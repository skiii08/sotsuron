The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Project indeed swept me off my feet, but it also flew off the handle of the broom. It was kinda nausea inducing at times.
","Shot entirely in the style of a documentary gone horribly wrong, this movie was indeed groundbreaking for the time, as it re-popularized 'the found footage' horror subgenre marketing style that was somewhat lost in the late 1980s, after the minor success of 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Using internet-based viral marketing, directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick was able to promote the idea that 'The Blair Witch Project' was truly the recovered footage of real documentarians that went missing in the woods of Maryland, in order to cover the local ghost stories, using fake online documents, footage, published dossiers, interviews, and even a couple of professional-looking television documentaries blurred the line between truth and fiction. The only problem with this, is that the movie doesn't know, what type of horror story, it wants to tell. For a movie titled 'Blair Witch', it doesn't really talk much about 16th-century witchcraft that much. Instead, it look like they wanted to talk about the fictional account of a 1940s child murder named Rustin Purr. Despite that, people were subtly convinced that these two legends were real, as opposed to something the film-makers made up themselves. Many were also convinced that the movie was based on a true story, or even consisted of actual footage. Because of this, the real-life actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael C. Williams had to play the part of the fictionalized version of themselves as demise, even after the credits start rolling. They did this, by not appearing in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. It really did seem, like they walk off the face of the earth to the point that a police investigation was order to expose the facade. For the most part, this verisimilitude marketing kinda works, as it got people interested in seeing this low-budget horror movie that has nothing much happening, including me. However, the marketing did leave some very jarring questions, like if this was a real movie, how was the film footage even recovered, if the woods was really that haunted. Another, is how was any upstart studio got the rights of the footage, from the families of the demise, and able to make a profit off their family members 'supposedly' deaths. Doesn't that seem, a bit odd!? Also, it's really hard to believe that this footage is indeed 'raw', when it look like it been edited to follow a narration path. After all, doesn't it seem a bit odd for these film students to film a lot of footage of them, arguing, cursing, & bickering with each other over a map, that they can't use on their documentary, rather than saving that footage for documenting the events. Still, I guess, they gave a good reason, with Heather's insistence upon filming everything, is suggested by Josh to be her way of coping with the fact that she's lost in the woods. Mad props to Heather's apology scene. She acted so hard that you could practically see the bite marks in the camera. She sobs, screams, and shakes so realistically that her acting was so convinced, making people forget that, she accidentally zoom the camera, too far on her face. However, I did think the directors went a little too far to promote discord between the actors, by deliberately ruining their sleep, and starving them. From what I heard, they were really butting heads toward the end. Still, it does seem, a bit out of character for one of them, to throw away the map for no good reason!? It doesn't make sense, unless, one of the students was really trying to kill the other filmmaker, but that's just a film theory. Despite that, I did enjoy the actors genuinely upset reactions, even if it was somewhat annoying at times. Still, it doesn't explain, why their film footage look like crap even in the beginning, if they supposedly go to film school. Yes, it can be said, the footage was made to look like it has degraded since it's been in the open woods for nearly a year, but it doesn't explain, why these 'student filmmakers' have so many badly shots. All these low grade blurry poorly focus shots make the movie, nearly unwatchable. Also the cringe-worthy shaking cam is really annoying, as it known to makes people vomit. Although, this movie show nearly nothing that was really scary. Like some sort of cinematic Rorschach test, there was enough suspense to keep me, looking for at least something that would get a reaction from me. I give the movie credit that, it didn't relies much on outright special effects of blood, gore, and violence to get people to watch; just the psychological horror and tension of unseen forces and sounds that is slowly ratcheted up with each passing day and night of the characters' descent into madness. It left everything to the audience's grisly imagination. While, this movie had a 2000 & 2016 sequel, 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2' & 'Blair Witch'. They didn't live up the hype of the first movie. Overall: I have to say, there is a strong reason why this movie lead a new age of 'found-footage' horror films. It was unique at the time, however rewatching it, now. It's a bit date. Nevertheless, it's not worthless, so no need to kick it in the creek. It's more like a nostalgia watch, these days. So check it out, if you want to.",6,3,4,12 December 2016
The King's Speech," Listen in, the King has something to say
","This movie never loses its' voice. It's great. I love this movie, because I, too have a speech problem. I felt enriched by the character of King George VI (Colin Firth). Albert or Bertie as he is known by his friends and family suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King of England. Not only that, but his country is on the brink of World War II and in desperate need of a leader who can talk to the people. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) seeks out help from an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). First off, it's nice to see Helena Bonham Carter outside of the crazy evil woman roles, she been subjected to, the last few years. I found her role, very supporting. While, Colin Firth looks nothing like the real life King George VI, he was still able to portray the tragic inability to speak, both in public and to his own family. I like Gregory Rush's character who gives some greatly need humor to the story. I like the supporting cast such as Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. He even portray him at the London 2012 Olympic opening. I also like Guy Pierce's supporter role as his brother David AKA King Edward VIII who ascends the throne, only to remove himself so that he can marry Mrs Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), an American socialite divorcée. The King's Speech does underplays Edward's flirtation with Nazism both before and after the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939 and neglects to mention George's support for the policy of appeasement pursued by Neville Chamberlain when he became prime minister after Stanley Baldwin resigned in May 1937. I know, Hollywood obviously took poetic license here, but I think it can be a little bit mention. Some of historical facts in this movie are just wrong. For example the Prime Minister Chamberlain did not resign when war broke out in 1939: he resigned after the defeat of Dunkirk. Still, I wouldn't hold the movie against itself. I don't care that it's historically accurate. Director Toby Hooper gives a fascinating insight into the king's troubled personal life and an inside look of what living up to royalty does on a person's mind. While, it can be a bit predictable. It's cleaver in a way that it gives us something new for a period piece. A great deal of humor. The best scene in the movie, had to be seeing King George VI giving out to a lot of curse words to learn to speak. It's so unlike the public image of royalty where they rarely swear. Due to this, f-bombing. Weinsteins were rob of their PG-13 rating. Due to its quest for more sells, some of the movie producers of this movie has eliminate the swearing scenes in DVDs. So there is some people that has the R-Rated version; while some people have a PG-13 version. It deserve the Academy Award best picture no matter what version, even if I thought Social Network would have taken that prize. I'm kinda glad this movie won it. The film deals with the gradual building of a close friendship between Bertie and Logue - or between royalty and commoner. The manner in which Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush create this memorable relationship represents some of the finest acting in cinema history. Overall, a great movie.",8,7,10,28 April 2013
Despicable Me 2," It's despicable if you haven't saw Despicable Me 2 yet. It's awesome fun!
","2010's Despicable Me was a huge hit that year, that from its success, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. Despicable Me 2 is truly just a fun movie to watch at the theater with your children or by yourself. The animation from Illumination Entertainment was pretty good, but I have to say that the movie trailers and promos will ruin it for you. I felt like I've already watched more than half of the movie in Youtube promos. So don't watch them. I do have to say that the sequel's story seem to be domination by the side characters Minions. I know that they will end up making a Minion movie for sure because they are just so damn adorable, but I thought they could have cut a little bit of them in the film to make more room for the love story. This is a 'Despicable Me' movie, not the Minions movie. While they may be a good marketing ploy, I really can't stand their chipmunk like noises after so long. Anyways, Despicable Me 2, has former super-villain Gru (Steve Carrel) being recruited with Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) by the Anti-Villain League to help deal with a powerful new super criminal who stolen a secret formula that cause a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde reaction to whomever drinks from it. It was a cute little family movie, but nothing really new in my opinion. It's a bit clunky as the story of this movie isn't as strong to begin with. It felt like the love story was force too hard. One minute, he doesn't like Lucy, and then he does after she save him from a horrible date. It was painfully obvious right from the start who Gru would end up dating. The whole movie felt like the same old movie formula of a single father cliché storyline. Lucy can be a bit annoying, as Kristen Wiig acts like a spazz most of the film. Wiig also played Miss Hattie in the first film by the way. There is also a subplot of Gru's daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) falling for his enemy's son. While, it could have work as a Romeo & Juliet type of sub-plot; the movie went a different way, and it was quickly resolve by the end of the film. Benjamin Bratt was brought in as a last minute replacement for Javier Bardem and Al Pacino as the movie's antagonist, El Macho. Al Pacino left the film due to creative differences. In my opinion, Benjamin Bratt does well. It must been hard for him, since he was brought in at such a late stage of animation. Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. I love that El Macho has a crazy pet chicken. He wasn't annoying like Vector was from the last movie. Back story of the villain El Macho, the most manly villain ever, was just funny as hell. Is the Hispanic stereotype jokes, a bit racist? Maybe, but it's all for fun. The ending fight with the villain was a bit disappointing as the secret formula that supposed to transform living things into indestructible killing machines was quickly end within a minute of fighting through nothing more than electricity. It was previous establish earlier in the film, that electricity doesn't stop them, so why did it work now? There is a lot of slapstick humor that the children will love, and some adult might enjoy. I do have to say to make sure to watch the 2010's short films such as Home Makeover, Orientation Day, and Banana as there is a number of running gags from those films in this film. There is a lot of adult jokes that the children will never get like the Minions dressing up like the Backstreet Boys. The movie is a lot of fun however. A lot of good supporting cast like Steve Coogan, and Russell Brand is an awesome addition to the cast. Glad that Ken Jeoung's role was cut to a few lines in the film. He would had ruin the movie. Even though you know how the movie's going to end, you really want her and Gru to end up together. Agnes (Elsie Fischer) continues to be one of my favorite animation kid character ever and the Minions are ever so funny. Like I said before, a Minion movie will come out and also a Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem ride at Universal Studios will be set to open soon. So check out this movie, and the previous one. It's a charming fun film.",7,3,4,9 July 2013
The Lobster," Let's get cracking! Come on over for some lobster. It's a delightful watch.
","In a bleak dystopian future, where relationship are to be understood as simple as black and white, comes a movie about living in the grey area. Directed by Greek director, Yorgos Lanthimos, the film tells the story of David (Colin Farrell), a single architect that is forced to check into a sinister 'hotel', in order to find a suitable life mate in 45 days. If his search ends in failure, he would be turned into an animal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I took it to be a film about authority/herd mentality of human trying to put everything complex into a few simplistic type groups and those trying to survive life through fighting against that system or allowing it to rule them for self-preservation. The conflict of man vs machine and man vs self was very well-told by writers Efthymis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a movie about the human condition in the most nonhuman way. Yet, there were a lot of critics might dislike, this film for its intentionally awkward slow pacing and tone, finding it, kinda boring. However, for me, it's one of things that makes this movie, unique in a slow burn Hitchcockism mixed with Twilight Zone and Stanley Kubrick's horror type of a way. After all, the film is supposed to present a somewhat fictional dull world of distant sex mixed with complex bureaucracy. Great world-building. It remind me of biblical conservative blended with Stephen King's 'The Shining' & George Orwell's '1984' book. Also, it really needed to be that way, for the dry deadpan humor to have an effect. Because of this, the satire of sex comedies kinda works for me, while others might find it, pretentious. The scenes like, where they were watching propaganda extolling advantages of partnership & hunting single asexual people in the forest was hilarious to me in a dark way. Even some of the music were very funny. I kinda like the little thriller, Bernard Herrmann's theme that plays, during the fight scenes. It remind me of 1960's 'Psycho'. Another was the 'Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart' by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook, dance scene. Yet, there were some parts of the film, where some of the jokes seem to fall flat, mostly with the surreal concept of 'turning people into animals'. It really could had been funny, but the idea never really get off the ground in my opinion, and didn't lead to anything. It was very disappointing that we didn't see, much of that. Instead, the film goes with a different direction with a very unlikeable blind person punishment concept in the third act. In my opinion, it wasn't really interesting as we seem movies like this, before. Plus, it was very extremely inconsistent, seeing the villain mention other punishment like the 'red kiss' and the unthinkable 'red intercourse' yet they don't show it. It's here, where the movie really starts to loose, its charm. Still, I have to say, the acting throughout the film is amazing. Colin Farrell really put it all, as the paunchy sad-sack, David. He put on 40 pounds for his role. Even the supporting cast like LÃ©a Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, John O'Reilly, and Rachel Weisz was just as good, in their untitled character roles. Everyone speaks with very little inflection and odd, stilted, overly-formal sentence structure, which surprisingly works for this type of a movie. Another great thing about this film is the cinematography by Thimios Bakatakis. Great use of the rural, lush, muted Irish locations. I also love the fact that production worked almost entirely with natural light and without much make-up. It's added to the naturalism look of the film. The classical music that went with it, was great as well. Love hearing Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No.7 In A Major,Op.92: II.Allegretto & String Quartet No 1 in F major, Op 18, No 1 Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato, during the slow motion scenes. 'Where the Wild Rose's Grow' by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds was also nice to listen to. Overall: I have to say, this movie is very watchable, even with the slow parts. Dazzling in its sinister surrealism, wicked black comedy and touching pathos, The Lobster achieved in nearly everything, it was going for. It was a fantastic film that artists such like Luis Bunuel, Franz Kafka and Salvador Dali would had love.",7,3,5,7 January 2017
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," It's no secret. National Treasure: Book of Secrets was not as good as the first movie. Regardless, it was still a fun watch.
","When it comes to unnecessary sequels. This film directed by Jon Turtetaub & produced by Jerry Bruckheimer takes the prize. It didn't really need to be made. Everybody in the original film, 2004's 'National Treasure' truly did lived happy ever after. At least, that was the climax of that Disney movie made it seems. However, I guess, that wasn't the case, as this sequel; has the crew of renowned treasure hunter Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) partake, yet another adventure. This time, in order to erase, Gate's family's ties of being a con-conspirator in President Lincoln's assassination. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the action sequences were compelling. The conflict & drive, for those scenes seemed a little forced. Look, I can understand, some people ostracizing Ben if one of his immediate family members done something wrong, somewhat recently; but judging his character, over something, his ancestors did over 100 years ago, is really stretching it. It's like hating an innocent modern day American, because his or her family, once own slaves in the 19th century. They have no control on who, they would be related to. Even if, Gate's forefather was indeed one of the con-conspirators, I really doubt, most Americans would bat an eye to continue to hold a social stigma, against the family. If some, of them, did, at least, they would be somewhat understandable & sympatric; as there are plenty of examples of living descendants of notorious figures from the past, just trying to live life as patriotic Americans. One such example is, Edwin Booth, the real-life brother of assassin, John Wilkes Booth. He just continued to do his job, becoming one of the most famous Shakespearean actor of the 19th century, following Lincoln's assassination. He was so beloved by the public, he even befriended, Lincoln's son, Robert at a very early age. Likewise, most people would see, past tragic events, like that, as 'water under the bridge'. Surely, it wouldn't make any current generation of Gates seem anymore un-American. Nevertheless, I do understand, why Ben was driven by a fierce desire to clear their family name of infamy, even if it's highly unhealthy exaggerating behavior. The value of good reputation is characterized as something worth preserving, even going to great lengths to protect and honor. However, it's not something, worth risking, life & limb for, if the grumbles are from a bygone era. I find it, highly ridiculousness, that Gates, is willing to break multiply federal and international laws, just to prove long dead 19th century people wrong. Honestly, besides one out of place kid, it seems like the majority of people in the film, don't really care, that he was related to a co-conspirator, if they continue to invite him, into White House, Buckingham Palace, and other famous social events. People still acclaim him for his treasure hunting skills than anything else, during the course of this movie. His name isn't really cover in mud, as part of the film, make it out to be. Because of that, I find his action to be jarring. Like really, what was his goal, anyways? How does finding a long lost city of gold absolve his forbearer from the crimes, he was accuse of? The movie made the quest seem a bit too vague, but if it's my guess, it seem like the crew bribe the government with enough gold, that, the federals look away or cover up theirs past crimes. If anything, Gates & his crew seem more like the villain than the heroes. Their willingness to lie, manipulate, assume false identities and trespass is bit troublesome. Nevertheless, moviegoers will surely, just be tempted to dismiss their actions completely because they were made in the service of an honorable end-and because the Gates family didn't intend to mean no harm. Still, I found their good nature request to be somewhat morally flawed. After all, it could had easily been resolved, in more quiet way, but I guess, we wouldn't have a movie if it was that simple. Regardless of that, the crew is mostly still mostly likeable. I just didn't like the subplot romantic argumentum elements that came with most of them. I found it, highly annoying. Still, most of the performers did fine work here, even new comers, like Ed Harris as the antagonist, Mitch Wilkinson. The villain was a huge improvement from the first movie. At least, Mitch was murky & creepy. Still, his heel to face turn in the climax was really jarring. The only flaw in what was otherwise, a compelling ending. Along with that, the music by composer, Trevor Rabin really adds to the suspense of that sequence. I love how the puzzles & heist elements wasn't as predictable. You really didn't know the twist & turns, the clues would led. It made the film a little more fun. This movie prove that smart, entertaining live action, adventure PG films, are still possible, even without a lot of harsh language, violence, & sex appeal to prompt people to take an interest in history. Still, it is necessary to suspend your disbelief at times, as nobody should take this movie as a legit American History lecture. After all, it is an action adventure film that claims that France & Britain knew about a Mesoamerican City of Gold in South Dakota for years & still gave up, those lands to the United States for cheap in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Despite the imperfections with real-life history & its many plot-holes. I do have to say, the movie was compelling enough to look past its flaws. It really got you, into the sense of treasure hunting. Hopefully, a third installment will one day, come to fruition. Overall: With 4th of July celebrations, just around the corner, as of this writing. This is one sequel worth watching on Independence Day. It was a blast.",7,5,6,4 July 2018
First Man," 'First Man' didn't quite had the right stuff. Regardless, this movie was still somewhat a stoic out of this world experience.
","When retelling the story how astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to step foot on the moon. Filmmaker Damielle Chazelle took a different approach to the subject. He aim for the celestial dark side. Without spoiling the film too much, the movie subject is less about the exploring the epic yet deadly adventurous dream-like wonders of space and more about learning to cope with death around you. Because of that, the journey toward the Moon Landings by Apollo 11 undeniably got really cold and distanced. Causing some audience members to complain about its melancholia tone. They wanted a more positive & awe inspirational dream-like feel good space exploration approach with some adventurous struggle, similar in the way, they felt when watching 1995 'Apollo 13' or 2007 'In the Shadow of the Moon'. For me, I have to somewhat agree. The magic in this movie was never not quite there. It didn't felt like grand escapism. It felt like we never left the ground. For most of the movie, the audience couldn't really feel starstruck with much of the visuals or the music, because how much the filmmakers wanted to concentration on the astronaut's plain near silence depressing home life. The final version of the film didn't even focus on even some of the exciting moments that happen there like the house fire in 1964. It could had made the whole Apollo 1 scene even stronger in contrast, even if the real life pilots weren't killed in seconds by getting burn followed by a large explosion, but instead from smoke inhalation & asphyxiation. Regardless some of the household conflicts seem a little forced. One such example is the fight between Armstrong's wife Janet (Claire Foy) and Neil (Ryan Gosling) about the dangers of the Apollo 11 mission. While Foy gives a pretty good emotional delivery about what Neil's kids should know. In reality, by this time, everybody in the family knew the dangers & risk, especially after them having to deal with Neil's near brushes with death before during previous missions like X-15, Gemini 8 and Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. It wasn't anything new. Apollo 11 was just another mission at the Armstrong household. Another thing, I hate that throughout the movie, the filmmakers made it look like Janet & Neil's marriage is always on the rock because of the death of their daughter. Even the closing moments of the film with the separate glass make it look like they were doom. In truth, the couple stay together for nearly 38 years before they finally got divorce in 1994. For the most part, they were a happily married. As for dealing with his associates. Yes, he was indeed an introverted person of a few words. However, he wasn't always robotic and depress reticent outwardly boring person that the film and Gosling recycling plainly portrayal him out to be. In truth, the man whose one small step changed history forever had more than a very close relationship with his friends besides Ed White (Jason Clarke), often making small talk, smiling or joking with them. He even hang out with Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) at times whom in the film made it seem like they didn't get along much. In truth, Armstrong truly never uttered a negative word about the man with whom he walked on the Moon. Along with that, it just sucks that we don't really get to know much about anybody else like Elliott See (Patrick Fugit), Jim Lovell (Pablo Schreiber) and their families. It's a shame because it could had made the scenes involving certain tragedies so much stronger than it turn out to. As for scientific accuracies. It's pretty shape. As a result, the movie frequently contains detailed explanations of engineering and physics. These scenes made for somewhat an arduous sitting. I frequently found myself rewatching scenes in an attempt to understand the information being conveyed. It doesn't help that the film overuse vintage color palette shaky cam and endless close up. It make the action somewhat harder to see.
Regardless, it wasn't until the moon landing that the film got bombastic and loud. It was there that it really lift our spirits & imagination. I like those moon scenes, very much. The way, they intermixed actual NASA archival footage, some that has never been released before, with the computer animation backdrop with the actors was amazing! However the lunar footprint in the famous photo doesn't really belong to Armstrong. It's honestly Aldrin. As for the Litter West Crater scene. It's possible that something was indeed drop there in real life. After all, it's not that uncommon for many astronauts to placed mementos or tokens of loved ones on the moon, so it's not unreasonable to suspect such an event occurred. However, I never really got the context, in how his daughter's death relate to his quest to get in the moon missions. It's not really established. As for the criticisms for the film omitting the astronauts planting the flag on the moon's surface. The Stars & Stripes still does appear onscreen in the background. However I do get what Chazelle was going for. It's an achievement for the whole of mankind rather than one single country. After all, a lot of NASA spaceflight capability were built upon, years upon years from innovations from scientists from both Western and Eastern Countries. While, the US is the first to make it to the Moon. It's the whole world that push the limits of explorations. Nevertheless, the movie was still somewhat holding back the adventure. I would love to see more action involving the rocket planes or his time in the Korean War. Things like that, could had made the movie so much more exciting. Overall: While not quite a blast to watch. It didn't alienation me too much. It's still worth checking out even if parts of it are over the moon.",7,8,11,8 September 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If we burn, you burn with us! Indeed, Miss Everdeen, we all got burned. Not for the better. Part 1 of the movie was just alright.
","You got to be mocking me! Splitting, author Suzanne Collins's 'Hunger Games: Mockingjay' into two movie parts was not a good idea from the movie studio. It was supposed to be the grand finale; instead, it felt like a grand disappointment, because how much Part 1 is lacking. They cut the material, a little too thin, here. Directed by Francis Lawrence, the movie is slow talk with little action. Pretty mediocre, in my opinion. The movie tells the story of first 12 chapters of the Mockingjay novel, in which, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawerence) is in District 13 after escaping the Hunger Games of the previous film, 2013's Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss must become the figure-head of the rebellion movement; the Mockingjay. So that, the movement can take down the Capitol leader, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and save her friend, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie bears little resemblance to its predecessors, as it replace most of the cartoony futuristic gladiator action, with a more serious tone, of realistic warfare. While there's much less bloody hand-to-hand fighting -- and no kids killing kids -- the violence can still be intense and upsetting. Lots of shots of skeletal remains, dead and severely wounded citizens, the execution of traitors to the Capitol. It's scary, how much, it mirrors that of real life conflicts. You really get the sense of how large and awful the war got, when you see the after effects; it had on the environments of District 12 or the large number of death in the hospital at District 8. You really get into the heart of the series and what it's exploring. Many thought-provoking messages/themes about war, media, rebellion, politics, greed, the dangerous edge of idealism and nationalism, and, ultimately, human nature. The movie doesn't shy away from going deep into the tactics of image manipulation, video virality and propaganda, which can be considered ironic since as a Hollywood movie, it employs these very tactics itself, and the audience is being made aware of how they are manipulated. There's also some level of funny reality subtext that Katniss is acting like a horrible actress than herself. The adaptation was mostly faithful to the novel, with few changes. Most of the changes were made, to make it, a little more entertaining. Such as the case, of adding back recurring colorful supporting characters like Effie (Elizabeth Banks) & Haymitch (Woody Harrison) to bring more, of a familiar feel. In the novel, most of the supporting characters from the Games were pretty absent, but Harrison and Banks did pretty well in their limiting roles. The movie also felt the need to add more action sequences, unseen from the book as the book was lacking in it. In my opinion, the action in the film wasn't the best, I have saw, because you barely witness the event, just see the after-effects of those actions. I was really disappointment, by the absence of detail. A good example of this was the increase interest in the book, Mockingjay had for Gale (Liam Hemsworth). It really felt like it was his time to shine. Instead, the huge ending action scene that the movie set up for Gale, was anticlimactic, rather than suspenseful or interesting. They really don't give much for Liam Hemsworth to work it, so I don't blame him, for how bland, his performance was. Another thing, the movie tries to do is cut down on Katniss's over sensitive irrationally mood swings and PTSD. Thank god, for that. I don't blame Lawrence for this. She's such a gifted actress, but her character is getting annoying and repetitive. Watching a post-traumatic 18-year-old girl that care more about the one person than the whole world is a bit much to take. Thank goodness, it was less romance than in previous installments. The love triangle is getting pretty old, by now. Watching the movie, I was really getting kinda upset on Katniss's dumb tantrums about Peeta. Josh Hutcherson isn't on screen all that much compared to the first two films, but when he is, as Peeta, you really see his dark transformation from well-known celebrity, to starved, wild-eyed hostage being forced to read propaganda. Donald Sutherland is pretty sinister as President Snow, but he also get a cut-back as the movie barely focus on him. There's a dark, melancholy tone to Mockingjay, but most of this movie felt like set up. There are parts I love, like when Katniss sings 'The Hanging Tree,' and the bombing of District 13 that remind me of London Blitz of WW2, but I'd probably have a much harder time remember anything besides that. I felt that Part 1 is a lesser movie; as it just set up material. It felt like it was clearly just made into a movie as a teaser and a money grabbing ploy to get as much money from the book's large fan base. Overall: This isn't the sequel that a lot of people will re-watch again, unless you're a super fan. Then again, it does set things up for the final film. Still, it's worth, at least, one watch. Recommended. Just note, that it's just not the best movie in the series.",7,4,11,18 February 2015
Black Swan," There is nothing uplifting about this film. Black Swan is just one depressing unpleasant movie.
","Not to be confused with the 1940s Tyrone Power's film, 'The Black Swan', this Black Swan is a very haunting film. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, the movie is a psychological thriller-horror flick about a committed ballet dancer, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) in a competition between rival, Lily (Mila Kunis) trying to get the lead role of the dark and sensual Black Swan in the company production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. You really do see, her character overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare. The film is a twisted coming-of-age story. Even though Nina is a woman, she is very child-like, as she hasn't yet gone through experiences that usually occur much earlier in a girls' life such as body image issues, and coming to terms with sexuality. Due to this late adolescence development, Nina might not be all there. Natalie Portman is very much, deserving winning the Oscars: Best Actress award that year. She is a perfect fit for the role. I enjoy how the film was shot. The mirrors shots were used very good as it got us to the depth of Nina's dark side persona. I love all the dream like hallucinations. You really don't know, if she's dreaming up this nightmare, or if it's happening in the film. Lots of freeze-frame replay value, as several times, the movie blurs surrealism with reality. I like how one of Nina's mother's (Barbara Hershey) paintings appears to move slightly in an early scene, foreshadowing Nina's madness later. If you blink for one second, you might miss some really awesome split-second morphing such as Nina's Black Swan or White eye costume, or people's faces morphing into that of Thomas (Vincent Cassell). Blurred imagery of a nude woman can be seen in at least three frames, as well. Lots of scary imagery. There were some very eerie scenes in the movie, like the finger peeling scene. It was the one that got me, cinching. It had that David Cronenberg-style madness. The twist toward the end was great, even if it was kinda stupid. Maybe, I was hoping too much for a 2008's Wrestler type of an end. The movie was really a good thriller, but it really push the buttons on my feelings, and I really came out of the movie, kinda unhappy. Don't get me wrong, there were a few moments that were good. I like the use of classical music. The soundtrack is very engaging to listen to. I like how there were some semi-funny scenes like how Nina's mom can be a bit overbearing. Then, there was that really hot sexy scene that a lot of people love. Still, it kinda had that dirty feeling when watching it. The scene where Nina is masturbating is strangely uncomfortable. Even the much-anticipated lesbian sex scene is designed to deter rather than titillate the audience. The film does have some clever symbolism as it relates to the ballet play, Swan Lake. There are tons of Swan Lake Easter eggs throughout the film. In addition to that play, there's also some to Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson, about a man with an opposite-natured doppleganger and the Greek myth of Icarus. Aronofsky also cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 'The Double' as another inspiration for the film. Lots of meaningful names here, as well. Nina literally means 'little girl' and is often used in diminutives of Russian names, showing how babied she is by her mother Erica. Lily reminiscent the name of Lilith, infamous demon and seductress of the night. The symbolism of Lily's tattoo, flower, symbolizes purity and the color white, as well as death and resurrection. Even with all visuals, the movie lacks good dialogue to go with it. It went a little excessive in the use of special effects. I was reading that the original screenplay, The Understudy written by Andres Heinz was a little more entertaining, with 1950's All About Eve drama set in the off-Broadway world. I just wish, this movie had that, too. Overall: It's an art-house masterpiece, but it doesn't translate into a good well-rounded film. Black Swan is a hard watch for me, with little to no entertaining value. It's had such a negative feeling to it that I felt worst, after watching it. I always believe that good depressing horror movies could be good if they have a good moral story to go with it like 1990's Jacob Ladder. Something to make you, want to live life harder. This movie is cold and nihilism, just there to make you depressed. That's isn't what type of film, I look for.",7,3,5,14 December 2014
Howl's Moving Castle," Howl if you like Howl's Moving Castle!! WOOOOO!!!
","I like the movie, but the film is way too different than the book to the point that it was a bit annoying. They change too many things. The story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. It's like taking 1939's Wizard of Oz and turning it into turning it into Sci-Fi's Tin Man (2007). It's a re-imagining of Dianne Wynne Jones's classic novel. Don't get me wrong, I love Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the book, Howl's Moving castle; I just wish it would had stay more true to Diana Wynne Jones's novel. This movie marks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service (1989). It is a really fascinating work with lively characters and incredible imagination through out the film. Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho), a 19-year-old hat maker who is taking away by the charm of a Wizard name Howl (Takuya Kimura/ Christian Bale) when she was rescue by him when she was trying to visit her sister. For punishment for trying to steal her favorite's wizard's heart, The Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/ Lauren Bacall) transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her old, Sophie (Jean Simmons) must searches for a way to break the Witch's spell. On the way, she makes some new friends: Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), Howl's young apprentice, a scarecrow nickname Turliphead, and last Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashun/ Billy Crystal). The visuals in the movie are amazing. It's a steam punk fan's favorite, the way, Miyazaki use CG to creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment, but held together by the burning heart of magic is interesting. The film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and interesting details of everything around. There is also the major themes that Miyazaki's works been known for such as such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. Miyazaki's Howl has a very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction. Both old and young Sophie were very interesting. I love Jean Simmon's voice as old Sophie. She gives some charm and funny moments. I love the stairs scene. I was laughing my head off. The dubbing by English actors match pretty damn good. Good job, Pixar. I love the English dub more than the Japanese since it's based on a English novel. The Japanese just looks a bit odd with the European themes in this film. The plot in the film is secondary, as it's nearly makes no sense and full of plot-holes. Things are mention at the last moment or not fully disclosure toward the end. There is nothing about Wales, no reference, no mention, no allusion to the place where the novel came from. The fate of a lost prince sub-plot comes nowhere in left field toward the end. Miyazaki turned the the story into a protest against the war in Iraq. I have nothing against anti-war propaganda, believe me, but let's call it what it is, and not try to trick people into pulling out cash from their pockets for what they assume is a film version of one of their favorite books. The story is utterly unrecognizable from the original. Several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. Sophie doesn't have her sorceress powers that allow her to turn things into living objects. While the Witch of the Waste is the villain in the book; the movie instead made her, into a weak, harmless woman. Then it made the male Suliman (Haruko Kato/ Blythe Danner) a alley in the novel into a female enemy in the film. Still, there are some changes I do like. I like Howl portrayed as a deep troubled hero rather than the arrogant self-centered wizard he is in the book. Still there is a bit of that self-centered narcissism attitude in him in the film. Reminds me a lot of the story Beauty and the Beast. I like how Calcifer is a cute cheeky little orange flame instead of an evil menacing fire demon. Overall: You have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear.",8,3,4,9 May 2013
Alien 3," Movie was a bit too painful to watch. It felt like an alien ripping out of my chest!
","Movie felt a bit too nihilistic and depressing to watch. Still, it wasn't the worst movie. I'll give that to 1997's Alien Resurrection. Alien 3 was a very hard movie to get through, as it didn't had the same scares of the first horror movie, Ridley Scott's 1979's Alien or the adventure thrill of the sequel 'Aliens' directed by James Cameron. Directed by David Fincher, the movie continues after the events of the sequel. Aliens left off on a hopeful note of no more bad dreams until Alien 3 came along and injected its own nightmare. Everything that people love about Aliens was rip away from the opening shots of Alien 3 when the escape pod from the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco crash-lands on a prison-run refinery planet, killing everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). By doing this, Alien 3 takes away every character, Cameron help established about the series and cause a sour-taste for the fans of Aliens, in the first few minutes, by killing off three beloved side-characters in the first three minutes. Certain fans, in particular, regarded the decision to kill off the characters as a slap in the face. I thought the director did show some courage by killing off the characters from the second movie, but the way, they die wasn't going make the fans happy to have their heroes die so brutality, without any attempt of establishing them in the third movie. Unknown to the prison population, an Alien organism was also aboard the escape pod, which then begins a killing spree on the planet as Ripley must once again is forced to stop it. Alien 3 had a difficult production, with various screenwriters and directors getting involved in the project, with multiply ideas. Some of these ideas for the third movie were pretty outlandish, ranging from aliens infecting technology, aliens coming back to Earth, Ripley going to the mother planet of the aliens, and others. The production start filming before a screenplay was even finish. The director had to re-shoot and rewrite the script simultaneously while fitting in sets that had already been built, so filming was already plagued. It didn't help when incessant creative interference from studio executives also came into play. Fincher has since disowned the film, citing the aforementioned reasons. I have to give David Fincher, some praise for even getting this movie out there. Since this movie, David Fincher has gone to bigger and better success. Just to note, the film has two versions of the film. One is the Assembly Cut, which was released in 2003 and the other is the original version from 1992. There is a few different, between the two, as Assembly Cut tends to be the better version as it establish more of the themes of Alien 3 and gives more screen time for the prison characters. One of the biggest different between the two, was the animal that the alien morph from. People tend to complain when living animals, especially dogs are killed, so in the assembly cut, the movie has the alien come from already dead, Ox. In my opinion, it doesn't make much sense. The alien in the movie tend to be fast, and move like a predator because of the traits it got from its host. An ox wouldn't have these types of traits. A lot of people complain how fake the CGI alien looks like, but it's not CGI, at all. It was a scale puppet operated by sticks on a blue screen. It was so poorly lighted and rot scoped that looks like cheap early CGI. Another complain about the movie is the lack of action. After watching an action full sequel, this movie seems dull as the prisoners lack guns or proper guards. Most of the prisoners are pretty unlikeable and unsympathetic as they were just brutal ex-criminals who found religion. There is misandry's tone of the movie. The movie is filled with male characters who exhibit only the worst male characteristics. None of the great male virtues are nowhere to be shown. It didn't help that the prisoners were all bald, and talk with a cockney accent. None of them really stand out. Even Ripley seems completely out of character. Two movies, two subtle love interests, no sexual relationship and then in this one she meets a dude for five minutes and wants to get down. So awful. The movie seem to have some weird sexual metaphor. A lot of theorist think the movie is really about AIDS, with aliens representing AIDS. Other thinks it is about religionists dogma as one of the early story draft had Ripley come across a religious planet that has rejected technology. I like how the film was trying to get back to the horror concept of the first movie, but I miss the suspense and claustrophobic feeling. The movie ruin the suspense, by showing us that there was alien from the beginning of the film, but they try to add a surprise to Ripley's character, but it doesn't make any sense since there was only one alien. Without spoiling it, too much, there was no way that Ripley could had impregnated. It just not logically. Even the Christ-figure ending was a bit hokey. I can do without all the religionists overtones as it was already too dogma depressing for me. Overall: the pacing is slow, the editing is very choppy, the visuals are murky, and the story is weak. One early draft of the script focused almost entirely the Aliens characters returning home would serve better than this film, only to find out a rival faction of planet has use the Aliens as a bio-weapon to conquer Earth would be better. While, the latter was used somewhat in Aliens: Colonial Marines video game. I still, haven't saw a good version of that plot. I would pay to see that movie.",6,3,4,16 November 2013
The Monuments Men," This movie had little monument worth. It was an alright art film. Bit mediocre.
","After reading the non-fiction book, The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, by Robert M. Edsel. I found the movie directed by George Clooney to be disappointing. It didn't help that it was loosely based off the book. The film follows an allied group known as the Monuments Men leaded by Frank Stokes (George Clooney) whom job is to find and save pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't find it, the best. It was just a little boring. Honestly, nothing major happens in the film, until 40 minutes in. Barely any action in this film. The movie reminds me of a badly done Old School WWII film. The soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat sounds similar to 'The Great Escape', but it just doesn't have the same charm. All the great characters actors here, are so mellow down, here, as if not flesh out. If you're not going to put that much action in the film, at less, have some interesting comedy from interesting characters. After all, you have some of the great comedians there like Bill Murray & John Goodman. There were only a few scenes that gave me, small chuckles, but overall, not that funny. They also try to make it emotional. Like understanding how are we supposed to felt for Bill Murray's character, when we haven't been establish that he had kids in the opening. How are we supposed to feel emotional about their deaths if they die such a silly way. For being smart people who know about art. They do a lot of stupid mistakes, and end up, getting themselves killed. I know, they weren't made to be soldiers, but gees, they really look way out of place, here. There was a good scene where Frank Stokes interrogation a Nazi, but it's really doesn't help the plot, go along. They even try to make a love sub-plot between James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simone (Cate Blanchet), they brutal it as well. You could had got a great story out of these two characters, but it's probably the worst part in the film. Its feel poorly structured. Honestly, this movie would had work better, if it was a min-series, because the various errands need more time to explore, so you can find it a bit more interesting. Although the film is based on real events, the names of all characters are changed, and a number of further adjustments to the historical facts were made in the interests of drama. Honestly, the source material of the book isn't that boring, there were a lot of stories to work out with. About historical accurate, it's a mixed, the movie state out the Monument Men was form after the bombing in Monte Cassino in 1944. In fact, its origins actually went back to British efforts in Libya in 1942, and it already existed when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943. The film's main characters of the unit number only eight. In reality, the program consisted of 400 men. Once again, they could add a lot more story to the film. Another thing is the misunderstanding of the Nero Decree. The Decree did not mention archives or art at all. In fact Hitler specifically ordered that all the art be left to German museums upon his death. It was mostly a 'scorched earth' campaign where destroying anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. Paintings are not really useful during a battle. Also, if your children happen to say 'Heil Hitler' doesn't always mean that they're Nazis. Every German was forced to say it at the time, despite what belief, they had. This film is a clear Hollywood History dramatization of the story and anyone who wants to see a film for an accurate account should see the 2006's Documentary, The Rape of Europa which tells the story better. Also check out, John Frankenhemer's 1969 film, 'The Train' that tells a similar plot. Overall: the film was alright, but don't be surprise if you find yourself snoozing or multi-tasking through bits of the film. It will do that, to you.",6,0,0,9 May 2014
Captain Phillips," O, Captain, My Captain. All Hail the Captain! Captain Phillips was a pretty good film.
","Captain Phillips is an interesting historic event biopic action thriller directed by Paul Greengrass. Paul Greengrass is well known for his series of film dealing with realistic portrayal of terrorism acts ranging from his work on 2006's United 93 to his James Bourne's films. So, when ask to make a biopic of merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips, it made sense for him. Captain Phillips stars Tom Hanks as the captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean during the Maersk Alabama hijacking in 2009 led by Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi). The first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. Rather than paint the pirates as evil one-dimension bad guys, the film does show the desperation of the Somali pirates, to take on the huge ship. The film does show the complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization which I love. While, the film isn't telling us to root for the pirates; it's not telling us to boo them as well. I think the heroism of Captain Phillips makes a nice little sub-plot in the film, but is not the whole theme deserving the title. Yes, the film is mostly about his story of the events, but other people indeed play a part of the real life events such as the crew members and the US Navy. So to call the film just 'Captain Phillips' is kinda an insult to them. It's hard to spoil this movie, since its based on a real life event, pretty much everybody in the world heard about. Everybody knows what happened and how it ended. Let's remember that Chief Engineer Perry (David Warshofsky) was the one who seized the leader pirate for the exchange, and also previously disable the systems of the ship. The only thing brave, Phillips did consequentially went with the pirates on the lifeboat. The rest of the rescue, was because U.S Navy play their cards right. There been a number of criticize of the film due to this belief that Phillips looks like all out hero that single handed took out the pirates. It isn't the film fault. This controversial of what really happen those few days in 2009 been up in question since Richard Phillips wrote his autography book, 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea (2010)' in which the screenplay is based on. Since writing it, Phillips was criticized for taking the wrong course too close to Somalia, ignoring warning emails, keeping them away from his crew. Also, they are criticize him for his lacking weapons knowledge in dangerous waters. The crew was off-route and performing a lifeboat drill when they noticed the pirates approaching the Maersk Alabama. When Phillips was informed of this, he ordered the crew to complete the drill instead of taking pirate defense stations. Then he allow the pirates to take cash on board. So a few of the crew, believe that this event was cause by Captain Phillips willful disregard for their safety to the point that they are suing the Waterman Steamship Corporation and Maersk Line for nearly $50 million. Another fact missing from the film is that they were two hijackings during an 18 hour period, as opposed to the one shown in the film. Despite these inaccurate facts, the film does keep you onboard with its near authentic story. Tom Hanks was extraordinary as the smart ass talking Captain and his skills as an actor are demonstrated in the whole film, but it's the last five minutes that is gripping. This is where Tom Hanks shows his acting chops unleashing the toll of the ordeal the Captain went through. The good thing about the film is how claustrophobic it makes you feel as if you stuck in the middle of the ocean in a floating coffin, surrounded by people that wants to kill you in a small boat. The action is great as the film keeps the audience in the film. There is rarely any slow shots. The only one, I can think of is the opening to the film where Phillips go to the airport, as it serve no purpose. It should had just start at him arriving at the boat docks. Some people think the film is bit too jingoism or propagandistic for the ill-prepared pirates to be taken as a serious threat. In this film, the pirates are portray as little dumb and weak children with guns than menacing. The four untrained and anxious guys didn't really hijack the ship, anyways as they had no clue how to truly control the huge vessel. In the end, the film has a pretty predictable outcome even if you haven't heard the news story. You knew that the pirates wasn't going to get away with the crime, so it took a lot of thriller out of the story, when coming in. In my opinion, it's no way near as interesting as 2012's Zero Dark Thirty or 2001's Black Hawk Down because in those films you can see the enemy as a threat. Maybe, if the film open up showing us the death of the Chinese crew member who was kill in 2007 in a pirate hijacking, maybe, the audience can take them more serious. In my view, it's was a bit one-sided, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs wasn't going to get a chance against the large strong modern tech US Navy. The film felt like a weird version of David VS Goliath where Goliath wins. America loves films portraying themselves as the underdogs who somehow win, in which this film lacks as the US Navy is portray like emotionless overpowered automata cyborgs creatures. It's hard to root for somebody that has all the cards and emotionless. Overall: Hard to be too invested in this film, but it's still worth checking out.",8,3,5,6 November 2013
Sucker Punch," Sucker punch to the head: headache
","That's how it felt watching this Zack Snyder's movie. It opens up with a 20 year old 'Baby Doll' (Emily Browning), whom mother just die. She's forced to live with her stepfather, despite her being of legal age to live on her own even in 1960's society. In a 1980's pop grudge music video style montage, the audience sees that her stepfather try to rape & she is blamed for the death of her younger sister when she misfired the gun & the bullet struck the younger sister. Unlike Zack Snyder's previous film, the music does not fit the film at all. It's doesn't match the time settling, It's go in and out of pop, rap & heavy metal. She's institutionalized in an asylum by him, once again despite being legal age. The stepfather bribes orderlies Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), into forging the signature of the psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Baby Doll lobotomized so she cannot inform the cops of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. Baby Doll wants four items, map, fire, knife, & key that she would need to attempt an escape. This is where the film does go into off the wall fantasy world with somewhat truth to it. This mental asylum is a monarch mind control experiment site. They systematically repeated the sexual abuse for wellness. They used music to encourage them to dissociate from reality by dancing. By dancing, she escapes the most humiliating aspect of her private hell, being made to dance for the pleasure of others, symbolic of sexual abuse. She does this by turning that experience around, instead of it being about surrender & humiliation, she makes it about fighting & survival, but what doesn't make sense is the dream world, she creates. How these imagination introduces in the story, background, or character development. She dreams of feudal Japan with giant samurais, WW1 trench warfare with German zombies, flying in a WW2 Bomber chasing down a dragon, & last a futuristic train ride with robots. Where in the story are these outlandish ideas of her introduces or comes from? She didn't show any interest in anime, video game, & steam punk. Those genres didn't really become well known at the time. It is nonsensical action scenes with no depth. It only somewhat mirrored her real life. The only dream that kind of does make any sense is that she thinks she's in brothel and her virginity is sold to the 'High Roller' AKA lobotomy doctor (Jon Hamm). She befriends four others – Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), & Rocket's sister, Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) convincing to escape with her. Why is she, all of a sudden a prostitute might be explain by what was truly happening in their ordeals in the hospital that are manifested as enemies in the dreams. It is here in the dreams, she meet the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). He revealed a fifth item is needed for 'a deep sacrifice'. The 'Wise man', might be another aspect of her personality, doling out cod philosophy & warnings. What hurts the film is in the beginning, the audience sees that Baby Doll doesn't escape her lobotomy thus we enter the brothel reality with Sweet Pea playing Baby Doll. In my opinion, all the characters represent different aspects of Sweet Pea & the whole film takes place in Pea's head. The movie does start with Sweet Pea narrating & Baby Doll does say to Pea 'this is your story'. Baby Doll is just a character that Sweet Pea created to be strong enough to escape, the person who puts all the actions of the story into motion. Pea's sister Rocket dies in somewhat the same way as Baby Doll with her sister. Many critics say the girls aren't empowered in any way because they are constantly in danger of being raped. While they are victimized, the movie shows how they still fight back with incredible strength, & they have to in order to escape their harsh lives. Baby Doll's arrival makes the rest of the characters realize that they have to look within themselves to find the courage to battle depression. My own interpretation is that the film is a tale of someone with multiple personality disorder fighting her way back to sanity. The initial sequence shows Baby doll helping the child defy her abusive father, this results in that classic punishment of abused children, being locked in a closet. The child dies in that closet to that represents the death of the Sweet Pea's sanity & innocence. Note toward the end, Blue has Pea locked in a closet. When her courage, Baby doll is almost lost – the lobotomy, she escapes in that last instant, to another world, the bordello. In sense, the men that sexual abuse can't dominate her, or make her feel him, which makes him go crazy in his own sexual frustration and dejection. She's basically laughing at him. The sexy schoolgirl outfits might represent both her lost innocence and the perverse demands of men. If the films show the exploitation and sexism without condoning it they would not need to have the actresses act sexually appealing, styled sexually provocative & have the movie filmed in such a highly sexually focused way. The really interesting thing about the movie to me is that they are saying that sexually objectifying and exploiting women is wrong while sexualizing exploiting and objectifying this female actresses. It's like they can't see it themselves. Whatever, the actual story might be, this film is confusing to the points, it's provokes headache. If look as not a smart movie; the movie seems to be for dumb teenagers with scenes with awful acting sexy girls in skimpy uniforms with overused CGI visuals. The men in the film are portrayal as rapists isn't greatly like. The film is pure sexual violence for entertainment. Modern way of Ludus Magna and Panem et Circenses.",5,4,9,30 November 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Let's get down to it. 10 Cloverfield Lane was alright, but a bit misleading as a sequel.
","2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane is a remarkable debut movie for director Dan Trachtenberg. While its budget is smaller than 2008's Cloverfield, it is no less effective in its ability to scare its audience with the film unnerve physiological horror. The movie tells the story of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a woman who just survived a car crash, only to wake up, being locked in a small fallout shelter, deep underground with a man named Howard (John Goodman) and his contractor, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) for her own safety. It's seems, that there has been a chemical attack, while she was knocked out, and the air outside the bunker is now toxic. Does Michelle believe what the men are saying about the world outside, or will the uneasiness of their presence, make living in the bunker, impossible? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this gripping thriller works, best, because of the great performances from these three actors in the limited space. It almost seem like a dialogue masterpiece of Broadway stage. This is in large part thanks to John Goodman, who delivers a career-high performance here as Howard Stambler. I love how genuinely resourceful, Goodman is with his role. Goodman's character is so complex and elusive that you can't help finding something off-putting about Howard, no matter, how nice, he acts. I also, love how much, Goodman's towers over his co-stars, Winstead and Gallagher, both in height and bulk. He really seem authorized and commanding. This movie show us, that humans along us can be just as frightening as the monsters, you don't see. Gallagher's lackadaisical southern presence adds a much-needed warmth to the otherwise frictional environment. He wasn't annoying to me, like some critics make him, out to be; because I love how Emmett acts like the moral compass of the piece, by revealing his fears and allow himself to find the strength to act to save others. Then, there is Winstead whom is a standout lead. Her character is a welcome antidote to the idiocy of the characters in the original Cloverfield. She's not a damsel in distress; but one of the resourceful, intelligent, and determined heroines in recent memory. I like how, Michelle starts the movie running away from her problems, only for the end of the film, to have the courage to face the monsters that live in her world. It was amazing character development. However, there are a few things that I didn't like about this film, such as the movie being market as a spiritual predecessor to the 2008 found-footage monster flick; when in truth, it has very little in common with that film. Yes, the marketing ploy did drive audiences to see the film based on the assumption of the name, but it's still false advertising, no matter, how you put it. The movie originally was a script called 'The Cellar', written by Josh Campbell & Matt Stuecken. Once producer, JJ Abrams's production company, Bad Robot got the script, it was rewritten into a 'spiritual successor' to Cloverfield. Because of that, they change the strong and realistic ending of the original strong script, into a silly and forced anti-climax end. It was very inconsistent. It felt like, I was watching a different film in the later part of the film. I would have loved the movie if it ended with her walking into the night with her suit on into an uncertain future, rather than the rip-off 'war of the worlds' premise. Honestly, I wouldn't mind, this approached to this sequel, if the producers told the public, that 10 Cloverfield Lane would be anthology series of horror movies with each film containing its own characters, setting, and story. Something similar to Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, or Tales of the Crypt, TV Shows. Better yet, something similar to what 1982's Halloween: Season of the Witch was trying to do with the Halloween franchise. It would make more sense! Since, they didn't do that, a lot of fans of the 2008 movie were very disappointed, that this sequel didn't continue with the Kaiju attack of the first movie. There isn't even any acknowledgement that the events of the first film even happened at all. It's a rough shift for them to take. Pretty drastic turn from monster movie to unique 'kidnapping' crime drama. Still, this movie is mostly a genuinely well-shot film that knew how to handle tension quite well. I like how 10 Cloverfield Lane wisely abandoned the lame found footage gimmick, and shaking camera. It's a lot more intense by being a psychological thriller. I just wish, that claustrophobic thriller/suspense part, was a little more draw-out; because there were a few things, I wish the movie would explain more, like why Howard didn't designed an air filtration control room, he can fit in? Better yet, what were the reasons, why Howard allow Emmett to stay there, if he can't stand him? Overall: I did enjoyed this movie even with its flaws. So, I recommended it. Get out of your shelter life and go see this movie! You will like it.",7,7,14,22 March 2016
The Finest Hours," The Finest Hours wasn't the perfect storm. It was bland. This movie is not Semper Paratus!
","Inspired by true events and based off, the 2009 book of the same name, by Michael J. Tougias & Casey Sherman. This movie directed by Craig Gillespie tells the story how a small boat of U.S. Coast Guardsmen pulled off the most daring rescue in their service's history. Set in Massachusetts in 1952, the film follows the men daring enough to rescue the 30+ man crew trapped aboard the sinking SS Pendleton, an oil tanker bound for Boston that was ripped in half during one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, since the movie is based on real-life events. There is little to look forward to. The movie is just too predictable and full of old fashioned clichés. Despite that, it's still, somewhat worth checking out. The acting in the film was pretty good for the most part. In spite of some of the supporting characters being very unlikeable due to cowardly or stupidity. At least, the main character, wasn't that bad. Yes, he's a dull milk-toast kind of a guy, but I kinda like Chris Pine as Coast Guard Captain Bernie Webber. It's nice to see him, played a character, with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness, while also being very obedience and rigid to the rules of his command. It's so different from his normal roles of playing captains that were also brave, but somewhat selfish and brash with their action. By far, he's the best character, in this film. However, I really wasn't very invested in the relationship, his character had with Miriam Pentinen (Holliday Grainger). Holliday Grainger is a fine actress, but I found her character to be a little too dependent to care about. She's so selfish. Miriam repeated, forceful demands that the rescue effort be called off to keep Bernie out of danger was really bad! I really didn't like her. Honestly, what did she think was going to happen, if she was going to marry a Coast Guard!? I'm glad, she got kicked out of the Coast Guard station over it. If that wasn't enough; she stupidly hits a snowbank and had to be bailed out by a housewife whom husband is trapped on the Pendleton. I get that it was supposed to be character development for her, but it came across as too annoying and all-time waster. Those scenes were really too distracting from the gripping main plot of the rescue mission. Anyways, the real Miriam was just in home in bed with the flu. Not only that, but she was already marry to Bernie a year and a half prior to the Pendleton rescue, so she knew that she was getting herself into. By the way, in real-life, Bernie met his wife, Miriam over the telephone, not in a blind date, if you wondering. Another thing, that wasn't true to real events is how Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the first assistant engineer and now de facto leader of the Pendelton crew, wanted to run the SS Pendleton aground. In truth, this decision would be, very stupid, because the ship would had broken up faster in the relentless surf. Anybody who is a Chief Engineer would have at least, known that. In real-life, Chief Engineer Ray Sybert actually decided to keep the Pendleton's stern as far offshore as possible, fearing that the ship might sink faster, if he did. Another thing, that Sybert didn't do, is cut the lifeboats as most of the crew, knew, already that the idea of escaping the ship by boat would be nuts, because how the monstrous waves were acting. If they did try to escape the ship by lifeboat. They would likely had been crush against the hull for sure. That's the reason, why none of the boats were ever launched. As much as I kinda like the Pendleton crew in the movie. I found most of the characters on the ship to be one-dimension. First off, you got the doubter, D.A Brown (Michael Raymond-James) who has nothing else to say, besides fighting with everybody. The old man of the ship, Frank Fauteux (Graham McTavish) who should be leading the crew, but isn't. Then there is the over-the-top jolly big fella, George 'Tiny' Myers (Abraham Benrubi) who should be scare, but isn't for some odd reason. Then you got the young greenhorn, Elvin Maske (John Magaro). Every one of them is clichés. Even Casey Affleck as Ray Sybert was kinda average. I'm sorry, I know he's a great actor, but he's so typecast, here. Honestly, it seems like Casey Affleck, only played characters that are shy, reticent people! It's a bit tiresome. He always talks like he has marbles in his mouth. Way too depressing. I also hate, how cool and collected, everybody is, despite the fact that there is two ships that are sinking. Everybody takes their time to get to the ships. There is little to no stakes. The action scenes in this movie is not that exciting. The movie didn't even, bother, showing the other ship that broke in half. Where was scenes of the coast guard, rescuing the SS Fort Mercer? The rescue of the SS Fort Mercer survivors was just as incredible as the SS Pendleton. I don't get why, they didn't show it. Anyways, the 3D isn't worth it. It's way too dark, blurry and rainy to tell, what's happening on screen. Also, the CGI storm, looks a little too fake looking for my taste. I really didn't like the ending with all the fake-looking car lights. It was too unrealistic. Overall: While the movie does a good job in capturing a sense of the post-WWII era with the sets and costume & the fact that the music by composer Carter Burwell was good. This old timey tale of heroism sunk for the most part. I can only recommended this as a one time watch. It's alright, but not good.",6,4,9,24 April 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Clocking in for 3:10 to Yuma
","Remake of the 1957 John Ford's movie with the same title, it follows the story of a small-time rancher agrees to hold a captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma hints its title. A battle of wills ensues as the outlaw tries to psych out the rancher and try to escape. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, the rancher who is trying to escort the outlaw to the train due to him being in financial trouble and is on the verge of losing his ranch. Dan Evans is also a Civil War veteran with a tortured past, during the war he lost his foot and ever since he has struggled both physically and emotionally explaining the reason why he is in a financial mess. This is compounded by the fact that his own son looks up to Wade more than him. This makes Christian Bale's character, a bitter man. Russell Crowe plays Ben Wade, a highly dangerous outlaw trying to outwit the rancher. He is a bit cocky at times, but Russell Crowe pulls up a likable character out of the brutal bandit. He is amazing and showed a variety of different sides to himself. The way, he let silence himself, and then do the talking for him in some scenes is incredible. It was a kick back/tone type approach. The way he approached the love interest scene and the leading to that was one of the most beautiful scenes in the movie. It was very moving. This create an unspoken bond develops between the two characters that I found a little bit confusing at times but by the end of the film you just go along with it. The supporting cast isn't half bad. I love Peter Fonda's role even if it's a small cameo. Ben Foster as Charles Prince really does look the part of a outlaw. The shootout at the end is the best I have seen in a western for a good couple of years even if it doesn't make any sense. The movie scenes doesn't flow right. It cuts and jumps around like crazy. The movie has too much close ups, so we lose the wide sets and sceneries in some shots so unlike John Ford who use the sceneries to make his Westerns look epic in size. In no way, does this movie beats out John Ford's classic. Still, I would highly recommend that you go and see this James Mangold's film and would give it a try.",8,0,0,2 October 2012
The Sound of Music," The Hills are still alive with the Sound of Music! This movie is amazing!
","The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in return is based off, the memoir of Maria von Trapp, 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' in which two previous movies were made. 1956's the Von Trapp-Family & 1958's Von Trapp in America. This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen' about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like 'Do-Re-Mi,' 'Climb Every Mountain', 'Maria', 'Lonely Goatherd', 'My Favorite Things,' 'Edelweiss, 'So Long, Farewell' and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like 'Something Good,' needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, 'How Can Love Survive' and 'No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany & Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall: It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.",8,5,12,25 February 2015
The Equalizer," Odds against You? Need Help? Look for the Equalizer. Denzel Washington + Antonio Fuqua = box office success.
","What do you see when you look at me? Quotes the tag line of this movie directed by Antonio Fuqua. I have to say, when I look at this movie; it's really good, but so formulaic. It has a lot of tiresome clichés and tropes that you see in a lot in a Denzel Washington movie. The movie isn't anything new to Denzel Washington. This film has almost the same similar plot-line of 2004's Man on Fire. It has the outsmart skills and tactics that you would see in a movie like 2012's Safe House. The movie is also a bit one-dimensional black and white as it comes with characters. Bad guys are just really bad. The victims are just victims, and not playing mind games or twisting the truth to get their way. Don't expend any twist and turns in this film. It's just a generic action film. I really don't know, how accurate it was to the 1980s TV show with the same name, but by the looks of it, it really doesn't match, well. Where was 'Control' during all this? Where was the Jaguar XJ? It's look nearly nothing like the show. In this version of the Equalizer, a mysterious man named Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is trying to live a normal quiet life. But when he meets a young prostitute name Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz) in the need of help. He can't stand idly by, and take control by taking on the whole ultra-violent Russian mob. Denzel Washington's character must had the God-like superman codes, because it seem really, it always seem like he was one step further than the bad boys. The bad boys never had a chance. The movie really borderline unrealistic, when McCall rarely shows any weakness. It seems that he always have the unlimited resources to combat, everything that the Russian mob can dish on him. Not once, could I see his character honestly dying. It's really felt one-sided. The movie is full of violent imagery and clever way to kill people. I do like slow-motion sequences meant to imitate Robert's timed-precision combat style. It does remind me so much of 2009 Sherlock Holmes. Too bad, half of the ending action sequence is in pitch dark, making it hard to see. It's also go way too long. This movie is really long, despite clocking in 2 Hrs & 11 minutes. There are tons of dead shots pacing where nothing is going on. It doesn't use the time, wisely. A lot of the Robert McCall's backstory is vague, thin, and poorly developed over the course of the movie. The movie doesn't even show if McCall suffer from OCD or not. Mad Props for Denzel Washington for adding some depth in the character. Anyways, crimes come and go in the film in an oddly forced simultaneously way. It felt more like a series of TV episodes oddly put together than a movie. The whole robbery in the Home Mart should had been in the beginning, than in the middle of the film. Chloe Grace Moretz, while getting third billing is barely in the film. She is in the majority of the first half, and doesn't appear back until the end. Instead, McCall is supported by sub-plots like Ralph (Johnny Skourtis), a fellow employee at the Home Mart, where McCall works at, trying to become a security guard. Characters like Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman) & Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) particular showing up has with little to do besides exposition. It felt like those scenes would had been cut. The villain despite being over the top, monotone speaking evil Russians stereotypes were alright. Marton Csokas as Teddy, the Russian mob enforcer is fittingly nightmarish. With a combination of meticulous control and savage brutality, he is wildly unpredictable and totally compelling. For the most part, all the acting in this film were alright. The movie has a lot of metaphor storytelling that really don't match with the story within the story. Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway tells the story of honor in struggle, defeat and death. The old man Santiago is characterized as someone struggling against defeat. Santiago, though destroyed at the end of the novella that his fish is eaten by the sharks, is never truly defeated. The film would be more powerful, if characters that McCall care for, were killed. Not once, did McCall lost any of his close-friends, or felt like he got close to being defeated. The movie lose a bit of that. I do hope, they make the film sequels, a little bit more challenging, so it can stand out, more. The movie does have a pretty good soundtrack that was great to listen throughout the film. Overall: It's not a bad movie. It's pretty damn good. I just wish, for more.",8,4,11,9 October 2014
Source Code," This Sci-Fi movie is on right track. It's very compelling to watch.
","Remember those problem solving enquiries back in school, where Train A leaves Station A at 45 MPH, and Train B leaves Station B at 35 MPH, and if the stations are 60 miles away from each other, when will they pass? Well, those problems just got a lot more complex, challenging and exciting, in this case: Train A leaves Railyard A at 70 mph, only to find out that, it's carrying a bomb, onboard that could kill everybody. How long will it take for the hero to stop it before disaster strikes? Well, hopefully in 8 minutes, because that is the time, that Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given, when he woke up, in somebody else's body, determination to change a past event & save the future, by figuring out, who the bomber is, at least, until he fails and dies again. If this sound very complicated to understand and somewhat very confusing to you. Then, you're right! This movie directed by Duncan Jones & written by Ben Ripley, indeed, left a lot of viewers, scratching their heads. They were asking the same questions, you probably asking yourself. Like, how exactly does the source code, projects eight minutes of alternate realities with complete personalities and identities, by only using the memories of the recently demise? Also, if they only have eight minutes of memory, how can they create new memories in alternate state of being? To add to that, how is there, a number of Stevens in a multiverse of quantum worlds timelines within an uncertain state of existence? Best of all, why is there a Dunkin' Donuts on a Metra train? That was odd product placement. All good questions that the film, sadly doesn't answers. The plot is a bit muddled because of that. It's as if the theories of the Human condition & Quantum mechanics were mush into a sealed box with SchrÃ¶dinger's cat; while the big bang is constantly, happening around it. I can see, some people getting turn off, by this mucho jumbo science nonsensical premise. There is a lot of plot-holes. Plus, it is somewhat hard to keep up, especially with the director & writers's crazy train of weird thoughts. Like me, it will take you, multiply watches to figure out, at least, the basics on what the hell is going on, with this movie. Despite that, if you willing to stay tune, you would find the TV Series, 'Quantum Leap' meets 1993's film 'Groundhog Day' meets mystery novel, 'Murder on the Orient Express' action, very entertaining, even if the CGI is not the greatest. While, parts of it, are highly Deja Vu repetitive. Each loop sequence is unique enough in its small changes to stand out on its own; which is good thing. Jake's performance is wonderful as the guy trying to figure, everything out. He really did look disoriented. Also, I don't know, if it was intent, but there was some humor that came along with the many of ways, Colter can get himself, in and out of trouble. All the reactions, by the surrounding cast involving him, made me laugh hard. The secondary characters for the most part, were very well played. First off, Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren is one attractive, intelligent, funny, young woman who's you as the audience is able to warm up to the most. She really does have somewhat chemistry with Jake Gyllenhaal. You really wanted to see if Stevens can indeed save her. As for Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin. She was not as believable as a serviceperson, as she should had been. Her character doesn't well trained, passionate or really that professional. Something was just off with her performance. Despite that, she didn't take me out of the movie. As for Jeffrey Wright, once again, he really master the role of innovation tech genius, so well. However, that has left his career as always being typecast as one. This is no differences. This film, like many sci-fi thrillers of the past, plays on societal issues with technology and it's potentially dangerous implications to the world. Not only that, but the film is also somewhat spiritual. I like the symbolisms of death, limbo, and rebirth with the cloud gate. However, I found that force happy ending a bit odd, seeing that Colter essential effectively murdered the real Sean and stolen his identity & his girl. In fairness, either way, the real Sean would still be dead. Still, that's pretty dark. Despite that, I still truly dig composer, Chris Bacon's music for this film. He put a very Hitchcockism sound & feel of suspense to this flick. Mad props to him for that. Overall: 'Source Code' is one movie worth getting aboard with. It's a fun watch, even if it's goes off the rails, a bit. Highly recommended.",8,0,0,9 February 2019
Skyfall," The name is Bond. James Bond. & this movie is awesome, because of him! Skyfall is worth watching.
","This was a great new gift for the 50th anniversary of Eon Productions series. Directed by Sam Mendes, 'Skyfall' tells the story of exile secret agent, 007 AKA James Bond (Daniel Craig) having to come back to her majesty's secret service, when MI6 comes under attack by a mysterious and sadistic cyberterrorist villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who wants vengeance against Bond's supervisor, M (Judi Dench). Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, this spy film is not as gritty as the previous Daniel Craig's versions of James Bond movies, 2005's 'Casino Royale' & 2008's 'Quantum of Solace'. 'Skyfall' does have all the gadgets and tools that longtime fans have come to see, such as intense well-paced action pieces, sexy suggestive long making & great memorable supporting characters like Q (Ben Whishaw) and Eve (Naomi Harris) paying homage to the series' iconic status. However, if some of the criticism of the last two films, is how much similar, Daniel Craig's bond is to the Jason Bourne's series, both in lack of quip and exceptional martial-arts department. Then, this movie will get criticize for how familiar, beat points of the plot is to the comic book movie 2008's 'the Dark Knight', with a tiresome and beaten down hero, going after a superior, intelligent, villain with large explosion and double-trickery. Despite that, I have to say, the movie is thrilling from start to finished, even if they abandoned some well-worn formula plot threads like opening gun barrel. Still, I thought, the movie could had explain, some parts of the film, a lot better, like how in the hell, did James Bond able to survive the opening action sequence in Turkey!? His out of the blue unexplained presence, later in the film was a bit jarring. I get that it's supposed to represent the rebirth of Bond, but it felt like a cheap hook that something that an older Sean Connery film would do. Not a modern day movie, like this. Another thing, I didn't like about the film is the idea of him, having heavy petting time with a woman who just reveal that she was an ex-child sex slave in China. It was a bit disturbing and dirty. At least, he could had wait for a better time to do that, when it isn't awkward. However, that never happens, as the woman named Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) barely gets any screen time. Because of this, I found the love-interest in this film to be, one of the weakest parts of the film. I thought, they could had established, a lot more with her character rather than a disposable plot device/sex object. One other thing, I was deeply surprised that they abandoned, was the complexity of the subplot of the breaches list of security, in favor for a simpler plot of man wanting to kill his ex-boss. I found the detour to be, great. The unique 'Home Alone' booby traps ending was a barn-burning finale. I also like how, it finally debunked the James Bond code name theory. In the end, this movie was worthy as the last hurrah for Judi Dench as M, whom played the role, over 17 years old, since 1995's 'GoldenEye'. She was amazing. Javier Bardem as the antagonist was also great. He had the right amount of charm, and creep to pull this Oedipus complex role, off. Raoul Silva will indeed immediately rank, very high as one of Bond's greatest villains. As for James Bond, Daniel Craig pull off, another defining performance. I love that they show, that the agent does have some flaws and sense of vulnerability. Skyfall really provides him with the opportunity to showcase his ability as a great actor. He's brutal when he needs to be, and charming and suave when the situation arises. He also has the comedy chops, when the film, ask for it, like jumping out of an helicopter with Queen Elizabeth II, during the 2012's Summer Olympics opening ceremony, during marketing. It's a lot better than the straight-case brooding over serious, hero, we got in the previous movie. About the controversial homosexuality/bi tendencies of Bond. He's clearly doing that, just for show. Nothing to get work up, about. He's still, pretty straight-forward, at least, as the recent films goes on. Anyways, 'Skyfall' isn't a Bond movie, without a good, supporting cast. Like, I said before, the rest of the cast was OK, with Ralph Fiennes's Gareth Mallory and Naomi Harris's Eve, standing out. As for Albert Finney's short role as Kincad. He was alright in the ending, but how cool, would it, be, if the director's original choice, Sean Connery was given that part. Anyways, as far, as the movie looks, the cinematography was alright. It was gorgeous, but I seem, better from cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Some of the locations used in the film like Hashima Island, kinda does stand out. Still, I could do, without all that CGI added for the Scotland landscapes. As for the opening title sequence. It was very well done. Visually, it was nice to look at, but the opening theme music by British singer, Adele titled 'Skyfall', really took the cake. It was so beautifully sung. It was an excellent song, that it is worthy of the many awards that it took; including Best Original Song at the Oscar. Not be undone, but composer, Thomas Newman's soundtrack wasn't half bad, as well. Overall: 'Skyfall' is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoy it. This 23rd film in the series is worth the title of 007. Author, Ian Fleming would be, so proud. Highly recommended.",8,8,11,28 June 2017
50 First Dates," Wouldn't it be nice to live together, in the kind of world where we belong? Yes, it would! 50 First Dates is a guilty pleasure of mine. I like this movie.
","Adam Sandler's movies is mixed bag for me. Some of his works, are really horrible, however, this movie isn't one of those. This movie is one of my favorites from him. I have always been a huge fan of his romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. Starting it with 1998's 'The Wedding Singer', and follow up with this movie. This movie directed by Peter Segal, has Adam Sandler as Henry Roth, a local veterinarian falling in love with Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) an amnesiac student in Hawaii. Since she has short-term memory loss cause by a car accident, Henry must learn how to recognize the difficulty of building a relationship with someone who will never remember you; and how to overcome that, for the reasons for love. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, this movie concept seem depressing, I think screenwriter, George Wing and Adam Sandler put enough charming comedy in the film, so you don't have to think, how stressful, it must be, for Lucy to wake up to find out, her entire life has change. While, the memory impairment suffered by Barrymore's character is fictitious, I think the movie gave enough respect to her ailment, that it doesn't seem, just like a running joke. Drew Barrymore plays her illness, very well. The movie really does explore, what struggles, she has to tend with, and if Henry Roth should even continue to love her. Because of that, this movie is a lot more mature and emotional driven than Sandler's earlier works. It's both heart-warming and very heart-breaking at the same time. Both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work well with the story. I'm glad, that Sandler's role in this, wasn't of a man-child, with anger issues, and an annoying lisp. He was somewhat charismatic. I can see a woman like Drew Barrymore falling in love with him. Even the supporting characters were strong, they share some good emotional scenes and some really fun laughs. I like Sue (Amy Hill) the Hukilau café manager and friend of Lucy and her late mother. She was so motherly. Pomaika'i Brown as Nick, the Hukilau café chef was a guy, I would love to hang out with. Even Lucy's father, Marlin (Blake Clark) & steroid-dependent brother, Doug (Sean Astin) was watchable. I think the only jokes that didn't go well is with the supporting characters of Ula (Rob Schneider), the native-Hawaiian friend & Alexa (Lusia Strus), Henry's ambiguously gendered assistant. I found the gay jokes to Alexa to be a bit mean-spirited; while Ula felt a bit offensive, with the over-the-top Hawaiian Yellow face racism stereotypes. While, some of the jokes, are offensive, gross, and not call for. Most of them, really works with the script. Very few jokes, fall flat. Even the pop culture shout outs inside jokes like the brain institute is funded by auto parts manufacturer T.B. Callahan of Sandusky, Ohio from 1995's film, 'Tommy Boy' fame & how the characters go to a golf course like 1996's Happy Gilmore' were clever enough that it was fun to see, even if most audience didn't get it. It's even funny, when the movie makes mistakes, like saying the Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, when they did that year. Not only was the movie, very funny, but the movie was very beautifully shot. I love the fact that they shot in real Hawaii Island locations. The rural shots really makes this film, seem very unique, compared to the other Adam Sandler's films that mostly take place in an urban New York City like settling with way too much product placement being shown. It's a blessing in disguise. One of the big things about this movie has to be the music. I love the tunes of the Beach Boys, playing in the background. 'Wouldn't it be nice' to have music like this, again. The other song, worth noticing, from the film is the covers song from Hawaiian native artist, Israel 'IZ' Kamakawiwoʻole. I love his covers for 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' and 'What a Wonderful World'. His tropical reggae version of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', is my favorite version of the song from the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz'. It's beats singer, Judy Garland's version, 50 times over. It's so good, I kinda wish, it was the state anthem for Hawaii. That's how much, I like that version. I also love the fact that this movie, help inspire 'real world application treatment for people with early dementia. It's nice for them, to watch a video every morning in which they see comforting messages and reminders from family members that they may still know. If that's not a good reason to love this movie, than I don't know, what is! The movie is also so good, that in 2014, a Malayalam film titled 'Ormayundo Ee Mukham' was created, to capitalize on the premise. Overall: While, '50 First Dates' doesn't have the complexity and depth of something like 1993's 'Groundhog Day', with a similar theme. It was entertaining enough to be stand out. In the end; check it out. You will find yourself, loving this movie as well.",7,6,7,12 March 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.
","Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story' in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym 'Sean O'Reilly' in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!",8,7,8,16 April 2014
The Hangover," Got a Hangover after watching Hangover
","I know a lot of people love this movie, but for me, not so much. Don't get me wrong, it's funny some what. Still, it's just has that stupid humor that reminds me of another similar movie 2000's 'Dude, where is my car?'. It's not that different from other drunk comedies. Instead, of a car, they are missing the groom to be, Doug. (Justin Berta). Also why is there a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the hotel room, and one of them is missing a tooth? Now the other three men deemed to be call the 'Wolf Pack' must find the groom, and retraces their steps from the night before when their Las Vegas bachelor party went horrible wrong. They must figure how all these things came into play. First off, there is Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), the social inept who both alternately creepy and hilarious stupid at the same time. It's not like he is that funny. He just like any other fat stupid guy in a comedy. I can name at less two dozen comedies with fat guys just like his character. Then there is Stu Price (Ed Helm) the dorky dentist who always end up taking the most chaotic change in his life in this type of movies. Last is the self-centered Phil Wenneck, (Bradley Cooper) who pretty much plays the straight man in these comedies. In their adventures, they encounter colorful characters, like smart-mouth cops, a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson. The problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags either crude or violent or both that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow, phony, and cliché. It's not new. Honestly, what type of valet would drive a beat up police cruiser to the front of a hotel when they ask for their Mercedes? Wouldn't he think something is odd by that? Honestly, what type of hotel wouldn't notice such outrageous act going on without calling the cops? I think it's would be funnier if it's more realistic things happen rather than things that wouldn't happen in real life. I surprised that the police or the hotel staff wouldn't had investigates until the last minute the source of the damage. Honestly, I thought it would be funnier if they went to jail for their crimes. I wish I can escape jail time if I steal a police cruiser while high on rohypnol, by doing a taser demonstration, but in real life, I will probably be seeing 20 to 30 years jail sentences for something like that. The hype about this movie was kinda overrated. I think the reason why it was so enjoyable to some people because they saw it when they were probably high or drunk. While the movie says they were drugged, the title says otherwise. It's about drinking. It's didn't feel funny if you were watching it sober. It's just the fact, that this is a film is about getting drunk, that most people would see it, probably are drunk while watching. Hints why they thinks its awesome. Honestly, people that has something against drinking, shouldn't watch it because it makes drinking too much look cool. People that do drink shouldn't act like these fools on film. There is nothing funny at being a alcoholic child. It's not fun babysitting drunk people. There are various types of humor out there, but not everyone likes all types of humor. I think comedies need to have a subcategory according to the type of humor to help people to further identify if they like it or not. And this is not my type of humor. I found Bridesmaids funnier than this. While that may have been perverted as well, but the acting and comedy were actually very funny. It's more realistic in tone. Overall: Director Todd Phillips's Hangover is over the top, frat boy humor who opening was very slow, hard time building up the plot and lacks any sense of smart humor outside of dumb dark humor and jackass violence behavior. It's funny if you like dumb man-child type humors movies, if not-- this isn't your type of a film. You'll just feel pain like a hangover.",7,3,5,9 May 2013
Ghost," This is one ghost story worth listening to. It's really good. I really do love it! Ditto.
","One of the directors of 1980 parody comedy 'Airplane' making a gut wrenchingly emotional romantic murder drama? Surely, you can't be serious. Yes, I am and don't call me Shirley. This film was nearly a masterpiece in the way it was shot. The way the camera foreshadowing the villain's turn from the reflection of the mirror of angel statue being lifted in to the antagonist being greedy about the apartment was magnificent. The spooky dark opening with the dust of the apartment looking like spirits was haunting and the horrific, guttural cries they make created by slowing down recordings of babies crying are chilling. Even the appearance of glowing light being shine down on the titular character whenever he's about to leave was powerful even if some of the special effects are dated. To give you an idea of how good the movie directed by Jerry Zucker really was. Some movie theaters actually gave out free tissue packets to attendees during its original run because how much of an emotional tear jerking watch, the film can bring. Trust me even I was crying after witnessing this film. However the story written by Bruce Joel Rubin of a murdered man's ghost, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) staying behind to warn his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) of impending danger, with the help of a reluctant psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) did have some flaws. Mostly in the way the filmmakers introduce some of the spirit's powers such as possessions and moving items. First off, I felt like the film could had introduce the Subway Ghost played well by Vincent Schiavelli a little bit better. It was a bit weird for the ghost to interference with Sam when he is following Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) but the titular character was still able to keep track of his killer even afterward being toss off the train. Honestly that scene should had been cut as it was bit jarring. The movie could had introduce that individual a lot later in the film. For example after Sam finds out that his best friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn)'s true motives. He could go back to the train heading back to Molly from 321 Prospect Place feeling depressed; only to find out that he is in the presence of another ghost. It's here where they should had a fight; only for Wheat not to give up and somewhat challenge him to teach him that ability. Yes it would be more of a Deus ex machina too convenient event than it originally was, but it would also made that moment a lot more emotional and powerful. Since the movie didn't do that; it always bug me why Sam didn't go back to the train station after witnessing it the first time. Why does it take him a whole bunch of filler scenes later to figure that out when knocking off a picture? Honestly a lot of what Sam does seem pretty idiotic. As fun as it is to watch Sam torment the villain with his ghost powers, writing out his name on the computer was not the brightest decision nor was going into the body of Oda Mae when the antagonists are heading their way. That along is really dumb. It's not like he didn't know that it can drain his powers. He witness another ghost do that earlier in the film. Talking about that scene; why was the point of the ghost doing that in the first place? It's not like he couldn't see his wife's hair. It's very visional. Don't get why he was surprised by it. Anyways those whole possession scenes felt forced nor does it make sense in the story as Sam never told anybody about Mae's powers. Plus it's kinda rapey as the ghost did that without her permission or her consent. It kinda disgusting and not that funny. Despite that, Goldberg did made me laugh at certain parts of the film. She was wonderful for the most part. Glad that Swayze convinced her to do this role to the point that he was willing to drop out if she didn't. She ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress that year. As for Swayze, I do think that he did a good job as the titular character even if Sam is little bland and dumbfounded. His reaction to betrayal and feeling sorry for others felt real. Along with that the pottery scene involving him is very steamy and sensual. It's the film most remembered and most parodied moment. Pretty impressive for a scene that contain no nudity other than Swayze being shirtless. While the song that went along with the scene, 'Unchained Melody' by the Righteous Brothers originally was about a prisoner hoping his girl will wait for him felt unrelated in a surface level to the scene as Sam has yet became a ghost with chained limitations. It still work so well with the movie that it was put back into the billboard charts after 30 years from its first debut. It's very romantic. Even composer Maurice Jarrie orchestral version of the song was emotional to listen to. The scene where Sam says farewell to Molly was heartbreaking. Demi Moore really did act. The way that she can cry on cue and seem flabbergasted really made this moment seem special even if her character was somewhat underdeveloped for most of the film. That scene along became more heartbreaking since Patrick Swayze's passing in 2009. It's somewhat hard to watch now. Regardless in 2010 a foreign remake was made in Japan & a musical production of Ghost hit Broadway in 2012. Still overall: No reboot can beat this movie with its great use of horror, comedy and romantic tone. It's one worth possessing.",7,5,5,8 January 2020
Iron Man 3," Marvel's Man of Steel, Iron Man 3 steals audience, a good movie. It was just OK film
","After the events of 2012 summer blockbuster The Avengers, there were some really big shoes to fit, for the new Iron Man movie and its director Shane Black. Sadly, it's was too big for him. I had high hopes for the film, and it felt like just another mediocre lazy popcorn flick. The movie based on the 'Extremis' story arc by Warren Ellis comic book, but it's loosely. The movie starts after the events of The Avengers, a haunted Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) start to have panic attacks due to the 'trauma' of the alien invasion and his near-death experience. Yes, Tony Stark started having panic attacks, yet he is able leap off 20 story buildings, fight crime, and save the world yet again from the evil Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Wow, those near-death experience is really stopping him. Not! Talking about the Mandarin, if you are a comic book fan. You will be deeply disappointed by finding out who he truly is. At first, the movie made him out to be one of the greatest superhero villains of all time, but they really ruin it for a twist ending, and stupid humor. Without spoiling the movie, let's just say, that the real villain is somebody else in the film. While there is a string of bombings by terrorists, I surprised there was no mention of S.H.I.E.L.D or what the other Avengers were doing while this was happening. They did had a cameo from one of the Avengers after the ending Credits. I know they didn't have the actors plan for this film, but they could have at less note one or two lines what they were doing around this time. I would have thought that would be a big deal for S.H.I.E.L.D since the Mandarin is planning to kill the President, and make super soldiers with the Extremis, an alien biologic weapon. Well, we know what Tony Stark is spend doing some of the movie, and it's rarely being Iron Man. Stark spend most of the time hanging out in Tennessee for some odd reason with a kid that looks like Carl from Walking Dead name Harley. In truth, he's barely in the suit even with the highlight action scenes like the jet plane action rescue. Honestly, if people get suck out of a jet plane, I think they would die once they leave the airplane due to the high pressure. If not they would have at less freeze and pass out. Still, it was pretty good action scene. The supporting cast of Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Gwyneth Paltrow work within their means. The movie use Gwyneth Paltrow more in this film less than Damsel in distress, but more like the wife from the movie High Noon. The ending to the film wasn't that good in my opinion. I wonder now how he will join the Avengers 2 if there is any. The story was meant as a sort of 'new start' for the character -to redefine him from his origins as an arms dealer, to be the 'test pilot for the future'. Ellis intended him to be a better superhero, so I understand what they were saying, but I also believe it had something else to say. The reason they made the movie how they did is because Robert Downey Jr's contract is ending after this movie. He may sign a new contract but that is in discussion. Marvel wanted to leave their options open for new cast if that is the way they go. I personally think Iron Man wouldn't have been such a success without Robert Downey, he made the movie great and plays the character awesome. It's hard not to see him in the role. It paled in comparison to the other two. I wonder how many fans tuned in to see an epic battle between Iron man and his nemesis The Mandarin and got screw. The Mandarin is Iron Man's most famous foe in the comics mainly because he's been around the longest, and now it's wasted. I Love the actors and special effects, but that's just false advertising. Stick with the Marvel Comics version of things, Hollywood and quit trying to re-write things because you think you can do it better. You can't, sometimes.",6,3,6,1 May 2013
Airlift," Airlift was a decent movie. Very uplifting.
","This Bollywood film follows the story of Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, whom must plan out the biggest evacuation of citizens by a civil airliner in history, when he is force to help, evacuated 170, 000 Indian out of wartime, Kuwait, during the height of the 1990/1991 Persian Gulf War. Without spoiling the movie, too much; while, this rescue operation film is not as good, as 1993's 'Schindler's List' or 2004's 'Hotel Rwanda', or even 2012's 'Argo', it was still a good movie, worth seeing even if it has some highly embroidered and fictionalized accounts of true events. After all, there is way too many films that, often take too much artistic liberties with actual events, making it somewhat offensive and jarring to watch. However, this particular film does not. Yes, it takes a few artistic liberties in the depiction of events, but most of them, actually works to make the depiction, much better. Still, there is somethings, worth noting that would need, so work. First off, the idea that, all of this planning was done, under one man's control. As much as I love, Akshay Kumar's performance as the fictional character of Ranjit Katyal and his character arch, from ruthless, selfish, greedy businessman to extraordinary Good Samarian whom initiative, tenacity and dedication help save the lives of many of his fellow country-men. I think, I would rather have the real-life depiction of entrepreneurs, Mathunny Mathews (also known as Toyota Sunny) & Harbajan Singh Vedi. After all, it's seem too unrealistic for one man to plan out, all this. Another thing, I was wondering, is why this film was call 'Airlift', when the majority of the characters, has nothing to do, with Air India's & Ministry of Civil Aviation, involvement in the evacuating. If anything, this movie should be call something else, as only the last 20 minutes is, about the airlift. Plus, in my opinion, the title gives away, too much of the end. I know, history movies are predictable, but gees, the suspense for this film is kinda ruin, when the title spells it out for you. Anyways, the airlift events, didn't just happen, during one or two days, like the film wants you to think. It was carried out from August 13, 1990 to October 20, 1990. That's a lot period of time, staying in Jordan. Another thing, I was wondering, when watching this film, was, how the whole evacuation plan can happens without the India's government active support. The film makes it, seem like the Ministry of External Affairs was little to no help; when in truth, it's the government that coordinating with the different groups and worked with the governments of Jordan and Iraq in having safe passage for the Indians. Plus, it's the government that work with Saddam Hussein, in making sure, they were protected, until the evaluation were over. For the most part, Indians in Kuwait, were allowed to buy food and continue their lives, as if the war didn't really started. I get that, a lot of things like this was omitted, because the filmmakers wanted added to heighten the dangers, but the idea of them, running out of food is a bit silly. Another thing, the idea that the Embassy in Kuwait & Iraq were no help, because they were evacuated of all staff and officers is not correct. Only non-essential staff and of course families would have been evacuated in real-life. The ambassador and his core team would have stayed on, as they did, based on the ambassador's account of the events. It's funny to see Ambassador, KP Fabian who was Joint Secretary of the Gulf at the time of the Kuwait war, being throws in very different light by this film, by being completely omitted, when in truth, he did a lot to help the Indians come home. Despite that, the war movie directed by Raja Krishna Menon is pretty decent. Still, some of cinematography by Priya Seth, does need some work. During some scenes, it was really hard to figure out, what certain characters were looking at, or what, the viewer was honestly seeing. It was a bit jarring to see some modern UAE (United Arab Emirates) backgrounds, that doesn't look like, it's Middle Eastern building style nor from that 1990 time period. Another thing, a bit off, was the violence. It was surprising, very tame for a war movie. I get that, they didn't have, too much of a budget to pull off, too many effects, since it was limited, but they really made up for the lack of graphic visuals, with well-done acting and somewhat decent Arabic & Hindi dialogue, even if it's a bit heavy-handed on exposition. I like, nearly every character, they show here, but still, they did, make the fictional supporting characters of George Kutty (Prakash Belawadi) a little bit too unlikeable for my taste and Major Khalaf Bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), too campy to be taken serious as a villain. I just wish, they hired more Arab actors, as extras, as it's somewhat noticeable, that Indian actors, were playing the soldiers & citizens as well. Despite that, the music choice wasn't too off. I kinda like the Bollywood mixed with Arabic music type of a flair by artists Amaal Mallik & Ankit Tiwari. Music like '' Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi', 'Soch Na Sake', 'Tu Bhoola Jise' & 'Mera Nachan Nu' were rightly place, in the film, and didn't distracting me from the overall theme of the movie. Overall: While, the movie does have some flaws. The good things about it, surly out weight the bad. Airlift indeed lift the bar, a little higher for Bollywood. As a Non-Indian American, I can't wait to see, what type of film, they would think up, next. Airlift is worth seeing.",8,0,0,10 June 2016
United 93," Are you guys, ready? Then, let's roll! United 93 is a heart-breaking powerful look at the unsung heroes of Sept. 11. A haunting brutal movie masterpiece.
","On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijack by racial militant Sunni Islamist terrorists, whom intent to use the aircraft as a weapon against the United States. Forty-four people were aboard the plane: 37 passengers, two pilots and five flight attendants. As terrified passengers phoned loved ones, they learned the horrifying outcome of the other hijacks planes and realized they would have to take control of the airplane from their assaulters if they hoped to avoid a similar fate. This is the story of their courage. Directed by Paul Greengrass, and released into theaters five years after the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. The movie tries really hard to dramatically reenacts what happened on the doomed flight that Tuesday morning—as well as depicting the confused air-traffic controllers, military personnel and government officials desperately trying to save the passengers and stop the terrorists. Not only that, but Greengrass and crew, casted a number of largely then-unknown actors and real professionals, then filmed the movie in a Faux Documentary style using separate isolated stages. The final product plays out in Real Time across its nearly two-hour running time. Using the facts that are known, quick cuts and hand-held cameras to create a sense of real-time verisimilitude. United 93 delivers, what might be, said, one of the most historical accuracy film, ever made. Yet, don't be foolish to accept this movie as historical document. Movies are fiction - even documentaries give a particular view of events, and editing can be used to distort the relative truthfulness portrayed. This film is only, almost a historical accuracy masterpiece. However, maybe the film might be, too real, allowing the inaccuracies of 9/11 to accurately portray as well. Rather than stripping down the confusion to make things easier for an audience to follow, all of the misinformed fragments are out there, just as it was in real life due to how rapidly things were unfolding. Different groups referred to the wrong planes by the wrong numbers. There were differing reports on how many planes were out there. After American Airlines Flight 77's impact with the Pentagon, the news reported a fire on the National Mall when there was none. It made the movie hard to follow. Another thing, since the movie is in real time, there is tons of slow & mundane parts that could be cut out, but wasn't, like the boring chitchat between passengers and crew in the beginning. It's also sucks that none of the dialogue given to the passengers were that memorable, outside from the phone calls. Since, there is a large supporting cast with little to no back-story explain in dialogue, it's really hard to relate to some of them. None of them, really stood out. Added the fact, that few of the passengers on the plane's names are mentioned in movie and you get, why I had problem, figuring out who some of these people are. There is also some controversy between some of the family members of the passengers and the investigative officials as to whether the passengers managed to breach the cockpit before the plane crashed. In my opinion, I think the movie depict the right ending. However, I don't believe the way, the movie portray the pilots, Jason Dahl (J.J Johnson) and LeRoy Homer Jr (Gary Commock). I doubt they were killed immediately, seeing how the terrorist need help to gain control of the plane and how to lock the door. While, the movie might seem exploitation, the film was made with the cooperation of all of the passengers' families with their blessing. Yet, there is a few things in value, besides the movie being somewhat a curiosity memorial. About the critics calling this movie, biased American propaganda, I have to say, the film is really, not. The film doesn't really explore the political conflict between the United States Government and Al-Qaeda that much. Nor does the movie depict the attackers as over the top clichés Arab terrorists. Instead, the movie depict the attackers, as deeply misguided religious zealots, who happens to be real human beings as well. Also, to all 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists that believe Sept. 11 was an inside job. It's clear to state out by the research, I done for this report, that United 93 was not shot down by an American aircraft nor safety landed in Ohio. The American Government isn't that strong, to cover all of those inaccuracies. In the end, I can't say, the movie is entertaining. First off, it's really upsetting to watch, no matter, how many times, you watch it. At the time, I first saw this movie in 2006. There is a great deal of discussion about whether America is ready to revisit Sept. 11, 2001. I still, kinda feel that it was too early for a movie to be made, about the subject. Recently rewatching it, I felt the same sense of dread that gripped me then. It's such a downer. Even, the predictable ending is bittersweet, at best. It's still too fresh on the mind of most Americans. Overall: While, United 93 is a story of stomach-wrenching horror and tremendous courage. Knowing the tragic outcome of that horrible day will make you feel depressed. While, I can't recommended others on rewatching it. I can say, at least, keep in mind, that a few people onboard United 93 sacrifice their lives, for the chance that others may live. It is still a powerful, poignant reminder that freedom is not free and every-day life is a gifted, not to be wasted. United We Stand Always & Never Forget.",8,0,0,15 September 2016
It," Even with some flaws, this horror movie still had the IT-Factor. It was very entertaining.
","Once upon a time, clowns used to bring out, joy out of children. Then, author, Stephen King's 1986's horror novel, 'It' came out of nowhere and nearly destroy that industry; by causing 'coulrophobia' AKA 'the fear of clowns' to become more common. While, it's true, that a few scary tricksters in novels, had existed for a very long time; such as author, Edgar Allen Poe's 1849's short story 'HopFrog', 1892 Italian opera, 'Pagliacci', and most recently, the Joker from Detective Comic's 'Batman' fame from the 1940s. Stephen King's novel takes the carnivalesque performance into a bizarre, but interesting direction by having a mysterious out of this world being, exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims by disguising itself with the form of a clown, in order to devour them. If you think, this plot already sounds crazy. I haven't gotten to, the outrageous meat of this novel; which includes under-aged gang-bang, statues of Paul Bunyan coming to live, cosmic turtles, and odd rituals against Universal Movie Monsters. Not only that, but the book was divide, by two major story arches: one focusing on the kids, trying to survive, and the other chapter, the kids reunited as adults to finally attempt to kill the beast. All of this, is way too much for a story! It's come across, as muddled, excessive, and highly gimmicky. That's why, this novel is highly regarded, as one of Stephen King's weakest books & often view as not filmable. Nevertheless, it didn't stop, movie studios from trying; as in 1990, the novel was adapted into a television miniseries starring Tim Curry as the demonic clown. For the most part, the miniseries was a lot better than the book as it omitted a lot of the craziest, and stupider stuff, however, it was still total crap for its bad acting, awful cheesy effects, and pacing issues. Although, the miniseries has many flaws, it has gather, a cult following over the years to the point, that a remake was welcome. In 2017, we got that reboot, and it was surprising, pretty damn good. Not perfect, but entertaining enough, to overlook, its flaws. Directed by Andy Muschietti, with a screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. The film really does a good job, cutting the fat. Instead of a dual anachronic order narrative, the film purely focuses on the development of the characters as children; meaning no awkward repetitive flashbacks; making more of a tighter film. However, there was still a structure for this coming to age horror movie, I didn't like. The way, the film intermixed the lighthearted comedy like boy bands with the disturbing imagery aspect of dead people was a bit jarring. It was kinda weird to see characters, in a state of unpleasant anxiety, one second, due to an attempt attack by Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) or sadistic bullies like Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), only for a few minutes, be alright to go outside to hang out with friends at the lake. Also the idea, that these children would be alright, in staying in a town, where a mysterious creatures kills people, the whole summer, was also a bit unrealistic. In truth, these children should be, more scar for life & living in paranoia, than they were. They should be locked up in their house, ready for anything, since the movie never explain, how Pennywise can get you, or not. The idea that they can coexisted with this creature, around, is, insane. Also, the span of the tragic events, should only, take, place, during a couple of days, not weeks. Furthermore, the third act of one of them, getting caught, a month after the last attack, seems a bit force, rush, and highly clichés. The whole damsel in distress, love triangle third act was not great. Despite that, the CGI visual effects and practical makeup effects were great, during the action moments. Lots of really frightening moments like that projector scene; throughout the movie; only a few of them, were duds, like the leper. I just wish, the movie could be, a little more subtle with some of the jump scares like they did with the creepy librarian and the television show playing in the background. Way too many loud noises, kinda ruins the suspense. Nevertheless, Bill Skarsgård does a great job as Pennywise, even if the film doesn't attempt to make his character seem, that deceiving as a villain. I love how one of Pennywise's eyes is always fixed on the camera, giving the impression that he can see the audience watching the movie. So creepy. As for the children, the acting from them, is also great. Mad props goes to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis & Finn Wolfhard as Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, and Richie Tozier. They did a hell of a job, making these characters, seem real. I really got the loss of innocence story, even if the update piece remind me of a gorier version of Netflix's TV Series, 'Stranger Things', with its homage to 1980s nostalgia. Overall: It's a must watch from me. Highly recommended. Even, Stephen King himself was very happy with the movie after seeing it early. 'It' was a fun enough thrill ride. This movie truly does float.",8,9,16,17 September 2017
Casablanca," Of all the review joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walks into mine. Here's to you, Kid. Casablanca is iconic! Play it again, Sam.
","From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song 'As Time Goes By' by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Café. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme 'As Time Goes By' from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.",9,8,9,3 August 2013
G.I. Jane," While, this movie was somewhat uplifting. 'G.I Jane' just didn't quite get my seal of approval. It was very mediocre.
","When Demi Moore, appeared on the red carpet with a bald head and a muscular built, for the premiere of 1996 'Striptease'. There was a lot of good buzz for her next big film, 1997's 'G.I Jane'. However, once the public got a hold of the film directed by Ridley Scott. The buzz turn into negative press. Without spoiling the well-shot movie, too much, one of the reasons, why this film didn't do so well at the box office, was, because viewers and critics, alike were under the impression that was going to be, a very realistic depiction of what life is like, for a woman to go through Navy SEALS training. However, the film wasn't like that. Actually, the movie was heavily fictional story of a Navy servicewoman, Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) being the first woman to enrolled in the Armed Force's 'the Combined Reconnaissance Team' (CRT) training program; a fictitious special operations until, that brings together operators from across all branches of the military into one group. Because of that, all the marketing for this film, including the trailers were misleading. It's hardly about Navy Seals at all! No wonder, why, this movie was called 'G.I Jane', despite the fact that the acronym is mostly used to describe the soldiers not sailors. 'The CRT' sounds like a team that a toy company like Hasbro would create, rather than the Department of Defense. Despite that outrageous figment artistic license, the movie training story is still not very well told. One such example is the out of the blue force action scene, toward the end of the movie. The idea that a national emergency situation, would require trainee's support, over years upon years, of well-trained, ready to go, Armed Force's special operation personnel is highly illogical. Not only that, but wouldn't it, make more sense, that the team that should support the U.S Army Rangers, in their mission, shouldn't be the trainees, but the Army's own, Delta Force or Green Berets. After all they're all in the same reconnaissance branch. Also, in real-life, any special operation trainee in any branch would probably take up to 2 years of training before, they ever saw combat. Such is the case with the real Navy Seals recruits. For them, they first have to go to Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School for 8 weeks; before advancing into BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL), training for another six months; follow up with another 3 weeks in parachute jump school/ plus 26 week course in SEAL Qualification Training (SQT), before finally, finishing off with SEAL Tactical Training (STT) that, normal workup or pre-deployment workup, including SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) is a 12- to 18-month cycle divided into three phases with them going to many different locations. The idea that this film is presenting, with a trainee skipping school programs and leapfrog toward any training site, within a few months, with the same instructors, plus go to war, with them, is not bound in any reality. No wonder, Moore went so far as to call then-President Bill Clinton to try to get advice from the Pentagon for the movie script. It's clear that screenwriters, David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra, had no clue, in what, they were doing. Despite the unrealistic inaccurate depiction of how the United States military operates their training courses, I still have to give Moore, some praise. While, her acting in this movie was alright; Demi really did look the part. Because of that, I highly disagree with critics, with her deserving a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for this film. If anything, Anne Bancroft's performance as Senator Lillian DeHaven was the worst. It was hammy and way too over-the-top for the character she's playing. As for Viggo Mortensen. He does a pretty damn good job of portraying Command Master Chief John James Urgayle. However, the idea that his character would trumped up charges of O'Neil being a lesbian (violating the 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy), seem a bit, out of character, but once again, that's the writer's fault, not the actor. It's lazy writing. As for the infamous POW scene, where the Master Chief beats her up and threatens her with rape. Surprisingly, those acts are justified. That's is what would happen if she was indeed captured by the enemy. While, there are those, who particular annoyed by this, because instructors are not supposed to physically abuse recruits. Under SERE-C, it's possible that it could happen, however, very unlikely under regular SERE training. Especially if the trainee outrank the Master Chief; such as O'Neil being a Lieutenant. So that was a bit odd. As for her having mistreatment from other recruits. It also could happens, as shown in real-life scandals like 'Tailhook', but it's likewise very rare, due to trust and teamwork being so vital in the military. Still, no one can deny, there is some sexism in the Armed Forces; after all, women weren't allowed to serve in any special operation roles, until January 2016; which is kinda depressing, because, when it comes to utilizing women in those fields; the United States is in the dark ages, compare to countries; which already had a number of female soldiers holding their own, reaching and surpassing the standards of their duties. As of this date of this writing, there has yet to be a natural born female to join the Navy Seals; which is sad, because everybody should had the fighting chance to serve their nation, if they want to. The idea of women having not enough brawn power to be in special operation is really outdate excuse. The majority of missions don't fail, because of the lack of man power. They flop, because the lack of smart strategies and misused of resources. Much like this movie. Regardless, of that, I hope, this movie's positive message would encouraged women to fight. Maybe, one day, there will be a good real-life 'G.I Jane' story to tell than this fictional half-ass version. One can hope.",6,5,9,4 June 2018
Training Day," Training Day is worth watching, any day! It's a masterpiece.
","'King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!' That's sure, right! 'Training Day' was an amazing movie! Directed by Antoine Fuqua, and written by David Ayer, this neo-noir crime thriller, tells the story of a young naive LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) undergoing a nightmarish single day evaluation by corrupt, yet renowned and respected narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) who has big sinister plans for him. Without spoiling this movie, too much; while this good/bad cop film has amazing performances from both main & supporting actors like Ethan Hawke, Cliff Curtiss, Scott Glenn & others, much of the success of this movie has to go with how surprising good, Washington was as the villain. It's sad to think, that Denzel had to depart from his usual squeaky clean image, to win, an Oscar for best actor, but the performer really does shines in this type of roles. You can truly tell that, with his use of body language and tone. The way, Washington show, primeval street grit, with long, hard stern looks, loud boisterous charisma yelling, and disregard for the public safety, such as bumping into people as he walks, show how much of an utterly detestable character, Alonzo can be. No wonder, why most of the audience were so eagerly for his comeuppance, even if Denzel, personal, is so beloved. Yet, there was another part of the character, Washington was able to display, without the writer spending too much time on his character backstory, visually; which was showing empathy for Hoyt. You see this, whenever Jake does anything, valor and honest & Denzel having to react from that. Its shows the struggle of guilt, within Alonzo. It tells the tragic story of a mild-mannered, family man, slowly morphing into a ruthless criminal in a matter of a few words & stares. It's nearly perfect. Yet, there was a few flaws, with the character as a whole. Much of that, comes from the misuse of the source material, which 'Training Day' is loosely based on. While, Alonzo is somewhat based on real-life, corrupt Los Angeles, police officers, David Mack, Rafael PÃ©rez & Kevin Gaines. Some of the actions, the character commits as a Narc Cop with Hoyt, throughout the film, just doesn't seem very plausible or realistic. They come across as too flashy, gimmicky and cartoonish, rather than smart street cops. One such example is the smoking, a confiscate drug scene. First off, it's a little hard to believe, that an officer like Hoyt that use to do patrols, would be that gullible and foolish, what it takes to become a narc. In most cases, police officers received an average of 41 hours up to 540 hours of instruction training before going into that field. There would be, no way, Hoyt would be that adequate. Secondary, it really doesn't make much sense that he would take the drug, knowing full well, that he was going to drug test in a few days & he wasn't dealing with any perps at that time. Third, it's highly bizarre, that Alonzo would plan out, for a whole week of stuff, on a specific one day plan that relies so much on the highly off-chance that Hoyt would take the drug, in order to blackmail him. Much of this movie could had be resolve in the first couple of minutes, with Hoyt, saying 'no'. Fourth, how in the hell was Alonzo's many crimes, overlook for so long!? I get that, he get stuff done in the department, but even if most of the department share the same corruption as the officer on the field; cops still have to write reports, submit a financial disclosure statement, undergo random drug testing, and pass recurring background investigations, yearly. There is no way, they can hide everything from the public & other government agencies. The corrupt cops would eventually get caught. Probably quicker than later, like what happen in real-life, with the Rampart scandal; which this movie is loosely based on. Also, none of the criminal sequences, throughout the day, felt anywhere near realistic. The idea that they easily find illegal drugs, as soon, as they pull a corner is far from truth. In real-life, Narc spend hours on end, on one, suspicious activity, with little to no pay-off, that a crime is being committed. Also, much of the crimes, portray in the film, felt more like step-up sequences, rather than isolate scenarios, which occurs more, likely. Regardless of that, I do have to fight against the claims from critics that this movie is nothing, but the continuous negative stereotype of minorities in film, by saying the movie does show that corruption happens in every level, regardless of class and race, such as the case in the restaurant scene & with Roger (Scott Glenn). As for the critics that says, Hoyt was nothing, but a ''white savior' cinematic trope whom job is it to rescue people of color from their downward plight. I also have to disagree with them, as the film shown in the end, Black & Hispanic communities, are willing to stand up against crime. Hoyt didn't make them, change. They did it on their own. Nevertheless, the film approach to women, could had been a little better. Most of the women in the film does nothing, but look and act like sleazy floozies. Sadly, actress, Eva Mendes is just there, for eye-candy and pointless nude scene. Still, that's a lot better than the jarring use of black musicians artists, like Macy Gray, Snoop Dog, and Dr. Dre, as criminals. That was awkward. Still, great use of their music in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, this strong Rated R movie, was an intense & compelling watch. While, this crime drama is not for everybody, due to rough language, graphic violence, drug use, and sexual references. It's still worth checking out, unlike the 2017's TV Series of the same name. Forget that show. Watch the movie, instead.",8,0,0,21 December 2017
In Bruges," I was waiting for a movie like this. In Bruges. It's worth the site-seeing. I know I'm awake but it feels like I'm in a dream.
","Apparently I grew up on a farm, because In Bruges impresses me very much. Directed by Martin McDonagh, the film, In Bruges is an interesting character driven movie. The characters in this movie are as human and fully fleshed out as it gets. A really dark comedy, the film is about two Irish hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) going into hiding in the Belgian city of Bruges after a hit went horrible wrong. They are waiting for a phone call from their violent crime boss with unbending principles, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) for further actions. The city of Bruges become a center point of the plot, as both see it in different ways. Ray sees the oldest well preserved medieval city, as boring and a personal hell nightmare for him wanting to get out of it. While, immature and his youth showing, Ray throughout the film is plunges into a state of depression and a torturous emotional experience, guilt for the hit going bad. Without spoiling it, he understand he violated moral standards of his crime, and looks for a way out by extreme pleasure, only to find himself paralyzed more to the guilt. Ken, the wiser of the two, sees the city as a dream due to its old buildings architecture and the rich history of its streets. Like Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' novel, the two characters play off each other on everything from living life to how to die in what to do, while waiting for Harry. Ray wants to party it up with a drug-dealer love interest Chloe (Clémence Poésy) and dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), while Ken wants to go site-seeing. The film is rich with symbolism and ideas. I love the film within a film notice such in the way, Ray met Chloe and Jimmy. A dream sequence kinda out of pastiche or homage of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now. A 'nod of the head'. The whole scene would foreshadow a lot of the end. The arrival of the phone call is the film's climatic moment as it put the film into motion. A nice reference by showing the opening shots of Touch of Evil, is clue that's things will not end well, for the two. The movie is about the conflict of principles. Harry is play out as the grim reaper of the film, as he thinks that anybody who did the same crime that Ray does, deserves to die. Ken acting as the guardian angel believes people has the capacity to change and deserves a second chance. It's a human struggle of how to seek justice. By having the medieval city as a background, all three of men represent the both extreme of religionist viewpoints on how justice is served. When Ray and Ken visit the art museum and look upon 'The Last Judgment' painting by Hieronymous Bosch. They walk into a surreal dream. Somehow, how purgatory might be looked at, based on Irish mythology. The idea of waiting for their inevitable fate in an unknown land is a common theme in philosophical Irish literature. When, Ray look upon the painting, The Flaying of Sisamnes by Gerard David, we knew that the guilt was eaten himself him, ripping him apart. All the actors did pretty well in this film. Colin Farrell's character is somewhat likable, but I found myself, not caring much about his fate due to some really annoying prickly jerk moments. It kindly turn me off the film. I found myself, relating more to the Ken character because he had more a moral code. Then again, the movie didn't had any heroes much to root for. It's perfectly alright to kill people, but don't you dare accidentally shot a kid. What type of moral code is this film presenting? I found myself, choosing the less of two evils. The hope of redemption and forgiveness is held out by Ken to Ray, doesn't resolve as this film gives blood-splattering conclusion where nobody wins. I don't think, Ray learn anything, besides wanting to live. He's doesn't seem like he wants to live to do better. It's seem he want to live for lust or fear of dying reasons. Hints why, I found Chloe to be a really horrible character. Brendan Gleeson display one of the best performance, I ever saw of him. Ralph Fiennes is just brilliant. The twisted humor is a hit and miss. I found myself, laughing in a few mean-spirited jokes, and at others, not at all. I did like the comedy of errors. The pacing is good, each scene didn't seem like a filler, as it serve its purpose, and move on quickly. I did find it, dragging in the pointless dwarf hooker party scene. I did love the perfect irony ending. The film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay award at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, and I can see why. It was well-written, maybe a bit too nihilism for my taste. The violent and gore was alright. Not to cheesy, nor unrealistic. The jump from Belfry tower of Bruges was a bit out there, gross. The language was alright for a gangster flick, but I did find Harry 'f-bomb' letter, just too cartoony. The music score by Carter Burwell is forgettable, and disappointed. I can't remember a damn thing about it. As a travelogue, I think the film is most impression as I didn't know much about Bruges before this film. The camera shots are great. High angle shots are used on church item, creating the impression that religion will be theme throughout the duration of the film, looking down on the characters. Close ups are great to show the coping of the aftermath of mistakes. Mise en Scene for the dreaming scenes. Overall: worth seeing, no matter if you're in Bruges or not.",8,3,6,16 December 2013
A Star Is Born," This musical film hits nearly all the right notes with me. I love this movie!
","The classic rags to riches story of a struggling young artist falling in love with an older veteran performer battling addiction, has been told time after time, again by Hollywood, with great acclaim; as early as 1929's film, 'The Broadway Melody' to, as recently as 2011's 'The Artist'. However, none of them, had the sights & sounds as 'the Star is Born' movie series (original 1937 motion picture, 1954's musical version, 1976's rock musical and 2013's Bollywood flick). These films are some of the finest movies about show business ever made, with 2018's version, by far, being the best. It's probably, my favorite of all the five films. That's pretty hard to do, because there is many things to like, with the other versions, but debuting director, Bradley Cooper & his crew indeed pull it off! Written by himself with Eric Roth & Will Fetters; the movie expands on some elements that were lost in the previous adaptations, such as giving more of a solid flesh out backstory to the main leads, Jackson (Bradley Cooper) & Ally Maine (Lady Gaga) than we got in previous adaptations. In this film, we get a lot of context on how real life struggle with substance abuse honestly starts. I just wish, the movie shown more of Jackson's fame, disappearing like the other movies. I just didn't get the sense that he's not in the limelight, anymore. After all, he still capable of selling out concert arenas and giving incredible performances. Plus, the musician got to perform at the Grammys, which is more than the previous characters ever got. There wasn't a lot of moments, showing Jackson having trouble, getting gigs as I would like. Despite that, Cooper still gave a good portrayal. He spent a lot of time, preparing for the musical aspects of the role, by getting himself a music coach and spent five days a week for six months, how to sing & play not just as himself, but also in character. He also spent months working on his speaking voice using a dialect coach to help him develop the rich tambour he wanted. Lowering his range to the point that it match the register of actor Sam Elliott who plays his on-screen brother, Bobby. That's a lot of work. You kinda knew that, this role was really importation to him, because in real life, the actor has also struggles with alcohol abuse. As for the female lead. BeyoncÃ© was considered for the role of Ally, but thank goodness, she wasn't pick. That singer can't leave the celebrity glamour side of her life, for any film. Instead, Lady Gaga AKA Stefani Germanotta was chosen, because her wiliness to strip the over the top gimmicky persona, she has, to allow the audience to feel more of real, grounded, and vulnerable performance. She really wanted to expose the real world insight of why modern day musicians acts the way, she does. There is a lot of similarities between, Ally and Germanotta, the performer. Both had to change their normal day image into something more over the top and flamboyant to gain the audience's attention. Its sucks that modern society has turn beautiful music into a shallow, vapid version of their former self. In a way, this movie was very powerful social commentary about the negative of modern pop music. Regardless of her celebrity persona, Germanotta has already established herself, as a wonderful powerful singer. Still, a lot of people still had doubts about her acting ability, even after her award winning break out role in FX's television show, 'American Horror Story'. In truth, I think, she really does pull this role off. Gaga can truly acted with Cooper, during the darker moments in the film. Both were outstanding. Not only that, but both performers had really amazing, on screen chemistry with each other. It really did seem like their characters, were in love with each other. Plus, both of them, have really beautiful voices. Who knew, that Cooper could hold his own with Gaga, during the singing sequences. Songs like 'Shallow' & 'Maybe It's Time', were very catchy. The style of music really does evokes the highs and lows of Jackson and Ally's relationship, and the song lyrics reveals the difficulty of staying true to your artistic voice in an era when everything, even their personal lives is market to the public eye. I can see, a lot of people buying the OST for the soaring, dramatic ballads; especially with 'I'll Never Love Again', where Germanotta gave a genuine heart wrenching performance for her best friend, who passed away, the same day, as the recording. In truth, every performer in this movie was equally as wonderful, even the supporting cast. Mad props goes to Elliot for his powerful portrayal. I can see him, being nominated, come award season. As for the visuals. The cinematography, especially, when the main characters driving in Arizona, were beautifully shot. Even the way, the large stage was frame to make it, look smaller, and personal with middle shots and close ups, was a very nice tough. It made, nearly every musical performance in the film, seem special, with the vocalists singing their heart out. It was very emotional. However, the movie does have some flaws. The movie has this deafening ringing sound throughout the film. I get that it was done to sympathize more with Jackson whom suffering from tinnitus. However, the way, the sound design is done, it will make you, want to cover your ears. It was a bit annoying. Despite that, I do like the foreshadowing to the hearing loss and the tragic climax. I just wish, the film show, the antagonist getting his comeuppance. It was a little too depressing of an ending. As for the pacing. It does seem rush a bit at times; especially, during establish Ally's career. Regardless of that, overall; the movie was an entertaining sensational watch. It's worth going gaga over. Highly recommended seeing.",9,5,8,17 October 2018
Gravity," Houston, we got a good movie, here. The movie is defying gravity and critics.
","There are not many movies out there that you should watch in HQ, HD, IMAX and 3D, but this is definitely one of them. The film's cinematography, visual effects, and realistic 'story atmosphere' of outer space was great to the point, that it was pretty entertaining to watch. It really did look like you were in space. A lot of critics were writing this movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron as a flop when they first saw the trailers for this film. Trust me, the trailers don't do this movie any favors. First off, the trailer makes it look like a 2003's 'Open Water' with the idea of having two people flowing in space alone after their space shuttle was destroy by debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite. I realize the horrifying idea of being lost in a doom like situation with little to no rescue, but the idea of watching two people in a dark open space waiting until they die, might seem boring because you can predict that by the end of this movie wouldn't end well for the characters. Glad to find that this movie involve more than 2 people flowing in space alone. There is always hope for survival, while building on the intense and the challenges of them trying to survive. I did find the Murphy's Law, a bit harsh. Everything seem to go wrong for Sandra Bullock's character, Ryan Stone. Another criticize about the trailer was that, people didn't think Sandra can't handle this emotionally driven high stress demanding role. I have to say, that Sandra really did prove that she can act in this film. I never saw such a depending will to survive from a female character since Naomi Watt's 2012 'the Impossible'. I have to say, Sandra Bullock's acting in this was pretty OK in this film. I thought, she did well enough to believe that she is a first time astronaut. While, she isn't as well trained as George Clooney's veteran character, Matt Kowalski. I did find her character likable, even if she does mistakes or gives up. Even the silly 'woof woof' scene seems believable, due to her character intense break down. I wanted her to survive. I did find George Clooney a bit too charming for this. I know he is supposed to be the calm storm that helps Sandra Bullock's character get through this tragic event, but gees, can you show a little bit of fear, George. It felt like I was watching George Clooney than a character. Still, I couldn't see original pick actor Robert Downing Jr. in this role, so George would have to work. I like situation horrors like this. I must admit the thought of helplessly floating in space, knowing the chances of survival is basically zero is pretty scary. The scary thing about movies like this is imagining yourself in the situation. I have to say this movie was beautiful shots like POV of space, overhead shot of Earth and lengthy 15 minutes scenes. These scenes does heightened the fear and love between objective and subjective perspectives, by showing the warm face of the planet Earth and the harsh depths of dark space, while showing the chaos nature of life both in claustrophobic and vastness shots. Other scenes might not be as good. There were a lot of cheesy Cirque du Soleil type space acrobatics that makes me laugh. Others scenes are just too dark to the point, you can't barely see anything. It felt like a cheap way to save film. Then, there is a lot of scenes that can cause motion sickness or cause Epilepsy. I have to say that Alfonso Cuarón made this movie work. You can see that he wanted to be an astronaut with this film, but chose to be an director, instead. I like how the director pay homage to other space films like 2008's Wall-E, 1995's Apollo 13, and 1979's Alien with its development of the characters and plot. The movie makes sense with all the science. One thing that I love about this film is that there isn't any sound in any of the space scenes. Replace the sound effects with a great score, and you got a good movie. The movie was very well made with scientific accuracy, but some liberties were taken in order to sustain the story. The technology is a bit weird as I have to think this movie place somewhat in the future since, as of this writing, the real-life Chinese Space station is named Tiangong is barely build yet. It was weird, seeing the space shuttle was being used in the film despite it getting canned in 2012. For the sake of entertainment, I am willing to employ my willing suspension of disbelief for the humanistic story premise this movie suggests. There is a lot of symbolism and metaphors. I like the Houston is God symbolism. Just keep talking, even if nobody is listening. It gives you hope. The film also meditates on spiritual themes both in terms of Ryan's daughter's accidental death, the will to survive in the face of inevitable death, as well as the futility of rescue. I found the rebirth metaphor well done. Her character has just lost a child before the mission, and she's in a peaceful environment, floating in space or water, and then something force her to move out. At first, her life is saved by a wire like a umbilical cord connected to Clooney, but then she has to cut it so she can live. Inside the space station, she's seen in fetal position. Then there is the scene where ship crashes into water and water breaks in, she cries and try to start walking. Intense. Overall: The surviving plot is simplistic, but it consistently keeps you either in awe or on edge. Nothing complicated, yet it sucks you in like gravity! That's how to make a great movie.",8,4,6,18 October 2013
Lone Survivor," As a seal, there is no such thing as an easy day. You got to be ready to lead, ready to follow, and never quit. Lone Survivor shows that. You're never out of the fight.
","Based on true event, Lone Survivor dramatizes a United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission call 'Operation Red Wings', during the Afghanistan War. Set in 2005, the team of four Navy SEAL, was task to take out a high-ranking Taliban leader, who is hiding somewhere in an Afghanistan mountain range. Unfortunately for the members of Seals Team 10 -- Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), the mission turn sour, as the team are left to fight on their own, in one of the most brutal last stand battles in the history of modern warfare. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, this movie will make some people, feel the patriotism, sacrifice, and heart the soldiers display incredibly moving; while others might feel, concerned that war and the military appears in this film, is too positive a light, and might come off like a recruitment movie. I can understand, where these people are coming from. While, I like the film, it does seem, like a powerful enlistment video. The film starts off with some cool intense Navy SEAL training footage, follow up, with a powerful Warrior Creed scene and then, a lot of badass, purely visceral, gut- pounding visceral action. If the fully immersive action wasn't enough, the movie ends it off, with over-dramatic martyrdom deaths. While, it feels shallow propaganda. In my opinion, the movie wasn't too jingoistic or overly patriotic. The movie made it very clear that there were some really bad people in Afghanistan that had to be stopped. Still, it does question and criticize the war for its failures, without painting the American soldiers in a bad-light. Director Peter Berg manages, so well to avoid high-minded moral debate of the war, while still respecting the source material, 'Lone Survivor' by author Marcus Luttrell. While, the movie is mostly historic accurate, there were a number of historical inaccuracies in the film that have to be noted. While, I'll not here to name all of them; some of the big ones, were, how the film deviates from Marcus Luttrell's account of the voting decision, his account to his injuries, and finally how certain characters die. The one decision, that bug me, is how they changed, how long, the fire fight lasted. In real life, the fire fight Marcus Luttrell and company engaged in with the Taliban for five days compared to the three depicted here. Another thing, the whole scene where the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight, never actually happened. So, I don't know, why they added it. I think the movie had enough action. Peter Berg manage to film, those scenes, very well. I like that he avoids too much camera- shaking in his depictions of the bloody battle. He builds adrenaline without tipping too far into either extreme gore or shock value. The movie pacing needs some work. The movie starts out, very slow, but toward the end, it does pick up. One thing, that I kinda hate about the film is, how predictable, it is. The movie kinda spoils, who the Last Survivor is, with the opening shot. Despite that, the movie does work. The ending is genuinely touching, and genuinely earned. You can't look away, when the photos of the real participants, are shown. Still, I wish the movie more concerned with telling us who these fallen heroes really were, rather than, focusing too much on the military-style action scenes. Yes, the movie did show, some character development, during the beginning, but it was far too little to remember. It's even harder to tell the men, apart, when they look nearly the same; all of them, having bushy facial hair, and all, being in the same height range. Still, I have to give the actors, some credit. The acting was pretty alright. Mark Wahlberg as the lead, was somewhat there, playing a Texan. I just wish, Mark Wahlberg at least, try to do a southern accent. His signature Boston accent was getting a little too silly, at times. The whole yelling scene with the grenade is prove of that. The supporting actors were decent. By far, this is Taylor Kitsch's best role, as of yet. I love Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, but I wish, there were more scenes with them. I like that the actors build genuine chemistry and warmth with each other. They really do, seem like brothers. Before filming began, the cast also underwent training from real Navy SEALs. They really did look the part. I really believe, they were soldiers. Still, I love the movie for using actual military veterans were used in the film to fulfill extra and acting roles. Even the real-life Marcus Luttrell got a cameo in the film. Overall: This powerhouse movie does have flaws, but it's still a smart, yet brutal intense film that need to be seen. So check it out, when you can!",8,4,5,2 August 2015
Meet the Parents," This comedy doesn't fock around. It really does meets the requirement on being funny! I'm satisfied with the results.
","Meeting the parents of your partner for the first time will always be nerve wracking. The pressures of making a great first impression can make any man or woman, feel awkward and nervous. For some of them, meeting the parents can turn out to be, a total disaster. Directed by Jay Roach, the film chronicles a series of excruciating moments that befall, one such man; Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), when meeting his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes's (Teri Polo) parents; overbearing father, Jack (Robert De Niro) & kind-hearted, mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I thought the series of unfortunate events & misunderstands were very funny at the time and still, is, even if some of the jokes hasn't aged well; such with the common misconceptions and stereotypes about gender roles & sexual orientations. While, the jokes about Greg's unlucky last name were very fresh at the time for a PG-13 movie, I think, rewatching this movie, along with the films badly delivered, sequels; 2004's 'Meet the Fockers' & 2010's 'Little Fockers' have, really run that joke to the ground. It's just not as risky or funny as it used to be. Nevertheless, most of the humor is still, timeless. The whole scene of Greg, explaining, how you can milk anything with nipples, will forever, crack me up! Ben Stiller really does delivered as the good-hearted but hapless goofball of a boyfriend, without going, way, over the top with his reaction and ad lib abilities. I also love, how the movie doesn't play, too much of the slapstick physical comedy that Stiller was known for, at the time. Don't get me wrong, I love 1998's 'There's something about Mary', but I do like, how the film, for the most part, keeps the humor, realistic in tone. It makes for more, well-rounded, appealing movie, because how relatable, some of the actions scenes, were. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably, his best comedic role, ever. Even better than his role in 1999's mob comedy, 'Analyze This'. Although, playing Jack Byrnes isn't much of challenge for Niro, since there was barely any different between that movie character from the normal, dramatic commanding tough guy roles, De Niro is known for. I have to say, the role did help him, bounce back from the awfully of 2000's the live-action/animated film, 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle', which nearly put a halt to De Niro's comedy acting career. It really does show the public, that the man can indeed make people, laugh. One thing, I thought, the movie could had improve, upon, is giving Blythe Danner's character, more to do. Don't get me wrong, her performance was mostly fine, but Danner's talent really does seem a bit wasted, in this forgettable role. I was really, hoping for Dina, to be, just as hard on Greg as Jack is. After all, the movie is call, 'Meet the Parents', not 'Meet the Father'. Nevertheless, deep down me, I really did like the comedic performance of everybody involve with this project, ranging from James Rebhorn as Dr. Bob, Owen Wilson playing Pam's ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley to the two five-year-old Himalayan cats that both played Mr. Jinx. I just wish, the female characters, had more to do, than stand them, looking disgust or embarrassed at Greg's actions. Regardless of that, the movie has more to give, than jokes. The movie was very well-shot. There is no better, example of fine-filmmaking than the roof scene. The way, Roach & his crew was able to show, multiply times, happening, at once is amazing. Another great thing, about this movie is the music, compose by music artist, Randy Newman. All of them, are easy-listening & worth checking out on their own. After all, Newman's original song 'A Fool in Love' was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. So it's worth a listen or two. Overall: I have to say, this is one of those remakes that really outshine the original movie. It makes 1992's independent film of the same name look unfunny, cheap, and amateurism. 2001's 'Meet the Parent' is a fairly good film to sit down and watch with the whole family. That's no lie. I truly do like this comedy. No need for a polygraph test to prove that.",7,4,4,9 November 2017
Mulan," Be a man & watch this movie!
","By Disney renaissance standards, this was pretty close to what the film was actually based on, the ancient Chinese poem called the Ballad of Hua Mulan. There is a slight exception from the poem and the movie, in the fact, that she lasted ten to 12 years in the military without getting discovered. Disney got it wrong in the settling as well, the ballad is set in the Northern-Southern dynasties period (420 to 589 AD), but Mulan the film makes it look like the height of the Ming dynasty a thousand years later. Oh, she also died tragically in the ballad. She commits suicide because the emperor asked her to be a concubine. But that's beside the point. I'm just history nerding. In the end, the story is the same, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) must pretend to be a man to save her elderly father from death in the army due to invasion with the Huns and it's leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). Some people think of him as forgettable due to one of the relatively few Disney villains who doesn't have a villain song, but I like Shan Yu as a villain because he looks so scary. No, his personality isn't that great, but the dude just looks like a monster! And he's a powerhouse! He can slice through the castle pillars with one swing of his sword. He's the only Disney villain I can think of that actually causes that kind of destruction. He doesn't need to be fleshed out as a character. He's the leader of the Hun Army. The Huns were trying to conquer China and were really violent and underhanded in their tactics. He belongs with the greats. One thing that bugs me in the film is how Mulan go to the camp, and get nearly kicked out of the army for not being fit, which kinda negates, the whole point of her taking her father's place. Clearly, her father wasn't healthy so if he was sent instead of her, he would have been sent home anyways. So what was the point of replacing him? Why, didn't Mulan go home after not being fit to join the army? I think it's about giving Honor to the family. Mulan's smart in a way I can see, a cheater, a bit lazy, loving, outspoken, and just fails at all things social, but lovable. This 'wood orchid' seems like the girl-power type character for the overly feminist. If anything, I've always seen her as a person who was just trying to find her own place regardless of gender roles. She tries to act as her society's definition of a woman and fails, she tries to act as her society's definition of a man and fails. If anything, Mulan only succeeds when she acts like herself rather than the roles that are put before her. It isn't about the girl power or the male dominance, it's about people finding their own place in life. Mulan may be a strong female character, but I don't believe with Disney marketing her as a princess. Mulan appealed to some girls because she wasn't a princess. The title of Princess is really just more marketable, because Queens in Disney type movies are usually evil, while the Princess is a heroine. Still, Mulan is not a princess. For example, Mulan in the movie didn't like her kimono outfit and found it uncomfortable and it's only seen in the beginning of the film. And yet, most of the toys of her showed her in that outfit as opposed to her warrior one. For Disney to do that is kinda wrong. A lot of the hate has to do with gender roles. No matter how brave or action oriented or tomboyish princesses are, they still dress in pretty clothes and have beautiful hair and fall in love which isn't realism to the source material. The main musical theme 'Reflections' is well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. Even though it's like the other princess songs, it's still a great song. 'A girl worth fighting for' is just as good, but my favorite is 'Be a man'. Most badass song in Disney history. How come only guys can have no singing ability whatsoever but still make an awesome song? Was it really necessary for Shang to be shirtless for the entire duration of that song? Shang clearly had a thing for Mulan even during the time he didn't know she was indeed a she. Conclusion, Shang must be at least bi. Disney, you astonished me again. Want to know something interesting though, the voice actor for Captain Li Shang, was B.D. Wong, an actually an openly gay man in real life. So it was a bit odd in a while. The confusing gender roles jokes and visual gags closely border on PG, but it was funny. Another person who was funny was Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the Chinese Dragon. He did OK in the role, but couldn't they find a Chinese or Asian American comedian, that would fit the film, more. I don't mind the fact that the Chinese culture is underplayed. Speaking as an Asian, it's refreshing to see a work of media that takes place in an Asian setting without overplaying the stereotypes to the point of offensiveness. The film was generally well received by Chinese audiences. The fact that Jackie Chan put his pipes to work as the voice of the captain for the Mandarin dub didn't hurt either. The animation was breathtaking in some scenes, but others were missing the epic sheer artistry. All in all the film itself doesn't really do any harm to the source material or the culture it seeks to portray. I really liked that about it and continue to consider it one of Disney's better animated films of recent memory.",7,5,6,9 April 2013
The Big Lebowski," A dude's dude movie. Nearly a perfect comedy. The Dude abides
","I love this movie so much. Anybody who doesn't like it, must be name Donny. Why? Because he must be out of his element. So shut up, Donny. It felt like a live, free-flowing work of comedy, action, and mystery. The Big Lebowski is an American classic that defied initial critical and box office failure to become a treasure of a film. This is one of the Coen's brothers most cleverly devised and executed stories. The plot surrounds the story about 'the laziest man in Los Angeles County' unemployed loser Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who get mistaken for philanthropic millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) by henchman hired by pornographer gangster Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). The Dude is a fairly good character, with White Russia in hand every time. You will hear that name a lot, about 161 times in the movie. They rough him up, and urine on his rug before last threaten to kill the millionaire's sexy young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who the Dude has no clue of. With his bowling buddies, security-store owner and suppose Vietnam Vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi) take a Raymond Chandler like journey into the world of crime, violence, sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll to find another rug. This movie has a world of its own, there is nothing I can think of comparing it to and it was a great experience and I still enjoy watching it. Donnie, Walter and The Dude were made for Buscemi, Goodman and Bridges. The supporting cast is great as well. I like Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, Peter Stormare as Karl Hungus and last John Turturro as Jesus. They all had memorable scenes and many unforgettable quotes. The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted in my opinion as he didn't serve anything to the plot. Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue that was a hit or a miss for some viewers. I got the humor, but for some people, they might see this as dumb. The editing needs some work as there is a lot of continuity problems, some crew visible, and a few audio/visual unsynchronized. Talking about audio. There's a soundtrack worth checking out. I love the Spanish flamenco version of The Eagles's Hotel California. It was awesome. Another song worth checking is Just Dropped In by Kenny Rodgers drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled Gutterballs. Nearly all of the visible symbols in The Dude's second dream sequence are taken from earlier scenes. While it's pretty good scene, it was kinda out of place. It was pretty pointless. Was I the only one totally lost when this scene played the first time watching it? There's something incredibly philosophical about the appearances of Saddam Hussein and the Gulf War in this movie. They're like an antithesis to the Dude. While the dude signifies the spirit of peace and and calm in the movie, Saddam symbolizes violence and war by being one of the greatest villains of the second half of the 20th century. The movie is often use for use as social and political analysis of many topics such as carnivalesque of modern society, commodity fetishism, neoconservatism etc. etc. In my opinion, while it does talk about major topic, it never does finish or make sense in the end of the film. There isn't a complex climax to the film. Sam Elliot appears at the conclusion to spout some bewildering nonsense that's meant to tack an explanation onto the end. Deep, I guess. So that might disappoint some people. What is it all really about? Who knows, let's just go bowling. Time heals all critical misconceptions, I guess as the movie fail when it came out, but grew into a cult following. This movie is like a good rug. Really tied the room together when looking at it.",9,3,5,15 June 2013
Unbreakable," This movie is so good, that it's nearly unbreakable.
","Unbreakable was a very risky movie when it came out. When this film came out in 2000, superhero films weren't as popular as today. Some critics might over look this film at the time, because of that reason. This is why I felt, the movie got an underrated treatment. Even so, the movie isn't really seem as a superhero film. It was billed as a psychological thriller rather than a comic book movie, because the way, the movie deconstructed the genre. It was pretty intense. Directed & written by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie tells the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard who recently survive a horrible train wreck. He is the only survivor of the tragic event, walking away without a single injury, bruise, or scratch. Suffering from mental breakdown from the event, he seems disconnected from his own life, unable to remember very much about his past and unwilling to connect to his wife and child. It wasn't until, he was contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic art dealer who has a congenital bone disease that cause his bones to break easily; that both feel that there must be a connection with their strange illness, and both must find their reasons why, it's happening to them. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie is very good at creating suspense. Yes, the movie might be a little slow moving in its pacing, but for the most part, it was very enjoyable. I love the movie explaining themes like good and evil, hero and enemy, strength and vulnerability, thesis and antithesis, and destiny and choice, so much deeper than that it should had. A lot of people might have mixed feelings about the twist turning the end, but I found it to be alright. It builds so much on sequel building, when you find out that there are other 'Unbreakables', out there in the world. I would love to one day, see a movie sequel to this, if they ever made one. Honestly, a sequel to this, might honestly save M. Night Shyamalan's career, after his series of recent box offices bombings. Like the other films from M. Night Shyamalan, there are a lot of elements tropes that you can catch when rewatching like how the movie is shot. The movie has a lot of fluid camera movements. Several camera angles were chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene. I love the use of mirrors and reflective surfaces as shots. You really get the sense of glass, being a theme. My favorite shot is the scene, where the doctor is explaining, how he hasn't got a scratch on him, while the other survivor, slowly bleed to death, across the hall. It's so haunting. The movie has elements of the supernatural, and it doesn't seem a bit cheesy. Like M. Night Shyamalan's previous film, 1999's the Sixth Sense; I love the use of colors and hues style. You really can tell, a lot of work was done to make it stand out, despite its gritty nature. I glad, we don't see Bruce Willis don silly tights and cape. You don't see criminals acting like in a comic book fashion. You don't see any of that, awful things. The movie was made in a realistic unique tone and it kinda work. While the movie is rated PG-13, the psychological horror and cold violence could be a bit unsettling. There were some moments that were a little bit uneasy for me to take in, like the child with the gun, wanting to prove he's invincible or a baby breaking his legs in the uterus is a bit much. That was shocking. The acting in the film is alright for what the concept asked. Samuel L. Jackson being slow-spoken and speaking in exposition, most of the time was kinda disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Bruce Willis being kinda depressed, seem lackluster at times, and somewhat boring as a lead. It gets better, when the self-actualization and self-discovery, kicks in, and the main character become more alive. I nearly forgot that Robin Wright was in the film, so you can tell that I absolutely didn't care about the subplot of David and his wife repairing their relationship. It was pretty forgetful. M. Night Shylamalan also has a cameo in the film, playing the awkwardly looking drug dealer, ever. The writing by Shylamalan for dialogue isn't that great. Most of the time, it felt like spitting long drawn exposition than real talk. The music by James Newton Howard is scored gratifyingly. It's slow, mysterious, haunting and eventually blooms into awesomely heroic. Overall: This origin story was very well-done. Unbreakable offers a wonderful premise, and has an astounding cast to pull it off. I do recommended, watching this film. Are you unbreakable? Then, watch this movie.",7,3,6,5 March 2015
Star Trek," Long live and prosper! Star Trek is boldly going where no previous Star Trek movie has gone before.
","The Original TV Series of Star Trek change post 1960's Sci-Fi forever. The show replace the tiresome hokey nonsense 1950s Sci-Fi with an intelligent view of the future, where human and aliens are trying to co-exist in peace, while also discovering the universe. It was indeed a new concept at the time; but overtime, Star Trek became view as an old relic of the past. While the film and TV Show franchise survive over the years, reaching out to each new generation of people. There hasn't been this huge support of the Star Trek brand, until this movie by JJ Abrams came out. How did JJ Abram gain main stream success? It was because he did three main things to make Star Trek, seem new. One is mixing the concept of Sci-Fiction with that of the more popular genre Sci-Fantasy. The movie feels more like a new Star Wars movie, then a Star Trek movie. Two: JJ Abrams replace the old actors with new ones, and change the Star Trek canon just enough to appeal new viewers, while not angering too much of the original fan base. Three: JJ Abrams and writer, Robert Orci hypercharge each original character's traits to the extreme. This brings on, a bit of a problem for me, as I found each character, one dimensional stereotypes of their former selves. Indeed, when I first heard who was starting in it, I thought this was a failure from the start. While, I was deeply misguide, I still think the acting is still mediocre at best. I do like Chris Pine playing as a mirror of himself rather than a cheap bad impersonator of William Shatner's James T. Kirk, but Kirk was more than a boyish horn dog which he is mostly portray in the film. Zackary Quinto wasn't bad as Spock, but he look and act like a cheap impersonator. I like how the film put conflict and tense moment between the crew members. I always found Kirk and Spock, a bit too calm when facing danger in the original. I like how they are bumping heads on decision making, here. I found myself, hating that Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) was put more in the back burning in this film, but Uhura (Zoe Saldana) was given more of a role than the previous films. The other crew members are bit cartoony for my taste. From the original cast, only Leonard Nimoy and Majel Barrett (The voice of the ship's computer) return, but they did play a big part. The film plot is that a Romulan name Nero (Eric Bana) from the future, has come back to the past to threatens the Federation because Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has cause his home planet to get destroy. Aim with a new weapon call Red Matter, he seeks to destroy every planet that the Federation control. Only James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the crew of USS Enterprise stand in his way. Some people call this a reboot, which in truth is a yes or no answer. The movie's premise doesn't allow that word to be used as it use both the Original Show timeline and a new timeline. I think the alternate timeline works, because it doesn't erase or ignored the previous films. It frees the new film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements and help pass the torch. The creators have also taken this opportunity to update the look of ships and technology to modern expectations. Still, it looks like a Budweiser brewery than an engine room. The special effects and CGI are wonderful in this film and action pack. Most of the violence is not graphic, rather it is suggestive and intense. Unlike the original movies, there isn't much Science gibberish that comes with this film. The movie doesn't really explain the whole black hole plot line very well, but who cares. I don't think, it was lazy writing. For entertaining reasons, it wasn't needed. The movie does have a comic book Star Trek: Countdown, that explain more of the loose ends like the why the Romulans have a new look, and others. I like how Nero is an amalgamation of the same-named emperor from Roman Empire and Jules Verne's Captain Nemo from '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'. Hints why the Narada looks like a giant octopus. There is a few delete scenes that need to be explore about Nero. The pacing is pretty good, but there is a few scenes that I didn't like, such as the events of Delta Vega. That's incredibly unlikely that all those events happen there. Kirk's promotion from cadet to first officer strained the suspension of disbelief for many. In order for it to happen, everyone above him in the chain of command had to die or be captured. I'm willing justified in that it's the crew's origin story, but it does stretch. One thing, missing from this movie is the very cerebral sense of the previous films about difficult situations and facing the unknown. I doubt it does follow any of Gene Roddenberry's original ideals, but it was indeed misguided popcorn fun. There was some funny moments such as James T. Kirk embarrassing reactions to vaccines. I like the nods to the original show such as the red suit dying, the Kobayshi Maru test, Centaurian slugs, the Green Female Alien, and the classic one liners. There's also a few references to other Star Trek shows. Lots of Easter eggs worth noting from other Sci-Fi movies. Look out for R2-D2 from Star Wars & Slusho drink from 2008's Cloverfield. The music is great, but I can do without the silly puns for songs in the soundtrack. I do like the camera shots, but the Len flare is used too much. Overall: Indeed the future has come and it does look good.",8,3,4,6 February 2014
Fury," Ideals are peaceful. History is violent. This film was brutal to watch.
","Fury is an intense film that use war to no clear beyond showing how ugly it can be. It's no way, go overblown patriotic like 1998's Saving Private Ryan does with its music. It doesn't romanticism the war like 2001's Pearl Harbor with its story. It's doesn't make war, an easier sit, acting somewhat like a propaganda film like 2009's Inglourious Basterds does. It's a very dark film with a lot of dark subject matter. It was a hard seat at times. I just glad, it didn't go too far into the horrors, to the point that it makes it really unwatchable like certain war films like 1995's 'Men Behind the Sun 4' or 2008's 'The Downfall of Berlin: Anonyma' due to the repulsion, nihilism nature. This movie belong in the same category as 2001's 'Enemy at the Gate' or 1985's 'Come and See'. It find a reasonable balance. It doesn't turn away audience members away due to the repulsion of war nor does it seem inaccurate or clueless to the horror of war. Directed by David Ayer, Fury is a fictional film about a battle-hardened army sergeant named Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) whom commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines during the last days of World War 2 Germany. The film draws a composite portrait of tank crews and the final days of the war in Europe by using stories influenced by the service of veterans in his family and by reading books such as Belton Y. Cooper's Death Traps about American WW2 tank warfare. Ayer went to considerable lengths to seek authentic uniforms and weapons which fitted the final months of the war in Europe. He even got the rare Tiger 131, the last surviving operational Tiger I to portray the enemy tank. It is the first time since the 1946 film 'Theirs Is the Glory' that a real Tiger tank and not a prop version has been used on a film set. While some things are not historically accurate for a story set in 1945, the film is accurate enough. Still, there are a few inaccurate things, clichés, and tropes that anybody can nitpick on. As for story, the movie wasn't giving anything new to the table; after all, there has been hundreds of films like this, previously done before. The third act is basically Saving Private Ryan with tanks. While the plot of the film is fictional, the depiction of the tank Fury and its commander, parallels the experience of several real allied tankers such as the American tank commander Staff Sergeant Lafayette G. Pool. The action scenes mirror that of the real life Battle of Crailsheim fought in Germany in April 1945. The action scenes were pretty intense and gory, but it was indeed scale down compare to those of other epic war movies. What the movie does well is using the story of the transition of cavalry to mechanized warfare. A lot of horse symbolism. The horses symbolize over the course of the film is the difference between European WWII movies and their American counterparts. People don't realize that the German army was like mostly horse-drawn at the time. By the end of the war it was mostly horse-drawn, and there's an innocence about a horse. A horse doesn't know where it is or why it fighting. In a way, all of the horse slaughtering can represent the youth of the two countries. When, they talk about what they've done to all of those horses, and it's very significant in foreshadowing when they let one go. Lots of Christianity motifs. Just like the Bible, it is filled with harrowing violence, inhumanity, corrupted and fallen men, and a message of God's grace. The movie is a very raw film. Lots of tense drawn out lingering nerve biting moments. Some good examples are the scene where Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) was forced to kill an unarmed prisoner of war in the back & the frightening sexual vibe of the scene with German women where you don't know if they wanted to rape them or not. It doesn't help that song playing in the background at that scene is 'Virgin Slumber Song.' The biggest change to the WWII motif is the idea of brotherhood. In this movie, they really mistreat each other, both physical and mentally. This movie was no lovely dove bromance, 2001 Band of Brothers. The tank crew honest could had kill each other, any moment. All of the actors well-acted in this film. Before filming, Ayer required the actors to undergo a four-month preparation process, where it broke them down. He kept the actors to cold, exhausted, and miserable while filming. Ayer also pushed the cast to physically spar each other, leading to many black eyes and bloody noses. They insulted each other with personal attacks as well. On top of that, the actors were forced to live in the tank together for an extended period of time where they ate, slept, and defecated. It was pretty ruthless. Maybe, too ruthless, as one of the co-stars, Shia LaBeouf went a little bit crazy, and pulled out his own tooth, cut his own face and refused to shower in order to understand what his character would have been through. It really did angering much of the cast and crew that day. The film also caused controversy by shooting a scene on Remembrance Day in which extras wore Nazi uniforms, in which the filmmakers had to make an apology. The movie is beautiful shot. The opening shot, alone, has this Lawrence of Arabia feel to it. Then you got a lot of haunting scenes. Overall, Fury is a well-made depiction of the horrors of war that will keep you at the edge of your seat watch.",8,6,13,2 November 2014
Akira," Akira explode with a lot of high energy action! The results from that, is some highly acclaimed praise! It's well-deserved. Still, it has some miss points
","While, this movie wasn't a success, when it first came out during its limited U.S theatrical release, this film has garnered a large following as a cult film since then. Akira led the way for the second wave of anime fandom outside of Japan and is a major influence on live-action films. Now, it's widely considered to be one of the best anime to come to the United States. In Japan, this movie is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest animated and science fiction movies of all time. I wouldn't go that far, into the praise, but I do love the way, Akira use imagery and themes regarding revolution, teenage delinquency, and political/religion incompetence, to show the deep clashes of cultures, between the new age beliefs and tradition values. It all build up to the inevitable destruction of the old and the rebirth of a new society. However, the film relies so heavily on symbolism, surrealism & absurdism, that it fails to connect with everybody. Some people might get lose, with some the film's many motifs, such as the image of a capsule that repeated throughout the story or the double helix shows up several times. Since, most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the original manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the print version, toward the last half of the film. Without spoiling it, just note different characters dies and lives than the manga. So don't worry, if you get confused by the odd visuals, because I was also asking 'WTF', was I watching, even after reading the manga novels. Lot of the character development and back-story was left out from the novel. Even, the majority drug abuse concept of the manga seem, to non-existed, here. Instead, it focus on an evolution theory that doesn't really go anywhere. Then, there is the fact, that a lot of the flashbacks, they did use, were edited in the film in the wrong spots. It made the film, so much more baffled. It's doesn't help, that the science-fiction manga in which, it was based & named after, is indeed a long read, so not everything about their world, can be put in the 121 minutes, run-time of the film. No matter if you're a first time viewer or a fan, the film does get a bit messy at times. Directed by the same author, and artist from the manga version, Katsuhiro Otomo; the film depicts a dystopian version of Tokyo in the year 2019, call Neo-Tokyo with cyberpunk tones. It's here, where the odd plot comes into play, focusing on teenage biker Tetsuo Shima (Voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and leader of his biker gang, Shotaro Kaneda (Voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) being expose to psychic powers from the government, that would wipe out, their world. What a lot of western viewers like myself, was surprised by, is the amount of violence and adult-driven themes. It was very rare to see that, in animation, at the time. The body horror in the night was and still is, visually haunting for me. This Japanese anime film contained some of the most kinetic sequences in animation history as well. All of the action scenes, were really made well. It gave the film, an epic scale of detail, movement, and fluidity. Akira has often been considered the greatest animated film of all time, with advanced technical features, such as highly-detailed scenes with textures, shadows, unusual colors, and seamless animation with over 160,000 animation cels. Computer-generated imagery was used in the film, primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor Onishi, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens flares. At its time, it was the most expensive film ever produced in Japan with $8 million. It's kinda cool that movie had the destruction of Tokyo occur on July 16th, 1988, the day that the movie had its Japanese theatrical debut, it was the same way; the manga told their story in 1982. The film has also been dubbed twice into English — once in 1988 by InterSound & later with Streamline Pictures and Geneon AKA Animaze via Pioneer in 2001, leading to a misconception that they produced it themselves. In my opinion, I like the Japanese version with the subtitles than the English version. There is just something, not right with the English dubbing. With the English editions, some of the original Japanese dialogue is lost or mistranslated. I also not a huge fan of the movie's soundtrack by Shoji Yamashiro (pseudonym of Tsutomu Ōhashi). Some of the music on there is very unlistenable. I can hardly stand the heavy breathing mixed with pounding of the drums. It hurts my ears, so much. Overall: While, a live-action film adaptation version might or might come, one day to renew fans, for the most part, this movie will be best known for its sharp animation. Still, the confusing plot and downer feel of the movie, doesn't make it, a great watch. It's still one of the most memorable anime of all time. However, I can't recommended everybody to see it. In the end, if you're a fan of anime, check it out. If not, there is better anime films to introduce you to that genre.",7,9,16,29 March 2016
The Maze Runner," The Maze Runner has a-mazing race for escape theme. I just wish, they explain it, better.
","Despite All Our Rage, We're Still Just Rats in a Cage. The movie does have a lot of twist and turns like a maze. So, it could be a bit confusing and frustrating to watch. You'll feel very lost and disoriented, watching it, trust me! While, I do praise the cast's performances, as well as the film's intriguing premise and refreshingly dark and action tone of Claustrophobia fears with great use of special/ visual effects, but still there was something missing from this film that could made it better. Directed by Wes Ball, the movie is based on author James Dashner's 2009 book of the same name. The film is the first installment in The Maze Runner film series, so sadly, most of the exposition needed for this film is in the sequels books, The Scorch Trials (2010), The Death Cure (2011), The Kill Order (2012) & The Fever Code (2016). The concept is interesting. It's remind me of 1990s Lord of the Flies mixed with the movie, 1997's Cube. It's sound very intelligent, but it was really dumb at parts. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn he's been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth full of monster scorpions call 'Grievers'. For a PG-13 movie, it's pretty violent. Lots of scary imagery. Felt almost 1979's Alien like. Honestly, the whole concept really doesn't really make any logical sense even if you get to read more of the exposition in the sequels. For a Sci-Fiction young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction, it borderlines Sci-fiction, and seem more like Sci-fantasy. The science in this film, makes little to no logical sense. When you think, hard on it, it doesn't make any sense on why the creators would build a giant Barnes maze. The world is half destroy by a social flare from the sun and a deadly virus is wiping out the population, yet they have enough man-power and energy to build a giant maze with an eco-system to test human beings mind under pressure. What!? How is that even possible? You have computers to run test like that, while waste limited resources like that. The movie is full of huge plot holes and really bad un-explained sequences like this. Don't bother asking why they have bones forest in the glade, as the movie never talks about it. Don't ask why the 'Gladers', can be immune to the flare disease, if they still suffer the effects without a serum? A big one is why isn't the over-bright sun burning the glade? Or how teenagers with little knowledge of science could be scientists? There are just way too many plot holes! Also, the plot could easily be resolved if they honestly just build a ladder. This movie loaded us up with more unnecessary terminology that it gets really annoying. The whole villain corporation name 'W.I.C.K.E.D' is way too gimmicky. I guess, 'E.V.I.L' was already taken .The harsh downer ending was so out there in left field that it felt like a different movie. It really left the audience with an awful taste in their mouth. The movie and book series differ in a few ways, as the movie cuts away the whole thing about characters being able to communicate via telepathy. They also ruin some of the characters like Gally (Will Poulter); by changing the whole ending, which means he couldn't be in the third movie at all. Another thing that the movie change is the Maze. The Maze would had made more sense, if it was indeed underground, rather than in the middle of a WICKED complex and outside. The Glade was supposed to be a pseudo-idyllic place where it never rains, sleets, or snows, but the film, it wasn't. The whole griever hole is not a void/cliff, but a door. Gees all these changes to the Maze ruins the whole theme of the Box being the womb, the Glade as childhood innocent, Maze as harsh adolescence, and the real world as adulthood from book. The whole allegory of the maze is life. There are sections where you see an opening and follow it, but you inevitably hit a dead-end or an obstacle, and have to retrace your steps or move around it to continue on. The movie has a lot of adult themes like dealing with manipulation in a society full of rules and order. Do you break them, or follow the rules? Do you want to live under safe confinement or anarchy freedoms? It's a big thought that the movie lacks in story-telling. Overall: It's a refreshingly dark approach to the new genre of Young Adult dystopian setting, but it's really doesn't shine well in being a great movie.",7,10,16,27 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Force is strong with this one. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was honestly pretty good.
","Although this franchise is popular with fans of all ages, this first stand-alone film in the 'Star Wars' Anthology series is quite dark, violent and downbeat. It's painfully clear that this movie takes the 'Wars' from Star Wars, very serious with high death count and casualties. Even the final of this movie is surprisingly bittersweet, brutal and pessimistic. However, while, it might upset some parents, that the action is too intense for young viewers. For the most part, Rogue One is still an impressive dark and grittier film that mature audience would love, even if it lacks some charm & humor. Not everything, has to be market for general audiences. Sometimes, people loves, when mainstream film go a little edgy. 1980's 'Empire Strike Back' & 2004's 'Revenge of the Sith' are some good examples. While, some critics might dislike this, I love it. It's very uncommon. I like the dark side of the force, sometimes. I have no problem with the enough of violence in this film. At least, the writers try to lighten up the mood at parts with cool cameos, funny one-liners, and references. If you still hate that, then I find your lack of faith disturbing. Maybe, this movie is not for me. However, for me, I was very pleased with this installment. This film is exactly what Disney needed to do from the outset. Fills in the plot lines of the original trilogy and built something unique out of them. Because of that, director Gareth Edwards and his crew made the first Disney produce Star Wars film that actually felt somewhat new in its story, rather than a film depending solely on familiar story-line, nostalgia and fan-service to drive the narrative like the recent rethread (2015) 'Episode VII: The Force Awakens'. Set before the events of 1977's 'Episode IV: A New Hope', the film tells the story of a group of rebels trying to stop the development of a super-weapon that could destroy an entire planet. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while it still have the same old-tiresome planet destroying plot line as other 'Star Wars' movie, I didn't find it, as bothersome as other films. However, I did wish, the movie did have more to tell with its story than that. After all, I thought, the relationship between main character, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) & her missing father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) was a bit underdeveloped, but what do, I know, maybe it's supposed to be that estranged. It was still awkward to see her go from being impartial about the war, to upright, leading the rebellion. That arch wasn't well-delivered. On the other hand, she goes a great job in both the action scenes and emotional parts of the film. Better than Diego Luna as squad leader, Cassian Andor whom a lot of people found, underwhelming. In my opinion, I think, his character was somewhat written that way, as a quiet, trouble-assassin. Complicated, yet layered. If anything, the rest of the Rogue One crew including smart-ass reprogrammed Imperial Droid, K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk), blind warrior monk Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen), weapon expert, Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) and Bodhi Rook, a former Imperial pilot (Riz Ahmed) save this movie from being dry. I honestly care for all of their safety. Not so much for Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone War who I felt was hamming it up. I love the refreshingly diverse cast, even the producers is trying to better market the film for Chinese audiences. Also, I love all the surprising familiar cameos from recurring characters from the other films, even if some of the de-aging CGI was kinda janky. Unlike some people, I did like the work, they did with Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). It really look like the actor return from the death. The visuals and special effects were good for the most part. The world-building really did look retro and familiar, while giving us, something fresh to look at. I was impressed with it. Because of that, I thought, the story structure and editing could need some more work. The first half was very slow with all the quick cuts. It really didn't establish, much. Felt too much of a fan-film. Seeing, no opening crawl was also a bit weird. The music by composer Michael Giacchino, that play in the background was just as distracting, however it did get better as the film went on. The second half of the film was a mixed bag for me. I can watch it, but it was a bit challenging to watch at times, due to the themes, they were, going for, with the desert world of Jedha. Too much current real-world metaphors in that part, for what is supposed to be an escapism movie. The third act, felt a bit rush, but yet again. It's a 2 hour movie. Yet, there were also a lot of extensive re-shoots during those final moments, which was pretty jarring to see old scenes from the trailer, missing from the final product. Plus, I thought, they could fit the inconsistencies between what is establish here in this movie and what happen in 'Episode IV', a lot better. There were a lot of things that still, didn't make sense to me, mostly with what was Tantive IV was doing at an open warzone in the first place. Still, Rogue One's strengths far outweigh any trouble spots. Overall: The film is intense, exciting and emotional, with its last act building to a crescendo and offering one memorable moment after another. Gareth Edwards has shown, with the first of these spinoffs movie can still have plenty of life in them, adding even more excitement to Star Wars' huge modern resurgence. Now, go head and witness the power of this fully operational battle station, firsthand.",8,4,10,19 December 2016
Shakespeare in Love," No matter, what some modern critics has to say. I still love Shakespeare in Love. A rose by any other name would continue to smell as sweet.
","It's sad, that this movie's reputation has suffered somewhat since its initial reception, largely because the Oscars foolishly choose this fantasy period rom-com over the realistic, grittiest, war torn themes of 'Saving Private Ryan' for the 1998 Best Picture Category. While, personally, I thought director Steve Spielberg's film 'Saving Private Ryan' was indeed the better film, I do have to say, the tale of a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) battling writer's block, until he meets his muse, an aristocrat's daughter enamored with theater and romance, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), inspiring him to write one of his most famous plays, isn't that bad as some modern critics make it out to be. Without spoiling the movie directed by John Madden, too much, I have to say, 'Shakespeare in Love', is indeed delightful, romantic, and funny, especially for those whom field is in entertainment. I can see why, this movie would appeal to many audiences members. After all, William Shakespeare's is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. Everybody knows his work, however, nobody really knows, about his personal life. While, it's safe to say, that this movie version of his life is highly fictional, due to the case that Shakespeare's greatest work 'Romeo & Juliet' was actually inspired by a pre-existing stories, written by others writers, like Arthur Brooke in 1562 as the Italian verse called 'The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet' and retold in prose in 'Palace of Pleasure 'by William Painter in 1567, in which, Shakespeare only adapted to play. Still, I do like that, the movie, somewhat entertain us, by humorous cleverly inserting, words, events and imagery, on how Shakespeare might have gotta some of his ideas for his poets and plays. Who knows, maybe, some of the things, that playwright, Tom Stoppard & screenwriter, Marc Norman could had happen! After all, many of the background details in the film, minus the whole new world subplot & jokes of the modern studio system thing are pretty accurate. Plus, Shakespeare indeed expanded the original plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. However, the idea of that Shakespeare was in love with a woman, when writing it, might be question. Many of people believe that the play was honestly, written for a man, due to its many 'Homoeroticism' tones between Mercutio and its title character. Regardless, there is also the controversy about if William Shakespeare was indeed the writer of this play and others, as many believe that he wasn't. While, it's true, that Shakespeare never wrote a play for theater manager, Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) as no payments to the writer are listed in Henslowe's surviving account books, I really doubt, anybody else, wrote this play, especially, fellow playwright, Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett), as Marlowe's characters development tend to be very dry and two dimensional. William Shakespeare's writing really did stood out, compare to the others playwrights at the time, for example, his themes about fate & dreams were rarely used at the time. Even the topic of romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy, until 'Romeo & Juliet' came out. Although the play is not considered as great as some of Shakespeare's later work, at the time, it is an exceptional work for the young playwright destined for much bigger things. Regardless of the lack of historic accurate in the film, the film does show that William Shakespeare is destined for greatest. However, the film's plot did bug me on how alleged similarity, it is, to mid-20th-century novel, 'No Bed for Bacon' by Caryl Brahms and S J Simon. While, I wouldn't say, this film is a total rip-off of that novel, as the bulk of the book focuses instead on a handful of several other historical characters of the period like Sir Walter Raleigh's doomed search for fashionable cloak, while worry about the nobles, tasting their first potato. I do see, some similarities in this film, when it comes to characters, like Viola falling for a stressed-out Shakespeare, while dressing up as a boy in his stage play. This book has more to claims, then, author Faye Kellerman had on the film stealing from her 1989 novel 'The Quality of Mercy', which hardly seem alike. Regardless of similarities, I do have to say, the film does stand out on its own. Most of all of the cast (led by Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck, and Judi Dench) were at the top of their game. However, I couldn't call, Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Oscar worthy. She was just alright with her near-flawless English accent. Nevertheless, I did think that Dame Judi Dench deserve her Oscar win, as Queen Elizabeth 1, even if her screen time was less than 10 minutes, out of 123 minutes film. On the other hand, I did believe that Geoffrey Rush got snub, out of his best supporting actor award. He was wonderful as Phillip Henslowe. I also believe the costumes and sets really stood out as Elizabethan Era design. It was wonderful to look at. I also believe the film score by composer, Stephen Warbeck was easy in the ears. It was charm to listen to. Overall: While, some people might hate the film for its tales of a Hollywood romantic fantasy torture artist finding love, without any meaningful sense of merit. Other will find it, as a blessed relief from gritty real-life true art is angst type of films. I just hope 'Shakespeare in Love' would get more the other half. It needs more love and appreciative. In the end, it kinda deserves that. It was indeed a good movie.",8,6,7,17 May 2017
This Is the End," In the end, it was a pretty good movie. Very smart comedy movie with a little bit of stupidity.
","First let me say, I actually like this funny movie, even with the stupid crude college frat boy humor. It's one of the smartest comedies, these actors have even done. It had some depth, and make light into a lot of post-apocalypse social issues. The movie is based on a short comedy film written by writer-actors Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and director Jason Stone called 'Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse'. When the trailer for the short film hit YouTube in 2007, it got over 50,000 hits in the first two weeks. Thus, 'This is the End' was green light to be made. I love the fact, that 'This is the End' has a self-reference, Charles Kaufman type feel to the film. The film has the real life actors portraying fictional version of themselves in a fictional end of the world story. Most of them played it completely straight and in doing so they've get the best comedy that's come out in a long time. Surprising Michael Cera playing this version of Michael Cera was the best thing for his career. It was pretty new to see him in this type of a role, even if it was short. Some of the celebs cameos were just way too short. I just wish, Kevin Hart and Jason Segal had a bigger role. I glad, Rhianna had a smaller role. She can't act, best to keep her role to a cameo otherwise it would ruin the vibe of the movie. There was also a very secret cameo in the Cannibalism scene worth checking out. Most of the main cast did a great job. Danny McBride pretty much made the movie, watchable. Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen was probably the most love character in the film. The other characters were a bit unlikable. I just couldn't stand Jay Baruchel in this movie at all. I felt the role that Jonah Hill got, didn't suite his personality. I don't know how they act around people in real life, but it was pretty interesting seeing them play the closest thing to just being themselves. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen combined real characteristics of the actors who then produced bizarre alt-version of themselves with elements that had absolutely nothing in common with the cast. Every main cast member took the director aside and told him that they couldn't do what he was asking him to because it was going too far and getting too extreme besides James Franco. So I doubt they were really horrible people in real life. The movie push the boundaries of humor to the extremes with over the top shock value scenes with serious issues like rape and cannibalism. What other comedy movie could make a serious issue such as 'rape' seem a little bit funny? There were some limits to the humor. James Franco asked Director Seth Rogen if his brother, Dave, could have a part. Rogen decided not to have the family of its main stars, brothers & sisters, mothers & fathers, girlfriends & wives in the movie because those people would have been most likely killed off in the movie causing it to become too dark. The movie starts out with all the actors hanging out at James Franco's house for a party, when the apocalypse hits. The chaos has forced the men to take shelter and try to survive in this new world. Slowly, the men are forced to take the apocalypse serious, and look closer into their own life, and ask themselves did they live a righteous enough to go to heaven. I was surprised at the religiousness of it all. This movie might offended some Christians and Atheisms with its biblical overtones, but I just say 'lighten up', it's just a movie. It does make the movie a little bit preachy for my taste in some areas. Still in the end, the movie says that acting stupid, mean-spirited, one-dimensional, offensive, and retarded man child, just show that in the end, doesn't help you in the apocalypse. Some audience members will be a bit angry that their famous celebs end up biting the dust. I just say, don't worry, you're favorite celeb didn't die in real life. I do like the CGI in the film. It was pretty high tech. The demons really look scary. The jokes here are hit and miss. Some of the jokes in the film got tiresome. Too much cuss words, gross out humor, sexual content, and racial humor was just as one-dimensional as ever. It wasn't ground breaking humor. I did like the parodies and satires here to both Hollywood and religionists lifestyles. I thought the Drug Humor was just awful. Because of those, I did leave the theater with mixed feelings. It wasn't impressive. It felt like a mediocre version of pretty bad modern comedies. In my opinion, this movie was just a better version of 2010's Grown Ups. I did like the funny homemade Pineapple Express 2 film. According to Rogen and Goldberg, the homemade Pineapple Express 2 film in which this movie depicts is what they envision for the actual sequel. So maybe we will see a real version of that one day. Overall: great movie, just not that great.",7,8,17,6 July 2013
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 has a bit of rust in its metal. It's a bit stiff, and unmoving. Still, it's a OK movie.
","Directed by once again Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 in my opinion fault to live up to the original movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful movie. It was pretty OK for what it is. A popcorn flick. It just wasn't as good as the original, but hey it's still worth noting. Iron Man 2 was more a comedy than an action movie. Iron Man 2 starts out, with after the events of the first movie. Stark has just revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Meanwhile, in Russia, scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to seek revenge against Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) as he believes that Stark stole his father's technology. Mickey Rouke as Ivan Vanko isn't a bad choice, but his character had little to no development. While the movie would love to point out that he is Whiplash from the comic books, in truth, he was on film a combination between Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo (the original Anton Vanco). Both Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo in the comics wore more body armor than the guy in the movie. Most of the movie, you see him fail into everything he does. In no way, does I see him as a seriously threat to Iron Man. The movie could have made him sinister, but gladly use him as comedy with a running gag about getting a bird. Also in most of the film, we don't even see Iron Man in action. Tony Stark literally spent the last half of the movie in his basement making the ultimate suit to fight a ton of drones that went out like a candle in the wind. The thing that annoyed me about it was how his father's intention for this incredible, impossible to create super-sustainer type thing that will changed the world, is made in like 2 days by Tony Stark and is essentially used to replace a double-A battery in his chest. Trying not to spoil the whole movie, but I found the ending fights really disappointing. 23 minutes of action in 124 min film is too little for a blockbuster film, far less than Iron Man. Even the middle fight in the film is pretty much pointless as it waste time. It's remind me of the fighting scene in 1988's They Live where the two heroes duking it out for little to no reason just for comedy. I think all the comedy, hurt the story ark for Tony Stark's depression, alcoholic, and poisoning arch. It was never taken serious in many scenes. I was really hoping for 'Demon in a Bottle' like story arc. Sadly as long as Disney Marvel control the movies. There will never be a Demon in a Bottle storyline. Plus, I don't even think Monaco Grand Prix would have allow a clearly smashed, poison and untrained driver Tony Stark to drive a racing car in a race with other drivers. We came to see Iron Man, and what did we get 2 short action scenes, a depressing finale, and tons of Avengers references. So there were a lot of Easter Eggs in this movie, but I didn't get a trip on it as much as I hope. I mark a little bit, I have little interest in it. Back to the movie in hand, all actors and actresses did swell jobs, but the one that really broke out of its shell was Sam Rockwell as Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer. So let me see the bad guy in the first Iron Man was a white business tycoon, using an ethic minority as a cover for their own plot, the second was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, and the third was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, true inspiration there. Tony Stark's sidekick, Colonel James Rhodes went through a change, too. Terrence Howard got replaced by Don Cheadle. What I believe is the reason why, was because Terrence was overpaid for the first movie, they slashed his pay for the sequel drastically. Once Howard's agents were informed they were taken aback at the huge pay cut. He back down. The studio had always wanted Cheadle for the part, Howard says. It's weird that Colonel James Rhodes can control War Machine armor so quickly in this film, while it took a while for Tony Starks to get uses to being Iron Man in the first movie. Scarlett Johansson is sexy as Black Widow, but her character development wasn't there. She was pretty much in the movie because she's eye candy to the comic book fans. Talking about eye candy, Gwyneth Paltrow is just there to suck up screen time as Tony's love interest, Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. Iron Man 2 had some bad dialogue. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together, there was a lot of filler content than actual story. Even Robert Downing Jr. himself, said that this movie turned out not-so-good (paraphrased) mainly because Marvel had way too much control over it and deleted so many scenes which would've done much to. It seemed too bland to me personally, just pointless action, plot holes and dumb plot elements. In the end, this movie is way better than Iron Man 3, and not as good as Iron Man.",6,3,5,3 July 2013
World War Z," World War ZZZZ. The movie is like a zombie. Starts out energetic and alive, dies for a while, then comes back for a bit, and finally ends with an bang.
","The beginning had promise, but then it became to CGI-ish. It's like they released it 28 days too early. If you read the book by Max Brooks, and then watch this movie with the same title. There is little to no connection. Even the zombies are completely different. They finally use the term Zombie but their 'zombies' are the furthest thing from modern day zombies. They don't die, they run, they pick who they eat (actually they don't eat they bite you and run away), and they climb. This movie is more like 2001's '28 Days Later' infected or 2010's Crazies type of zombies. The different between those movies, and this are three things: 28 Days Later had characters with depth, the infested were scary, and it had a lot of gore. This movie had action, the characters had little to no depth to them and the zombies were far from scary. I prefer the undead mysteriously coming back to life and the real conflict is how the living can still 'live' on. Anyways. There is something about 2010's Walking Dead that makes this scarier than World War Z. It's the fact, that no matter how much you fight or hide from them, you will turn into them in the end. This movie would have work better with a Rated R version, movie had this happy go lucky ending that makes me puke. I can accept that the books style was not directly translatable to a movie story line, but I am severely disappointed that so little was mined from the source material, save the title it seems. The zombies themselves were scary enough but the mechanism chosen to neutralize the them was scientifically absurd, especially considering the books solution was conventional, methodical and thus believable. Someone needs to re-do Z as a miniseries. It can't be done it 2 hours. The book was a series of zombie like short-stories, not one whole story. Since the book isn't exactly a story, the filmmakers just used the same concepts and put an story together for the movie. There was a lot they could have used from the book that would have made this movie so much better, like the underwater zombies, the zombie ships at sea, the battle of Yonkers, the methodical military solution that turned the tide instead of the ludicrous 'zombie camouflage', the birds eye view of events from the International space station, how about 'patient zero'. They had a gold mine of material and only used a few very small nuggets. The book had certain great themes such as government ineptitude, American isolationism, and social commentaries that made the book great. In the film, these topics are little talk about, instead we get a United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) able to travel around the World, to look for a way to stop the Zombie pandemic. Don't get me wrong, it's nice seeing how other countries like South Korea, U.K and Israel are dealing with the zombie outbreak. I like how a country so small, and lose nearly all its population like Israel, can build a 200 feet wall in 7 days. Still, there is little to no way Gerry Lane is able to travel around the world, while the brick of humanity is happening. It's nice to see that airplane service is still around, after billions of people have die. I like the fact, that you can toss a grenade at the back of the plane. A plane can take an internal grenade explosion and still maintain enough direction to land. The explosion depressurizes the cabin causing everyone to be sucked, and when you crash. You're able to survive. What? Director Marc Forster presented us with a lot really tense moments at some points and the action scenes were good, but my only problem is they killed off military dudes so quickly that I didn't really get attached to anyone besides Gerry Lane. Plus, Brad Pitt in no way show any sense of fear and uncertainty against the zombie plague. I would love to see Brad Pitt have one break down moment, one scene where he's looks like he is really afraid, but we never got that. The film could have been better, if they kept his family there rather than sending him out wasting fuel and time going to countries. However, I had problems with my viewing the film as night scenes was not clear enough or too dark. It was really hard to watch what is going on even with the day scenes, with the zombies moving in such a fast pace. The action scenes became a little too blurry. The 3D didn't add or help the film, in my opinion. Lot of shaky camera shots made it dizzy. Well, I know they had to do reshoots and rewrite the script a butt load of times in order for World War Z to come out. Overall: Was it worth seeing? It was OK, at best. Not the best zombie in my opinion, it's just felt like watching ants on an anthill, biting me. It was annoying. Maybe a normal audience member might love it, but for me, a huge Zombie fan. I was disappointed by it. There's nearly no controversial about it. The movie had little to no depth, and it just felt like a really safe popcorn flick.",6,8,16,24 June 2013
The Hunger Games," I'm still hungry, feed me more, movie!
","Hunger Games only feed my interesting even more, but this Gary Ross movie fails to make me full. The movie is based on the 2008 science fiction novel by Suzanne Collin, telling the story of teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives in a post-apocalyptic nation of Panem AKA North America where The Capital, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation by having The Hunger Games, an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12â€“18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death. You probably asking why don't they rebel against this cruel matter. They can't kill everyone, they rebelled in the past, why not now. That is the idea. By the capital killing their children without remorse or second thought. They demoralize the districts and keep them down. Africa is absolutely ridden with child soldiers, so it's somewhat possible. I know it's bit unbelievable, but just go with it. The movie fails to also mention Avoxes from the novel, the people who rebel against the Capital anyways. I imagine District 9 would be frequent winners of these games. They have illegal aliens. Just joking. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katnis, but she does have some lacking values such as Lawerence gives near emotionless deliver of lines. Well that technique is commonly used to show uneasiness, tension, and stress. Sort of like from Katniss' POV, it's just not well-delivered. Not only that, but its hard to buy the fact that she is supposely 16, when she already start in more adult roles before this film. It's seem out of place. Katnis is chosen for Hunger Games with little to no training against well career tributes whom districts with a better economy since they had resources to train for the hunger games. She isn't going alone, she is follow by Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) a short, boring one-dimension boy character. To make them have a chance of surviving, alcoholic trainer Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrison) is wanted them to fall in love, so they can get sponsors to help them with the game. What is missing the movie is Katniss's inner monologue wrestling with the fact that she doesn't love Peeta, but has to. To show young love to become a audience favorite. The fumbled romance can actually be contextualized as two people being manipulated into this awkward thing they think is romantic love but really isn't, because it's what fans both in the novel and outside the novel want. It hurts the film. The story, especially the movie, works best as a scathing satire of reality television, but the absurdly shaky camera, especially in the fight scenes was annoying as hell. If they're trying to set a frenetic tone to simulate actual fighting their doing it wrong. The movie does a fantastic job of depicting the ignorant high classes with the capital civilians with awful clothing. The people of the capital see these children as characters on a screen and even when they don't they won't blame the government for bringing them there, they will blame the other child for killing him/her. It's interesting in a way, because in real life, people pay to see movie just with the fact that children are killing other children. We don't blame society, we blame the child. Truly eye opening subject here. Another thing, Hunger Games fail to show us hunger. It's not presented in the movie well enough. Most of the actors looks well-fed. In a world, where they can create animals like wolf mutts, why couldn't they create animals to be eaten? Doesn't matter anyways, cause the bad CGI makes them look fake, even the fire dress looks fake. The music by Taylor Swift 'Safe and Sound' and the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing. The PG-13 rating didn't really hurt the film, as most of the death were pretty gruesome, and some of them were really emotional such as the death of a member of District 11. I hated the fact that the movie wrote out several really important plot points like Katniss having to adapt to going deaf halfway through and Peeta thinking his leg might be cut off. I think it's importation to the plot. Also, part of the appeal with the world building was the inter-district politics which play such a huge role in the sequels missing here.The books are original enough that you don't notice how the basic story structure is shamelessly pillaged from Running Man and Battle Royale. Everyone is saying it's a copy of Battle Royal, what about 'Knights of forty islands'. The first novel by Sergey Lukianenko in 1990? 6 Years before, Battle Royale was finish. The story is very similar. Just because something came out second doesn't always mean its a rip off. Similar ideas are always going to be around. Besides, the Hunger Games focuses more the the 'glamorized' idea of the games. The author took the premise of our reality TV shows and went far right with it. Never really got why the Hunger Games seemed to be linked to Twilight. Other than the love triangle and conflicting emotions of a female main character, there were no real similarities and let's be honest here: the Hunger Games was just better than that pathetic portrayal of vampires in all aspects. At less here, the female lead is a free independent string woman unlike Bella. The movie is not as good as the book, but that's because the book is written in first person, with a lot of detail and plot points derived from Katniss' personal thoughts. This could not be translated into a movie seriously (I would have hated hearing her narrate it) so other methods had to be used. The movie work as what it can do, and that's really good enough.",7,3,7,15 February 2013
Zootopia," Zootopia is a beautiful beast of a movie. I love it.
","This March Hare of a movie is a lot of fun. Plenty of Easter Eggs worth checking out! Zootopia has everything that the general audience, might be looking for, in an animation movie. Set in a world where walking, talking, 'civilized' animals live in general harmony with one another, regardless of whether they're predator or prey. A small-town rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) achieves her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit cop; only to find out, that she been relegates to a safe, but boring parking-duty assignment. However, things started to change, as animals around the city, start to go wild. With a street smart, sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), she might be the city's only hope in solving this mystery, once and for all. Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, this movie is so much deeper and mature than previous Disney anthropomorphic animal films, like 1973's Robin Hood & 2005's Chicken Little. It does a great job of teaching audiences important moral lessons about tolerance, and respecting, those who might be different to you. I love how egalitarian ideals are challenged by Zootopia's stereotypical political prejudices here. Its shows how animalistic, human are being, toward each other. It's really needed, social commentary. I love the use of animals as the message without being heavy-handed or preachy. While, the movie is able to do that well, the movie does have a large number of unanswered questions that kinda bug me about its exposition delivering. I know that these animals has indeed evolve; but wouldn't the so-called animal look a little different than its normal counterparts? After all, in this world, 'Survival of the fittest' & 'Natural selection' doesn't really existed in this world, as much as it does in our world. Here is a good example: most of the movie plays off, the fact that predators are turning back, toward their former selves. However, wouldn't these creatures, couldn't have those normal animalistic behaviors like their previous selves, because the fact, that they evolve from creatures that hasn't eaten meat, or hunt in many of years. I get that, maybe, they're just feel the force to kill, because of drugs, but I can't find myself, believing, that they want to eat their prey, when they haven't done, so, in many of years. Also, how in the hell, are they still considered 'predators' if they don't eat the prey? The only idea, I got is that, they allow to eat, lots of many lower forms of life like other vertebrates and invertebrates creatures. However, this change in diet, doesn't allow them, to keep their normal animalistic features? If they became all vegans; wouldn't these 'predators', honestly look more like normal herbivores? Even the herbivores would look and act different, since they evolve into creatures that lost some normal features, due to no longer, needed to be used. Also, what standards of animal evolution, makes these animal choose, which creature can or cannot be eaten. Is mammals, the only ones sapient in this world? I find that odd, because some invertebrate and vertebrate creatures like reptiles, arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, birds, jellyfishes and fishes do have some intelligent right to not be eaten. Who is considered as sapient, who is not? Maybe, I'm thinking, too much on it, since this is after all, a cartoon, but it's a good question for a debate. Still, the movie is relentlessly entertaining enough to overlook those logically questions. It's a well-rounded film. The computer animation from Disney animation studios looks amazing and beautiful. I love the look of the futuristic look of the city and how it's operates. The action scenes in this film were intense and full of danger. The neo-noir murder-mystery is suspenseful, dark and thrilling. The jokes were mostly clever and funny. Love the mixer of adult humor with that of childish ones. Love all the references and homages. Glad to even see, some non-Disney ones, like 1972's Godfather & AMC's Breaking Bad TV Show. The family, friendship and relationship dramatic is heart-warming and well development. Voice actors, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are spot on, with their characters. I love the constantly energetic, optimistic Judy working the sly, con man attitude of Nick. It made for very good chemistry. The supporting cast is just as amazing. Also, mad props go to composter, Michael Giacchino & singer, Shakira for the catchy 'Try Everything' theme song of this film. The music and soundtrack is stunning to listen to. Overall: This animated adventure is equal parts buddy-cop comedy, fish-out-of-water tale, and whodunit mystery is a great movie. With its vibrant visuals, simple but evocative storyline, and important social commentary, Zootopia is a talking-animal pic worth watching with the whole family. A must-watch for everybody.",9,6,19,4 March 2016
12 Monkeys," Stop monkeying around and go see 12 Monkeys. This movie is insanely good.
","It's time to revisit this 1995 neo-noir science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam. After all, this film has recently made history once again, when Syfy Channel has chosen to adapted it, into a television show in early 2015. With that said, I have to say, unlike the show, which is a remake of the film; the original movie '12 Monkeys' is more of a reimagining, than a remake of the 1962 French short film, 'La Jetée', written by Chris Marker. While, it's true, that La Jetée and 12 Monkeys have some similarities; such in the case, of the main character, which both has a man redreaming of a childhood tragedy and time travelling to stop it. Still, these films couldn't easily be compared with each other. Marker's La Jetee is about a man trying to escape the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic world, by travelling in the past to find his love; while 12 Monkeys is about, a man, James Cole (Bruce Willis) sent to the past, gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet. Although, La Jetee inject their story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster. The big different is that 12 Monkeys screenplay written by David and Janet Peoples is much more grandeur with its theme; interlocking dramatic social commentary about the world's environment, the struggles of mental help, and how people view religion. Could psychiatry be seem as a new religion!? Is Faith is a delusion!? Does the march of time, prove that what we deem insane, today; might seem normal, tomorrow? These are the brilliant questions that this movie brings to us. While, yes, this film does perversion the original intent of Marker's film message, but, Gilliam's version gives more to the table then the 1962 nuclear holocaust drama. It's reasons like these, why it feels like Gilliam's version is more like its own standalone masterpiece of contemporary cinema, rather than a remake. Plus the special combination of directorial vision, superb writing, and mood enhancing cinematography delivered an engaging piece of dramatic fiction. One thing, that this Terry Gilliam's film has, over that French short film is a superb cast. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Brad Pitts plays against his pretty boy typecast, here, as the crazy, and paranoid schizophrenic, Jeffrey Goines. Meanwhile, Madeleine Stowe gives alright performance as Dr. Kathryn Reilly, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. I like her lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical 'Cassandra complex'. It was somewhat brilliance, nevertheless, her falling in love scenes with Cole need some work. It wasn't convincing. Another great thing from the film is the music by Paul Buckmaster. It's so eerily with its creepy circus like theme. However, I do have to say, the movie does have some faults in the eyes of some critics. As with most Terry Gilliam films, this film is often dense in grim darkness to the point, that certain people find them, somewhat depressing to watch. The whole bittersweet ending is a bit hard to take for some. Another problem is all the film references and shout outs such as 1958's Vertigo, 1931's Monkey Business, Blade Runner & 1985's Brazil. It comes across as a cheesy homage. Terry Gilliam's 'Monty Python' cartoony style of realism mixed with sci-fi fantasy is a bit jarring. In my eyes, the pacing is a problem as well. I didn't like the repetitive annoying nature of the childhood flashback dream sequences. It was a bit overwhelming. I also didn't really buy, those dream-like scenes, Gilliam has, as a great example of human thought. La Jetee, somewhat address this matter, better with its slide-show, motionless black & white style. It seem more like a dream in the unconscious mind than Gilliam's version. The still moving images works best when exploring dream, memory and the concept of time with its simplicity. However, as a grand motion picture film, 12 Monkeys is superior in that field. La Jetee can barely be count as a film. Another problem in the film is the complex story. It seem to be missing a lot of things to make it, perfect. There are a lot of unexplained sequences in the film such like the 'Bob' scene that really doesn't add up, logically. The whole 'butterfly effect' is also a bit confusing, when you take in 'You Can't Fight Fate' aspect. So, why, then, do the future scientists give Cole a gun to change history? Did Cole alter history or not? Also, what was 'the insurance' lady, talking about? We might never know. Some viewers found these unanswered questions to be a bit muddled. Despite that, I do like Terry Gilliam's brilliance. The fact that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions is good. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless. Overall: It's worth watching and worth discussing about. A must-watch.",8,4,7,15 December 2015
The Impossible," It's nearly impossible not to like this movie. It's a really good movie!!!
","It's impossible to know during the first moments of a disaster, if you're even going to survive, or not. It's impossible to know if your love ones will end up dead or alive. Yet, there is a chance of possible results. It's call hope. Every living man wishes that them, and their love ones would never be harm by any tragic event. Hope is needed for surviving. This movie teaches people to believe in hope. The Impossible is an English-language Spanish disaster drama directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sánchez. It is based on María Belón's and her family's experience of the real life event of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The movie says it's a true story, but the movie changes a lot about Maria Belon's experience to the point, it seems less like a true story, and more like Hollywood trying to exploit a real life tragedy event to make money. The 2004 Tsunami is still in recent memory to a lot of victims when the movie was created in 2012. It's not like making a film about 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, where most of the victims are now dead. This only happen a few years ago. It still fresh in people's mind. So to see a Hollywood movie about it, is a bit too soon in my opinion. Still, at less, they produce a film with respect to all the victims, rather than offending most of them with a silly plot. The plot mostly stay with the source material. The biggest different is that the real life family were Spanish. In the film, they are played by English actors. While all the English actors did a swell job, in my opinion. Spanish actors would have made this movie more realistic. It's not like they couldn't find good Spanish actors. There are so many Spanish actors that I can think off my head to play these roles. I felt it was Spain's movie industry copping out, to appeal to with a broader audience, since most films industry shows white people as the main parts. Even some of the most Hispanic actors are chosen for roles because how light skin they are. It's rare to see dark skin actors in main role parts, and often they play second fiddle to those actors who are light-skin. I just don't like the concept of whitewashing. For a movie about, the Indian Tsunami disaster, there is a very few dark side Thais in this film. Most of them have little to no speaking parts, and just add in the background, so we know we're in Thailand. I know 5,000 people died in Thailand and half of those were mainly white Europeans. In Khao Lak where the film was located, almost all who died were foreign white tourists, most Thai deaths were in Phang Nga, Phuket and Krabi almost 50km away. I know it's not a documentary about the Tsunami, it is the story of one family, but I just thought as less, they can at less do, is give the Thais a voice in the film mentioning the struggle of the native people after this disaster, too. I heard that nearly all the foreign and Thai extras where actual survivors of this tragic event so why not. Any ways, the movie has English physician Maria Bennet (Naomi Watts), her Scottish husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Tomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oakley Pendergrast), are on Christmas holiday in Khao Lak, Thailand, in 2004. The tsunami triggered by an earthquake floods the area with overwhelming destructive power and all of them are separate from each other, not knowing if they are alive or dead. Naomi Watts spent most of the movie, injury, and barely alive. She does a great job in this role. I was happy to hear that she was nominated for Oscar for Best Actress award. I have to also give big props to Tom Holland, who really gave this movie, the heart it needed. There was a commanding scene where he can't find his mother at the hospital. Ewan McGregor give one great powerful scene with the cell phone sequence. It nearly had me in tears. The ending was a bit disappointing as they make themselves seem like they don't care about Thailand, and look like rich snobs. The movie should had ended at the hospital, not there on the plane. I know its air ambulance, but gees, it looks awkward as they look like they were escaping on a private jet first class. I have to say the disaster effects were astounding. The tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave created in a water tank in Spain. I like how the director was committed to working with real water, rather than a computer generated wave, because he wanted the story to be authentic. Seeing Naomi Watts, and Tom Holland in the massive water tanks gave the movie, its realistic point. The whole Tsunami sequence was just too damn scary! The parts where Maria was being cut up by sharp items was tough to get through. The shot of her leg wound, and the follow up shot of her breasts that looked like they were hanging from her skin was just hard to watch. It is one of the most frightening re-creation of a real life disaster, I have ever seen. Overall: It's nice to see a movie with a lot of hope, rather than watching a depressing film of lost. It's one of the few disaster films that make you care for all the main characters in the film. I have to say, go watch it indeed. You will believe in hope after seeing this film",8,3,6,10 August 2013
42," Any fan of baseball need to watch this movie. It's a home run!
","This was a great movie even if you are not a baseball fan you will love this movie. It's a wonderful film and amazing story of the baseball legend himself, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman). Robinson is so important to baseball that his number 42 went into retirement with him throughout the whole major league. No other player, got that. Not even Ty Cobbs, Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron. Before this, I don't think I ever saw Chadwick Boseman in anything much less even know his name, but he pulls off a very believable Robinson. The movie tells the story how Brooklyn Dodger's owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was able to bring in Robinson, and finally break the color barrier in the sport of Baseball. Harrison Ford is outstanding. Happy to see Harrison Ford in a decent film. It wouldn't shock me if he were to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Thank goodness for people like Branch Rickey that make this world a little brighter. I kinda wish the movie would have mentioned the person who scouted Robinson and actually introduced him to Branch Rickey. Clyde Sukeforth. A former catcher who managed the first two games Jackie Robinson played in a Dodger, but oh well. Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland miss a few historic moments in the film. I guess it was best to leave out what happen in 1947's World Series with the Yankees. I know it might lower the mood, but hey, it's history. Anyways, they can always show 1955's World Series where the Dodgers were really champions. While, personally, I'm not a Dodgers fan, I do like baseball. I know by limiting your story to one team might hurt the movie due to the huge different fan base for teams, I think it was important for the film to focus on the Dodgers. While there were a few Historical inaccuracies. Just for example like Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) and Jackie Robinson actually met even earlier than the Boston try out when Jackie faced a court martial while in the Army for insubordination for not going to the back of a bus when ordered to. Thankfully Jackie was exonerated and this terrible experience for Jackie went an long way towards Branch Rickey choosing him to be the first black major league ballplayer. It's still good with the information they do put into film. It's based on. Not all the events are historically accurate. And I don't need spoilers galore on how events are laid out in the movie. Maybe you need a reality check on how movies work. About the racism portray in the film. Yes, it's a bit harsh in some scenes, but at less they didn't make all the whites look like racists. There were a few supporting characters helping Jackie Robinson on his way. I would have love to see a bit of racist attitude of blacks against some whites so the movie doesn't feel like a movie about white guilt. Let's remember that racism isn't a black and white issue, but any race can be racist to another. Sad to know what he had endured back then. When I see what people had been through to overcome that, such a motivating to better our society. Brilliant! I can't imagine the restraint it must have taken for Robinson to not smash that guys face in, that one scene. Yes, there is a lot of black stories movies of pushing beyond racial barriers film, to the point, it's over sanitize the genre. So grateful that society had matured over the centuries give him coo-does for standing up for himself as he was a great ball player. Well paced and well acted film. The music score was amazing and beautiful to hear. 42 is a must watch.",8,4,5,11 May 2013
Rocky V," Even if it try. Rocky V couldn't fight itself out of a paper bag. This movie is super weak. It's not worth going for it.
","This fifth movie and apparently then conclusion in the series, was not good. It turn away so many fans. So far, it's the only film in the Rocky saga to have lost money at the box office. Directed by John G. Avildsen, the flick tells the story of boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) learning how to deal with retirement after suffering numerous concussions, meanwhile training a new fighter Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) to take his place. Without spoiling the movie too much, thank God for 2006 'Rocky Balboa' & 2015 'Creed', because the franchise could had ended with a sour note. Originally pitch with the boxer meeting his end with an unplanned street fight. The film's climax was rewritten by Stallone after noticing how overall unpleasant, it was. So he changed it for the better; which was the best decision. The whole idea of him giving up and dying very weakly goes against everything that the franchise was teaching its viewers. Regardless, the new ending still didn't go the distance. It didn't really resolve any of Rocky's financial & fatherhood issues with his son Robert (Sage Stallone). That's one of the biggest faults of the movie. We never got to see if the boxer would be alright with putting his gloves away for good and survive through other means. It felt unfinished. In fact, a big takeaway here is that violence is still the best and perhaps only way to solve any and all conflicts. Be it Rocky's issues with over the top cartoony character, George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) or Robert's bullies. That's isn't really a good moral message when you think about it. After all, being brave doesn't mean, you go out looking for trouble. As for the music. It's mostly a miss for me. This movie doesn't have best training montage to pump up. The hip hop music is really dated and doesn't really related much to what happening in the film. It's honestly pretty disappointing to listen to. Plus, I hate that 'Gonna Fly Now' is not never really heard in the film. Regardless, the action scenes throughout the film, still look pretty fake and hokey even with the alternate fight work print. The hits don't even land at times. It's sucks, because Morrison was honestly a really good boxer in real life. Although, the action scenes with him were below average, his acting was decent. He really did some great delivery with passion at certain parts in the film. One such example was the dinner scene where Tommy talks about his father. Nevertheless, it's Michael Williams, the other boxer performer that really fall flat here. Not only is his shadow boxing, very poor in the film, but he barely shows any characteristics as Union Cane. While, it's true that Williams and Morrison were to have an actual match about a month after this movie was released. It had to be canceled, because Williams hurt himself. As for Stallone, he was alright in the film. I do like his acting even if Rocky's lethal form of 'brain damage', was inaccurate portrayal. Regardless, it's just nice to see the effects of head injuries like concussions being actually honest meaningful discussed here, even if it was briefly shown. His chemistry with his son was fine. Sage was also alright as an actor, despite being a little annoying at parts. As for Adrian (Talia Shire) Rocky's wife, Shire as a performer isn't given much to do, besides being supported. She was just fine in the role. Unfortunately, one subplot I didn't really like was the boxer's brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) falling for unrealistic schemes and losing nearly all of Rocky's money. Especially when Paulie never once apologize or try to make amends. That character is just too unlikeable in this movie. Yet, Rocky is willing to defend him even till in the end. It makes no logical sense. It didn't seem real. The movie would had work better if Rocky was defending his son's honor rather than Paulie. After all, it's Robert that suffer the most from Tommy's actions. As for idea of them, moving back to the slums. It felt like an unrealistic extreme setback. Even with the limited amount of money, they should had been more well off than they were portrayal. Don't get me wrong, 'fall from grace' storylines are great, but unfortunately this felt like a rethread. We already saw them deal with money problems and injuries in the 1979 sequel 'Rocky II'. This film didn't give us, much of anything new. Honestly, the movie would had work better if the 'riches to rags' story took place somewhere else than the Kensington area of Philadelphia. Look I get that having it take place in that area, was obvious attempt to recapture the magic and charm of the original 1976 movie, but awkwardly, it felt more jarring than emotional impactful, especially in parts, such as Rocky visiting his old gym or Adrian being forced to get her old job at the pet shop back. While the director's cut version explains those scenes with more context and reasons with Marie (Jodi Letizia) reprising her role from the first movie as an emotional backdrop. Her scenes near the bar along with some of the flashbacks of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) were sadly cut from the theatrical film. Because of that, we never really got to truly understand why Rocky act the way, he does. It was muddled much in the same way, how Robert age from five to ten between films. Overall: This is the only film in the franchise so far, that I really do hate. Sadly, like most of the audience, this movie was not a huge hit with me. Because of that, it was not quite the knockout, I was hoping for. It truly didn't rock my world.",5,3,4,26 August 2019
Argo," A real movie about a fake movie.
","Nice movie full of thriller about Canadian Caper created and develop by Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck). The caper was a joint covert rescue by the Canadian government and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to try to get six American diplomats out of Tehran, Iran after the hostage events of the United States embassy of 1979. The six evaded capture during the seizure of the United States embassy by escaping to the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). Tony is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees being Canadian filmmakers scouting for exotic Middle Eastern locations in Iran for a similar science-fiction film with help from his superior Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), and film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). From all the supporting characters, the best is Lester. Alan's Lester get most of the great funny lines of the film. The Hollywood producer is the only one who is essentially fictional. Which is a bit ironic, since the character is himself presented as the embodiment of Hollywood BS. The real life 'Argo' screenplay that the CIA used to create their cover story came from an adaptation of Roger Zelazny's 1967 novel Lord of Light. It was once supposed to be a real attempt to produce the movie with the book's original title. After that production attempt had failed, it was utilized by the CIA, and the title was changed to Argo due to a knock, knock joke. As much as the movie tries to make glorified the CIA, the main source to help the diplomats. In truth, the role of the Canadian government particularly that of Ambassador Taylor in the extraction operation was 90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan. There are other historic inaccuracies that the film does, like saying that British and New Zealand's embassy turn the diplomats away. Grossly inaccurate. Sorry to burst your bubble, but all problem moments in the film, were dramatic license and not history. At best, it can be called 'based on true events'. Still, it's tries to give history about Iranian's culture in the opening, and the end credits, by posting the real life people side by side with that of the actor's portraying them. I didn't like Jimmy Carter's voice over talking about the events, as it felt like self-gratification for something, he hardly work on, just approve on. The movie kinda felt like propaganda. It felt like to demonize Iran, maybe since we (USA) still in conflict with them as of the time of this writing. But that depends on the context. In my opinion, it's a story that need to be told. But overall, the film to be honest gives a totally wrong picture of Iranian people. Showing them so savage in this movie or back watering. At the time of revolution there was an Anti-American atmosphere, as the Shah of Iran has been supported by the American government. Even though the revolution went in a wrong way. Today, Iranian people are more close to American people in battling for freedom and democracy in Iran. I hope this film is demonize that country's government, not its people. The film is excellent, but it will do nothing to further 'peace talks' between US and Iran. If a silly film recently can ignite the murder of a diplomat in Libya, what will this one do? The action was great. I had to pause the film several times because of the tension. The screenplay for this film had some really slow parts. The thing that still picks at me about this situation was the lack of depiction of any of the 6 having, for lack of a better phrase, 'Survivors guilt.' One of the six diplomats, actor Scoot McNairy who plays Joe Stafford is made out of be a big time annoying jerk who question everything. He states out that he is mad at himself for keeping his girlfriend in the country when they could have escape. Later when Tony gives him an ideal plan of escape, he question it, and threating not to take part of it. This is awfully writing for that character. I've never really been a big Ben Affleck fan over the years but I have to admit, this was quality work. He should directed more. His acting in this film was OK. Not much to say. The film feels really genuine. If you're looking for some sort of 'Black Hawk Down' shootout/rescue, than just get that movie and don't even bother with this. There is action, but not the one 'action movies' are based on. This is about doing it with no gun battles and car chases, and no one losing their lives and still getting the job done. Overall, I give it a great watch. Was it worth, winning Best Picture? Maybe, but it deserve that win. If you don't like the film, Argo you know what to yourself.",8,3,5,10 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," To boldly go to see Star Trek: Into Darkness so I can have kick ass adventure in space!!
","I highly anticipated the movie and was not disappointed by it. First thing first, before seeing this movie. People must watch these few things to make sense of the story is trying to tell. The first one is Star Trek: The Original Series 'Space Seed' Season 1, Episode 22 (1967), an episode that has a similar plot to this movie. The second film to watch before this film is Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, (1982) set fifteen years after 'Space Seed' and the last one is Star Trek (2009). All three movies are needed for understanding this film. The movie go like this, a terrorist name John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former Starfleet agent just bomb London, and flee to Kronos, the Klingons planet. Now Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the Enterprise is called to bring him back to Earth into justice. Without spoiling too much, the movie was a very good sequel to the 2009's Star Trek. The action, the story, the visual was top notch from beginning to end. The twist in the movie wasn't too big of a twist, to any fanboy or trekkie who research the film beforehand, but for anybody who isn't a die-hard fan, might find the movie a bit confusing. Even if you don't get it, the movie does a good job trying to explain it. The only problem is that the movie felt like déjà vu of pieces of old Star Trek movies scenes stitch into a new movie. It felt like the story cheated in a way, because it use the same tactics just changing the characters into reverse roles. Watch the ending to Wrath of Khan for more detail and then watch this movie ending. The audio and visual were decent. The acting was pretty good. I love Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain. His deep voice, and chilling stare is scary. He really did look unstoppable. I enjoyed the Enterprise crew. Everybody did their bits even if their acting seem a bit too much caricature. Still, it's hard to believe that how young everybody on the crew looks, that this James Kirk would be allow to be Captain for so long. Tired of the man-children. In the real world, someone as young, irresponsible and arrogant would not even be a deck officer in the navy, let alone a captain. Also I believe that Star Trek isn't no longer Sci-Fiction, but more like Fantasy in space, so Sci-Fantasy. I think they finally got the picture, seeing how popular Star Wars was, and Director J.J Abrams decide to make it funnier to watch. Sure, Star Trek tries to rely on science more than Star Wars, but let's face it, there's barely anything plausible on some of the Original Star Trek movies, too. Yes, the science in the Sci-Fiction doesn't make sense, but who cares when the story is that damn good. Enjoy the ride. Yes, at first, I thought the first 2009 Star Trek movie was going to be a joke, but I learn to love it. This isn't your TV Show having taken a turn for the worst, this isn't a disappointing climax to your favorite franchise. This is just another interpretation of the Star Trek Films. No one's forcing you to watch. This is turning out to be a great franchise in my opinion. Overall: There are tons of amazing action sequence throughout the movie blew me away. Enjoy it!",8,6,14,17 May 2013
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men doesn't made me angry. It makes me think. It's one good movie.
","12 Angry Men is one of the best plays turn into movies films ever. 12 Angry Men was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose by director Sidney Lumet. There is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons: great writing, and great acting. One thing that I love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. Beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. They must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. To add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. The way, the film is filmed is amazing. It shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. Since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. Like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. None of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. When you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as 'the boy' and the witnesses as the 'old man' and 'the lady across the street'. The film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of America. These are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. This sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. Who were these men is still a mystery? We only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. They soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. Some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, Juror Number 8 (Henry Fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. The jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. Without spoiling too much about it, I have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. All the actors did a great job. Henry Fonda does a great job as Juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. He does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. Still, I doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. Ed Begley as Juror Number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. Lee Cobb as Juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. Last, worth noting is Jack Warden as Number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. While the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. Throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which I love. The two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. Each character wants 'justice,' but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. If I can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes Henry Fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. We don't know if Juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. In the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, Juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. What's really interesting about the case within 12 Angry Men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. It's up to question. People even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. In modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. It's one of the few movies that make you think. The film should be view by anybody going to Law, but not only that, but regular people in general. Yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but I think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. If not, this movie. They can watch the 1997's remake of 12 Angry Men. That version is also pretty well done. There is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. It's really hard to hate this film. The more years pass by, the more praise it gets.",9,3,4,19 November 2013
The English Patient," Zhivago of Arabia
","Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count László de Almásy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the 'hero' deliberately sells out the British — the West — to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.",7,3,5,28 November 2012
The Notebook," If you're a bird, I'm a bird. I like flying with the Notebook. It's a good movie.
","Come fly with the Notebook. Directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is about Duke (James Garner) an elderly man, trying to re-spark the memory of his dementia suffering love one, (Gena Rowlands) by using a notebook about a young couple love affair during one summer in 1940. It's here, the movie flashback from present day to 1940, where we're introduce to worker man, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) trying to work out, their own relationship. While, it's not a healthy relationship like the novel. The chemistry between them are pretty good, when you get to see them as being a lovely couple. The movie still has more arguing and fighting then love scenes. It's a bit overwhelming, but without conflict, it would be a really boring chick flick. It kinda hurt the film, but kinda doesn't in a way. First off, both people really put each other in danger. The first bad sign was when Noah climbed up on that Ferris Wheel and threatened to kill himself by letting go if she didn't go out with him. Sure, it seems cute in the movie, but imagine if a guy did that in real life. You would be calling 911, thinking he's a psychopath. Honestly, he almost get her run over by a car by lying in the street. That's a sign of unstable, ladies. I have to give props to Ryan Gosling for making these scenes, more charming like a crazy lover, than crazy stalker. Also, Allie is no Southern Peach here, too. She's abandon him multiples times, beat him with slapping him in the face or punching his chest and cheats on her current boyfriend, Lon (James Marsden). At less, the movie doesn't make them too unlikeable. The relationship here, is way more realistic than the unrealistic cheese in the novel. The supporting cast is alright, but they're so clichés characters like the mother (Joan Allen). It's so generic, to have a mother that doesn't want her to date this guy in these films. At less, I have to say, Joseph Stalin mustache, Allie's dad (David Thornton) was pretty cool. Also, James Marsden has to be the most typecast actor for the role of woman cheats on her current boyfriend for a much hotter guy. This guy doesn't get a break! The writing is pretty clichés archetypical story of the Boy Meets Girl. Examples of this, are with establish scenes like kissing the rain, romantic boat rides, and others. Honestly, the things trying to pull them apart is ridiculous unrealistic and could had been solved. It felt really dumb. Like why Noah couldn't go to New York? He's alright with going to a new city with his friend, Fin. (Kevin Connolly), but not with Allie? Also, how on earth, Allie's mother, able to gather all her mail, if Noah wrote that much letters. You would thought, for one whole year, Allie might beat her mother to the mailbox, at less once. Also, it's not uncommon to people to call other people back in those days. The only thing that could make sense, is World War 2, but they really pan over it, quickly. It's ends as fast as it started in the film. Honestly, if they kept the WW2 part, going longer. It would make a way better pull apart conflict. Instead, the movie really misused that. The twist in the end, wasn't really much of a twist as the movie kinda hints at it, 2/4 in. The cinematography is pretty good for the film. Still, the director hits you over the head with a bird metaphor. It's everywhere, here. Enough with the birds! The movie really does look like it takes place in the 1940s, but like any movie in the places, there are some historic inaccuracies. I do love the references to 'Leaves of Grass' by Whit Whitman. It's themes of faith and fate in the poem, ''Song of Myself,' are two topics serve to foreshadow future revelations in later parts of the film. Glad, it's not a throw-away line as it brought up multiples time in the film. Noah's love for poetry, music, and the outdoors all play important roles in The Notebook, not only adding interest to a number of scenes but also deepening Noah as a character. The biggest different between the book and the film is the fact, that Allie didn't write a notebook at all. It's seem like Noah wrote the notebook, but it's not really mention. The best thing that made this movie really good is the theme of love conquer all, when Alzheimer is a setback. This part, made the movie so watchable. While, the ending is bittersweet. It was a better way to end the movie, then the novel. The movie being PG-13, didn't really hurt the film. It does show that you can still show a great sex scene without one shot of nudity. The violence is pretty tame, as the WW2 years are passed over, quickly. I can say, this movie works better than a lot of modern young adult novels. Overall: The Notebook isn't anything new, if you follow chick flick movies, or know anything about romantic novels. The one thing that made this movie really good is the struggle of remembering love ones. That is the backbone of the story. It's the reason, why this movie works.",8,3,4,29 June 2014
Us," This motion picture ineptly ran with scissors! Regardless, I was still tethered to this movie. The flick was semi enjoyable, even if parts aren't that scary & too silly.
","If you wanna get crazy, we can get crazy. Writer & director Jordan Peele proves without a doubt, that he is indeed eccentric! After the success of his 2017 Oscar winning horror film 'Get Out', he went bonkers within this genre. This movie from him was insane! The film tells the story of the Wilson family led by patriarchs, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) & Gabe (Winston Duke) being attack by a separate family of doppelgÃ¤ngers. Without spoiling the movie too much, the first thing you probably want to do when watching this motion picture is not focus, excessively on the reality or logistic of the premise. Instead, you should see it as more of a symbolic statement that it was intended to be. After all, questions involving the vast amount of currently up to date semi resilient clones kept underground are mostly left unanswered. We might never know if the government laboratory still kept the clones alive, even if the original host dies or leave for a different country. Better yet, there is no resolve to the question if they make new replicas for those whom are recent immigrants or illegal aliens. Things like that are not meant to be explain. While, we might not know exactly when the cloning project ended. The film didn't do enough to make the replicas seem that desperate. The movie should had shown more abnormalities changes involving deformities, undernourished, or demise Tethered, due to their limited rabbit based diet to make the film's premise stronger, knowing that the replicas would go to any means to quickly take over our lives & escape their horrific and squalid conditions. Since Peele didn't do that fully. It was a bit jarring to see most of the doppelgangers led by Red (Also played by Lupita Nyong'o) take their sweet ass time escaping the underground & killing people, especially with the Wilson family. Don't get me wrong, I do understand that the Tethered did started out uneducated, due to the lack of a soul & forced to imitate the actions of their above ground doubles, because of that. However, it's obvious by 'the Hand across America' attacks, that they do commit individual actions under their own free will & choice. Yet, I found it still puzzling, that despite no longer mimicking their counterpart's lives 24/7, they still act like animalistic with comedic groans and moans. Hearing them make ridiculous sounds was a little too off putting for me. The noise ruin the scenes that are supposed to be frightening. The film could had done better, with more smart quiet killers. It's sad, because the choice of red jumpsuits and murder weapon being a pair of scissors was truly scary. It's symmetrical. They reflect both the literal and metaphorical bloody rapid severance between the have nots and haves. It could had been a very strong commentary on the duality of the American dream, nature vs nurture. Instead, the metaphor for the troubles between social classes were somewhat loss with some viewers. It didn't quite push us, to confront the shortsightedness of many prejudices between the poor and wealthy, within this under the surface upward mobility mortality play. Especially when it comes understanding we all are one of the same, regardless if born in rags or riches. The whole duel clock & duality mirror imagery meaning should had been more clarified. Despite that, the twist toward the end was highly predictable. The flashbacks to Adelaide's childhood weren't really needed. It kinda push the obvious. It felt like filler and really hurt the pacing. Honestly, Peele could had gone with the approach of one world, many parallel world's SchrÃ¶dinger's cats with that, for a more unique watching. Regardless, I still dig the foreshadowing with Adelaide's white shirt turning blood soaked by the end of the film. It shows who she really is. I also like the clever cultural references to other Sci Fi and Horror films such as 1956 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 1984 'Chud'. Even the nods to fictional novelty works like the Bible & Alice in Wonderland was cool to see. The movie even copy bits of real life historical events like the Underground Railroad, Sept 11th, and even the rabbits being clones in 2003 for equally chilling effect. However, the best thing about this movie is the music. Great use of ominous gothic chanting from composer Michael Abels. Even the instrumental version of Luniz's 'I Got 5 on it' is particularly memorable during the movie's more dramatic moments. Following the music, is the haunting, beautifully well filmed shots from cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. He really does knows how to create a sense of dread. The duel acting from all the performers that went along with the visuals, was outstanding with the different in mannerisms within their characters and the rival doubles. Overall: Despite some flaws. The film is still worth taking a stab at. It's a above cut from the rest.",7,4,7,17 April 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Respect my authority, by going to see this cartoon musical! Its wicked fun!
","At the time, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' was released, Matt Stone and Trey Parker's popular animated series was at the peak of its popularity due to its crude and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics. So it was no surprise that fans were foaming at the mouth to feast their eyes on a full-length cinematic adaptation. They got it in the summer of 1999, due to the success of the Comedy Central show. Made after Season 2, and before Season 3. Stone and Parker were given nearly virtually limitless platform to let their depraved satire and original comedy run wild. And run wild they did with the nudity, violence and toilet humor, they put in the movie. However, it's the profanity that got this movie, the most infamous. In fact, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut went on to earn a spot in Guinness World Record history for 'Most Swearing in an Animated Film.', & first computer-animated film in history to receive an R rating, despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down. Thank goodness, this foul-mouthed musical didn't get it's originally rated NC-17 rating. I would have, thought that would be, way too extreme of rating, just because the movie felt like using profanity. Still, the Rated R movie really went beyond what the television show, was able to do, at the time. What made this movie, very entertaining is the fact that South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters that was originally intended for mature audiences. While, it's more common place, now. In the late 1990s, it wasn't. This movie was never made for kids. Yet, some children did see it, at the theater. I was one of them. My parents knew how controversy, this movie was, at the time, but they understood, that behind the foul-language and low brow humor, there was some intellectually insightful satire view into modern society. After all, the movie is self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrence and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie. I'm not saying, that children should see this movie. It's really up to your call. I just saying, as parents, you should allow your children, some freedom to make their decisions, than acting too much of authoritarian. After all, hearing people swear is, part of growing up in the modern age. You just have to teach them, why certain words are not welcome for general use, and try to guide them into making more moral judgement calls. It's call parenting. I'm not even saying, my parents were even permissive. There were plenty of other extreme movies with sex & violence, I wasn't allowed to watch, until I was, way older. In the end, this movie didn't really turn me into a foul-mouthed psychopath. It just broader my intellectual development even larger. Another thing that was brilliant about this movie is how it's advocates against censorship, and better parenting. In many ways, the plot for this movie is very similar to the sixth episode of the first season of South Park, in which Death comes to South Park, after the parents of South Park protest against the foul language use in a local TV Station. However, unlike 'Death', this movie use the execution of Terrance (Voiced by Matt Stone) and Phillip (Voiced by Trey Parker) as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse; causing Satan (Voiced by Trey Parker) to return to Earth. In addition to the Canadian Duo, that episode also introduced recurring characters Kyle's mother. (Voiced by Mary Kay Bergman) that would played a big role in this film by blaming Canada for the children use of language, rather than themselves. Much of the plot, is also a homage to the 1993's 'Beavis and Butt-Head' controversy where a little boy set his trailer on fire which killed his little sister on accident. Instead, of blaming the boy, his mother of course blamed the MTV animation show. In the movie, Kenny (Voiced by Beavis and Butthead creator, Mike Judge) is use in very fashion, showing how much people are unwilling to accept responsibility for their actions, and would rather look for scapegoats within the media, government, religion, and culture, as a way to solve their problem. Because of that, it point out the absurdities that both extreme sides of a social issue cling to, so well. It is Meta Humor use at its best and funniest. Another great thing about this film is the use of a lot of subversive, profanity-laced musical songs. All written by co-creator Trey Parker and Hollywood composer Marc Shaiman that ripped off and spoofed traditional theatrical musicals such as 1955's 'Oklahoma', 1961's 'West Side Story', 1965's 'Sound of Music', 1989's 'Little Mermaid', and of course, 1998's 'Les Miserables'. Songs like 'Mountain Town', 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?', 'La resistance' and others, became a house-hold names, because, how memorable, the lyrics and tone were. Even songs like 'Blame Canada' was nominated for an Oscar, for best original song. Because of this film success in the music department, the creators of this movie were able to make the fame Broadway musical, 'The Book of Mormon', years later, with also got great praise. The voice acting is also pretty good in this film, with most of the original cast reprising their roles. I even love all the celebrity voice cameos like George Clooney, Eric Idle and Minnie Driver that came to lend a hand, during production. The visuals are not that bad, as well. Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut still looks great. Overall: What Would Brian Boitano Do? He would probably go see this movie. So check it out! It's one hell of a film.",8,3,4,22 April 2016
Ted," This movie and me are Thunder Buddies for Life
","In his theatrical debut, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane makes his big leap from television with Ted. Always pushing the boundaries with his own style of humor, the movie Ted is truly downright hilarious. As the director, producer, co-writer, and voice artist behind the title character, MacFarlane makes offensive laughs on pop culture, drug culture, religion, sex, bodily functions, and all things '80s. Yes, there are extremely foul language, some racism comments, and some homophobic jokes, but I wouldn't say it was really crude enough for the audience to hate the characters. It's pretty tame compare to the television shows that Seth MacFarlane created such as American Dad and Cleveland Show. Some of the jokes do fall flat in my opinion. Example: 'The Airplane!' type scene. Why make fun of a parody that makes fun of another movie and don't add anything to it. John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is an adult who still lives with his childhood Teddy Bear (Seth MacFarlane) who came in life when John's childlike wish came true. John still acts like a child with Ted despite the fact that his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) wanting him to be more mature. I thought Mark Wahlberg did a good job as the movie's likable goof. As the movie go on, John must choice a successful life with Lori, or a life full of fun with Ted. While the same time, John stands to lose it all, with Lori's sleazy boss, Rex (Joel McHale) trying to hook up with her and Ted's crazed fan Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) wanting to kidnap him for his son. All the actors did a wonderful job in their roles. I have to say, that Joel McHale was good at being a funny scum ball role. Giovanni Ribisi was just creepy in his role as Donny. The scene with him dancing to Tiffany's 'We are alone now' is disturbing. About the plot, I give it a B. The story is your usual rambling Seth McFarlane script with lots of cultural references that makes sense or doesn't add anything to the story. I love the running gag about Ted & Jon being huge fans of 1980's movie Flash Gordon. There was even a cameo by the main actor from the movie, Sam Jones. There is a lot of cameos from MacFarlane's cartoons shows playing supporting characters as well. I love Patrick Warburton as guy. I don't get what the guy is saying, but it's funny. The animation on the film was great, as the CGI bear look life like. One thing is that if you do decide to watch the Unrated Version, it's doesn't give you anything new, but lame jokes that deserve to be cut. So don't watch the unrated version, unless you have to. Like the title suggests, this is an R-rated film. This film isn't for small children. I think most teenagers probably heard or saw this movie already. Most of young teens would have heard this kind of language and dialogue at school or college, but still it's shouldn't be watch with any children, not mature or adult like to watch. Don't take the movie too serious, just enjoy.",7,4,7,16 April 2013
Oldboy," Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Old Boys was very interesting!
","This South Korean mystery thriller neo-noir film is like a hammer. It always manage to hit the nail on the head. Directed by Park Chan-wook, and loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by 2002's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by 2005's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film follows the story of a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), who is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of lies, conspiracy and violence. With the help of a female Japanese chef named Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang) and one of his old computer friends, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji), Dae-su must find a way to piece together the scattered clues of who took his life away from him, while cutting down anyone who gets in his path. Without spoiling the movie too much, this film has a lot of twist and turns, that will keep the viewer, interested in the story. The movie is an extreme art-house film, often using tropes taken from previous psychological movies such as 1929's Un Chien Andalou (1929) & 1966's Persona. The film also has several parallels to classic stories such as William Shakespeare's to Titus Andronicus & French author Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The most famous one is the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex. Other works, like Ella Wheeler Wilcox's famous poem, 'Solitude', played a big part in this film. 'The Man of Sorrow' by Belgium painter James Ensor gave the movie, some depth with it looks. Classical music gave the movie, its ears. 'The Last Waltz' by Frédéric François Chopin, and the first movement of Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons: Winter' are certainly used the best. The rest of the entire soundtrack is a work of genius. Not only does every title clearly applies to the events seen in the film when the track is played, but every track is takes their name after a famous film noir film. The acting is excellent for the most part. Min-sik Choi really put a lot of work, into this film. Not only did, he nailed it, with the emotional side, he trained for six weeks and lost twenty pounds to get in shape for the role of Dae-su, and did most of his own stunt work. If that wasn't extreme, enough, he ate four real life live octopodes as Dae-su in the sushi bar scene. While, it did provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. I saw nothing wrong with it, as long as he ate all of them. That scene was used, to represent, Dae-su hatred toward his enemies and I think Min-sik Choi capture that. Supporting character, Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee was great at being sinister, while being realistic. Director Quentin Tarantino was at the screening and was shocked to find himself crying for a character who had been completely despicable for the prior duration of the movie. That's how much, Ji-tae Yu got people to invest in the character. The only weak acting in the film, had to be Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do. I really didn't like her damsel in distress, manic pixie dream girl role. Still, this was a very powerful film. The movie was shot, superb. Great use of mirrors, as a symbolism of fragmentation of one self. I like how everybody is looking at another person, through a mirror. I like how shots of Woo-jin Lee, show how much omnipotent by wealth, he is. I like how Dae-su is shown as the common man. Getting back at the society, by hammer. It remind me of socialism ideas pitting against that of capitalism. Still, the most well-known shot had to be, the lengthy scene in which Oh Dae-su takes on over a dozen men armed with just a hammer. Given that the scene is nearly 5 minutes long, and is all filmed on one camera, in one take. The fight sequence took three days, worth of attempts to nail it. The violence in this film wasn't as violent, as some critics made it out to be. The torture wasn't too in- depth, as the camera cuts away, when things become way too gory. I found the violent to, pretty tame for a Rated R film. The story matter is indeed shocking. The whole twist toward the end is a gut-wrenching and sick. The movie ends with a gloomy ambiguous ending. While, some people might see this as a fault; I see it as thought provoking. While Dae-su is let out of captivity, he can only free himself, by finding out why he was imprisoned. Dae-su takes on many aspects of an Ubermensch on finding the truth, but ultimately his character has no control of his own fate and plays into his enemies' hands. By the end of the movie he is a very, very broken man. It's a great example of why human decisions are meaningless and choice is an illusion. One of the most important themes of Old Boy is the truth. Sometimes, the truth doesn't set you free. The only thing, that I can see as a fault of the film is how some scenes were very confusing. One of the biggest mistake, you can make, is watching it, with the English dubbing. It's horrible. It doesn't match with the lips on the screen at all. Unfortunately, you will lose a lot of Korean language drastically changed over those fifteen years, with it. You should watch it with English subtitle, instead. This movie help influence a Bollywood remakes in 2005 & an American remake in 2013. Overall: This dark Oedipian tragedy is somewhat enlightening. Drop the hammer, and give this a watch! You will not be disappointed.",8,8,10,16 July 2015
127 Hours," Give James Franco and 127 Hours a hand! They did a great job!
","One thing that Director Danny Boyle got right in this film is how close they film the movie based on Aron Ralston's memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place. The film stars James Franco as real-life adventurer Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a fallen boulder that crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon in Blue John Canyon, Utah. The cinematography of the desert was beautiful shot. I like how Boyle convey the vastness of the canyon and the area of Aron get entombed. I was kinda one of the people that didn't really watched to see this, but after seeing the reviews. I went to see this on my own. I was pretty blown away. I kinda like James Franco in this movie, he was very charming in this movie, unlike his roles in Spiderman. It's probably his best role since Pineapple Express. It was a great start, by 20 minutes in the film, besides meeting the girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tambyln). You pretty much just have James Franco stuck on a rock. Most of the scenes Aron shares with them is pretty much pointless. In my opinion, you can pretty much skip 20 minutes until he get his hand stuck and you wouldn't miss much. So James Franco's Aron Ralston had to be a likable character in this for it to work. The one thing, I found funny is how loose that rock look. He pretty much, did a dumbass move, by getting stuck like that in my opinion. Anyways, days pass, and you see flashbacks from his life. The good thing about this movie is that he didn't really had a bad life, unlike most of the movie's survivor characters I watch. The film introduces us to Aron's father (Treat Williams) and mother (Kate Burton) and the love of his life, Rana (Clemence Poesy) through brief flashback. These moments, though brief, helps to give us insight into Aron's character and life. At times it was hard to know what the flashbacks were referring to. I recommend reading the book or getting the book on tape to get a great account if the story first, before watching this. His mind is running, while he is not. It was just him, trying to get away from the pain of being trapped. He gets crazy, and acts funny at times without moving. I love the idea of him trying to keep sane, by acting like he has a TV Show at the abandoned canyon. I like how strong and smart, he can be, despite being a bit of an idiot. There is no force more powerful than the will to live. I love the Gatorade scene as well. I never though Scooby Doo can be use so creepy. The dream sequences are very haunting and well done. Without spoiling the ending, there is a scene where Aron must act upon to save himself. That scene is both realistic and gruesome, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene. It's a bit predictable, if you saw the trailers for the film or hear the movie. Most people know what happens to Aron Ralston, there. It can be a bit long, and drawn out. It would probably work better as a good documentary with scenes of Aron's family talking about him with the movie style reenactment. Still, I like the movie to have more description of Aron's efforts trying to get out of the desert. Overall, I like the movie. It's an inspiring tale of the strength of the human spirit. So check it out, and see how one man cheated death.",8,3,5,25 April 2013
Batman Returns," For all its problems, Batman Returns is still an awesome Batman film.
","I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.",6,3,5,23 May 2013
Creed," Michael B. Jordan shows that he has the eye of the tiger in this Rocky spin-off. Creed is a hit. It really does go, the distance.
","This inspirational, action-packed, emotional driven, underdog story was a 1st round, solid knock-out! Written and directed by Ryan Coogler of 2013's Fruitvale Station fame. The movie tells the story of Adonis Johnson Creed (Michael B. Jordan), a young man with a trouble past, trying to forge a career of his own as a boxer. Intent on becoming more, he eventually travels to Philadelphia to seek out his father's old rival/friend, ex-boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and convince him to become his trainer. Can, the illegitimate son of a famous late world champion boxer, make a name for himself, or will Adonis Johnson Creed, forever live, under the shadows of his father's legacy? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; despite, the fact that this movie is a Rocky spin-off, it still follows the same guidelines as any of the previous Rocky franchise films. (1976 to 2006). All the familiar schmaltzy tropes are there in this film, from the small touches of the iconic theme song, the training montage, and the clever shout outs film references. While, this makes this movie, somewhat of a predictable rethread; there still something to say, about Creed. It also gives something new to the table and doesn't feel like an accessory to Rocky films. Yes, it's true, that all the nostalgia Rocky mentions, are the reasons, why I went to see this film, in the first place, but even, if you take away, all of that. This film would still stand out as a really great film, after seeing it. There is plenty of new things, worth noticing about. I love how the new music by composer, Ludwig Göransson sounds so much more epic than any of the Rocky soundtracks combined. Despite, not being a huge rap fan, the hip-hop touch to the film, was indeed something new to the franchise and wasn't as annoying as I thought, it was going to be. The way, this movie shot, its fight choreography is amazing. It looks a like more realistic, brutal & grounded, rather than older cartoony style of the last series of films. I love how the movie shows the fighter's fighting stats, before each fight. It really shows the pressure that Adonis is getting himself, into. In my opinion, this film doesn't feel like it's ripping off, any of the previous films. It's more, like it's changing how fighting movies are made. Fighting against the established fighting tropes, the movie shows a more complicated side of the main character. Unlike Rocky Balboa who came from poverty to become somebody. Adonis Creed has always been successful, but wants to have something more than his normal 9-5 white-collar job. He wants to do something, some people don't try. Go for his dreams. This make him, so much more relatable, than Rocky; whom chose to do boxing, because that's what he felt, he was only good at. While, Adonis has a chip on his shoulder about being Apollo's son and has demons to silence. He's well-intentioned, kind, and determined to succeed. In my opinion, Michael B. Jordan really does turn in, an outstanding performance, showing great details of Adonis's struggles of trying to figure out, who he really is. Yes, it does mean that, we don't get to know him as deeply as we did Rocky, but for me, in a personal level, I found the scenes with Adonis to be engaging. While, his relationship with singer-songwriter, Bianca (Tessa Thompson) was a bit underwhelming. I wish Bianca was given, a little more depth. She seem to be missing, a lot of it, compare to other boxing films, love interests. However, I did like how the character was hearing-impaired. I wish, the movie would explore that, a little bit more. I also like how, both Adonis and Bianca, were able to connect. I really did buy into their relationship. Tessa Thompson does well in her limited role. Still, by far, the best relationship within the film is that, of Adonis and his trainer, Rocky. The scenes between Rocky and Adonis are one of the highlights of the movie. Both characters have very good chemistry, and feels so much, more real than 1990's Rocky V's trainer & trainee, concept. Watching the two men size each other up, figuring out what the other is made of, was enjoyable in this film. Rocky V, not so much. The sub-plot of Rocky trying to figure out, what to live for, after losing so much, in his life, is emotional tearful in this film. When Balboa makes his first appearance, it's hard not to root for him. We've known this character for years, and there's something fundamentally appealing about him. Rocky may no longer be an unrelenting fighter in the ring, but he's still the same generous, big-hearted, and humble guy that we love from the previous movies. Stallone is outstanding in this. Great acting from him. I hope he get nominated for an Oscar. He deserve one. The only problem, I had against Rocky's story is how their absence, Rocky's son, Robert from the film. I really didn't like, how he was mention in a throwaway line. I can understand, why they omitted his character, so they can show, how physical deterioration, Rocky has become, but come on! At least, they come had put Robert toward the end. Overall: While, Creed is full of Rocky references. It's not a cash grab type film. The story is driven forward by Creed and him, himself. Made with a lot of love, the film tells the dangers of boxing, while also showing the positive and negative effects of the champions, willing to make a living out of this sport. Films like this, show that it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard, you can get hit and keep moving forward; because of that, Creed is a must watch film.",9,3,7,6 December 2015
The Others," This supernatural gothic horror film is otherworldly indeed. It's one very creepy movie.
","Set on the British Island of Jersey in the immediate aftermath of WWII, the film written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar follows the story of housewife/mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), being haunted by spirits wanting them to leave. Without spoiling the movie too much, for a film rated PG-13 and not a drop of blood or graphic gore in it. It's scary! It works because how well made the motion picture was. All the camera shots portray the dark picturesque decaying creepy astrosphere with melodramatic psychology fear to a tee. For example the opening title shots with the hand drawn drawing of a house fading into an actual home through an excellent use of transition made it seem like a ghost story was coming to light. While the overall atmosphere of clichés fog and haze does go overboard at times in the film; it does set a mysterious mood to the settlings. Adding to this, the voyeuristic wide shot taken from outside looking in the house through the pane of glass are very powerful. It shows the isolation of the trapped characters to the point that it's very effecting unsettling. I also like how most of the film takes place within dark rooms and dim hallways with flames of candles in lanterns as the only source of light due to the children's photosensitivity sickness. It create a more shadowy feel to the film, creating disoriented and uneasy psychological state within the viewers on what they're seeing and not seeing. A good example of this is the puppet scene. However some of the significant use of mirrors and reflections shots throughout the film don't really go anywhere. You would think it would play both more conscious and subconscious in the character's mind, but its themes are avert for the most part. As for sound. The disembodied voices, strange noises and intense musical music can lead the viewers to believe that something frightening is about to happen, yet, most of the big scares come at the moment where it's quite quiet with not much going on the screen. The film cleverly tricks your senses. Thus making scenes like the piano room jolts hardly predictable. I glad that the movie doesn't really indulge on too many in your face jump scares. The old school approach of not showing much is ambiguous. It's the fear of the unknown that really scare people. As for pacing. The film works best as a slow burn thriller with its runtime. While this might cause some parts of the movie to seem boring with certain amount of static shots, little action & heavy exposition dumps. In the end it does works to build up the tension to the climatic 1999 film 'Six Sense' gotcha type twist ending. Because of that, the movie has a lot of repeat value as there is plenty of clever hints and Easter eggs that lead to that the revelation of the terrible secret besides the gravesites and the oddly out of place post mortem photograph album with the servants like Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). Some examples are the way Grace first picks up the rifle. She's seen looking at the item as it was déjà vu. Another is her frequently complaining about migraines. Even her children peculiarly heavy breathing foreshadows the end. To add onto that, Grace's religious fundamentalism makes a lot of sense when you consider that she interpreted her and her children allegedly continuing to survive after the war as a miracle of God. No wonder why she got super religionist and try to 'live' up to her given name to the point that she berates Anne for questioning what she's been taught by her, and uses biblical stories like limbo to frighten and manipulate her daughter. Kidman was very convincing as the prudish, over-bearing mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world. While her character can be a bit cold & unlikeable. There were some lovely heartfelt motherly love scenes between Grace's psychotic episodes for us not to turn off the movie. As for the children. The acting is a mixed bag. The girl that play Anne was pretty decent in the role, however, I felt that the kid playing Nicholas was below average in certain parts. It didn't help that the lines coming from them felt a little too posh and thick for my taste. They didn't sound like real kids from that era. More like children of pre-WW1. As for the supporting cast. It was alright for the most part, but if the film has any big fault. I really didn't find Christopher Eccleston's role as Charlie that appealing. I felt that his premise didn't really add much to the plot. Plus his character return didn't make much sense with the story that they were telling; much in the same way, a bunch of photographs of corpses posing for portraits can end up in a storing room in a house or a living person can possessed a dead person. Nevertheless, I do dig the some of the audience member's interpretation on the reasons about Grace's pariah state. It really does seem like she might had collaborated with the enemy during the war. Certain scenes points to that being the cause of her madness. No wonder why she didn't want her children to stray too far from Christ. Although, Grace has a strong connect with the lord. The film does takes direct ideological aim at Christian theology. Undermines faith and biblical doctrine calling them dangerous fabrications to the point that some people might find the movie blasphemous. Amenábar really didn't like Catholic school. Regardless of that, overall while this morbidly fascinating movie is probably not going to lift your spirits with its depressing ending & make your love life with your significant other better. It's still otherwise, a very good movie worth checking out. One far from being dead.",8,4,4,6 November 2019
Just Go with It," This movie is awful! I can't go with it.
","I can't believe, this 2011 comedy written by screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling, is a loosely based remake of the 1969 film 'Cactus Flower'. Nor could I imagine; that this was also an adaptation of an earlier successful, Broadway and French stage play of the same name. It was truly a less than stellar motion picture. Directed by Dennis Dugan, the film tells the story of Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) trying to fool his much younger fiancée, Palmer Dodge (Brooklyn Decker) into believing that he is divorcing a make believe pretend wife, Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), when Palmer sees his fake wedding ring, during their first date. Without spoiling this Happy Madison Production movie too much, I can see the original writer Abe Burrows spinning in his grave. Why? It's because this remake was not funny. None of the crass, juvenile toilet humor, including jokes at the expense of the overweight or physically imperfect, landed for me. It didn't help that Sandler slept through this movie. Don't get me wrong, Adam does have some talent. He did displayed some depth and emotional range before. However, Sandler in this film, look like he could care less if this flick was a success or not. He put nearly no effort in his role, going back to his usual shtick, performing as the angry man child. Because of this, Danny comes across as very annoying, tiresome and unlikeable. It doesn't help that the character is a chauvinist pig for the most part, lying to women and being a jerk to others, due to one lady making fun of him in the past. Look, I'm willing to ignore and forgive the romantic lead for lying to the love interest in order to win her heart like the original movie, but lying for years upon years to multiple ladies and painting himself as a victim of domestic abuse is downright disturbing and wrong. I have no amount of sympathy for a guy that spends two decades manipulating women to become home wreckers, in order to sleep with them. Talk about being highly misogynist. So, it was really hard for us to overlook Danny's past events and root for him, even if he has a character arc, from debauch bachelor to semi good, family man. Also, as a rich plastic surgeon, he still broke multiple Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules, by discussing patient information to his friends. That's not good. As for Aniston's character, the same can go with her. I hate that Katherine knew about his womanizing from the beginning, and didn't do anything to stop it for years. It made me miss so much, the original 1969 character played by actress Ingrid Bergman. I like that she had no clue of the scheme at first. It made her seem so innocent. Plus, I like how her character was somewhat dowdy. So, it was nice to see her bloom into an attractive woman in the end of that film, rather than being already generically sexy like Katherine during this movie. Despite, the lackluster and plain performance from Aniston. She still lightyears better than Brooklyn Decker's so call acting. Besides her good looks, the model turn actress's character is so lifeless, bland and dull. When you compare Palmer to the heavily flaw free spirited original character played by Golden Hawn in the first movie. It's no match. Hawn's flower child performance, wins all the time. Decker's character is just that forgettable. Although, the main cast were below average, the supporting performers were a little bit better. I kinda love Nicole Kidman as Delvin Adams. The scene with her and Katherine dancing in a contest was somewhat funny, but very hot. She was very entertaining. As for Nick Swardson, I do dig him as the over the top cartoony character of Dolph Lundgren. The surreal dialogue given to him while highly unrealistic, is so out there bizarre, that I can't help laughing, even with the scene of him drowning Palmer to keep up with the deception. I also have to give props to musician Dave Matthews. His delivery of comedic lines are top notch. Who knew that he can act! Honestly, the only supporting characters, I didn't like, were the kids. They were a little too precocious & so very annoying. No wonder, why Danny told Palmer that those fake kids of his, has been killed in a tragic accident, after throwing one of them into the mud. Nobody really liked them not even their mother Katherine. Not only that, the whole Hawaii vacation idea that the children came out with is really stretching the logistic of the plot, very thin. I find it very unlikely, that anybody in real life would spent millions of dollars of lying material, just to get a woman he barely knows to engage with him within a week. The whole plan seem unrealistic, very rushed and last, but not least, highly superficial. Honestly, there is no reason for any of this charade as Danny couldn't even marry Palmer if he wanted to. Why? It's because he didn't divorce his fake wife yet. No wedding ceremony would even allow this. Even if this could happen. The film wouldn't show it. Oddly, all the dumping was done, off screen. What a disappointing cheap cop out! While, the film didn't showcases that, it was kind enough to show us, plenty of product placement advertisement for Pizza Hut and hotels in Hawaii. Because of this, the movie felt more like a travel brochure than anything else. It's not good. Overall: Just watch the 1969 version of this film. It's so much better than its offspring, any day. That's for sure.",5,10,16,17 March 2019
Brokeback Mountain," I wish I can quit you, movie, but you're just so good to watch.
","I don't see it as a gay or bisexual cowboy movie directed by Ang Lee. I see it as just a romantic movie. For a movie based on bisexual or homosexual love, it's pretty tame compare to the other LBGT movies. The characters don't play on the gay stereotypes, nor does it feed like aggression pro gay marriage movement agenda film. It was suppose to be a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making any money, but it grew to become of the best romantic movies of the year. The reasons why is the characters and story. In 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through the summer in Wyoming at a place call Brokeback Mountain. Soon after months being up there, the loneliness kicks in, Jack makes a sexual pass at Ennis, who is initially apprehensive but then succumbs to Jack's advances. Jack's characteristic seems more interested in sex & lust than Ennis. Jack had a history of affairs and sex with prostitutes. Jack then to borderline sex predator at times and more of aggressor of the relationship. Ennis has a clandestine personality. Heath doesn't need to say much to embody the inhibition, inarticulateness character Ennis Del Mar. His character is the key dimensions of this story about gay characters who must keep their sexual preferences hidden in a repressive society. Ledger's subtle facial expressions alternately conceal or reveal his deeper feelings without resorting to words, for he is living a secret. Those depths come out in his facial expressions and body language: dialogue written by screenwriter Diana Ossana & Larry McMurtry helped Ennis restrain his deepest feeling than to verbalize them. Ennie warns Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, and each is bloodied. After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his longtime girlfriend Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and fathers two children. Jack meets, marries and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Midwhile, both Ennis and Jack continue to meet each other for infrequent fishing trips. The script and the direction kept a low profile about the events and the characters involved and their lives, so making the underground pain even more explodeable. No much drama exhibition, thus no 'melodramatic' show off, just life, as it would really be under these circumstances. A film almost 'neorealistic' and therefore painfully touching for the ones who know what living with hidden feelings really means. The ending is one of the saddest pieces I ever witness. Ang's perfection in directing with a style of 'less is more' causes this movie to seep deep inside of you and it haunts you for days/weeks after wards. While people quote it as a epic Western, I really don't think it's a Western due to two reasons: the story's periodic time isn't 19th to early 20th century, and modernization of the piece. Brokeback Mountain also has one of the best theme song by Gustavo Santaolalla 'The Wings'. Gorgeous and heart warming song that injects an overdose of emotions. Check out the movie. It's not a story of gay love. It's a story of love.",8,5,5,18 November 2012
Chicken Run," You'll believe chicken can fly, once you watch Chicken Run! Chicken Run is awesome!
","Being a huge fan of Wallace & Gromit film series & old school WWII Prison films like 1963's 'Great Escape' & 1953's 'Stalag 17', I was really looking forward to this movie, when it came out. It had a unique look to it, with its stop motion clay animation style. Directed by Nick Park & Peter Lord, and animated by Aardman Animations as the studio's first feature-length film; Chicken Run tells the story of a band of chickens lead by Ginger (Voiced by Julia Sawalha) trying to escape from certain death, when the owners of their farm, Mr. & Mrs. Tweedy (Voiced by Tony Haygarth & Miranda Richardson) decide to move from selling eggs to selling chicken pot pies. Can the smooth-talking Rhode Island Red named Rocky (Voiced by Mel Gibson) teach them to fly or will they end up, being the main course when Mrs. Tweedy get her hands on them? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie was amazing that it even got finished. After all, Aardman weren't really sure at first, if they could pull off making clay figure of chickens moving in a set, because how awkward, they might had look, but somehow, they were able to make them look enchantingly believable. For a stop-motion animation film, this is some of the best work, I have saw. It was poultry in motion. The exceptional British voice-acting from the cast add to the unique characters in this film. The chickens are highly individual, completely believable, and wildly funny side characters. My favorite character in the film had to be Babs (Voiced by Jane Horrocks). Her posh-like speaking voice, matches so well with her character, very air-headed and spacy, jumping to strange conclusions and not fully grasping what's going on, behavior. Lots of laughs from her. However, there was a little language barrier with some of the Cockney and Scottish accents from other supporting characters like Mac (Voiced by Lynn Ferguson) & Nick (Voiced by Timothy Spall), that made me, scratching my head, due to them, being hard to understand. For the leads, Mel Gibson really stood out as the cocky American playboy here with the tone of his voice. He was really literally a chick magnet, back then. I also like, how his Australian accent wasn't showing at all. He really did sound like, he was from show business with his Hollywood-like attitude. Still, there was one thing that bug me, about his portrayal. I really, didn't like, that he didn't sound like he was from Rhode Island, in which his character is supposedly from. You would think, the movie would hint at that, a little more. Anyways, while the trailers, make it might seem like Mel Gibson is the main hero, it's Julia Sawalia as Ginger, who really stands out in this film. She really sounds like a woman with a plan. You really sense, the urgency within the tone of her voice. The villains were also well-played by Tony Haygarth & Miranda Richardson. They really do stand out, with their over-paranoia and axe-crazy personality. The humor is a mixed bag for me. There were a lot of moments that really did hit my funny bone, mostly in the British style of slapstick humor; yet some of the dry humor needed some more work. Then, there are some U.K pop-culture references that clearly went over my head, like the spoof sequence from 1951's Ace in the Hole or 1971's And Now for Something Completely Different. It didn't make a lick of sense, to us, Americans, but for the most part, I understood, most of the jokes. Some of the jokes could be a little too complex for children, but for the most part, it works within its means. Despite, being stuck in one-location, the movie is full of action and adventure. I love every minute of it, from escaping pie-making machines to the climatic airplane chase. The music score from Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell really add to the epic scope of these scenes. One scene, that really bug me, was any of the scenes with the rats. I really thought, they would had been cut out. The whole scene where they're debating on, what came first, the chicken or the egg was somewhat annoying and drawn out. It was the only problem, within what might seem, like a very well-paced film. Still, the story was mostly 'alright' category for me. Mainly because the story wasn't really anything new and often full of clichés. The whole third act, 'liar revealed' cliché wasn't really needed with its gloom. Regardless, I'm still glad, that Nick Park and Peter Ford cut some of the darker sequences from the film such as like; Fowler (Voiced by Benjamin Whitrow) being an abusive alcoholic & a chicken eaten by the watchdogs in an escape attempt. That would be way too grim for a children film. Overall: I like this, incredibly creative, highly detailed, animated film. Memorable characters and a cool prison escape plot, made this, a must-watch. So don't be a chicken, go run and see this movie.",7,4,5,17 December 2015
Orphan," This is what happen if Little Orphan Annie was remade as a horror movie.
","Having seen movies like the Good Son, Omen, and Children of the Corn. I'm clearly a fan of the 'Bad Seed' horror genre. I was really looking forward to this movie. In my opinion, it was pretty decent. The adoption community has a different opinion on it. They felt that the movie will turn away good couples from adopting children from orphanages. The movie got so much heat, that Warner Bros. edited the movie's trailer to remove Esther's line 'It must be hard to love an adopted child as much as your own' after receiving numerous complaints from adoptive parents and foster care organizations. The line remains in the movie itself. I believe that the movie could hurt orphanages, but I also believe people can understand it's just a movie as well. Not all children are like that. The controversial story is about a couple, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) whom are looking to decide to adopt the child. At the local orphanage, they find Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a gifted young Russian girl who loves painting and wearing old fashion dresses. They decide to adopt her, and welcome the child into their home to live with their other two children, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Maxine (Aryana Engineer). After a while, Kate sees a bunch of danger signs in events that show that Esther might not be as perfect angel as she seems to be. Concerned for the safety of her family, Kate tries to get John and others to see past Esther's sweet facade. John is pretty clueless about not seeing the series of alarming events and in denial that Esther was the cause of it. At first, it seems realism to see how John cannot see the fact that Esther might be evil, but after a while, John should have started to have doubts and see through the lies, but no, he is pretty much oblivious closed-minded to everything that happening around him. Come on, writers. Not once, did he think, that Esther had anything wrong with her. It was shocking performance from newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman and she was able to make the audience to really hate her. In real life, Isabelle she is so nice in person but sometimes she still pulls that creepy stare. She was able to make a little girl pretty scary, and chilly. Still, there were some scene that supposed to be creepy that makes it a bit cheesy. I just don't believe in the whole turning on and off the night looking at the painting scene. The other girl, Aryana was just the opposite in her character, very sweet and tragic because all she wanted was a sister. Like her character, Aryana has a Cochlear Implant, which has improved her speech and hearing. She is not deaf, but a mild hearing loss. There was an agent looking for a little blonde headed girl that could sign and she was the perfect candidate! Another child actor that did well is Jimmy Bennett as Daniel. He was a bit annoying at first, but his character got better in the end. Too bad, the movie never explains what happen to his character in the end of the film. The movie seems to fail a lot of explaining. It seems like a lot of scenes were cut out from the movie due to rewrites. The movie never truly explain what happen at the pond, Kate's alcoholism and what happen to Jessica. In my opinion, it should have been more clarify. There were a bit of cliché in this film, like the bully who just like to bully, silly jump scares and the cheesy one liner in the end. The ending line was horrible, the minute the words left her mouth my immediate thought was the movie Ring 2 (2005). This movie seems very influence by 1992 film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle as well, except that here the psycho is not a nanny but a nine year old kid. The part where Esther freaks out in the toilet while her 'parents' are discussing about her with the child psychologist is a direct mirror of Rebecca de Mornay freaking out in the toilet, smashing things up. About the doctors, when Esther gets the cast on her arm, you'd think the doctors would notice the scars on her wrist. It has enough Grand Guignol moments and scenes of sheer terror to make a quick killing at the box office even though it borrows from just about every other Bad Seed flick Hollywood has ever unleashed. Producer Leonardo DiCaprio also gave us a film that twist ending comes out of left field. It's a wonderful horror however, the twist is far too ridiculous to be taken seriously. There is also a Alternate ending to the film to check out. The Orphan brings a fresh and strong balance of dark humor, thrills, and storyline. However, some parts would work better if the movie was more spread out. If you like this movie, also check out the orphanage (2007). Altogether, it's a good watch.",7,3,5,12 April 2013
Home Alone," Home Alone watching Home Alone
","John Hughe's 1990 classic story, 'Home Alone' directed by Chris Columbus -- Not only did this slapstick family comedy single-handedly launch the career of it's childhood star Macaulay Culkin, it also holds the distinction of being one of the highest grossing Christmas film of all time with over 475 million in box office revenue worldwide. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy, frustrated with his family, who wishes he didn't have one. We as the audiences don't blame him, as most of the family member's really do treat him horrible: mostly the Uncle and brother Buzz. The family is made out of mother Catherine O'Hara, father John Heard, Devin Ratray and Roberts Blossom in other family roles. When he wakes up on Christmas morning the next day, he discovers he's been accidentally left home alone after his entire family flies to Paris on vacation, and forgets about him. It's does feed the same story as 'It's a Wonderful Life', in a very odd way, when it applies to both the main character and the supporting cast, where both sides wish that the main character never existed and when they are apart they realize they really do love each other and want to be together for Christmas. At first, he's relishing the time with himself. I'm surprise that the pizza guy didn't call the cops in one of Kevin's pranks, but the closing it get to Christmas, the more he miss his family and matured. Matters are complicated when two bumbling burglars attempt to rob the large house Kevin is home alone in played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci known as the Wet Bandits. The two adult idiots quickly get outsmarted by a kid is always fun in a sick demonic way and protected his home. Kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a series of booby traps and tricks. Now, it's a race between time, as the parents rushing home to rejoin Kevin, and the Bandits trying to hurt him. I wonder what would happen if Kevin accidentally kills them. Would he be charge for man slaughter? Parents should still watch the movie, just in case if the movie has way too much violence and swearing in the movie. The characters in the movie are presented as cartoon-like. But the fact remains the actors are real people and not animated images, and the visual effects are done with a very high degree of realism. It's a bit disturbing. That the protagonist is himself a victum of child abuse is a bit disturbing in itself. The violence he inflicts on others is only an acting out of the resentment and rage he fosters towards his parents. So there might be something wrong with Kevin, indeed. Still, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear. I love the planning song. The slapstick might be cruel, but in heart, the movie does have a Christmas theme with the story of Kevin and his snow- shovel carrying neighbor. It's truly a XMAS movie indeed.",7,0,0,5 October 2012
Spotlight," This based on true events, movie deserves all the spotlight, it has been getting. It's a well-made superb film.
","In the midst of the chaos of the first year of the new Millennium, a new editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) hope to shakes things up more at The Boston Globe when he re-assigns the paper's 'Spotlight' team of reporters; Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) to dig up an old story about a local priest. Led by editor, Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team uncover more than one story, but a massive child molestation scandal within the city's Catholic Churches that would bring the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight. Directed & co-written by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight is able to show the power of investigative journalism, and how a small group of journalists were able to take on, a large social entity. Because of that premise alone, the movie kinda remind me, a little bit of 1976's film, All the President's Men with its all-star cast. The main actors that make up, this small group are amazing. Each one of them, really did shine, but if I had to pick, two, it would be Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Both really put, most of their emotional weight in this film. There are also strong supporting characters in this movie that it makes many of the minor scenes, very appealing to watch, but if I had to showcase some, I would pick character actors like Stanley Tucci & Billy Crudup. The reason why, I felt they were awesome in their small roles, is because they really did seem like lawyers with hidden agenda to the best degree. Its characters like them that made the film, so engaging. Because of that, the film feels like it hardly has any slow and tedious moments. But if I had to pick a slow moment, it would be any scene dealing with Boston College High School. I found those scenes to be, a bit too controversy and turn-offish to be, worth watching. Still, for the most part, I love how the film delicately balances its focus on giving the story somewhat room to breathe and the survivors their voice. The music by Howard Shore add to it, with its tone of feeling of disgust with a mix of hope. However, some parts of the film, can be a bit confusing with the limited exposition and somewhat rushed, due to the quick pacing. A good example for me, is how I got confused, between dialogue talking about Cardinal Bernard Francis Law (Len Cariou) and that of, Canon Laws. I really didn't know, who or what, they were talking about. There are plenty of dialogue full scenes like that, where a few names, local places, judicial process, and historic events are said by characters that might go over many moviegoer's head. While, I found the movie, somewhat engaging because of the dialogue, I think a little research on the subject matter, beforehand, would help, make sense of it, for the viewer, when watching this film. But if you can't find time to do that, and you going to watch this movie, pay close attention to ever detail in this film because there will be stacks, and stacks of information that your mind has to wrap around. The astrosphere for the film was also great. You really get that feeling, of change, going around. You really do sense, the end of newspaper business with this film with how outdated, some of their methods are. I just love, the details of seeing tons and tons of papers folders, scatter around the office and the journalist calling from, flip phones. It shows the industry in its last hurrah, before getting crush under the weight of online v-blogs, interactive media, & conversation threading. Small talks in the film about how the internet will change, how journalism is run, is amazing to hear. The same with the church; you really get the sense, that social institutions like that, are losing its control on the people. Just ask any Christian today, and you will see more and more people are not as devout, as they use to be. A lot of strong Christians, are even lapsing or questioning, what does it means to a man or woman of the faith. As more and more information is available through the internet, it's easier to see the hypocrisy that Church for so long, try to hide. Indeed, this is the informative age. For the most part this movie is very accuracy to the events that came to be. While, researching for this review, I couldn't find much to couther this. Overall: While, this movie is a bit predictable, much of film's massive appeal, go primarily to the stellar cast, and the screenwriter Josh Singer, who approached the subject matter with palpable and empathy, care. While the movie is Rated R for some language including sexual references, Spotlight is surprising, not that overly graphic. You don't see, any graphic sex scenes, here, just adults talking about how, when they were children, they got molested. It wasn't too much of a turn-off. In the end, while Spotlight isn't for everybody; it's a film worth watching if you get the chance to. After all, horrible things like child molestation must stop.",9,3,5,16 January 2016
Aquaman," Aquaman indeed made a splash with some viewers. Me not so much. It was just fine.
","Packed to the gills with over the top cartoony action, clever nods to other pop works and hilarious comedy. This Warner Bros motion picture directed by James Wan, was the first DC live action movie in a long time to go with a lighter tone. Set in their extended universe, this fish out of water hero's journey story of a humanoid merman, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) being reintroduce to his culture's origins in order to reclaim his birthright before his half-brother Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) takes the throne & seek revenge on the surface world, was entertaining. Without spoiling the movie too much. Brooding, over serious, and somber doesn't fit Aquaman at all. They made the right decision of tone, even if the actor's edgy badass presence doesn't fit well with the wholesome colorful silver age look. Nevertheless, I did like Momoa's surf bro style of acting. I just wish, the movie didn't make Arthur seem so much of airhead. After all, he's supposed to be a wise king that care for his kingdom. In this movie, he rarely thinks, or try to embrace with his people. All he wants to gain the people's trust is to find a silly lost McGuffin. While, the treasure hunting subplot is fun. It's still a bit odd, that his people who barely knows anything about him, would make Curry, their king, after he kill hundreds of them, just because he now holds a legendary trident. As for the other leader, the one they knew. He got off the hook, a little too easy as well. He done far worse. Regardless, who is the true leader, this senseless war resulted in large number of deaths & casualties; which this movie, sadly highly glazed over. None of the royals felt bad, about how many Atlanteans were murdered. A little comeuppance or selfless sacrifice would had been justified for both rulers. Maybe, Arthur losing an arm to save them or Ocean Master accidently drowning by his own hands would made the film, a little more satisfied. Plus, it would add more stakes, surprised twist, or innovative concept in a movie's plot that didn't take that much risk. As of right now, the main plot is kinda thin, bland, and generic. It's not adding much of anything new. In truth, I thought the film would had been a little bit better if they stay away from the surface world, as much as possible. Why? Very little of the history of the surface world make sense within the story, they trying to tell. Logically, it's really hard to believe that the Justice League wouldn't had interfered after the tsunamis, even if they were busy. The film did the right decision, by not hanging up too much from the previous movie. The film is already confusing enough, with people not believing Atlantis exist, despite that there has two alien invasions, an goddess running around, and a enchantress attack. Nevertheless, there were a lot of loose ends. The hero's superpowers & physical imperfections are kinda inconsistent & poorly define. This lend to a lot of confusement on what things could harms Curry. A good example of this, is the desert scene. Isn't the lack to expose water, one of Curry's weaknesses? To add onto that, how does he even have tattoos, if he has strong healing ability? Better yet, does his powers, give him a new orange-and-green suit? Things like that don't add up. Even the bizarre reunion with family members recognize each other instantly, despite one of them being a kid the last time was a bit offed. Regardless of the story. The visuals were beautiful even if they look fake and highly disproportionate. Nothing seem like it was physically or scientifically there. They really did overused the computer effects. Need more practical effects sets. CGI was overwhelming. Regardless, I did like how the movie look. It was bright & colorful, rather than the desaturated color palette and pitch black darkness. As for the dialogue. It was a mixed bag. I kinda dig the villain's eco terrorism reasons to fight. I wish the flick explore more of that. Sadly, a lot of the corny exposition given throughout the movie is highly repetitive. The film is full of people reminding each other of things, they should at the very least know already, like the rules of within their society. Then, there are things that are never explained, like what happen to the previous king. In spite of that, I really don't mind most of the casting. Some of the performers playing older parental figures despite being nearly the same age with their costars, whom are acting as their adult children, was fine with me. I found Nicole Kidman & Temuera Morrison working great as the movie's emotional heart piece. As for Amber Heard. I found Mera to enjoyable to watch, despite the controversies surrounding the actress's personal life. I also didn't mind Wilson being here, even if it's a bit jarring to see him in yet another DC movie after 2008s 'Watchmen' & 2015s 'Batman V Superman'. He was fine. As for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. He was good as Black Manta. Hopefully, he has a bigger role next time. Rounding out the cast are Julie Andrews, Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren. They were scene stealers. Trying not to rock the boat, the only acting that I didn't like, were the thespians playing the younger version of Arthur. They had really wooden delivery. Overall: While, this movie did swam up from the depths of the DC Universe and into theaters ending with a mediocrity end credit stinger. Nevertheless, I'm willing to dip into uncharted waters and say, this movie is whale of a time worth watching, even if its story is just a small drop in the ocean that didn't sail smoothly. In the end, it's still worth diving into, my man! At least, once or twice.",7,7,10,23 March 2019
500 Days of Summer," Summertime is here! 500 Days of summer is a bright intelligent movie.
","Directed by Marc Webb, and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, this creative movie follow the 'non-love story' happenings between Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and that of Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) through nonlinear narrative structure, with the story based upon its male protagonist and his memories of a failed relationship. It's so refreshing to see a romance movie from the guy's perspective. The film get a bit confusing at times as it jumps from various days within the 500-day span of Tom and summer's relationship, indicated by an animation that includes the day's number; this summary is a linear version of the events of the film. On the screens where the numbers of the days in the relationship are shown, the coloring and mood of the background art change to reflect the status of the relationship. Good days are brighter and bad days are darker. While, it can be predictable, because in the first frame we get to know they were going to break up, but having the love story relive thought the goods and bad days make the story seem new. It did help that the scene with them together, were a bit enjoyable even if both characters were being childish or rude to each other. Both protagonists were selfish and self-absorbed in their own way that some people may not like. I love Zooey and Joseph acting here, they're great friends in real life since 2001's Manic and they definitely brought that chemistry to the movie. You really thought they could have been in a relationship. I love all the jokes. The penis yelling joke, and living at IKEA joke are my favorite. 'Darling, I don't know how to tell u this but there's a Chinese family in our bathroom' cracks me up. I love the literal parody on an Ingmar Bergman film. Using 1957's The Seventh Seal is brilliant because it's both a reference and fits into the film perfectly! By losing to Cupid, it's a great symbol of the fate of the main character's relationship with Summer. Also great use of 1967's Graduate. While Tom sees true love, others see euphoria to ones showing more ambivalence. Many people interpret the ending to mean that the two ultimately realize how foolhardy their romantic escapade was or, at least, that they, both harbor doubts about the future. I wouldn't say this is a first date movie because of those scenes in 500 Days of Summer. It's really depressing when you think hard about it. If the humor wasn't so funny, I would have thought gees that isn't what I wanted to watch. You want the characters to have a happy ending ever because some people want to escape and believe that. Who goes on a first date to watch a break up movie? Its heart broking, and watching it felt like it. So, for does thinking it's a happy go lucky romantic movie: do warning. At less, the movie ends somewhat in a good note. It's a really odd film. How many romantic comedies movie do you know that have a disclaimer: 'Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you, Jenny Beckman. Bitch'. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance of a real girl who inspired the character Summer. 500 Days of Summer is like a pop song in movie form. I love the great use of music. The scene had an amazing musical sequence after Tom and Summer first spend the night together. As Tom walks to work, he is overjoyed and struts down the street in a grand musical number set to the Hall & Oates song 'You Make My Dreams' and others join his dance is just wonderful. I do like how Marc Webb created a music video as a companion piece to the film, titled 'The Bank Heist'. It features Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt dancing to 'Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?', a song by Deschanel's folk group She & Him that help promote the film. Songs from the Smiths, Simon & Garfunkel also play a great part in the film. 'She's got you high' plays great in the credits. My favorite part of the film is the sequence where the screen is split in half. On one side is Reality. On the other, Expectations. The character Tom is going to a party being thrown by Summer. He is hoping to get back together after the break-up with 'Hero' by Regina Spektor playing in the background. We get to see the same scene played out differently. It's scenes like this that make the movie distinctive. Another unique scene is the documentary interview style about love and having Tom said nothing. That's speaks more than words. You would have thought this movie was directed by Woody Allen. It's so remind me of 1977's Annie Hall with all the fourth wall breaking, and European art house film references. Overall: I quite like this movie if it's has a disappointing ending. The romance genre really isn't as strong as other genres and I think it's because filmmakers are often too self-indulgent in these kinds of films. They make the sappy fantasies that people want to see, not necessarily what they need to see, if that makes any sense. Still, 500 days of Summer is careful to tell you that it is not a love story, which really isn't true. It's was marketed as love story. I do not think it really made sense to have a movie like this because most people go to movies to escape reality, not fact it. This movie is definitely about love, but it's just as much about breaking up and coming to terms with the aftermath. I think what they meant to say is that this film is not a conventional romantic comedy. Still, it's get an A+ in my book.",8,0,0,7 August 2013
Juno," Honest to blog! This coming to age story was pretty adorable for the most part. Still, it did had some few faults.
","The increasing popularity and feasibility of low-budget films over the last 15 years has led to a vast increase in the number of aspiring filmmakers. These are people who have written scripts and who hope to find several million dollars to turn that script into a successful independent film. One of those success stories, is from the writer of 'Juno'. Written by ex-stripper, Diablo Coby, 'Juno' tells the story of a sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) who discovers she is pregnant by her friend and longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Fearing abortion, Juno instead, seek to find a family for her unborn child for them to raise. It's here, where she meets the couple of Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman), who seems like the right people to give her baby up for adoption. However, things started to unravel with the couple, causing Juno to re-examine the relationships in her own life, and wonder if any kind of love can really last a lifetime. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while the 'Teen Pregnancy' angle has been done to death in films, way before this movie came out; this movie was one of the very first films to deliver the 'teen pregnancy' concept in a mature, but meaningful comedy way. Even if foreign movies like Korean films like 2005's 'Jenny, Juno' somewhat did it first. While, this movie wasn't groundbreaking in any means, it still had a quirky story was unique enough to stand out for its calmer, yet gender tone. It's not a film that, that makes teen pregnancy seem like the end all of end all. I guess, the movie knows teenagers are going through a lot, so it doesn't make them, feel even worst about themselves. It really could had been worst, like how they portray these events in 1998's TV Movie 'Fifteen and Pregnant' that comes across, as too preachy, depressing and unpleasant. I like that the parents played by Allison Janney & J.K Simmons. They are the best things about this movie. They weren't over-the-top harsh, and controlling with Juno. They had the right amount of discipline and care for parents dealing with a problem like this. It's nice is to see a cool-headed approach. However, I can't say, the same with Jennifer Gardner and Jason Bateman's characters. I really found their scenes with Juno, way too awkward and creepy. Yes, I know, they were written that way, but I really didn't like the whole 'molesting' angle. This dark subplot really didn't fit with the sunny-side tone of the rest of the film. That scene ain't Etch A Sketch. This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet. I'm still having nightmares about those scenes. Another character, I really didn't like, is Paulie Bleeker. Michael Cera is pretty much, playing himself with this role. He wasn't really that memorable, nor likable. Even Ellen Page as Juno could be a bit annoying at times. Don't get me wrong, Juno does have some really good funny or mature moments, mostly with her parents, but the highly gimmicky and awkwardly dialogue that Diablo Coby wrote for her character and her friend, Leah (Olivia Thirby), can be a bit much for me. I found their silly dialogue, bit unrealistic at times. It was too quirky at times. Plus, some of the slang that Coby use, is somewhat dated, even for 2007. Another problem with screenplay is the fact, that Diablo Cody indicates that the film was meant to be neutral on the subject of pro-choice and pro-life. Yet, it seems to lean to one way. While, I have no problem with its pro-life approach. After all, Juno's namesake is the Roman goddess of, among other things, fertility and childbirth. The protagonist even says that she was named after the goddess. Plus, the fact, that, we wouldn't have a film without Juno's pro-life choice. Still, I want to believe that people should had a choice if they want to a child or not. Anyways, I still think, Coby deserve the best original screenplay award at the Oscars that year, despite my personal beliefs. Another thing, the film could had done, better, is make it seem like Juno was honestly pregnant. Her mother bump did look a bit fake at times. Still, I have to say, director Jason Reitman and his crew did filmed the movie, very well, despite that little nitpick. For the most part, the film was very bright and vibrant. I kinda dig the Wes Andersen's style, Juno title sequence. It stood out, because it transforms real sequences into a sort of cartoon. Names and texts are hand-drawn and are mixed up into the sequence. Background loses its depth and becomes flat. The final effect is really cute, even if a bit out of place! I love the creativity of this sequence. I also like the music that went along with this film. The film's soundtrack, featuring several songs performed by Kimya Dawson in various guises was also amazing. My favorite song is the Moldy Peaches version of 'Anyone Else but You'. It match the visuals so well. Also, it really did sum up what I thought of 2007 independent filmmaking. While, this movie was one of three films in 2007, that had a plot that dealt with a woman face unplanned pregnancy. It's by far, one of the better films; even with the ambiguous odd ending and the fact, Juno somewhat shows disrespect to her elders. I suggest others to watch this movie. So call your friends on your hamburger-shaped phones, and pull up a chair, and check this movie out. Also check out, 2016's 'Tallulah', with a similar plot and some of the same actors. You will like it.",8,4,5,3 August 2016
Concussion," This Hard Hitting drama, indeed left an impact in the Sport World. It was a mind altering movie.
","This motion picture is not your typical sport movie. Instead of focusing on compelling athletes competing in a physical game. This movie based off true events is more about ongoing debate over player safety within the sport of football, and exposing the dark extreme lengths, the oppositions would do in denying the obvious link between a brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and football related head injuries. While the movie written & directed by Peter Landesman tries really hard to tell a good story; it has been criticized for not being truthful to the actual events; such in the case, how the motion picture made up a number of fake adversaries for Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) to fight against. One of them, was the FBI. While, it's true, that the bureau raided Bennet's boss, Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) for corruption; what's untruth, is that it was instructed by officials of the NFL, in order to scare the doctor. In reality, both organizations had little working ties. Even if they did, the case with Cyril has nothing to do with the concussion result; as the raid occurred three months prior to Omalu's publishing his finding. Another misleading information, create by the film was the indication that the doctor & his wife, Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) suffer a miscarriage & were driven out of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, due to the fears over the federal's retaliation. In reality, not only did they not suffer a miscarriage, they rarely got harassment like that. Authenticity, Dr. Bennet and the government has really good relationship with each other, to the point, that the doctor appear in court as a witness for the prosecution & also offer to become the next chief medical examiner for Washington D.C. Choosing not to get into politics, the forensic pathologist turn down the offer, in order to stay within the city to tried to go after Wecht's job. The only reason, why Bennet left Pittsburgh and move to California, was, because he didn't get that job. It has nothing to do with the government, nor the people, he work with. In real-life, Bennet barely had any combative coworker like Daniel Sullivan (Mike O'Malley) at the coroner's office; as he often work, by himself. As for, the other threats, his family got, in the film like from ex-football player, Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). It's also inaccurate. In real life, Duerson did not harm Bennet with mob like death threats. He only discredit the doctor's findings, whenever, he was talking to the public; which was rarely, as he didn't really work for NFL at the time; due to a business venture, in the retail food industry. Indeed, the negative light toward him, was somewhat incorrect & highly exaggerated. Likewise, Dr. Joseph Maroon (Arliss Howard)'s portrayal in the movie is also highly sensationalized. While, it's true that the neurosurgeon did deny any relationship between football concussions and Omalu's findings. In the defense of him, he did more to treat and prevented concussions than anybody, specifically in football, by establishing the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing and discovering 'burning hands' syndrome. In truth, he was no football stooge. He fought against the system; along with executive director, Christopher Nowinski, whom was not even mention in this movie. It's sad, because the Concussion Legacy Foundation played an integral role in discovering brain damage within football players. Sucks that, they were omitted. Another problem with the film is that the players suffering from this brain disease, also doesn't get enough screen time. The film might have worked better, if they did. I really wanted to know, more about their stories & rather than seeing the protagonist fight made up villains. They really drop the ball here. Also, structurally, the movie had really bad pacing. There is no indication of time moving, at all. A good example of this, is the doctor's relationship with his wife. It felt rushed and underdeveloped, as Raw isn't given, much to do, as a performer. Her fairly superficially written character is only there to give moral support. When in truth, Bennet's wife did more; such as help him, document his work, by taking photographs. Also, unlike the movie, Prema did not initially live with Bennet, during her first few months in United States. She live on her own. While, it's true, that she did go to the same church as Bennet. Sparks didn't fly, until they met at a party, later on. Having her live with the doctor from the get go, looks very creepy & odd. It's sad, because, scenes like that, including all the religionist talk, toward dead people made Bennet seem more like African Warlord, 'Joseph Kony' style religionist zealot than a normal stocky American common man of faith. It doesn't help that Smith plays a generalized African accent that sounds over the top & cheesy. It's so unlike the real doctor, whom has a cooler Americanized accent. It's a really odd choice, just like, how Nigerian born, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is playing an American football player. It's doesn't add up. Another problem with the film is the science is not as accuracy as it should had been. While, it's true that CTE and Concussions are brain injuries. They are not the same. Each have very different conditions. A concussion is a suddenly acute brain injury caused by a blow to the head, while CTE is repeated brain trauma cause degeneration over time. Also, not every concussion leads to CTE damage. Nor can, CTE really be all, to blame for the suicides of several former athletes. Let's not forget that, many other factors, outside of football, also led to these tragedies; such mental illness, drug use, bad relationships, numerous lawsuits and financial problems. However, these things are not explore. In the end, while, 'Concussion' didn't tackle the subject matter as good as 2012's documentary, 'Head Games'. This movie still needs to be seen for any sport fan. Just note, it's no touchdown. At least, it's no fumble.",7,11,14,11 October 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," BRRR It's cold out there, but this scientifically-inaccurate movie kinda does warm my heart. I'm cool on seeing this movie, again. I like it.
","Yes, I know, it's a corny movie, but this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. It was entertaining. It's funny that 20th Century Fox invited a group of scientists to preview the film, to test their reactions to the science used in the film. None of the scientists was impressed with what they saw, although most conceded that the movie was enjoyable nonsense and I have to agree with them. If you turn off, your brain, it is fun enough to watch. Directed & co-writer by Roland Emmerich, the global warming plot of the disruption of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation never really made sense to begin with. Not saying, it isn't possible as I still believe global warming does happen; but the changing of climates wouldn't occur, within a window of a few weeks. Unless you count, the orbit of earth, somehow lost control of itself, and send us, across the darkness of cold deep space. Then maybe, the Earth might experience another ice age in a matter of a few days, but that's not what the film is portraying. Instead, the setup for the action packed disaster flick, felt a bit too unrealistic for the preachy force message of environmental to take shape. The film also tackles a clever satire viewpoint on immigration, with Americans escaping illegally to Mexico to avoid the storm, however, it wasn't well delivered, as the film later ruin it, by saying that the United States government negotiated permission for all American survivors to cross over into Mexico and the rest of Latin America in exchange for all Latin American financial debt being forgiven. Huh!? How is exactly would Latin American's debt to the United States and other Western countries still exist after the Northern Hemisphere has been rendered uninhabitable!? Shouldn't the Southern hemisphere been destroy, too, seeing how cities, closer to the equator like Los Angeles and New Delhi were also affect? It seems to me, that the artistic license on science is not only the only one, lost in this film, as geography took a hit. I know, at the time, there were some doubts among the production team about having a major disaster hit New York, especially after 9/11. However, it didn't stop me at the time, from enjoying the visuals of large catastrophic storms destroying cities, even if some of the effects hasn't aged well. Call me, a sicko, but seeing a city level into ruins in a film is interesting to me, in a morbid way. After all, I was a huge fan of the large amount of disasters flicks that the 1990s were producing. Sadly, the real-life effects of natural tragedies such as 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, 2005's Hurricane Katrina, 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and 2012's Hurricane Sandy might had indeed slow down my interest, in seeing these type of films, as parts of it, can be hard to watch, but those events still couldn't stop me, from checking the next new disaster porn, overtime. Even today, nearly a decade, I still can't help myself, from watching this movie, whenever it's on TV. Maybe, one of the reasons, why I like the film so much, is because the likable characters. I love the father and son relationship between Professor Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) & Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal). Gyllenhaal and Quaid are the best things about this film. I like the idea of a father journeying through the endless amount of snow in an attempt to rescue his son. It was very compelling. Even the supporting characters were fine in the roles, they were given even if their acting is sub-par. However, I can do without the subplot of Jack's wife, Lucy (Sela Ward) trying to rescue a sick-kid as I found that, to be, somewhat boring, along with Professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) of the Hedland Climate Research Centre scenes. Still, thank god, they cut all of the subplot of actor Rick Hoffman's character, as it added very little to the plot. Even with that, another reason, why I like this film is the amazing soundtrack by composer, Harald Kloser. It was incredible. It really gave the film's some really needed, epic scope. Another reason, why I like this film is the fact that this this dumb film does have some smart and complex moments that some people might overlook as filler, such as the debate of burning books to survive and if God was going to save them. There is powerful message about irony and aphorism. Hints the title taken from a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche's book, 'the Antichrist'. Also, I love not so clever, criticism of the Bush Administration's policies with that. With that being said. It's hard to deny there is an undertone of camp that accompanies this film. It's up there with 1996's 'Independence Day' as a wonderfully enjoyable terrible movie! Definitely watch this!",7,0,0,9 November 2016
Deadpool 2," Grab some chimichanga and give 'Deadpool 2', a watch! It's worth seeing, despite some flaws!
","Like the 2016 original of the same name, 20th Century Pictures' 'Deadpool 2' is also, an R-Rated pop-culture spitting, raunchy fourth-wall breaking, violent comic book movie that is clearly targeted specifically at older audiences. Expect tons of extremely graphic violence, harsh-language, heavy drug-use and sexual nudity to go around. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and directed by Davie Leitch, the film tells the story of Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), trying to cope after the loss of a love one, by protecting a teen mutant, Russell Collins/Firefist (Julian Dennison), from a time-traveling cybernetic soldier, named Cable (Josh Brolin), whom sworn to eradicate him, before the boy can kill his family in the future. Without spoiling the sequel, too much, if this story sounds like familiar. Then, you're right. The three screenwriters: Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds basically borrowing most of 'Deadpool 2' story elements from far more superior rival action films like 1991's 'Terminator 2' & 2012's 'Looper'. However, they didn't use all the familiar clichÃ©s & tropes, correctly; leaving many mistakes, plot-holes & misdirection. Things like the 'Rule of Empathy' moral message felt like confusing regurgitation half-digested rehash. The movie could had work it better, if the writers took the concept more solemn. You know, show more of the emotional negative burden & pain, Wilson has to go through, when killing people, in order to show Russell that life as a contract killer isn't worth it, rather than showing Wade's selfish doing it to get some tail from his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). That might work. Even better, make Russell seem like he had some likeable innocent that could be lose. For the most part, Dennison's character was highly annoying and nasty. Nothing really worth redeemable. Since the movie didn't do that, the moral ground seem a bit muddle. So, it hurts the overall, emotional sentiment redemptive message about family & sacrifice, very much. For that reason, I found the movie's story to be jarring. After all, the movie makes killing look like a lot of fun & rewarding for the most part. There is even, another scene play off for laughs, where a minor supporting character from the first film, craves for a kill, like a sick psychopath. It's a bit disturbing to see this movie champion his wish; seeing how many vehicle mass-murders, happen in recent years. The moral message in the film seem a bit hypocritical. Another thing that hurts this film is not so serious climax. The mid-credit scenes including the ending felt like a cheesy cop out; a cheap happy go-lucky end that ruin the strong savage, inhumane nihilism ending, it should had. And above else, it doesn't make any sense; as why could Cable turn baby face and use his time machine to save Wade in the first place? It goes against everything that Wade wanted to do, in order to meet up with his wife. Wouldn't Cable rather use that time to revisit his family, instead? It's seem a bit off & odd. However, it could had been much worse, if Leitch kept the Hitler baby-killing post-credit scene. That was indeed too squeamish. Anyways, the ending for this film, didn't have the strength that previous 20th Century comic book movies, like 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' & 2017's 'Logan', had. It was highly disappointing. Also, those films, told the fatherhood & destiny concept way better than this film could ever do, as well. Honestly if you cut it away, all the fan service & jokes, the movie's plot is pretty damn simpleton & generic, rather than unique & original. This movie could had been a little more complex than surface deep. Sadly, the writers couldn't go to the next level. No wonder, why Deadpool in universe, lampshade the story elements as lazy. Despite that, the comedy side of the script bulges with rapid-fire one-liners and pop culture references to just about everything kinda works for the most part, regardless if it feels a bit forced. It's mostly hilarious. Jokes like the unfortunate demise of X-Force were funny. However, some of them, like the shot of Deadpool's vestigial regenerating penis is highly cringe-worthy. It's borderline child pornography. Others jokes like might feel dated, as the years goes on, such as the jabs to other present day comic book movies. Regardless, Reynolds as Deadpool dominates every scene, steamrollering everyone around him. Even returning supporting performers are all firmly pushed to the sidelines. Some of them like T.J Miller get little screen time. Thank goodness, because he is not funny. Plus, the sexual misconduct allegations against him, makes me, hate him, ever more. Glad, he wasn't in the film, much. Nevertheless, it's the new characters that really get to shine. Brolin gave a cold grizzled mysterious presence as Cable, which help the film a bit, since the writers didn't give enough space to establish much of his character's background. Zazie Beetz is also good. She was made Domino, into an interesting character with her demeanor, during her limited presence. Even the surprise cameos were fun to see. I enjoyed every last of them, including the Vanisher cameo & the gigantic CGI villain character voiced by Ryan Reynolds. Another thing that work, was the visual effects. It was improved since the last movie. While, the movie is less gory and crass; the quality of action is also a lot better. It was amazing throughout the film, with the train scene being a highlight. It was particularly witty and well-executed. The music by singer, Celion Dion was also great. 'Ashes' was a beautiful song. Overall: I have to say 'Deadpool 2' was a watchable superhero movie. It's a lot better than the first film, big time. So check it out with maximum effect.",8,4,6,20 June 2018
Spider-Man 3," My spider senses are tingling... yes this movie truly not the most amazing Spiderman movie ever.
","To each its own, for me, I have mixed feelings about Spiderman 3. Yup, that film was quite bad, but it's watchable. If you haven't watch Spiderman or Spiderman 2 (2004), watch those first. After that, try this mediocre film. I felt that it try to cram too much into one film. First off, the movie has three villains. OK, the new Green Goblin (James Franco) makes sense, they set it up at the end of the last movie that Harry Osborn saw his father's weapons and he was out for revenge for what happen in 2002's Spiderman. Harry tries to make Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst)'s life a living hell. Harry Osborn go through some many mood swings in the movie, it's annoying. First, he wants revenge on Peter, then get Amnesia, then happy go lucky with Peter, then back to revenge, and finally back with speaking terms with Peter. Plus, all this could be solve if only Harry's stupid butler told him what happen to his father that night, in the beginning of the movie. It's too much for a character, as there is yet another love triangle between them. Not only that love triangle, but another love triangle between Peter, Mary Jane, and Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). In my opinion, I would take Gwen Stacy over Mary Jane anyways. At least she was not a boring plainest damsel in distress, in contrast to the already annoying helpless Mary Jane. Bryce Dallas Howard is one sexy lady. The next villain is the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is pretty good for his Flint Marko role. In my opinion, he should have more screen time, then he got. The fights were damn good between him and Spiderman. The part about the movie that gets me most is where Peter forgives Sandman for accidentally shooting Uncle Ben. Because even if he's doing it for his daughter, the guy is still a violent criminal. He punches people out of cars and into busy traffic and generally acts very destructive. Sure, he doesn't intend to hurt anyone while he runs around with a loaded gun or smashes everything around him with several tons of force, but that's kind of an inevitability. Sandman does nothing but prove he'll endanger anybody he feels like using a sappy excuse. And Peter's reaction is, 'You're right, you're a great guy and you should keep on doing that'. Come on, movie. Last is Venom AKA Eddie Brock play by Topher Grace who looks nothing like Venom from the comic book. I just don't see him playing Venom with his wimp comedian style. Venom was an extraterrestrial symbiote badass and he was only in the film for the last ten minutes. Director Raimi was actually going to have Vulture and Sandman in Spiderman 3, but Sony wanted Venom and it hurt the film. In no way, does the particle accelerator, Green Goblin serum or the extraterrestrial symbiote scenes explain beyond making the villains. It would been really cool to have the technology be part of the plot. What mainly annoys me about Spider-Man 3 is that it goes way overboard trying to clarify who's good and who's evil so it loses its effect, like a comedian explaining a joke to the audience beforehand. The movie has some unnecessary comedy scenes such as Emo-Dancing Peter. I admit this is a stupid thing that was added into the movie. I don't fully understand the whole reasoning behind it as to why it was written in. The symbiote wasn't supposed to make Peter emo, it was supposed to make him aggressive. This movie was heavily marketed as a drama, where Peter becomes evil. There are a few scenes where he is, like his fight with Sandman, his fight with Harry, and his confrontation with Eddie at the Bugle. But for the most part, it was more stupid than evil, but not enough to ruin the movie. But the dance scene that occurred from it, I seriously could not see this as a part of something Spiderman related. Am I the only one to notice that everyone in the movie bawled like an emo infant. Should have called it Crying-Man 3. The movie has this lack of coherent writing, structure, and half-way decent effort for the movie. Going back and forth between at least 3 different stories all at the same time, without giving enough weight or attention to any of them in order to make them the least bit involving, or interesting. It's not Stan Lee's writing. I did not like Stan Lee's cameo in this one. He might as well have looked right at the camera. Who the hell just walks up to someone and talks like that? Although at this point he is probably about as old as those old men who strike up random conversations in the grocery store. There is also the cameo of Bruce Campbell as an French maître d'. His scenes were pretty funny, but not needed. Overall: The movie visuals are great, the story was pretty bad, but altogether it's alright for what it was market for. A comic book popcorn flick. At less, it's not the The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series) from the 1970s.",6,4,5,20 May 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," It's Hammer Time! Is Thor: Ragnarok, worth watching? Yes, it is!
","Unfortunately, it takes one of the most popular Hulk comic book stories ever, 'Planet Hulk', to make 'Thor: Ragnarok', the most entertaining 'Thor' movie yet. Honestly to tell you, the truth. It's a good thing. While, all three 'Thor' movies, have a similar generic premise, in which, an alien force is trying to conquer the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a super-weapon, with this one being Thor's lost-long sister, Hela (Cate Blachett), with Blachett doing a good job, playing sinister, sexy and deadly, even if her character come out of nowhere, unexplained. At least, this movie directed by Taika Waititi & written from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost was a lot more memorable than its counterpart. I can hardly remember, 2011's 'Thor' & 2013's 'Thor: the Dark World' in the years, after both movies came out, at all. This one, honestly stands out. First off, most of the action, takes place, off-world, outside of Earth & the Ninth Realms, giving a lot more, bright & crazy looking, sci-fi vibe, mixed with its fantasy elements. This allow us, to get away from the annoying, human characters such as Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) & Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), whom in the last movie, pretty much, phone her performance, in. None of them, return. Sadly, this also eliminates, the Warrior Three such as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fandral (Zachary Levi), but at least, they had cameos in this film, even if short. Still, it cools to see that Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is still around. However, Alexander's absence in the film, does beg the question. Why, wasn't Sif in Asgard!? Nevertheless, this change in direction, allows new likable supporting characters to emerge, such as Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who does a pretty good job & Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to shine. While, director, Waititi did an alright motion-capture performance for Krog, a gladiator that Thor befriends. His soft-spoken, Australian accent was a bit jarring for something that came from Norse mythology. The same goes, with Karl Urban as Skruge, whom machine gun mow down scene was really bizarre. Nevertheless, I love how the film is not so bog down with complex, confusing Norse mythology, as the other movies; giving more room for simpler story lines like a prison escape subplot to breathe. While, yes, the whole gladiator fight/revolution plot for the most part, doesn't mesh well, with the main 'Ragnarok' story, in which the movie is title, from. It's still entertaining even with big plot-holes like how the wormholes honestly works, why nobody use the tesseract to get anywhere and how Hulk got to Sakaar, in the first place. Nevertheless, it's cool, that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still the title character, not Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), throughout this, even if it came from a Hulk comic book. The direction for this film, could easily be, misguide with Hulk getting revenge on the Avengers, but they stay focus on Thor trying to get back on his home world. I also enjoy, how the movie took more risk, with the title character. Seeing Thor, have short hair & without his trademark hammer Mjolnir was really shocking. Lucky for the writers & Hemsworth. Most of the risk paid off. Nevertheless, I can still do, without the badly gone, CGI eye injury. It was so fake-looking. It kinda distract me from enjoying the climax. The other special effects were good, but not great. While, none of the CGI in the film, look, deeply realistic. At least, it's beautiful to look at. It match well with the deliberately '80s space opera aesthetic and synth score, composed by new wave band, Devo's bandleader, Mark Mothersbaugh. Additional music featured in the film include 'Immigrant Song' by Led Zeppelin and 'Pure Imagination' from the 1971's film 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was also a nice tough. Another highlight from 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the humor. It was really cheeky & funny, as it really was going for that, 2014's Marvel film, 'Guardian of the Galaxy', sci-fi comedy vibe. Hemsworth really look like, he was enjoying, playing Thor, this time. His performance really made the film, very fun to watch. I glad, he didn't get bored. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, was also nice to see, however, I really getting tired, of the heel/baby-face, working, together, vibe. It was cool in 'Thor: the Dark World'. Here, not so much. I really was, hoping for something new. Still, I did like the cameo of Matt Damon, Sam Neill & Luke Helmsworth, stage-acting out the climax of the last movie, to Thor & Loki. It was a unique touch. It's also cool to see, that Stan Lee is still around, at his age, doing Marvel cameos, as well. I hope that day, where he can't, never comes. Furthermore, along with the Easter eggs, film references, it was also cool to see, characters performers like Benedict Cumberbatch & Scarlett Johansson reprises their roles as Stephen Strange from the film 2016's 'Doctor Strange' & 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. This includes, the mid-credit scenes. Without spoiling it, they really do help set up, 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity War', big time. Can't wait for that movie to come out! Overall: This movie deserves a thunderous applause. While, deeply cartoonish & somewhat childish. 'Thor: Ragnorok' was a feel good fun romp fantasy escape movie. Highly watchable. Highly recommended.",8,15,25,8 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," If I could live anywhere, it would be a night in Paris in the 1920s. I have to agree with Gil. Midnight in Paris is a beautiful well-made film.
","Set in Paris, the film follows Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a screenwriter, whom is vacationing with his materialistic fiancée, Inez (Rachel McDonald) and her wealthy, conservative parents. Gil is struggling with writer's block, trying to finish his first novel, about a man who works in a nostalgia shop in 1920s Paris. It doesn't help that Inez and her family continue to dismiss his ambition as a romantic daydream and encourages him to stick with the more lucrative screen writing. One night, as Gil was taking a walk, he found himself transported to 1920s Paris. It's there, he finds himself exploring and questioning his nostalgia and modernism beliefs, forcing him to make a decision: should he go back to his own time, or stay in theirs. Directed by Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris seemingly struck a chord with audiences. It's one of the few movies, beside 1977's Anne Hall that I honestly like from him. Midnight in Paris is a story about learning to live with the past. Gil obsesses over the past and its artifacts, and his unhealthy obsession continue to make his present life, a bit dissatisfaction. It wasn't until he got to see the past for what it is, that he knew he was dreaming a 'Golden Age' Fallacy. The movie does expose the dark truths behind the belief of the 'Good Old Days' and that's the best thing about it. The main actors were all pretty good. Owen Wilson was pretty much playing Woody Allen. As is customary with Woody Allen films, main character Gil is a stand-in for Woody Allen, from the tucked-in shirts Gil wears to the nervous way Gil talks. Owen Wilson, at first, I couldn't see him as the actor that could able to adapt a fitting characterization to match the films tone, but I was taken aback by his performance. It was alright, but really no big stretch, here. Both, Allen & Wilson mumbled and speak as if they are being tickle. It's not the best out there, but alright for his role, even if it's a bit annoying. Another problem with the film is Marion Cotillard's thick French accent. I can't understand a lot of things, she's saying. I thought, it would be better if she spoke in French throughout the whole film and don't bother with English. Just add sub-titles. It would make the film, more realistic. Still, it was hard to believe that everybody that Gill meets in the past, besides Marion Cotillard's character, Adrianna is famous. Still, it was very nice to see the countless amounts of famous historic real life supporting characters, playing cameos throughout the film. You got singer, Cole Porter, artist, Pablo Picasso, author, T. S. Eliot, dancer, Josephine Baker, film maker, Jean Conteau, artist, Man Ray, bull fighter Juan Belmonte, and others. Some of the key character to look out for, are absurdly intense author, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), straight forward writer counsel, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), crazy artist, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), and the dysfunctional couple of Zelda & F. Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pil & Tom Huddleston). They all play big parts in the plot. It's really hard to believe that all those legends really did converge on Paris around nearly the same time. If they did, I really doubt they all hang out, together in nearly the same places. There were a few historical inaccurates and plot-lines, but I can't blame Allen. This movie is pure fantasy, after all, and doesn't make any claims toward historical accuracy. Surprising, most historical elements were in fact accurate rather than exaggerated. It's fair to say, that this surrealism movie is a love letter to Paris. The film paints it, like every tourist wants it to be: romantic. The city was beautiful shot. If the place wasn't romantic, enough. This film will kinda overdo it. It really feels, a bit too gimmicky, buffeting you with every tourist site, the production can get their hands on. It's paint Paris in a good light, rather than showing you, any of the bad things about the city. The writing is pretty clever, and funny. It's perfectly paced, hits all the right notes. Glad, Woody Allen won Best Original Screenplay for that year. The music score was spectacular to listen to. The main theme 'Parlez-Moi d'Amour' (Speak to Me of Love) work so well. It was written by Jean Lenoir and first made famous by Lucienne Boyer in 1930. This must be one of Woody's favorite songs, because he includes it in the 20's scenes notwithstanding that it hadn't yet been written. One song that would be funny to add is original lyrics to 'Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)', by Cole Porter, but I guess that would be too racist. Overall: The movie is very funny, romantic and whimsical. If you love Paris, art or history, you have to see this film.",8,0,0,1 December 2014
The Prestige," Do you want to see a magic trick?
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is first off visually as it looks stunning with its beautifully assured direction, excellent sets, & stunning effect. It's brings out to the world of the magicians of the turn of the century. The story itself of two warring magicians does have its charms, as both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson were great in their respectable roles, playing the two rivaling magicians searching for that one jaw dropping trick to out shine the other. The two begin as friends, but when tragedy happens when a trick gone wrong, setting up for their lifelong battle to out shine the other begins. The charm and the magic of the film is painted gray as director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) brings a very dark and suspenseful look to Victorian London. The two leading stars followed up with Michael Caine, whom good in his role as a mentor type trying to inference and make peace between the two warring factions, but yet making it worst. Scarlett Johansson character is inter-twisted with both leads, but the acting from her wasn't much. David Bowie is nearly forgotten in his role as Nikola Tesla but yet his character is one that puts 'The Prestige' from Victorian historic melodrama to more Verne Steam punk Sci-fiction. He doesn't come into the film, until ¾ in. His role isn't large enough, nor long enough on film, but his character and his invention serves as the final twist in the story. The film is filmed & edited in a way throughout that feels as if it is concealing its hand in just for the final reveal. Unfortunately the reveal isn't as satisfying as it could have been, with half of it being a slyly admirable in its innocence & the other half simply jarring with the films tone & genre. It wasn't much to add it, as it was clearly out there before the final reveal. Is it worthy of the high marks? Not really--- it's works as suspense, thriller, but is it watchable after once--- sadly not. The film barely shows any other mood—then dark emotion that to the point, can serve to be somewhat depressing to watch. It's clearly not the film to watch at a party, or a get together. For a movie, it's really demand it's viewers to pay attention to every fact. It's hard to explain based on only viewing. The film is great, but it's semi overrated due to the popularity of Nolan. Watching the movie would do no favor if not watching it on BLU-RAY. It's one of the cleanest & sharpest BLU-RAY releases ever. It's a unique picture in this day & age for sure, & holds more showmanship & gloom than its counterpart 'The Illusionist', but the latter is a more satisfyingly (if only because it plays it safer) rounded film.",8,0,0,23 September 2012
Cloverfield," Cloverfield was a monster hit!
","What I love about Cloverfield is how much mystery was leading up to the film premiere and how much the movie after years later; can leaves you with further questions. It's a thinking man's film as you're left asking yourself, what was that movie really about? Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield is a mystery science fiction monster movie. The film is well-known for barely explaining anything. Coming from J.J Abrams, the producer from TV's Show 'Lost', it shouldn't be no surprise that the film will leave you with questions after watching it. Before settling on an official title, the film was marketed as 1-18-08. A lot of people didn't know what the untitled trailer for Cloverfield was about. Some thought it was a live-action adaptation of Voltron, others thought it was work from author H. P. Lovecraft 'The Call of Cthulhu' or spin-off of the TV show Lost. Due to the trailer, not having a title, so people started to use the name 'The Parasite', 'Slusho' 'Greyshot' 'Monstrous' and 'Colossus' to describe it. In the end, Cloverfield was chosen as the title. Cloverfield is a weird title that makes you wonder. What does it mean? It seem to be taken off from a street from California. Well, you don't find out in the movie what it means. The film presented itself as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated 'Cloverfield' and was found in the area 'formerly known as Central Park'. The video consists video of the events of Friday, May 22, 2009 follows six young New Yorkers attending a going-away party on the night that a gigantic monster attacks the city. Occasionally, older segments are shown from a previous video that was mostly taped over showing a trip to Coney Island. What made this found footage movie different from the others, is how big budget, it was. Instead of showing us, nothing like most found footage does, we see a great deal of the monster attacks. Lots of great special effects and CGI that was scary at some points. Lots of scenery gorn. The violence was a bit graphic at times. Look for the store scene for details about that. It was great, but the shaky camera can makes some audience hurl. The film had this cinéma vérité style to look like it was taped with one hand-held camera. You can also see bits of 9/11 allusions based on the destruction in New York City, that makes the film even more disturbing to some viewers. The movie makes homage to other monsters film such as 1954 Godzilla, 1933 King Kong, 1953, the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and others. There is even homage to action movies like 1981's 'Escape from New York' such in the case of the rip Statue of Liberty head being tossed into the streets. The movie also put in Easter Eggs like the drink Slusho and the Japanese drilling company named Tagruato that served as part of the viral marketing campaign for this movie. You can see, both as Easter Eggs in many of JJ Abrams movies since then. So look forward to that. If you look closing in the Coney Island scenes, you can see a certain item hitting the ocean as foreshadowing of the monster's attack. Having the Coney Island scenes in the film, show that a lot of heart went into this film. It really give the movie so emotional value. After all, the acting is alright, but not memorable. Most of the character act like really dumb people and some can be a bit annoying at times. Without giving too much away of the downer ending, thank goodness for the Coney Island scenes to lower the blow. The DVD includes two alternative endings, which vary only slightly. The movie might hold a possible sequel, as there's a moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, with a background character was filming, the characters of the film. It show a different point of view. Overall: The entire film is one long love letter to Kaiju films but lacked substance, development, and emotional value with its damsel in distress story. The action scenes speak more than the human characters. The camera work can physically as well as mentally nauseated. In the end, it's a good B-movie story with a big blockbuster budget. Watch 2014's Godzilla, first. It works better.",7,3,4,6 May 2014
Ready Player One," It's time to level up and dive into Steven Spielberg's visually breathtaking pop culture Easter egg hunt 'Ready Player One'! Is this movie worth playing? Somewhat. It's fun.
","Set in the world of 2045, this Warner Bros film based off, author Ernest Cline's 2011's bestseller YA novel of the same name; tells the story of Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) on his dangerous quest to find one of the three hidden keys that brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has buried in his expansive virtual reality universe; 'the OASIS', the discovery of which will lead the winner to inherit the game creator's fortune & control of his company. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there are not a lot of filmmakers out there that could had adapted this book into film. None of them has the vast assemble of contacts throughout Hollywood, in order to convince other studios to lend out their IPS (intellectual property) for the piece, as Steven Spielberg has. He also knows how to bring out the best performances both live action and though, character animations with nearly everything being spot on, strong. He did that before in 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Not only that, but the book film neatly encapsulates Spielberg's biggest strengths, by taking the world's obsession with the unstoppable push of CGI technology, layered with clever inside jokes & nostalgia driven- pop cultural references and combine them up into a sci fi genre that can work, both as a mystery & adventure with its treasure hunting premise and you got yourself, nearly a match made in heaven without it turning into controversial vanity project. However, there were somethings in this adaptation that could had done a little bit better, such as adjusting the exposition narrative into more of a 'show don't tell' type story. All the slog info dump in the beginning, still felt like reading a book, than a movie. Another thing, unlike the book, the film is so enamored with the world of Oasis that it doesn't spend as much time fleshing out the real-world of 2045. Where is all the mentions of environmental destruction, overpopulation, and economic meltdown from the book? Isn't it weird to see sequences outside the 'stacks', with Columbus, OH still looking pretty well kept for a city that supposed to be, in the brick of collapse. Also, I never got the idea that the world is horrible, if everybody is able to connect to the 'OASIS'. The background visuals for this film seem underdeveloped, much like most the character's backstories, besides Halliday. There's not a lot of remarkable amount of depth & development with them. Wade honestly felt like such a self-insert/wish fulfilment type character. He has literally little flaws here, but the will to fall in love. At least, in the original, he had learn to overcome greed, devastation and gluttony. In the film, his obsession with the 'OASIS' isn't healthy, as his knowledge of the creator seen too all-consuming and come across, as just unrealistic. Tye's character wasn't really that interesting, despite his acting being alright. Supporting characters like Art3mis AKA Samantha Cooke (Olivia Cooke) had potential to be a great character with her cool rebellion backstory, as well. Yet, in the end, she was ultimately reduced to a love interest. It was a bit disappointing. Nothing in the film is particularly emotional. I expected more of a moral message with their relationship. Still Olivia Cooke did alright job. The same can be said, with the others side-performers. I just wish, their emotional scenes weren't cut out of the film. Scenes like where a character is toss out of a building and another character family member having to hide her race through an avatar were very powerful in the book. Not having it, here, was a big mistake. Another deviate from the novel, I hate, was having everybody in one place. Isn't 'OASIS' supposed to worldwide network?! Where is the scenes all over the world? The lack of scope come across as so underwhelming. As for the action scenes. Some segments like the Manhattan Sky-line car race & the climactic battle scenes are visually inducing seizure due to over sensory. While others, like virtual version of 1980's Stanley Kubrick's horror movie, 'The Shining' are brilliantly staged. Either way, all the action scenes are lot better than the book. The movie takes away the numerous trials to unlock multiple gates with keys: instead focusing on winning the key as the challenge. It made the plot move faster, while, keeping the mystery, complex, and worth trying to solve. However, I didn't like how characters would magically whip some convenient Deus Ex Machina like obscure unexplained knowledge or unestablished weapons in their arsenal. Look, as much as I dig the premise of a treasure hunt inside a gigantic immersive online environment, very much; the idea of the people of 2045, being fixated on cultural references, over 50 years ago is bit jarring. Online culture just doesn't work that way. People like novelty. The film should had create more recent fictional in-universe pop-culture references to work with. You know, works from 2020-2045. After all, nostalgia can only go so far, before people forget or become unaware, of past works. A good example is how you don't see many silent era film stars as internet memes, these days. It's just unlikely going to happen. The movie push its pop-culture references too hard to the point that it reach insanity & oversaturated. It come across obnoxious, too reminiscence and annoying at times. It's hard to keep up. Despite that, the movie the movie is cheeky & witty enough, on its own to keep viewers, interested. However, some of the jokes might fall flat, because how dated, they quickly can become. At least, the movie doesn't cringe-worthy creepy jokes about masturbating & stalking like the book has. As for the pacing. The film is better, but both share the choppy rushed ending. Regardless of that, this movie is still worth plugging into, just for the nostalgia trip factor, even if the book both celebrates and critiques online culture, better. It's a film, still worth checking out.",8,3,5,21 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," This movie was too entertaining to be hated on. It was awesome!
","Largely set inside in a Wyoming outpost dubbed Minnie's Haberdashery, this American Western movie directed and written by Quentin Tarantino finds eight strangers snowed in together during a blizzard, some of whom harbor dark secrets and violent intent. Can bounty hunter, John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) survive a few nights with these people or will his bounty & prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), find a way to escape? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; I do like how the movie moves like a stage play, by having one main location, where most of the characters are able to develop relationship, spit out exposition and very interesting dialogue. By doing that, it does helps create an interesting film astrosphere that fit the film. However, on a technical level, Robert Richardson's cinematography and the use of 70mm was somewhat disappointing, due to the fact, that it's only one location. Still, you can really tell, by the way, the location looks, that there are tons of stories waiting to be told. Stories like, how the door got broken & who made the tea are just as important, as the characters that make up the film. You really get the layout of the place, by the end of the film, after hearing tons of dialogue, about the fireplace represented the bitten, yet heated South, and how the bar represented the drunk power of the North. Combining that with all the gifted actors that played the characters made for a healthy dose of entertainment. By far, the best actors in the film for me, were Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a former Confederate raider who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock & Samuel L Jackson as the exile black union major turn bounty hunter -- Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). They have the most depth of all the characters, while, most of the others can be considered one-note and cartoony like Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, who introduces himself as the Red Rock hangman & Kurt Russell as John 'Hangman' Ruth. Still, supporting actors like Jennifer Jason Leigh did pretty well with her limited role. I like how the filmmakers really did, ugly her up, by showcasing her rude personality, but also giving her, enough make up scars to tell the audience, that this is one b*tch, not to mess with. She's most likely to get nominations, come awards season. However, the movie wouldn't get an award for pacing. This film is not well paced. The film clocks in, for a 187 minutes for the Roadshow version which includes an overture and intermission, and 167 minutes for the General version. In my opinion, both versions don't work, for a mystery plot that could had quickly dissolved, within 30 minutes of the film time. After all, there are tons of moments throughout the film where characters illogically wait, when they clearly could had act, faster and more aggressive. Like, I said before, the film could had ended in 30 minutes, if only some of the mysterious figures had the balls to kill Ruth when he was entering in the Haberdashery, by himself. Anyways, the first couple of chapters are somewhat dry, with not much of anything really going on. It would easily, have cut a few more scenes from that. Second off, the narration that comes in the middle was a bit jarring and come across as poorly utilized. It really comes out of nowhere, and never truly explained. Did we really need that important spoon feed!? It would had been better, not to know, the twist with the coffee. It would make a greater punch, than it was delivered here. Another thing, that wasn't needed, was the flashbacks to earlier events toward the end of the film. Yes, I know, of 'show, not tell' but, Quentin already loves to fill his movies with dialogue, so it couldn't hurt the film, too bad, just to do that. After all, it was a bit anticlimax to see a deadly gun fight where nearly everybody dies; only to cut back, to see how the enemies got there in the first place. I really don't care, how they got there; I want to know, if the characters survive, Quentin! The messy ending also kinda ruin the whole mystery of the film. However, I was glad, this movie was even made. After all, after the script leaked online in January 2014, Tarantino considered publishing the story as a novel instead. Sometime in early 2015, after some rewrites, he changed his mind, when he got the actors, he wanted for the film. I'm pretty glad, he did, because legendary spaghetti western composer Ennio Morricone also join the project. His music in this film is tense and very haunting score. A very good job from him. Overall: The tone of the film is armed with vicious yet offensive racist humor, sexual assault and an intense violent, and gory action piece that some people might not like; but for me, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is as brutal in its insights into race relations and human nature as it cans. After all, it's depicting an era of the mindless violence in the aftermath of the American Civil War where racism/sexism/ and justice was indeed a very complex issue. That's why Hateful Eight is outstanding. It's must-watch for any Western fan.",8,5,21,2 January 2016
Dear John," Dear John, I'm breaking up with you. You're too mediocre.
","Dear Viewer, I have to tell you the truth. I'm starting to think that author, Nicolas Spark is one-trick pony. There are tons of Spark's novels that get the cinematic treatment and they all mostly look like the same. He's essentially writing the same story over and over. Dear John is a great example of this. This movie doesn't stands out more than the others. You'll see a lot of his tropes, here, like settling in Carolinas, love letters, kissing in the rain, and most of all, somebody ends up, dying from some type of disease or disaster. This movie seems like a carbon copy of his earlier books. It's the Poor Man's 'Notebook'. Don't get me wrong, I still love author Nicolas Spark, and I love some of his novels, but I just wish, he wasn't so lazy. Some of his works, is becoming very repetitive. I want to see, something new from him. Not this. Directed by Lasse Hallström, the movie tells the romantic story of a soldier, John Tyree (Channing Tatum) who falls for a conservative college student, Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried), while he's home on leave. Instead of getting out of the military when his time is up, John re-enlists after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, out of civic duty. The long distance between them is shortened through a series of love letters they send to each other, but the time spent apart also begins to wear on their relationship. Can their relationship last, or will the years of separation, pull them apart? Watch the movie if you dare to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, the first thing to I like to say, is that, I really don't buy into these two characters being in love with each other. They don't seem believable. First off, they rarely spent any time, together. Technically, they only spent two weeks together, out of many long years, apart. That's pretty sad. Second off, the chemistry between Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum is pretty dull. Not only is, Channing Tatum's character kinda boring, Tatum delivers line, so wooden, that it's hard to believe, that Savannah loves him, anything else than his looks. Clearly, she didn't fall in love with him, due to his personality or morals. I don't blame her, Tatum does provides plenty of eye candy for the women and gay men, I suppose. Amanda Seyfried's character seem to have, more to do, than Tatum's character. She seem like a more well-rounded character. I like that she had emotional depth. I also love that Seyfried, not only act, better. She also sang, a song in the film, call 'Little House'. Still, I don't buy into the fact that her character; Savannah is so selfless that she would marry a dying man that she doesn't love, due to pity. It seemed kinda ludicrous to me. That's way, over the top. At least, Savannah and John didn't cross the line with regards to fidelity in marriage. I'm glad, they resisted, in committing adultery. As a romantic movie, it is expected that Dear John may include some sexual content. However, the sex scenes are pretty tame. The violence in the film wasn't too bad. It barely show anything, graphic. After all, it's late 2000's PG-13. Not 1990's PG-13. The War on Terror subplot is questionable, at best. The movie doesn't dig deep into the political debate, about the war. It just serves as a backdrop. I spent the better part of this film, wondering, why John was serving in the first place. The movie portrays John as going to war, as his civil duty, but in the books, it's more about him, trying to help pay all the medical bills of his dying autistic father (Richard Jenkins). In many ways, it's confusing, but genuinely interesting. Was John doing this, for his autistic father or his country? We might never know. However, this bring one of the movie's most touching scenes when John reads his hospitalized father a letter. I love the coin twist. One thing that I really didn't get about the movie, is how only letters can be sent to John. The film screenwriter, Jamie Landen try to justify it, by just saying that he's in some far off desolate places where they don't have email, or phone calls, but I really doubt it. Most servicemen out there in Afghanistan, are able to receive emails or phone calls, easy; just like that. Yes, it's limited, but I really doubt, John wasn't able to talk more to Savannah than he was given. It seem a bit forced. Another problem with the film is the pacing. At 1 hour and 42 minutes, Dear John isn't that long, but it does drag at times. Then there's the big change toward the end that really anger me. The book ending is pretty alright, but the movie's happy ending is down-right sell-out. Honestly, the alternate ending seems more true to the spirit of the story. Overall: With more heartwarming and memorable love stories already captured on film, Dear John runs the risk of being forgotten, over time and I think it has.",5,3,4,25 May 2015
Moana," 2016's 'Moana' is worth watching! It's a luau of a movie!
","Set on the Polynesian islands of the South Pacific. 2016's 'Moana', explore the expedition of a young woman, Moana (Voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical life-breathing relic with an island goddess, Te Fiti, when it was stolen by the Demigod Maui (Voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson). Without spoiling this fictional movie written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, too much; though the film heavily influenced by Polynesian's history, myths, & culture, it is not directly based on any specific native tribe like the 1926's documentary film of the same name. Instead, the film takes specific cultural elements from a variety of native Pacific groups and incorporates them into one generalized portrayal of Polynesian culture, in order to make the audience member to identity the story better. Because of that, certain critics has accuse Disney of cultural misappropriation & exploitation, suitable to spur a profitable capitalist enterprise of music, celebrities and merchandise. While, this is somewhat true. I don't think, Disney had much of a choice. They had to avoid setting off cultural taboos. It was lose-lose catch 22 situation. Somebody was bound to get offended, regardless. However, I don't think, this musical is as degrading as certain people make it out to be. It's pretty harmless, compare to other tropical musicals like 1958's 'South Pacific' whom portray its island people as ugly snake oil-sellers, hags who gives give away their really young daughters to military servicemen to screw. If anything, 'Moana' gives a more positive light. Still, some of the characters of the film were drawn, very insensitive. Maui did look like an obese 'half pig half hippo' man. He did look kinda offensive. Still, much of that blame, come from the Walt Disney Animation Studios animators trying to lighten their load, by replicate the same awkward-looking art style that their 2002's animation film 'Lilo & Stich' was doing, over 14 years ago. Even back then, not a lot of people were fans of the big nose, the huge tights, oddly body structure, and alien-like eyes, type of a drawing for islanders. So, I really don't know, why they try to copy it. I guess, they wanted to focus more on other drawings like the supernatural elements designs. Even with that, those drawings also felt a little too familiar. If anything, the spirits looks like Disney recycling artwork that was previous, used in films like 2000's 'Fantasia 2000' & 2014's 'Lava'. As for animal sidekicks. As much as I love Hei Hei (Voiced by Alan Tudyk) & Pua. They really weren't needed. It did felt, unneeded animation. Despite that, at least, the island CGI background visuals for 'Moana' were breath-taking beautiful. There is no better example of that, then the 'Where you are' & 'We Know the Way', musical sequences. The other visuals like the action sequences, were equally done well. I just wish this Polynesian Prometheus/Odyssey-like fantasy story was told a little better to match the visuals. The action scenes in this film seem a bit force. Plus, it doesn't make much sense. After all, I get that, Moana was chosen by the water spirit; because how much, she cares about aquatic-life, but it doesn't explain, why the supernatural entity couldn't just do the task, itself. Nor does it explain why, the ocean tries to kill Moana with storms, sea-monsters, and lead them into conflicts with sea raiders, in the course of the film. Did the demigod actions make the ocean, bio-polar, as well? Also, what was the point of even having Maui around? He really doesn't do much; besides put Moana in danger. Let's not overlook that Maui also tried to kill Moana by locking her in a cave to die & trying to drown her in the middle of the ocean. Hero!? He's more like the villain. Another thing about the story, is that much of the flashbacks, book-reading and dream cave sequences could had been cut down in editing. All of them, felt a little too much like filler. The movie tends to repeat itself, multiply times; explaining, how Moana's people were, once- island voyagers, before Maui, cause the ocean to become too dangerous; despite the fact, the ocean, somewhat helps them. All the exposition dump come across, tiresome and very jarring. Another thing, that hurts the movie is the fact that the story of a young native princess tries to break free from the strict confines of her society by seeking out, a mysterious stranger in order to save her land, sounds a little too familiar. After all, we seen heroine's adventures like this, before, in half a dozen, Walt Disney Animation Studios films like 1995's 'Pocahontas'. Even acclaim Pixar films like 2012's 'Brave' had these well-worn elements. Don't get me wrong, it's doesn't make 'Moana' into a bad movie, but its presenting nothing, groundbreaking. In the end, this movie in a couple years, might not stand out, as much, as other films from this generation. Despite that, the movie does offer positive messages for younger viewers, about self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage, even when face with danger. Cravalho perform her, very well. She is a great singer and has a passable voice. As for Johnson, not so much. His performance was more mediocre, because how dial down, his personality was. However, Johnson does sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie, 'You're Welcome'; which is a plus. Besides that song, the funniest song is 'Shiny,' sung by Jemaine Clement; which also really fun to listen to; along with the power ballad, 'How far I'll go'. All great songs, courtesy of creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. All this music, makes 'Moana' soundtrack, worth listening to. Overall: Although. 'Moana' has many big flaws. It still was entertaining. 'Moana' is truly an adventure worth sailing for. So check it out.",7,7,11,8 March 2018
Crash," This movie isn't as good as I remember. It kinda crash hard for me. It was just alright.
","After rewatching it, I have to say, it's not Best Picture material as people make it out to be. This movie was a hard sit through with its tough loud and brash language and racist overtones. I found it to be very annoying. A self-described 'passion piece' for Director Paul Haggis, Crash was inspired by a real-life incident, in which his Porsche was carjacked outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard in 1991 where he saw racism, first handed. The movie tells a fictional story of number of Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives colliding with each other in interweaving stories about race, loss and redemption. I like how the film makes it everybody is tied with each other, but the whole interlocking story device isn't really that innovative when Crash come out. Hyperlink cinema has a long history in Hollywood, and in the right hands, could be clever. Films like 1994's Pulp Fiction, 1999's Magnolia and 2000's Traffic were able to do this, very correctly. Crash interlocking story arch felt clunky and unclear of itself. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a serious melodrama. The movie has this holier-than-thou attitude that I didn't like, with its story. It's telling the audience that racism is bad in a heavy-handed and preachy way, but yet, the writer for this film, put in funny ethic jokes for the audience to laugh at. They make you laugh at racism joke, and then the film goes all serious, and condemn you for laughing at it, minutes later. The film felt disconnected in that regard. Very hypocritical and very manipulative in the way, the film was edited. Besides that, it's nice to see the filmmakers, showcase, that minorities could also be racists, too. It's nice to see that movie isn't all about 'white guilt'. The film really extremely showcase racism, but fails to bring anything new to the discussion, like how to solve that problem. It seem mostly founded in making the audience feel as guilty as hell or angry for things that they personally didn't do. It is reasons like this movies, that there's still so much racism in society. It's because animosity never goes away. Somebody always trying to stir the pot. We get it, 'racism is bad'. The race card topic is pretty well-worn by 2004. Let racism die down already, Hollywood. Another problem with this film is that it fails to be a story. First off, the movie has no main plot, but a series of sub-plots that often never get resolved. The plot twists often felt cheap. The movie often felt like it was jarring with itself, pacing wise. Lots of slow pace filler scenes to fill in the run-time. This movie has way too many characters to follow, making it hard to remember who they are. None of them are really well-written, because of the little time, spent with each character. They felt like very offensive stereotype caricatures than real people. The film makes it worst, by making them so unlikeable, showing more of their faults, than their goods. Characters like angry white cop, John Ryan (Matt Dillon), idiotic and dangerous shop-owner Farhab (Shaun Toub), the rich, WASP snob bitch, Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock), and the gangsta hoodlum, Anthony (Ludacris) were so unpleasant. They really turn me off from the film to the point that I didn't care about their story arch. For a film with a socially conscious message, it's quite insensitive in how it portrays certain races. Its sucks that the movie doesn't have any strong Asian leads, because most of Asians, portray in this film are treated worse than any other race in this film. The only character, I found myself, rooting for was the hard-working, family-oriented Hispanic, Daniel Ruiz (Michael Pena). I really hate the fact that Farhab call Daniel's daughter, his angel. The movie already makes him look like a psycho. I was actually surprised that such a mediocre firm was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and won. Crash won the Best Picture Oscar at the 78th Academy Awards, controversially beating the critically favored Brokeback Mountain. It's hard to believe that films like 1998's American History X wasn't nominated for Best Picture, but films like this, were. In my opinion, this film was OK for critical acclaim, but it didn't deserve the Oscar for being the best film of the year. Overall: It was indeed social relevant. It was so popular that in 2008, a 13-episode series titled 'Crash' premiered on the Starz network with a similar concept. Crash does showed depth. It's not that bad of a movie. It showed that everyone can have prejudice, and can still be good in other ways. Crash is an Important Film that something profound to say. Despite all the faults, it has. It's still a semi well-made movie. I just wish, it could had been better.",7,3,4,10 February 2015
BlacKkKlansman," The invisible empire just got expose, how stupid, they really are. What an intriguing, surreal, funny comedy, this movie was!
","Loosely based on the 2014 real-life memoir by good nature, ex-police officer, Ron Stallworth, originally titled, 'Black Klansman'. This 2018 biographical comedy drama, directed by Spike Lee; told the story of the first African American police detective in Colorado Springs history to ever infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, successful. Without spoiling, this semi-historical flick, too much, I didn't mind, that the story wasn't as authentic as the motion picture should had been. Most of the major changes the film did; such as adding an imaginary cop hater activist girlfriend, Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier) or made up, Jewish surrogate cop, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) for Stallworth (John David Washington) to hang with, while solving a fictional bombing plot; work for the movie's favor, because it add more tension and suspense. However, having the events take place in 1972, instead of 1979 was a stylistic choice that was a mixed bag for me. While, I like that it allow a complex and impassioned debate about the portrayal of race in the media by referencing both Blaxploitation movies, as well, as political conspiracy thriller from that era. It does sway away, the struggles that Stallworth had to go, to accomplice with his main case. Pessimistically, this part of the film was often, sadly, delayed by other things, Lee wanted to shallowing show us first as well. Like, using film footage from another movie, 1939's 'Gone with the Wind' to open this motion picture up. Then, parodying a supremacy propaganda video with a minor character. Although, those sequences were unique to see. It didn't really help, move the plot, along. Much of the same, can be said, with the drawn out love subplot party scene. Did we really need to see Stallworth, dance to the whole song 'Too Late to turn back now' by Cornelius Bros and Sister Rose? It felt like time wasted. Even scenes that seem more important, like Stallworth, doing undercover work like infiltrating a local rally by national civil rights leader, Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) ran a little too long. No wonder, why it took forever for the case to take form. The pacing for this movie was way off. Don't get me wrong, I love how that scene is shot, with the lighting experiment, camera zooming in on close up of the bright faces of the crowd, listening to the organizer, surrounded by darkness. It was beautiful. However, the 'Tarzan' speech was kinda theatrical cheesy & forcefully heavy-handed. Not only that, but much of the 'take arms' bullet points, would be repeat, later in the film, anyways, in a jarring badly cut street scene where the black student union debate about having weapons at their protest. In truth, the lecture could had been cut down. Plus, we got a lot more powerful similar speech toward the end, with the film intercuts the KKK doing their rituals and watching director, D. W Griffith 1915's movie 'The Birth of a Nation', with footage of an elderly man, Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) illustrates in terrifying detail, how racism films like that, has cause an increase of real-life horrors of cruel and inhumane punishment toward minorities. Still, even that message, the film was somewhat muddled. For example, how on Earth, can Lee denounce one director's use of violent imagery, then, arguably does exactly the same thing, here, albeit from the opposite perspective? I get that, Lee doesn't want to shy away from making connections between the Klan Stallworth infiltrated in the '70s and the Unite the Right Rally of 2017; by having the movie open in theaters on the anniversary week of that tragic event, but having his protagonists, pull out guns and point them at the camera while visuals of modern day racism, both political and national dominates the screen, isn't the right message to give people of today. Anger through violence, in all its enflamed and even cinematic variations, is an emotion that our world could definitely use a little less. We don't need to fuel a future race war. Combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance would had been a better message to the movie with. Regardless of the mixed moral principles of the director, I found Stallworth to be morally sounded character. Thanks from solid dramatic acting chops from Washington during the serious moments of the film. Stallworth is truly dedicated, good-hearted guy who is stuck in rock and hard place; when it comes to his moral duty. Some people think of him, as a traitor to his race, for being a cop, while others, embraced his courage for taking on the KKK. His struggles was compelling. As for actor's comedic side. It did felt like a variety act to the point, that I did mistake him for Chris Redd at certain moment. Nevertheless, his delivery of humor was hilarious, especially with Stallworth interactions with Klan's Grand Wizard, David Duke (Topher Grace) over the phone & during the infamous photography scene. As for the supporting cast. They were equally as good as Washington, both comically and dramatically, with Adam Driver, standing out the most. As for the music. Composer, Terence Blanchard gave out, one of his best. What a haunting, but funky melody. Plus, his use of catchy R&B culture from the 1970s was well capture. Overall: While, I have furthermore, unnamed nitpicks of historical inaccuracies & problems with film message, that I didn't have time or room to mention, here. I still found this movie as one of Spike Lee's best works to the point that I'm willing to gloss over it. It's highly recommended, even if the film is target at an urban African-American audience. It still does have the appeal to many people, pass racial and ethnic lines. Because of that, I believe every person who believe in human rights should watch this movie. It's fundamentally fascinating.",7,11,19,7 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman swing back into action, and for the most part. It was alright.
","Welcome Home, Spiderman! Nice to see you back! However, you weren't really gone for that long. After all, there has five films featuring him in the last 15 years, with two reboots. You were pretty much, everywhere. So, coming into 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', I was really, wasn't looking forward to your movie. I was really, feeling the superhero fatigue, after the last two films about you, 2012's 'The Amazing Spiderman' & 2014's 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' kinda disappointed me at parts. Nor, was I looking forward to watching the 'The Sinister Six' spin-off film, which eventually got cancelled by Sony Pictures, but after hearing that Sony was allowing you to join the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe in a cameo appearance in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. It got some of my Spiderman sense tingling. However, I was still, a bit off-putting on the fact that I have to watch, yet another retelling of the Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman comics, origin story. I really had mixed feelings, coming into this film, because of that; but thank goodness, after watching, this movie, directed by Jon Watts, I felt astonishment that the film avoid the tiresome exposition on how Peter Parker (Tom Holland) became bitten by a radioactive/genetically-altered spider to become, Spider-Man. It totally skip it to tell something new. Now, Spider-Man is, like Iron-Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), in which, his suit gives him, most of his powers. It gave the character, a lot of new abilities and move-sets, such as controlling drone-size flying spiders, and choosing different types of web projectiles, while also somewhat limiting him, in his ability to trust his natural instincts & problem solving skills. It was a unique approach to adapting the character from the comics. Still, the action was not that memorable. I thought, the film could had done, a lot better. It was a little too CGI heavy. Also, it was a bit, odd to see Spiderman talk to an intelligence assistant named 'Karen' (Voiced by Jennifer Connelly) built into the suit about life issues. It really felt, like I was watching a superhero version of 2013's 'Her', at times. Still, I was deeply surprised, how little, the film talk about 'Uncle Ben' passing. You would think, that would affect his life, deeply, but there is no mention of that, at all. Because of that, the character was a lot more enjoyable and charming, but sadly, it also made Tom Holland's Peter, paper-thin. There was barely any character depth, besides the fact, that is Pete is an outsider in high school. I would like to see the sequel, tackle more intense & emotional issues than coming to age issues like him, trying to get with a girl and being popular in school. Another problem, with the film, is the fact, that they focus, a little too much on characters from the Iron Man franchise. The fact, that the villain, Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) has more of a grudge against Iron Man than the title character, makes Spiderman seem, less of the main hero. Don't get me wrong, you can still have the salvager turned into an arms trafficker, but have it, relate more to what Spiderman did, than the Avengers. It would make the film have more stakes. Still, Michael Keaton was great in the role. I just wish, his character, was a little more sinister and darker. As for the supporting cast, it was mostly a miss for me. I found, the classmates of Peter, to be really annoying. Some, good examples is the characters of Ned (Jacob Batalon) & Michelle (Zendaya). There were very unfunny. Some of the jokes, like not wanting to go to Washington Monument due to it, being built by slave-labor was cringe-worthy. It really didn't help the film. If anything, it slow the film, down. Also, the fact, that most of the students, couldn't tell, that he was Spider-Man, is really hard to believe. Thank Goodness, not all the humor was awful. I did like some of the hand-held V-Blog exchanges, between Peter and Happy Hogan (Jon Favereau) & the hot jokes with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) were kinda funny. Also, some of the cameos in the movie like Chris Evans, StanLee, and Gwyneth Paltrow was nice to see. As for the love-interest, Liz Allen (Laura Harrier). She was very forgettable for the most part, besides the big twist toward the end. It's just seem weird to see the writers, not use, the more famous, Mary Jane Watson or Gwen Stacy, instead. This film is by far, the weakest, in the love-department. As for the music,I like, how much, composer Michael Giacchino interweave a new update version of the original 1960's cartoon TV show theme song to the movie. Still, I like the Danny Elfman's 2002's version, better. I would wish, they reused that. Anyways, unlike this movie, I will be looking forward to Spiderman's appearance in the next MCU movie, 'The Avengers: Infinity Wars'. That's for sure. As for the next single feature. I have high hopes that it will do well, as well. Overall: 'Spiderman: Homecoming' spins a mean enjoyable web. It was entertaining for the most part. Even with some flaws, I highly recommended watching it.",8,16,27,12 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It might be a little dated, but Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is still da bomb. A fun watch.
","The topic of nuclear apocalypse might be a dark and chilling subject, yet, it doesn't mean we can't laugh about it either. This 1964's political satire black comedy film showcase, not only the dangerous of atomic weaponry, but also the pure human stupidity that comes with it. Directed by fame director, Stanley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb tells the story of the President of the United States, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), and his staff, trying to recall a squadron of air-force bombers heading toward Russia, after an unhinged United States Air Force general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) declare nuclear war on the Soviet Union. Can the group save the world in a last ditch attempt to prevent a nuclear apocalypse or will we all, be listening to the tune of 'We'll Meet Again' by Vera Lynn in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, as a Cold War nut, I found this movie, very interesting. Instead of creating, a serious drama of author Peter George's thriller novel, 'Red Alert'. Stanley Kubrick chose to take a more escapism route than a oversaturate melodrama route at the time. I guess, he can already sense that a lot of Americans at the time, were already on the edge because of the threat of Nuclear War, and people need a laugh, more, than being put into fear. However, Stanley Kubrick was face with a few problems. First off, Columbia Pictures would only finance the film if actor Peter Sellers played at least four major roles. I guess, they like Seller's performance in Kubrick's previous film 1962's Lolita, because the fact, that he assumes a number of identities. In my opinion, having Peter Seller onboard was the greatest thing, this movie could had done. He was hilarious as the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Captain Mandrake. All of them, were very different characters, and none of them, seem like it was played by the same guy. However, his performance as Dr. Strangelove was a bit, over the top. Despite that, I still found it, to be amazing. That's how great, he was, in this film. I just glad, he only did, three roles, rather than four. I really didn't see him, playing the Texan, Air Force Major T. J. 'King' Kong, the B-52 Stratofortress aircraft commander at all. In my opinion, Slim Pickens was a better choice. Glad, they went with him, instead of Sellers in this case. Another key character in this film, had to be George C. Scott as uber-jingoist, General Buck Turgidson. Wow, just wow! He was laugh out loud, funny. He really had that sense of command in his tone. Ever since then, a lot of war comedies, have use his sense of tone as a comedic general. The movie dialogue helps the acting, a lot. There were a lot of clever funny jokes and memorable lines, throughout the film, like 'You'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company ', 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!' & 'Mein Führer! I can walk!' It was all very well-written. I just glad, they stick to the ending, we got, instead of the pie fight ending, they originally wanted. However, the effects of the Kennedy assassination on 1963, did change a few parts of the film. Any mention of the city of Dallas was clearly cut from the film. Another problem that Stanley Kubrick had to face, was 1964's Fail Safe, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although Fail Safe was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. So, a lawsuit was filed by Columbia Pictures and himself on Fail Safe. Kubrick argued that Fail Safe's own 1960 source novel Fail-Safe had been plagiarized from Peter George's Red Alert, to which Kubrick owned creative rights and pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between certain characters, despite Dr. Strangelove being loosely based on Red Alert. The plan worked, and Fail Safe opened eight months behind Dr. Strangelove. Fail Safe open up to mediocre success, while Dr. Strangelove open up to mostly success with people, but a few controversy and mixed opinions from certain critics calling it a 'juvenal satire'. Yet today, this film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and I have to agree with today's standards. Indeed, Stanley Kubrick's deserve the praise. This is my favorite movie of his. I love how it's shot. The whole Black and white feel to the film, remind me of the 'black and white' views of the Cold War, so much. While, most of the sets, visual effects and action scenes can seem a bit dated. Comedy films like these, are one of the very few comedies from the 1960s that I can still laugh at. Overall: It's an outstanding, timeless masterpiece that must be seen for anybody looking for a good hoot! An explosive of laughs.",9,8,12,28 January 2016
The Bodyguard," I will always love you, movie, even if you're a bit mediocre.
","Houston, we don't have a problem. At least, not in 1992. In 1992, both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston could do no, wrong. At the time, Kevin Costner was one of America's most accomplished thespians and Whitney Houston was one of the most popular singers. When you combine them, in the movie, 'the Bodyguard'. You get a semi-OK-masterpiece. This schmaltzy proposal for this film was rejected 67 times before Kevin Costner got the rights. It was originally written by Lawrence Kasdan for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the 1970s. Directed by Mick Jackson, the movie tells the story of Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a former Secret Service Agent for the President, who became the private bodyguard for international pop star and actress, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) after she been, receiving death threats from a dangerous stalker. Can Frank save Rachel or will the killer win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I found Kevin Costner's acting in this, pretty dull. I know, that his character is supposed to be stern, but geesÂ… they could have, lighten up, the character, a bit. Even, in the lake scenes. He was pretty blend. Despite, that, he made a pretty realistic bodyguard. He was also, a pretty cool, action star at the time. He deserve more credit for this movie, from stopping it from totally tanking with his action scenes. The scene where he was chasing the killer, through the woods was intense. Kevin Costner was so insistent that Whitney Houston and no other black singer/actress play the part that the film production waited 1 year for Whitney to be available to film. In my opinion, it was a good choice. She was a good singer, but not a good actress, even when seemingly playing a variation of herself. Whitney Houston as Rachel, was mediocre, at best. I give her some credit, for at least, trying to act. She did suffered a miscarriage during production and missed a couple of weeks of production recovering, and you can't tell, by her performance, how truly depress, she must have, been at the time. I just glad, Whitney Houston's character wasn't playing like a gimmicky black singer stereotype. Still, most of the movie, I felt that her character was a bit annoying. Even, test audiences, couldn't stand all, her b*tching as the film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting. Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including 'Queen of the Night,' a remake of Chaka Khan's 'I'm Every Woman,' 'I've Got Nothing,' and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You.' Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, 'Run to You' and 'I Have Nothing', were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing 'What Becomes of the Broken Hearted' instead of 'I Will Always Love You', before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it 'a capella' for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall: Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it.",6,3,6,24 April 2015
Fast & Furious 6," Fast & Furious hasn't ran out of gas yet. Seems like it is just getting started.
","Honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's starting to look like all they got is this franchise. The actors are all becoming 'One trick Ponys' in my opinion. In my opinion, this movie by director Justin Lin is probably the Fastest and the Furiousness yet. Still you got to watch the other movies to even get this far in. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives. U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his second in command, Dominic's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) who is after a secret military chip. There wasn't a lot of silly moments which Fast Five was full of, in my opinion in this movie; but the car coming out the nose of an airplane is bit outrageous dumb. Still, that had to be the longest airport runway in the history of the earth. The plane in the movie was in flight for 5min 33sec. Based on that the runway was at least 13.88 miles long, that doesn't even include the beginning of the take-off and the fact that where they stopped. It didn't seem to be anywhere near the end. Longest runway I know of is 18000 ft. Anyways the action was pretty intense, you might have not notice that. The tank battle was pretty good as well. I just didn't like the whole bringing in the speed racing theme into the middle of the movie. I know it's in the original Fast & Furious movie (2001), but it takes out the seriousness of this film. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. Most of this movie plot come from Fast & Furious (2009) since it deals with Letty. In 5 films, not counting Tokyo Drift (2006), the story has evolved from fast cars, racing and hijacking tractor trailers to heist money from drug cartels to now fighting international terrorists. Then you got people turning evil to good, good to evil. I didn't know being an international terrorist can get parole from the same country, she was attacking. Watch the movie to get who I am talking about. I noticed Vin Diesel doesn't look very buff out like he used to be. Age is getting to him. Still, the Rock doesn't look normal. Are you sure this guy isn't taking Steroids? The acting is OK; everybody had their bit parts. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous give the film its laughs and memorable one-liners. There wasn't anything new and sexy in this film unlike the others, but seeing Gal Galdot was pretty OK. Han (Sung Kang) is always an interesting character of mine. Also make sure you check out, Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) before watching what happen after the end credits. There also a special new actor joining the cast on the 8th movie. Overall: Sit back and enjoy the ride, let reality leave you for a couple hours.",7,3,5,28 May 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," The door is locked. In that case. Create your own door. Open your mind and watch Pan's Labyrinth! It's an amazing movie. You just got to know where to look
","Director Guillermo Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable to his earlier film, 2001's 'The Devil's Backbone', as both addresses similar themes. Set in Spain during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) & influenced by children fairy tales from authors, L Frank Baum, Lewis Carroll, Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, along with adult-driven fantasies novels from authors, Jorge Luis Borges, Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, & Algernon Blackwood. 'Pan's Labyrinth' tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the kingdom of the underworld. However, her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López) thinks otherwise; who believes, that Ofelia is becoming too unstable for his plan for a stable Falangism regime for both his country and in his household. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there are two ways to look at this movie. One is looking at it through a child's mind where everything and anything is possible, regardless of circumstances. The other is through, an adult's mind, where rational thought dictates our actions. It's these two ways of thinking, that make the film, so thought provoking. Is Ofelia telling the truth and Vidal is the one, losing touch with reality or is Vidal right about the world, and everybody else is living in the fantasy world? Its complex questions like this that makes this fairy tale movie, so interesting to watch, but far too sophistical for small children. Definitely, it's not for toddlers or anybody under 8 year old, unless, you want them, to see something profoundly graphic/violent and disturbing. Not only that, it's somewhat depressing with a tear-jerker type ending. It's not family friendly, despite whatever, marketing wants you to think. Despite that, the film has really fine-adult-driven acting, mostly from both Ivana Baquero and Sergi López. I have to say, Sergi for sure, as he's one of the best villains in modern day film history. The Spanish dialogue also well-written, even if it's a bit confusing at times. The English subtitles, was very helpful in trying to understand the story. The music by composter Javier Navarrete was very haunting & beautiful. The piano & violins really brings the sounds of our own mortality and purpose into question. Well-done. The film also has a supernatural horror tone to its fantasy sequences. While, the film employs some computer-generated imagery in its effect, it mostly use complex make-up and animatronic to bring its creatures to life. There is no greater example of that, then the characters of the Pale Man & the Faun, both played by the same actor, Doug Jones. One of the biggest misconception about this film is that the Faun is Greek-deity-Pan, when Del Toro, himself, stated out that he is not. Instead, he along with the Pale Man is both original characters, taken straight out of the legendary nightmares fuel of Greek, Japanese, Nordic, Christian and Roman mythology and mixed together into something new. Both creatures represented the goods & evils of authoritarian. First off, you got the Pale Man who represented man-made-control like fascism & communism. In a way, the juxtaposition of the Pale Man's table with the scene of frightened townspeople lining up to take the only food they could probably get, rations doled out by the Fascists or the Communism rebels, has some significance to the plot. If we are to believe, that the Ofelia makes this fantasy story, up, taken from multiple sources. Then, it's become very clear, that the Pale Man is supposed to represent the adults around her. After all, they are the one that trying to shatter Ofelia's trauma-triggered fantasy perception of her harsh reality. Like the Pale-Man eating children, they are the ones killing the youth within all of us, only allowing those mature enough to breed and survive. It's control 'survival of the fittest' at its scariest. A very strong Holocaust overtone. Then you got the Faun that represented phenomena or the laws of nature. Just as much, as we have to follow man-made authoritarians; we're also dictated by the harsh changing environment in which, we lived in; which we mostly have no control of. Yet, we try to be disobedience against it. We always trying to control death and childbirth. It's no surprised that Del Toro chose the character's look to invoke a certain 'light-bringer'. Like mandrake roots, free choice in small amounts us to have some control of our lives, but in larger doses might kill us. Being submissive to something out of your control is not a bad thing. The existence of the unexplained, ever make this, belief, somewhat stronger. Overall: Regards to whether or not the fantasy underworld was real or a product of Ofelia's imagination, it doesn't really matter, as long, as you get that message. However, I didn't like, how Del Toro kinda ruin it, by spoiling his answer. In my opinion, having a film so deliberately ambiguous, is a stroke of genius. It's better off that way. In the end, it's a must watch from me. Highly recommended.",9,5,7,21 July 2016
The Polar Express," I'm sorry to say this, but Polar Express was somewhat of a train-wreck of a movie. It was not good.
","'One thing about trains: it doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on' quotes the Conductor (Voice & Motion Capture Performance from Tom Hanks). I'm sorry to say this, but I can't get aboard with this 3D CGI animation kid's movie, about a young unnamed boy (Voice by Daryl Sabara, but motion capture performance also done by Tom Hanks), having to travel to the North Pole, in order to renewed his faith in Santa Claus (Also voice and motion capture performance by Tom Hanks). The disbelief story felt a little too manipulative & force. After all, that part of the story was too extreme, it didn't match the levels of the children book of the same name by author, Chris Van Allsburg, which also happens to be the source material for this film. It's really does seem like that part of the movie, was made for some evangelical religious convicting agenda, rather than fans of the book. For example, there is a lot of padding scenes, in the movie, where a ghost (once again voice and motion capture performance by Tom Hanks) scares and shames the mostly innocent young boy into believing in Golly St. Nick; as if he was Ebenezer Scrooge, a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old moneylender from Charles Dicken's 'Christmas Carol', rather than a child who just thinking straight & coming to age. Who says, not being too naive & gullibly is a bad thing? After all, isn't teaching our children to be smart, better then, teaching them to go blindly into the night with strangers. How is that wrong!? Going with conviction, without asking any questions, is how cults are built. Even if this movie wasn't made to brain wash, anybody, the bright light god-like appearance of the Kris Kringle later in the film giving out the bell as if its first communion, doesn't help, swag the argument away. Instead, it brings the issue, even closer. It's pretty clear, by all the religious overtones, that this movie is in-fact, a faith-based movie, hidden under a capture the holiday spirit, type of vibe. Anybody that says otherwise, is truly blinded by the smoke & mirrors. It's not a Christmas movie. It's a 'Christ'-mas film. In the end, it's still highly exploited. Very unbalanced. Not only that, but the movie has way too much 3D gimmick rollercoaster style actions scenes like the Glacier Gulch sequence, that goes against, everything that Chris Van Allsburg was trying to say, in his calm, relaxing storyline of the book. The film wasn't as slow & whimsical, as it should had been, because of that. Added to that, was the amount of action sequences that was totally pointlessness. Honestly, you can cut away all of the scenes where the child struggles to find, another child, train ticket, with the ghost on the roof; you would still end up in the same place in the end. It doesn't affecting the story significantly. All of this padding, really hurts, the pacing. Its leaves too many plot-holes, such as why the conductor walk over the roof of the train instead of just walking through the train to get to the engine room or what happen to the dancing hot-chocolate waiters? In the end, the 32 pages book that can be read in less than 10 minutes, should had never been made into a full-length 100 minutes movie. It leaves too many unanswered questions. Instead, 'Polar Express' should had work better, as a short animation film. Don't get me wrong, I give the filmmakers for taking a risk, in providing the world, the first live action motion capture animation & doing a good job in the background to preserve the look of Allsburg's lovely oil pastels illustrations from the book. However, I thought, the movie would had work better with the same hand-drawn animation that 1982's short film 'the Snowman' or 2006's short movie 'Little Match Girl' had. Better yet, go live-action. Why, because this movie has fallen in the subconscious effect called the Uncanny Valley. The exaggerated caricatures of human beings in this film is highly creepy. It just doesn't look right. Sadly, director, Robert Zemeckis didn't get the memo as he would directed, two more films with that style, 2007's 'Beowulf' & 2009's 'Christmas Carol'. As for the voice acting, it was mostly alright; yet again, I can do without Tom Hanks's voicing the ghost hobo, as well, as Santa Claus. It was very jarring to see him, do multiply roles and they were way too hammy. Another character's voice that should had been cut, was the know-It-All kid (Voice by Eddie Deezen & Motion Capture by Jimmy Pinchak). His voice got a little too annoying, toward the end. As for the music. I love composer, Alan Silvestri's theme for the film, even if its suite sounds too similar to Danny Elfman's Ice Dance theme to 1991's 'Edward Scissorhand'. As for the songs; it just didn't work with me. The 'Hot Chocolate' number was an awful lazy written song with annoying repetitive lyrics and jazzy hook that comes out of nowhere. Then, there is 'When Christmas Comes to Town', a ballad duet that sounds really generic. It's highly forgettable, along with Josh Groban's 'Believe' that sounds too much of a guy reading the spoilers than singing. The only song, I kinda like, was the 'Polar Express' theme. The tune was catchy. As for the covers of classic Christmas songs. It was nice to hear them, nevertheless, I can do, without 'Rockin' on the Top of the World'; it was lackluster, and doesn't match, with the theme of timelessness. Plus, seeing Aerosmith's Steven Tyler as an elf was awkward as hell. In the end, this movie just doesn't capture the same magic of Caldecott Award winning book. It was just disappointing. Because of that, I can't recommended seeing this film. Just, check out the book, instead. Now's that worth, getting onboard for.",6,4,8,30 December 2017
Black Mass," Black Mass was nightmarish. It took the gangster genre to the depths of insanity. A great powerful movie. I love this movie!
","This true crime drama makes for a very well-rounded film. Black Mass shows what happens when you make a pact with the Devil. Directed by Scott Cooper & based on the 2001 non-fiction book, Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film tells the true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp), one of most notorious gangster in American history -- and his relationship with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as an informant for the FBI. Can John Connolly control Bulger or will Bulger gain the upper hand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I like seeing, the manipulation of the FBI as a means to eradicate crime rivals for control of the Boston underworld. It made for an interesting intense watch. Lots of brutal action, throughout the film. Not for the weak hearted. Johnny Depp is just wicked good as Whitney Bulger. As much, as his make-up work is somewhat distracting, I like how Johnny Depp was able to show a lot of range of emotions with this character. Any other person would probably, play this crucial role, a little way cheesy; with over the top, stereotypical one-dimensional evil, acting. While, the film doesn't shy away from showing Whitey's evil sins, I like how Depp was able to show Bulger's more human side, with the material, given to him. Scenes with his mother, wife & kids, were really necessary to show, that there is a real person, within the criminal mythic. You really do feel a lot of emotional, through his performance. You feel the heartbreak, when the family man side of him, really dies. Don't fear, the movie wasn't going to romanticize him, so needn't worry. It was just nice to see, a bit of that. Scott Cooper was able to show, also Bulger's more Machiavellian side. This movie shows that James Whitney Bulger could teach Satan some new tricks. I just wish, the movie establish more of a connection with his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) & him. I really didn't see, much conflict or stalks, between them. Anyways, Benedict Cumberbatch still, did a great role, even if it was short-lived. Sadly, John Connolly felt more like his brother, than Billy was, in the movie. Edgerton and Depp play wonderfully off each other. Connolly was a great character study that really show, how heroes, can easily be corrupt, when they want power. He has the most tragic of fates. Joel Edgerton is wonderful in this role. Also, his Boston accent, pretty damn shot on. The rest of the actors were pretty alright for the most part. I just didn't like how, some of them, are always being typecast. Good examples are Juno Temple as the prostitution, Deborah Hussey & Jesse Plemons as the criminal, Kevin Weeks. I kinda want them to step up, their game. The best of the minor supporting actors, had to be Kevin Bacon as Charles McGuire. While, his character is a composite of several Boston FBI bosses, he had some of the best harsh verbal exchanges. It was fun, watching him, play off, with Edgerton's character. I'm glad, they cut Sienna Miller as Catherine Grieg from the film, because her scenes weren't really needed. I'm also, glad, they didn't show, too much of senior-citizen, Whitney Bugler, because, the makeup work for age 40's Bugler is outrageous, enough. I glad, they kept, most of the film in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It would be, way too jarring for the film to have longer scenes in 1995 or 2011. For the most part, the movie is pretty accuracy historically. There are few things, worth nitpicking, like not going into much details of how Bulger was able to escape, how he was capture, and how his criminal operation works. Another thing, the movie didn't explain, is why certain people were kill off. I had to do, research on my own, to figure out, who and why John Callahan (Bill Camp) had a hit on him. The movie could had, been better if only the movie dug deeper. I wish, the movie would mention more of Bulger's LSD testing days, the Killeen-Mullen War, or even the Lady of the Dunes rumors. Still, the movie does have good pacing for what it is. I was never bored. While, the movie is grim. It does have some semi-funny moments with its strong language and mean-spirited comments. Some critics have accuse the movie, for trying too hard to be, like 1990's GoodFellas, but I rarely see any similarities, besides the dinner table scene. It didn't borrow, much of anything from Goodfellas. This movie is way more intense and scary than any of Martin Scorsese's gangster films. If any, Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed borrow, way too heavy on Bulger's exploits. While, yes, the plot of the movie is adapted from the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, but you can clearly see many similarities to that film with this. Overall: This gripping and unique crime drama about the duality of undercover work, works. A must-watch. I do recommended.",8,4,10,21 September 2015
Nacho Libre," Nacho Libra low blows audiences with stupidity.
","I find it interesting that Hollywood would make a comedy movie about Mexico's culture with a predominately Hispanic cast, only to cast the lead role as a recognizable white Male with the joke being that he playing a Mexican. There are far more funny Latino comedians they can use, rather than casting Jack Black as the main role. Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite fame directs Jack Black as Ignacio, a young man who works as a cook in the Mexican monastery where he was raised. When the institution faces a financial crisis, Igancio decide that he must do God's work, by competing in a local Lucha Libra (pro-wrestling) tournament under the character of Nacho the Luchador. Donning a spandex outfit, mask, and cape, to protect his identity from getting catch by the Church. Nacho decides he can do that and enlists the aid of a local vagrant, Esqueleto (Hector Jiminez) to be his wrestling partner. Hector Jiminez is super skinny, as Jack Black is fat. Most of the jokes will be about their weights and how gross they are. A couple of fart jokes. A diarrhea joke. A 'wipe my face' joke. He struts around in tight sweatpants and no shirt through a significant portion of the film; not a pretty sight. They begin to lose their freshness after multiply times and it becomes a tiresome joke. Kids will love it, mature adults not so much. Some funny and unfunny tasteless jokes indeed. The movie is so crude, that they even named one of the children in the monastery, 'Chancho' which means Pig due to the fact he's overweight. Chancho is the only person who knows that Ignacio is Nacho. The plot is that Igancio need the money to make better food, clearly seeing all the fat children in the monastery, I think they need less food. Nacho tries to save the monastery while trying to win the heart of a woman of the cloth, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) a celebrity look-a-like rip off of Penelope Cruz. What is most remarkable about this morally-bankrupt movie is its obvious impropriety of a monk constantly soliciting a nun for sex. Though it try to create humor by mocking old practices of church it, it does not condemn religion though Ignacio's sexual appetite. Still, people in religion can feel offensive to few of its jokes. This movie is based on a real priest, Rev. Sergio Gutierrez Benitez. whom ring name is Fray Tormenta ('Friar Storm' in Spanish) and he does wrestle under the mask in Mexico to support an orphanage. He inspired characters ranging from King from Tekken, to Crasher Wake to Pokemon. This movie is not a tribute to him, as there are far better movies such as 1991, French movie L'Homme au masque d'or (The Man In The Golden Mask) starring Jean Reno. Even, Fray Tormenta appeared in the film 2007 Padre Tormenta as a priest who dons the luchador's mask and enters the ring to raise funds for the orphanage he directs was better than this movie. Nacho Libre, naively made kids' stuff, lacks such minor attributes as a decent script. The film sports an whimsy and melancholy in the first 20 minutes and continues to be somewhat a downer. The later half of the movie feels formulaic and conventional, the joyous spontaneity lost as Ignacio continues to fail and fail. Jared Hess directs the movie with the same colors & visuals as Dynamite, but fails to present properly Mexico culture. Hess perpetuating stereotypes for some sort of comic purpose in this film. The manner in which he depicts Mexicans with the bad teeth and the tacky squalor is also something that many would find offensive. Actually, the accent Jack Black used in the movie is called the bandito accent. That accent has been used for ages in Hollywood when representing Mexicans on film. It's quite a different accent from the accent from Mexicans and and a lot more different than the accent used by people from Spain. It's as different as the English accent used in Britain, Australia and the US. It's appear both racist & making fun of Mexico even if it's not the movie's intention. This movie wrestles with a lot of issues, and get pin to the count of 3, because of it.",4,3,5,19 February 2013
The Town," One of the movies that save Ben Affleck career.
","The best Ben Affleck's film since Daredevil. Just kidding about Daredevil, that movie sucks. The Town redeems Ben Affleck not only from awful films he star in the past, and pretty much help him with his new job: directing, that would help him in later films like Argo. I was kinda iffy about seeing this, because first Ben Affleck starts in it, second Ben Affleck directed it, haven't yet seeing 'Gone Baby Gone'. I was kinda hoping it would be very similar to 'the Departed'. I really enjoy it. The movie is loosely based on Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves, and the movie start with a bank robbery. Claire Keesey, a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) just got rob and taken hostage, but later releaser her without harm. She was soon pick up by the police, and taken to the station for questions. FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) interviews her to see if she can identify any of the mask bank robbers. Jon Hamm's performance alone as the FBI agent trying to nail them was great. Jon Hamm (Mad Men) will make a huge jump from TV to movies, soon. I predict he will win a Oscar one day. Anyways, she couldn't remember due to the trauma and sent home to rest. She later breaks down at a laundry mat, when a fellow Boston neighbor Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) sees and tries to help her deal with the pain. What Rebecca Hall doesn't know is that Doug is one of the four bank robbers, who has come to Claire to save her from fellow bank robber and friend James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) who thinks of eliminating her as a witness due to her knowing too much. Jeremy Reginner was great as his psychopath best friend, who would rather die in the street, then in prison. He was just that evil in this film. A romance grows between Doug and Claire forcing Doug to make a life choice, to get out of the bank robbing business due to his disenchanted with his criminal lifestyle and the lies he has to tell Claire. Ben Affleck as Doug McRay seems to be a role he needed to play. The character is a crook, but you really see trying to change. There is a charm to it. The only problem for Doug is that Fergus 'Fergie' Colm (Pete Postlethwaite), his crime boss doesn't want him to leave. The writing for the film was pretty damn good: the whole speech about what happen to Doug's mother, the speech about Claire being tied up and touching the water. The movie has brilliant dialogue, and no better example of that then the 'Weight of Dollar scene' with Blake Lively and Jon Hamm. The accents can be hard to understand at times, but most of the parts are well-acted. The only one I had problems was Rebecca Hall's performance, it's seem too acty, and the scene in the bathroom where she was crying. I couldn't tell if she was crying or laughing. The three heist in the movie was great for the action-packed fan. The Action scenes wasn't too violent, or too graphic. It was the Stadium scene that got me. It was cut OK, but there were bits of the heist scenes I couldn't figure out due the movie leaving out a lot of information about how they were able to pull these bank task off with the limited money they had. How in the earth did they get police uniforms? The sex scenes were well crafted, and wasn't graphic at all. The sex scene between Doug and Krista (Blake Lively) is questionable, wasn't really needed. I know it's showed him not being into it, it actually helped with understanding his feelings throughout the movie, but it's doesn't have to be there. There were even comedy in the movie. See the nuns and one cop scene. Another one, that got me was when James drank the soda during the last shoot out. Another thing about the film, I didn't like was the negative press about Charlestown, as if saying it's a bad neighborhood. Today the neighborhood is a mix of upper-middle and middle-class residences, housing projects, and a large working class Irish-American demographic. While crime is still predominant, it's not the bank robbery capital of the world as said in the film. If the movie is settling in the early 1990's, it might be more reasonable. Anyways, overall: a great movie, that has very similarities to that of Heat, but in my opinion better than that.",8,5,8,28 January 2013
Suicide Squad," Like a real-life suicide. This movie left a big awful bloody mess. Still, it was alright entertaining movie for the most part.
","The marketing for this film has been pretty amazing. The playful neon overlaying the normally gritty aesthetic is great, and the perfectly-timed trailers to rock band, Panic! At the Disco & singer Becky Hanson's version of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' & Bee Gees 'I Started a Joke'. Even singers, Grace's 'You Don't Own Me' and 'Sweet's Ballroom Blitz' trailers just knocked it out of the park. It made me, want to see this movie about a group of special-ability incarcerated criminals: sharpshooter, Deadshot/Floyd Lawton (Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn/Harleen Quinzel (Margot Robbie), bandit Captain Boomerang/George 'Digger' Harkness (Jai Courtney), gangsta El Diablo/Chato Santana (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc/Waylon Jones (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) being recruited into a secret, deniable and expendable government task force under the directorship of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis); in exchange for reduced sentences, and not having their heads blown off by bombs planted in their skulls. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is very watchable, however, like the Joker (Jared Leto) says in this film. 'I'm just gonna hurt you, really, really bad'. Indeed, I will, fanboys. I was very disappointed with this movie based off the DC comic book of the same name, directed by David Ayer. It was very mediocre. It didn't lived up to the hype. This movie committed suicide, by trying too hard to copy other films styles like 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy', with that of 2012's 'Avengers', with a slice of 1981's 'Escape from New York', added to it. It didn't seem original. First off, you can tell that this film had some studio inference as the writing and dialogue is all over the place. First off, you got, way too many characters and themes being introduce in one movie. You can't force the whole idea of the DC Extended Universe in one film. Supernatural themes like ancient gods attacking earth, don't mixed well, with Gotham gritty crime drama. Like really, how was the crazy woman with a bat supposed to stop a God-like being!? It makes no sense. It's so sloppy forced and shoe-horn into the writing. Honestly, the film would had been better, if they never did establish the Enchantress/ Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) story-like, but if they did, have her, face Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), or better yet, Hawkgirl since it's Midway City. Anyways, the Enchantress's killer 'light in the sky' weapon is such a tiresome clichés. Didn't we see this, before-like, 2013's 'Man of Steel'!? If anything, I thought, the movie's plot should had been more grounded, and should had the squad hunt down the Joker, because his popular character clearly has been underused, here. Plus, criminals hunting down criminals, make more sense! Another thing, wrong with this film. It seems like Warner Bros really wanted to lighten up the source material, after the critical failure of 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman'. The overused of licensed pop songs in the film, was annoying. Not only does it show that DC Studios trying to mirror Marvel Studios style with the 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy' like soundtrack, but some of the music, used didn't serve much for the plot. It was very jarring. The writing and dialogue is just awful, particularly the second half of the movie, where things started to make no sense and the jokes fall flat. There were very few moments in which, I kinda laugh. Half of the time, I spent, scratching my head, due to the bad editing. Way too much flashbacks, and quick cuts. It really screw up the pacing. Lots of repetitive exposition moments. Also, the film is so chopped up extensively, that the action was hard to see. First off, way too much scenes fighting in the darkness! Second off, fighting in rain, smoke and fog, doesn't help, make the visuals, any better. The CGI was alright, but nothing worth writing about. The action was also a bit, too unrealistic. Now, that he got that of the way, here is some of the positive things about the film. The characters were very memorable, and likable, even if they made, the mercenary Slipknot/Christopher Weiss (Adam Beach) into an expendable character and introduce Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana (Karen Fukuhara) far too late in the film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a stand out. She really does get the character's quips, despite being sexualized like Enchantress. Both female characters are way too young to be, doctors and scientists. Anyways, Robbie's character is probably the main reason to see this film, even if Harley wasn't in the original squad from the comics. Will Smith as Deadshot was also amazing, even if he seem a bit tired. Jared Leto as The Joker is a mixed bag, since he was forced in, as a last minute decision. Since he wasn't in the film, much. I can't say, if I hate the character or not. I also, don't know, how to feel about the tone-down version of the abusively relationship with Harley. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the government official pulling all the strings. She does her job well; a reserve, stern, credible performance. Other characters worth nothing is Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerrang and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. Both were great in their limited roles. The cameos of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and the Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) was also cool to see. Overall: I don't like bashing the film, but I'm uncertain why DC feel the need to rush into blending their cinematic universe, instead of taking their time to establish the characters in stand-alone films. There's far more money to be made making a single film, then an ensemble movie. So many squandered opportunities, and I really hoped this would be great. C'mon DC, these characters and your audience deserve much better.",6,3,5,11 August 2016
Battleship Potemkin," Indeed, Battleship Potemkin is one of the most influential propaganda films of all time!
","Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the movie presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime. Eisenstein divided the plot into in five acts: Act I: Men and Maggots, Act II: Drama on the deck, Act III: The dead man calls for Justice. Act IV: The Odessa staircase and last, Act V: One against all or Rendez-Vous with the Squadron. While the masterpiece has remained one of the most influential silent films of all time, influencing such directors like Terry Gilliam, Francis Ford Coppola, and Brian De Palma's later works. The movie also have a negative side with the Revolution Will Not Be Vilified attitude. While it is certainly a classic it's nonetheless still, an old Soviet propaganda movie that help keep tyrants like Joseph Stalin in powers for years. Soviets seized upon the mutiny as a propaganda symbol for their party and unduly emphasized their role in the mutiny. In fact, the people that lead the mutiny on the boat, were Socialists of one type or another and cared little or nothing for Communism. The Bolsheviks had little to do with it, despite the movie saying so. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed. So I wouldn't say, the movie is historical accurate. It had a heavy-handed message that Communism is good. Anything else is bad. After all, the local Cossacks are portray so negative here, as over the top shadowy evil villains who shots women and children. You're really feed force to feel this great sympathy for the downtrodden sailors and workers. Clearly, the movie is very manipulate. A good example of this is one of the dead sailor corpse being display, with the sign about him having been killed for a plate of soup, instead of inciting a mutiny. He wasn't even the leader in real life. The real leader of the mutiny continue with life with the ship, finally settling in Dublin and silly as it is, open a fish-and-chips shop. Yes, that's really did happen. Another is the famous Odessa massacre, it never did happened. It was just made up so that the revolution would look more justified. Yes, there were reports of demonstrations being put down by troops on that day, but it was greatly exaggeration of some of the real events. In fact, Joseph Goebbels said that this film was the greatest propaganda film ever, and really help influence him on Nazis propaganda films. You really see a glance of what, he was talking about, with the film making a crude characterization of the Russian Orthodox priest. By showing him, it was meant to show how religion is used to support the status quo and reinforce authority. It was clearly an anti-religion comment. Later, Nazi films would use the same tactical in their media war against Jews, portrayal them as the greedy authority that kept the German people down. It's clearly haunting. The movie was often banned from countries like United Kingdom, France, Germany, and even Soviet Union at one time, because how much, it influence people to overthrow the government. While, not a huge hit, when it came out, the movie has received extremely positive reviews from critics, over the years. A lot of this come from how great the montage editing techniques were. Sergei Eisenstein learned/discovered cutting clips in experimental Soviet film workshops with his teacher, Lev Kuleshov. It shows in the powerful, and violent Odessa Steps sequence. I love the epic rush of how it was film. Added with the music from Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony and you got something powerful and disturbing. Suppressed anger. A dangerous and distressing time. I particularly like the fact that the fate of the infant in the baby carriage is left to the imagination of the audience. The baby represents the fragile hope of progress. At the top of the steps are the advancing forces of imperialism and autocracy, at the bottom a wild mess of violence. The people are caught between great forces of destruction, to which there is no appeal. Does the baby survive? We do not know. Even the action scenes on the boat were pretty intense. It was really surprise to see the splash of color in the end of this movie. It really work in the symbolism department. Then, there is ship scenes, where people notice some phallic and sexual imagery. Who knows!? Maybe, there is. After all, most propaganda film at the time are pretty homoerotic. Maybe, sometimes the cigar is just a cigar. The faults of the film could be its pacing. By modern standards, this is a short film; but for 74 minutes. Yet it felt like forever. It had a lot of slow moments and repetitive recycle shots of nothing happening. Then there are oddly cut shots that don't match up, what happening on screen. Since the old Soviet production company is no more, Mosfilm released a selection of its classic films online for free viewing. It's shouldn't be, too hard to find. The movie is indeed in the public domain under a free license Creative Commons. If not, try to find the various DVD edition. Most video transfer are pretty good with few scratches and speckling. A lot of them are restored. Since the movie is indeed a silent film. There are several film scores. The best one to watch it is under Shostakovich. Edmund Meisel & Mark-Andreas Schlingensiepen works as well. Other film composers versions, Nikolai Kryukov, Chris Jarrett, Eric Allaman, Del Rey & the Sun Kings band, and Pet Shop Boys are worth checking out. Just stay away from the avant-garde jazz version. It's really bad. Overall: A must watch for any silent film fan or film student. A alright watch for everybody else.",8,0,0,23 July 2014
Taxi Driver," Let's taxi to the Dark Side of Life
","Essential film to watch. Director Martin Scorsese, and Screenwriter Paul Schrader shows a life full of private fear, emptiness, and loneliness in 'Taxi Driver'. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is that Taxi Driver, a Vietnam Vet whom seldom speak whom drifts in and out of 1970's New York City wicked night life. He witness a lot of wrongs and faults in civilization by how the people act around him. Robert De Niro character is similar to Don Quixote and Dostoyevsky's ''Idiot''. He is a good man trapped in an evil and sick world ,the difference with Travis is that he gets through it by becoming even more vicious than the world of slime, he inhabits whereas Quixote remains delusional and dies and the 'idiot' goes insane. He slowly growing tired of it, and losing hope and looks for a way out. These supporting cast ''way out' are Betsie and Iris. (Cybil Sheppard & Jolie Foster). Both being symbolic of Travis having a madonna/whore complex somewhat. Betsie is a campaign volunteer for Sentaor Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) who is running for President.. Iris is a 12-year-old child prostitute who is attempting to escape her pimp Matthew 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel) who he becomes obsessed with helping her return to her parents' home, sending her money to do so and a letter in which he states he will soon be dead. Disgusted by the street crime, politics and prostitution that he witnesses through the city, Travis finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training and shaving his head into a mohawk as he become a weapon for violence. The scary underlying concept in the movie that many overlook is that Travis Bickle is the manifestation of America of the 1970s. A confused society recovering from the failed war in Vietnam, from poverty of the working-class, from racism towards blacks, from drug addiction, and from mental illness. Bickle has adopted the confused mix of the military values of militancy, honor, and chivalry (his initial modest courtship of Betsy) with sexual perversion, racism, and disillusionment with society. The ending of the movie can be interpreted in many ways. Was Travis a hero or villain? Did he die or live? Some people might not like the movie, due to the sexual and racist undertones in the film, the violence, and the cursing. Taxi Driver is and will always be a disturbing film, however it's thought provoking and now there is a lot of depth to be seen in this very critical film. It's an experiment, NOT entertainment, only vaguely art. It presents no solutions, promotes despair, and really is a glorification of violence, and of the filmmakers own self conscious congratulations of himself on his own daring. It's a experiment of the mind.",8,0,0,17 November 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," O' Captain, My Captain. All Hail, the Captain! Captain America: Winter Soldier was pretty badass.
","From an optimistic WWII Pulp-inspired adventure movie to a morally ambiguous modern espionage thriller. While, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was indeed, a sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, the movie is only somewhat similar to that. Rather than facing cookie cutter type evil villains like the Nazism Hydra. Captain America (Chris Evans) find himself, in a world where it's harder to find who the villains are, as everybody has a shade of grey becoming more and more disillusioned as members of S.H.I.E.L.D attacking him. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the movie deals with a 2002's Minority Report precognition type plot that somewhat mirrors a lot of the post-Watergate political fears of the government will create something that will preemptively eliminate any future threats to national security without fair trials or judgment. It's also is a metaphor for the actual surveillance crap done by the NSA & drones strikes that most Americans find disturbing. Another motif is the increasing security measures the United States government has done since 9/11. The movie also tend to want to bring up Hydra again into this, as I thought it didn't had to, as it kinda made the realistic political power structure more cartoony. The Hydra subplot is just as ridiculous as the real life belief of Illuminati taking over the government, but I guess it kinda make sense, as Operation Paperclip was indeed a real life event thing. Still, I doubt a bunch of Nazism are leading the country. I thought it would better suited for H.A.M.M.E.R or the Thunderbolts. Something new from the comics. Still, this movie truly respects the philosophy and moral aspect that Captain America as a character represents towards America's society. 'This isn't freedom. This is fear,' -Captain America, he quotes about what's happening to the country. While, the movie is title, the Winter Soldier. Without spoiling who he is, he plays more like a henchman, than the leading villain. Adapted from the comic book, the origins of his past is way different here on the film as the movie blends elements from various sources and continuities. A good example of big change is key comic characters like Aleksander Lukin and Vasily Karpov are replaced. Still, the Winter Soldier isn't underplayed as he get a lot of scenes throughout the film. He is pretty awesome and match well to Captain America. Some of the hand to hand combat are just intense to watch. Most of the action scenes seem extremely realistic grounded and believable, even if it's bit over sci-fi and Captain America almost looks like God-like. I like how the action isn't all CGI orgy. The limit CGI in the film was used well in the last part of the film. The live action scenes get better with all the paranoia sub plot as you don't know, who is to be trusted and who isn't. Sadly, the movie is pretty predictable as who is the villains. The plot twists are not delivery correctly. I do find it, distracting that the movie makes up new or bring up new inventions on the spot, just for the villains or the heroes to escape. Too much deus ex machinas. Another thing, I dislike about the comic book movies is how often, they give us these 'fake' deaths, only to bring back the character later on the film, or in a sequel. If you going to kill a major character. People need to stay dead, or the film will lose a bit of sense of danger. There is a few shaky cam that hurt a little bit and some awful cuts. Another thing is while it's can be watch in 3D, there isn't much in the film that makes you want to. It's better off, if you watch the film in 2D. One last thing, there is a lot of nods to the first Captain film, 2012's Avengers, and even 2011's & 2013's Thor's movies as video clips, sight gags, or name references are throughout the film that pretty cool to see. It also felt like dumb recapping or exposition. Still, it was a bit odd to hear Dr. Strange. That would be interesting if he ever show up in a Marvel film. There are sight gags to other films like Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, War Games and others, worth watching out for. The acting in the film is pretty good. Falcon's (Anthony Mackie) presence is similarly unnecessary, but it's cool to have him around. He's pretty useful. Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) has nothing to do with his comic book counterpart, but he's just amazing. I love how Redford is hired for this film because of his work in previous political thrillers. I like how Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) opened up more in this movie. We got to see more of her vulnerable and human side, and her deeply hidden desire to connect with someone on a human level. A great female character for women. No, silly love story here. Still, how could she be a byproduct of the Cold War KGB if she was born 1983 and the Cold War ended in 1991? That doesn't make any sense. Also where is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in throughout the events of the film? I thought he was a top S.H.I.E.L.D agent and he doesn't shown up. Not even a cameo! Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) got a pretty good action sequence. Also looks out for other nameless cameos that you would play bigger parts in the next Captain America movie like Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) & Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Without spoiling the ending, it's bittersweet. The monochrome, symbolism-packed closing credits are reminiscent of the credits for a spy thriller such as one of the James Bond films. There is two after credits scenes worth noting. One is hinting 2015's Avengers: Age of Ulton. The other one is more closure. Also look for the Stan Lee Cameo. Overall: A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great film",8,9,16,5 April 2014
Life of Pi," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Lagan. This movie is fun to watch. It's easy like Pi.
","Written by Yann Martel, Life of Pi was one of those novels that most filmmakers thought was un-filmable. The reasons why are because 'Life of Pi' deals with the main character grew up trying to find the ultimate truth of life by questioning different religions and aspires to find that ultimate truth one day. Life of Pi is about seeing the world through Pi's eyes. This is precisely why it's strongly called an un-filmable book because it's almost impossible to visualize on screen the combined feeling of every sight of the amazing spectacles that the ocean can show an young adult like Pi and how they take him closer to the answers for his questions. But, Directed Ang Lee succeeded in making this movie amazing. This movie visuals are amazing. Epic cinematography by Claudio Miranda. Ang Lee was able to make the near lifeless seem boring Pacific Ocean into a wondering trip into self-discovery and survivable. The 3D actually work, and wasn't cheesy at all. I love the soundtrack by Mychael Danna, it was beautiful to listen with the film. Life of Pi just had such a rich story. On the outside, it's basic. A castaway, kind of film. But Ang brings brilliant timing to the film which makes it emotional and strong. It's confusing at times and sometimes feels slow, but you forget about that because the movie is something that has good meaning, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Life of Pi is very faithful to the book, I'd suggest reading first, but anyways most of the film is about a young man name Piscine 'Pi' Patel who father own a zoo. Suraj Sharma plays Pi in his film debut and what a debut, he was great in the film. The scene where he kill the fish was emotional. Anyways, Pi and his family decide to travel to Canada for a better life, and hopefully make money selling the zoo animals. Too bad, nobody makes it beside Pi who survives a disaster at sea when his ship sank leaving him in a lifeboat with four animals on board. There is a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger name Richard Parker. Unlike, other human & animal relationship movies, that has the character befriend a wild animal to the point, it seem like it's a pet. This movie doesn't do that; at all. Most of the movie has Richard Parker wanting to eat the Indian boy. It wasn't until Pi establish himself as the alpha male that Richard Parker became less of a danger to him. I have to say the CGI tiger was the most realistic computer animal, I have ever saw. Good job! Still, Pi and Richard Parker must now learn to survive this harsh new world. For a PG film, it pretty dark with themes of cannibalism. Research Richard Parker and shipwrecks online. Some critics says it has warning about the dangers of increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and ocean acidification, but I really don't see that in this film. I do like the Gaia hypothesis that some critics point out. I can see it. Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say that the movie is really good. Still, it took a while for the film to get to the sinking scene with all the attempts at spirituality. While, I did love the scenes explaining who Pi is like the whole French swimming pool story, and Pi looking for religion and love. I just wish it didn't take so long to explain because I think the best part of the movie are the relationship with him and the tiger. I do love the idea that most of the narration coming from middle age Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to the novelist Yann Martel (Rafe Spall). Irrfan Khan gives one of his best acting here. I love the scene, where he explains what happen to Richard Parker. I was deeply surprised he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for this role. I do hate the fact that Yann Martel plagiarism the idea from Brazilian writer and physician Moacyr Scliar 1981's novel 'Max and the Cats'. Still, I think Life of Pi is a little bit better than 'Max and the Cats'. I have readt both in doing my research for the film. I just glad the director cut the state of delirium scene from the book. The twist in the end was so moving and truthful. It marked how humans are in fact like animals and also gave an alternative to the basic perception of life; do you chose to view life through science and reason, or religion. The movie is deeply religionists, but it didn't bug me like other critics. I love the symbolism of the island of algae. It represents the atheist mindset that we eat till death and we get consumed by the world itself in the end and nothing matters, a bleek future. I myself, as an agnostic, I understand the brute cruelty meaningless of this world. Raw matter organized itself with an organic backbone and over the course of billions of years of improvement, it emerged to artificially build a society upon all that nothingness. I agree, it's best to remain agnostic because you have no concrete answers about the universe. Atheism is a form of concluding one's mind, not a fan. Overall: The thing I like about this movie is that whichever story you believe, your right and both a physically possible whether you believe the literal or metaphorical meaning it is both equally plausible.",9,3,5,27 July 2013
Doctor Strange," No doubt about it. This movie was indeed strange. I kinda like this superhero version of a kaleidoscope LSD trip!
","During the psychedelic era of the late 1960, as many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. This would also have an influence on the field of medicine, as many people seek the various practices of eastern spiritual medicine over the science of western health, during that day. In order to capitalize on that, creator Steve Ditko and Marvel Comics created 'Doctor Strange'. Inspired by old school radio adventure serials mystical programs like 'Chandu the Magician' & 'Mandrake', 'Doctor Strange' tells the story of a former neurosurgeon turn sorcerer, Doctor Stephen Strange on his quest to reclaim his broken body, while also having to protect the Earth against magical and mystical threats. The comic book character soon became very popular. So, it was no surprised that Marvel Studios would one day, bring this comic book character to live action on the big screen. However it took many years for their plans to work. The first attempt in 1978 was so badly made, that they choose to air it as a TV movie. Their next try was in 1992, with 'Doctor Morbid'. Due to the studio's license to the character expired before production has finished, the film had to change a lot from the source material. It was equally as bad as the 1978's version. The 2007's cartoon movie was alright, but it wasn't until 2016, that 'Doctor Strange' finally hit the big screen with great results. Being the fourteenth film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film directed by Scott Derrickson finally gave us, the magical spell-bounding visuals, this series needed. Remind me so much of 1999's 'The Matrix' & 2010's 'Inception' in a way. Marvel comics fans will also be pleased to see that the original Doctor Strange art by the character's co-creator, Steve Ditko, is not forgotten and paid proper respect. Kudos as well to Michael Giacchino's appropriately drug-fuel score, which helps propel the action. I also find the clever cameo from both writer Stan Lee, and the foreshadowing end credits, pitching 'Thor: Ragnarok' fun to see. However, the writing from screenwriters, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, could need some work, as it felt a bit unbelievable in the coincidences. Like how did the 'Orb of Agamotto' get from the throne room from 2011's 'Thor' to one of the sanctums control by the Kamar-Taj? Also, the whole idea of time-travel seem a bit rush, and somewhat confusing. Another thing it's really hard to believe that Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), at first, would be, so against magic, seeking how both witchcraft, supernatural beings, and aliens, population his world in all of the Marvel movies. It's so hard to believe that the only damage, the rich selfish guy would had from a car crash is nerve damage in his hand. Anyways, while the first part feels a bit formulaic, having seen similar comic book story arches both in 2008's 'Iron Man' and 2005's 'Batman Begins', my main gripe against the film was the out of place, force humor, poorly written female characters and underdeveloped villains. Don't get me wrong, Cumberbatch is perfect choice to play Strange, as his own mixture of gravitas, but he is far from being a great comedian. Leave the jokes to somebody else. Also, it was a bit disappointment to see Rachel McAdams having nothing much to do on screen, as Strange' former lover Christine Palmer. It's sad that she wouldn't get to be the hero 'Night Nurse', since the character Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who appears in Marvel's Netflix television series, will seem to portray her for a very long time. Yet, the worst has to be, the misused of Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius. The combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including 'certain individuals who live in other dimensions'. In other words, Mikkelsen was just a tool that was greatly underused. He is a generic, forgettable henchmen for Dr. Strange to fist-fight with. I wish, he was Kaluu, instead. I also feel that his superior, Dormammu (also played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is just as forgettable. The generic all-powerful smoke monster villain attacking Earth remind me, too much of 2007's 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' & 2011's 'Green Lantern' in a bad way. I felt that all the Dormammu stuff, could had cut off, seeing how it kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how one man can outsmart an all-powerful being like him. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? If anything, Karl Mondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) should had turn to the villain, faster. While, the film lacks memorable villains. The film made up with great actors for the supporting heroes in the film. Both Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor were wonderful as Karl Mondo and the Ancient One, even if it's a bit whitewashing. I'm for one, wasn't too angry, by the filmmakers choices that they were trying to avoid the Asian Fu Manchu stereotype. Yet, I can understand, the backlash from some audiences, of not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor. Still, it does almost comes off as a bit paternalistic to have the educated Western man save all the mystic foreigners from their own incompetence. 'It's a damn if you do, damn if you don't' decision. Still, the movie has a positive message about humility, and not being so arrogant. In the end, it was a fun trippy movie with a lot of potential for greater things in the future.",8,4,7,8 November 2016
Interstellar," Interstellar was indeed pretty stellar.
","Interstellar will divide the audience. Some of them will love and enjoy this movie, while others will see it as a boring film and feel the long 3 movie pace. Interstellar is no way, a popcorn fun film. It's a smart man film. It's remind me, so much of 1968's 2001: A Space Odessey, both in visuals and how people reaction to it. Both films, receive mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. I think like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie, Interstellar will garnered a cult following and slowly became a bigger box office hit, but right now, it's up in the air. While, the movie seem to taking a lot of homage to that film, Interstellar seem grounded by the director own identification. It's a film that couldn't blast away, even if a lot of determination went into making this film. The reason is, because people have become so aware of what Director & Writer Christopher Nolan will do. Without spoiling it, too much, the movie has a lot of overused Nolanism tropes & clichés. This means a lot of exposition dialogue with characters explain through dialogue their innermost feelings, instead of, acting those emotions out. Add the elaborate, flashback-heavy narrative structure, and lots of science mucho jumbo, and you get a film that will confused people. Some people think, it is a fallacy, but in my opinion, it's not inherently bad. They're alright in the right doses. People need to be challenge in films. People need to think. If you're so caught up on Nolanisms, you'll never let yourself enjoy the film, as a whole. I think some people just didn't get it. I don't blame them, I love the film, but parts of the film are indeed slow pace, and hard to understand. Even with a love for Quantum physics, space travel and psychology before this film, I had a hard time following what's going on. Like 2001 Space Odyssey, this movie lacks the broad appeal to an audience whom unaware for a need of such deep intelligent research. Maybe, it was a bit overreaching in its direction; as the film feels less a film, a more of a science lecture. You really have to tune in; to get, most of it. The trailers were no help, coming in. The film is about a team of astronauts whom travel through a wormhole in an attempt to find a potentially habitable planet that will sustain humanity, because Earth cannot longer manage life. I found a lot of things jarring in the film, like example, how they use a Saturn like rocket to escape out of Earth's astrosphere, but later on the film, they're able to leave, most planet's upper astrosphere with ease with their little spacecraft. A major error that I have spotted is the matter of the planets where gravitational forces cause such extreme time dilation that an hour on that planet equals seven years for us on Earth. Technically, yes, it's a possible, but the gravitational forces necessary to bring this about, would be so extreme that no planet, let alone people, would survive such gravity pull. Why couldn't they go to Saturn's moons? After all, scientists have pointed out that Saturn's moon Titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life. Save you the time, and effect. I know, everyone on Earth has infinite resources, despite large blight dust-clouds, but come on! The movie felt like two movies, mixed together. I think the first half of the film movie is very Sci-fiction, with the second half of the film after the wormhole, a bit Sci-fantasy, because how much, it lacks true science. Even if we can make a wormhole, the equations show that they're unstable and they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So, that's where the science fiction comes in. Kip Thorne put an amazing amount of research into the film, but the film does have some moments that you might have to suspend your disbelief in. I'm glad, the second half is that way, because it got really boring in the first half of the film. Way too much talking into the first part of the film. Most of the action and tense moments, play out in the second part. One of the biggest fears in the film is Einstein's special theory of relativity. I think the problem of relativity, played very well in the film as characters are afraid of wasting time. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer is a great role for him. I love the tense relationship with him, and his daughter, Murph played by Mackenzie Foy (Age 11) & Jessica Chastain (Age 37). You really see the pain that Cooper goes through, when he sees his children, growing up fast in front of him. While the ending is very clunky, it was very emotionally and physically draining to watch. Indeed, Matthew could act. He was the anchor that kept the story, grounded. Still, it was bit a stretch, at times, hard to believe, that his character spend most of his later life, farming, but still able to be an accurate ace pilot who can play a spacecraft through black holes, and dock on spinning out of control space station. Jessica Chastain is great in the secondary role. Anne Hathaway, while overacting in her role as Brand, Coop's co-explorer; was mostly alright, despite her character, doing a lot of stupid selfish things. The rest of the supporting cast were pretty good with their parts. I do love the smart ass robots. I thought the visuals were amazing. Must watch on IMAX. I thought the music by Han Zimmer was absolutely beautiful and really made the dramatic scenes including the end scene with the twist all the more engaging. Still, it was overbearing, and the sound mixer were pretty bad as I couldn't hear the dialogue, when the music is playing. Overall: Despite its faults, it's a good movie.",8,4,9,17 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Oohrah! Full Metal Jacket. This haunted portrayal of war is insanity well told. Me love it, long time.
","Being a soldier in the Vietnam War era had to be rough. Not only, was the war in Southeast Asia, a very arduous and evolving moral challenging affair, but going through boot camp for that date with the enemy was not kind. Especially, if you had to go through it, with a rigorous Senior Drill Instructor like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermy). However, somehow, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) was able to get survive this, only to find himself, in a world of hurt, once he finally see combat, and had to make the final choice to kill or not. Could he pull the trigger? Watch the film, to find out. Without spoiling the movie, too much; this film was loosely based on a book by author, Gustav Hasford called 'The Short Timers', which he wrote whilst serving in Vietnam. Both director, Stanley Kubrick, and screenwriter, Michael Herr, adapted this book into the screenplay, changing parts of it. While, the movie faithfully reproduces the first section of the novel, 'The Spirit of the Bayonet', with only minor differences in events and names. The second part of the movie change a lot of the dialogue, scenarios, and characters; by combining elements from chapters 'Body Count' and 'Grunt' & merging them into one to save the movie from a long runtime. Because of this, several key important sequences were left out or change, including: a character lapse into cannibalism, a tank running over people, and the real person, the protagonist has to force to kill. Because of this, Kubrick and Hasford did not get along, it got worst, when the filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work. In order to further distanced himself from the original author, Kubrick changed the title of the film to what it is today after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. This was finally draw, as Hasford didn't meet Kubrick ever again, nor attend the Oscar ceremonies when the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Anyways, regardless of the writing dispute, the movie is probably best remember for the scenes at Parris Island, at the Marine Corp Boot Camp, as most critics and audience love Ermy's portrayal as the strict drill instructor. His over the top bellowing acting & the comedic funny insults to Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) were by far, the most entertaining part of the film. However, it wasn't his first acting role like some critics may want to think. In truth, he play a similar character in Sidney J. Furie's 1978's film, 'The Boys in Company C'. Honestly, if you look at both movies as a whole, you would find a lot of similarities between them besides Ermy, to the point, that some critics believe that Kubrick & Hasford might have stolen ideas from Furie's work, or Furie's adapted Hasford's story without giving him, credit. It's hard to tell, who is the right and who is the wrong. All, I know, is both films, showcase the exposition of dehumanization & the loss of individuality and that catapults into men into fighting machines so well, with this movie's boot camp sequences being a little more accurate. Psychological & mentally conditioning techniques like the ones, show in the film, are indeed used to sharpen recruits, in order for them to obey all orders, work together, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle. However, I really doubt, much of physically hitting used by Hartman is allowed, even back then, without embroiled in controversy. As for the film's portrayal of marines in Vietnam. It could easily be mistaken for another film, as the footage looks and feels like other over the top, somewhat cartoony, Vietnam War films from that era, including 1979's film 'Apocalypse Now'. While, it's true, heinous acts were commit by some of them. Nevertheless, most of the vets out there, were highly discipline and acted accorded to qualities of what a good combatant should be. In short, they were more like the realism soldiers in 1986's film 'Platoon', than the shocking extremists of Francis Ford Coppola's movie. Regardless of that, the movie does a strong second half, both in action and moral message. It does not all fall apart or seem disjointed as some people think. The journalism parts are great examples of this. They're very interesting, as the men interviews in a faux like documentary perspective really have no clue, who they, even fighting against and why. Nor if they really winning the world. I like how each of their answers ranges from topics like lack of sex, religionist duty to downright insanity. It mirrors to every coercive persuasion that people like Hartman altered into them, in order to reduce the subject's ability to think critically or independently. I also love, how it foreshadows, future events. As for the ending with the sniper, it's very much of a symbol of loss of innocence. No wonder, the movie ends with a satirizing military infusing singing of a children song. It's haunting. Even the catchy pop songs were very well used. Most of the music compose by Kubrick's daughter, Abigail Mead was also great. The creepy industry background music in the climax is one such example. Compelling as hell. Those scenes in Hae must had been difficult to shot with all those chemicals in the air. No wonder, why the movie took forever to film. Despite that, the movie is very well shot. As for acting, all the performers did their jobs; but D'Onofrio really shines, as he gained 70 pounds to play Pyle. Talk about going to great lengths for a role. Best acting in the film, by far. Overall: Despite some flaws. If you want to get some! Go see this movie! It's a poignant masterpiece. It's a must watch for any Kubrick fan.",9,0,0,31 August 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Tom Joad will be there and so will this movie for you
","I'm will be there—to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity.",9,5,6,17 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: Episode IX the Rise of Mediocrity. The Skywalker Saga has fallen so low.
","It's clear now that this film franchise was doom from the start when Disney buy out Lucasfilm. Nobody had a clue how to further tell the story. So, director JJ Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy closely just rehash the same formulaic tropes of the original trilogy again with a few lazy reconstructing twists. They didn't even bother using with any of the establishing lore from books that could had made the films seen somewhat unique and new. Look, as much as people hate the prequels. At least, they gave us somewhat of a beginning tale that somewhat fit into the continuous story of the originals. As for these sequel series, they really do hurt most of the canon lore. This movie being the worst. It ruined the whole Skywalker redemption arch by having Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) return with yet again with the over clichÃ©s easy to pick off out of nowhere planet killing ships rather than going all in with more complex well-acted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). It also gave the whole Chosen One prophecy to somebody else. Perhaps the biggest let down in the movie was finding out that semi alright Rey (Daisy Ridley) does indeed have a grand gifted lineage rather than the idea that great power within the Force can manifest in anyone. Don't get me wrong, having Rey be related to the real villain is not a bad idea. It just shouldn't be biological parental because it's a bit off putting that somebody pork her grandfather. Instead she should be one of the many female Sith cultist clones that was model after Sidious including trailer fodder Darth Rey. Emperor Palpatine that died previous should be the male clone also separate from Sidious. It would better explain why the ancient dark lord look like in bad shape as he made copies upon copies of himself over time and why he can heal himself back once a clone like Rey dies. As for the old Supreme Leader. I would love to think that the reason why he looks rough was because he was one of the very few copies of the demise Darth Plagueis. It can explain why Sidious was able to gain control of him so easily. All this would make more sense than what the film gave us. Another thing that was disappointing is having Ren work with Sidious and Rey trying to burn the lightsaber. It dropped the ball with Rey's beliefs of preserving the past to gain knowledge and strength was counterpart to Kylo's wants to destroy it as he felt that it binds people to weakness and ignorance. The film also ignored their dyadic idealistic understanding that future peace can only be made with the meager of the cookie cutter light and the dark side of the force into the grey area way. It sucks. Also having Rey fall in love with the man that killed all her mentors is an unhealthy forced romantic relationship. Such a turn off more than the last movie. That was one thing that should had been retcon! At least Abrams keep the good thing about their communicate. The idea that they can move items through their mental and physical force powers despite not being in the same location was cool to witness even if it never established or used in the original or prequel series. Yet the used age of the new half-baked force healing was not well done. It makes demise seem like a game of hot potato. Likewise, if the force can straight up heal people and even bring them back from near death. Why would Jedis forbid the practice? It sounds like they could had saved the universe all this problem if they taught a certain Skywalker how to do it many moons ago. To add onto that the idea that most of the dead Jedis would be alright in helping Rey rather than any of the previous heroes like Luke (Mark Hamill) is such a cop out. She is more prone to use her anger and fear. Also, the idea that Sidious is able to use all the powers of all the Sith to knock out all the whole fleet through force lightning is over the top silly more than the Holdo maneuver, not only because every dark lord in the past has betrayed each other but as well their long history belief to limited their numbers to a very few. It makes no sense. Along with that, the whole 16 hours ancient Sith dagger wayfinder fetch quest really felt like wasted nonsense filler. The idea that the blade edge lines up perfectly with still surprising mostly intact wreckage of the Death Star was outrageous dumb luck seeing how the explosion burn it up nor the tough waters eroded the metal over time. The story pacing is kinda hard to believe like Rey fixing Luke's old ship in a few hours after years being underwater. It kinda like how they never explain how Maz Kanata voiced by Lupita Nyong'o got a hold with Luke's old lightsaber or what Finn (John Boyega) had to say to Rey. It's really bad editing. While the performers are great, their characters are wasted along with less annoying Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Also, the death of Carrie Fisher in late 2016 caused major problems in production as well. The repurpose unused footage of Leia was kinda jarring. The visual/special effects from ILM were still impressive along with the sets & costume but some of the action scenes does cause dangerous photosensitive epilepsy. Not good. At least the film score by John Williams was still amazing. Overall: This movie is a mess from start to the cheesy name changing finish. I can't act like the previous two were perfect, but this seems especially maclunkey. I didn't like it. At least 'the Mandalorian' TV show is giving new hope for Star Wars because this movie certainly tries to kill it.",6,2,4,24 June 2020
Pacific Rim," This film is an amazing tribute film to Japanese Kaiju and Mecha Genre
","It's a great summer blockbuster movie! This was a fun ride. Director Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It's outshine the Transformers series way up! I don't think the movie was ripping off a lot of Japanese Kaiju movies like 1954's Gojira and others, but making tribute to them. I saw a lot of plot references from other Japanese mecha works such as 1979's Mobile Suit Gundam, 1995's Neon Genesis Evangelion, 1989's Gunhead. I do also see a lot of references from American films such as 1989's Robot Jox, and 1993's Power Rangers as well. I like to see Mechas and Kaiju monster fighting against each other, so this movie was a treat. It's 100% badass. The film was very good in terms of visual effects. It had some good CGI effects. The movie starts out in 2020s (Honestly, they should have move the date up more) with an invasion of alien monstrous creatures call Kaiju, started rising from the Pacific Ocean from a portal from a different dimension wreaking havoc on humanity. To combat the giant Kaijus, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But more and more Kaijus continue to enter the portal, more than the Jaegers could be build and pilots could be train. On the verge of defeat, the only hope for mankind is a last ditch attempt to seal the portal once and for all. I do have to say, I love the acting in this film. Nobody really kept it down. I love Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket, the washed up former pilot who has to team up with an untested trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to control the Jaeger robot Gypsy Danger. I think Mako Mori is a very strong female character that hold up her own in the film and girls can look up to. It's nice seeing a strong Japanese character portray like this, then the dumb eye candy that follows the main character around. The person that made the film was Idris Elba as Marshall Stacker Pentecost. He's so commanding in the role. I do have to say that the other characters were walking stereotypes. Charles Day as the over the top scientist, Ron Perlman as the black market kaiju organ dealer gangster Hannibal Chau, and Robert Kazinsky as the hot shot Top Gun's 'Iceman' type pilot that is there just to be a jerk. While there is abundant Clichés and stereotypical characters. There was a pretty good emotional scene in the middle of the film that I love. Mako's flashback of her as a kid and the absence of other people emphasizes the terror she felt being all alone and chased by a kaiju. That little girl that portray a young Mako did an amazing job and I really felt for her, and the way she was holding on to her shoe was a highly powerful representation of her shock and fear, she was clasping to it for comfort and in that situation at that age. I do like how the film fits how the characters got to know each other by drifting. The mind meld drifting was still somewhat unclear. Using one right and another person left hemisphere to make one brain is confusing. I felt it was trying too hard to be 2010's Inception with this. Would repeat handshakes fill in the gaps that they apparently had? If they were wholly in each others' minds, do they really need to talk to each other? When the scientist drifted with the nearly dead brain piece how did the kaiju track him down? Why couldn't the kaiju just terraform the planet themselves and they kill the dinosaurs? It pose more questions than answers. The science in this doesn't make any sense at all, but after all it's a Sci-fiction movie, it doesn't have too. Honestly there were some things they could have cut such as the whole wall discussion and the side adventures of the scientist. It was stupid. They could have fit more time with the Jaegers. I was bit disappointed with the other Jaegers screen time. The action is amazing. I wish more daytime fights scenes with the monsters and more use of the sword. At less, give these Jaegers guns so they have more fighting chance. I can barely see what is going on with the night scenes. I think it's worth checking out in the theater. You will miss a lot if you don't go there. Just don't see it in 3D. 3D was annoying as it's hard to see due to 3D rain and snow. Everything was so dark, which hurts watching it in 3D. Everything happens at night for some reason, or underwater, or underwater at night, so it's hard to tell what's going on with in those scenes with the glasses on. Watching it on D-Box Simulators is interesting, but gimmicky. Very entertaining. The division of the film I think that cinema is moving towards a remarkable development and a very good overall story of the film is not original but exciting for the viewer. The Japanese have been making movies like this for years. Just without the fantastic CGI effects. So check out Pacific Rim!",8,7,14,18 July 2013
American Sniper," American Sniper hits the bull-eye. It reach its target audience. For others, it was a miss.
","This movie isn't for everybody. It's feel like the usual, over patriotic one-sided America Hollywood film that people will either love or hate. Does this movie seem a bit shallow and propaganda? Somewhat. The movie made it very clear that there were some really bad people in Iraq that had to be stopped. Still, it does question and criticize the Iraq War, without painting the American soldiers in a bad-light. Little to no shades of grey whatsoever. Could the movie go into more detail on the war and felt more well-balanced? Yes, but it's clear that this movie isn't for those people. It was for the people looking for heroes; out of the mess that was the Iraq War. They found heroic and role-model in U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Is it true, that Chris Kyle was somewhat racist and killed dozens of people for fighting for their country, when the US invaded and occupied the country of Iraq? Yes. Yet, on one hand, he is somewhat of victim, because he only wanted to do what seem good and he was misled in thinking it will come from this war. He indeed took a deadly toll, because of that moral belief. I think the movie did a pretty honest biopic of the man. Indeed, he was a hero to some people, and yes, he was somewhat a gung-ho war freak to others. In the end, no matter, what's your honest opinion, on the guy, you have to say that Chris Kyle indeed took his mission, very serious, protect his comrades and becomes one of the most lethal snipers in American history. Directed by Clint Eastwood, and based off Chris Kyle's autobiography American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. The movie tells the story of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) whom pinpoint accuracy, help saves countless America soldier's lives, but also makes him a prime target of insurgents during his four war tours in Iraq, with each tour taking more and more a PTSD ton of his well-being. Bradley Cooper had a gripping central performance as the man that couldn't stop fighting, Chris Kyle. He gain 40 pound of muscle to play his Captain America like hero, but acted like Captain Ahab. He made you believe that the Iraqi insurgents were the manifestation of all that is wrong with the world, and he feels that it is his destiny to eradicate this symbolic evil. Despite the content and the reality of the war, the movie doesn't paint, the people of Iraq in any good light. The movie tries to link Iraq to the tragic events of 9/11, but anybody with a brain, would know, that Iraq had little to do with it. You would think that there would be, at least some good Iraqi people in the film, but no, even the good ones end up, being villains for Chris Kyle to defeat. I try to never understand the logic of the action in this film. Indeed, it was graphic and brutal, but it felt a bit unrealistic at times with all the missions, he probably didn't go through. I guess, seeing him snipe people from a distance, can be a bit repetitious. The movie make it seem like he had to kill this one guy, Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), an ex-Olympic sniper before he was able to stop fighting. In my opinion, I think, the climax would had been a stronger film if he didn't get a chance to kill that character and all the years spent trying to, took the ton on him. Another disappoint is the lack of story after the war. It shows that he face PTSD, but the movie doesn't show the other stress, he had to deal with, like recriminations from lawyers, anti-war commenters and his fellow soldiers. Nor, does it tells us anything about him, writing his book. Most of the stateside scenes were filmed pretty mediocre. Sierra Miller as the wife, Taya seem a bit uninteresting. Her character has no personality, no job, no family and no inner life. Her own purpose in the film is to help Chris Kyle with his inner demons. I kinda hope for a more rounded character for her. It's pretty astonishing how one plastic baby prop can undercut a crying couple's emotional impact. It's also kinda disappointing, that he have no clue who the troubled veteran was, that he was trying to help in the end. Lots of miss opportunities to make the ending so much better. I glad, they didn't add the whole taking down carjackers in North Texas and looters during Hurricane Katrina or the time he 'supposedly' slugged Jesse 'The Body' Ventura for talking smack about Iraq from stories that Chris Kyle told people. Those stories clearly have ample amount of skepticism. Chris Kyle was known to exaggerate or fabricate his own accomplishments at times, some have questioned if a straightforward adaptation of his autobiography was appropriate. I have to agree, this film was a bit rush in production, way too early to tell if any of this events are honestly 'based on truth'. Whether the movie is pro or anti-war has been the source of much debate. Overall: Was it a good film? Yes. It was indeed well crafted from beginning to end. Could a little more time pre-production, made it a better film that everybody can watch? Yes. Still, it's a must-watch.",8,72,135,14 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars's Episode II got attacked by the fans. Was it a bad movie? No, but it wasn't good, too.
","Attack of the Clones is probably my less favorite Star Wars movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the originals movies more, but I don't hate the prequels like some fans do. Director George Lucas didn't rape my childhood. The prequels were pretty interesting for me. A story about Anakin Skywalker's rise and fall, how the empire got started, details about the Clone Wars, all of these ideas sound good. But it was executed in a way that wasn't that well done. It didn't felt like Star Wars, we came to love as children. The film is set 10 years after the events in 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a rebel Jedi named Count Dooku AKA General Robert E. Lee rip off (Christopher Lee), thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars. The first thing, I would notice about Attack of the Clones is how boring it is. There is barely any action in a film titled 'Star Wars' in this film. Even with the limited action scenes, with all the visual effects, it doesn't look real enough to care. No sense of danger in a world full of CGI. We know its CGI characters fighting other CGI characters. Why do we care about the clones? We have no feelings for them if they get killed nor do we care about the robots. The rest of the film is replace with talking scenes about politics, non-realistic love, and unrelated issues we can't even put our hands around. The audience is expected to accept too many things that we are told and not told about. Too much talk, and not enough show. Honestly, we not shown how the character feel about each other, but told how they are. How on Earth, is Anakin and Obi-Wan even good friends, they sound like they can't stand each other, most of the film? They complain about each other way too much. Plus, their action doesn't match their words. Obi Wan is supposed to be the mentor and Anakin is the loose-cannon, but in some scene, the roles are reverse. Obi Wan does stupid stuff like jumping out of a building onto a probe droid. Then Anakin jump into another speeder. Man, these scenes are way unrealistic and cartoony. Plus, the whole assassin plot really doesn't go anywhere, anyways as it tossed out halfway through the film. It was as useless as the shift shifter assassin who doesn't use his/her shift shifter powers. The whole relationship with Anakin with Padme is awkward and flat, too. It seem forced as hell as both have no reason why to love with each other. Both character are total different from each other and share little in common. Anakin is clearly violent, arrogant, and Padme still take the guy. It seem like one-dimension romance like Romeo and Juliet where they just madly fall for each other for no reason. Why couldn't they just make Padme tempt Anakin to sin by loving, similar to Eve tempting Adam with the apple? It would have made more sense. I don't understand why Senator Amidala isn't allow to love. Politicians have sex all the time, everybody knows that. Plus, I don't understand why love is banned in the Jedi Order. Its OK, to get angry as a Jedi, but to love is bad. The Jedi Order seems some of the dumbest people on Earth. First off, nobody check up on the missing Sith Lord from the last movie; second off, none of the Jedi had a clue that an army is being build and the guy that probably build it is probably the Sith Lord, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). It makes no sense. This movie makes Yoda (Frank Oz) look so dumb. I was deeply angry to see Yoda is force to fight with a Lightsaber. I thought of him like peaceful loving figure like Gandhi who didn't need a lightsaber because of his wisdom and knowledge. He was great Jedi master, because he master the force, not the lightsaber. I hate the fact, that George Lucas even have a scene where Yoda train children with lightsabers. Isn't that a bit dangerous for children? Why is Yoda doing this, anyways? Yoda never train Luke with a lightsaber in 1980's Empire Strike Back. He use the force, not weapons. In the end, the massive story and the virtual filmmaking kinda ruin of the film for some. I did like the movie. I don't want to leave this review with a sour note with only negative notes. There are good things about the film. Epic battle scenes. Another great score from John Williams. Alright acting from all the main actors. Great themes like warnings signs of fascism and how democracy can quickly fall. I didn't mind the poetic similarities in the prequels that remind us of the original source. I was pretty pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks has only a minor role. Last, I did like great world building of the film. The movie is watchable and still need to be check out if a big Star Wars fan. If you happen to be one of the very few movie audiences never to see a Star Wars film. Watch the Originals first, not this lousy movie. They are making sequels to the originals, so maybe there is a new hope coming soon. Let's hope so.",7,3,4,10 September 2013
Romeo + Juliet," This is what happen if William Shakespeare lived in the 1990's.
","This is how his plays would look like. Romeo and Juliet is just one revision by director Baz Luhrmann and the MTV Generation, as the 400 year old written text by thee William Shakespeare is put though a grinder, and out comes the meat of the story repacked and sold to the audience. Romeo and Juliet is the story, oops I meant Romeo + Juliet is the story of two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. While most people know the plot, this movie just gives you all the highlights clips of the film in prologue. Yes, you don't believe have to bother watching the film, it's just shoot it up there with fast pace zooming and out, with epic background music. Unlike the 1968 Zeffirelli version, this takes place in the fictional modern-day location called Verona Beach, where the two houses of Capulets and Montagues are just giant corporations. What do they sell? Who knows-- all we know is that they hate each other for some odd reason and it's ripping the city apart. The play was set in Italy, but in this film, I have no clue if it's Latin America, America or some country in Spain. Believe me, I love Shakespeare, but it has its place, and doesn't need to be reduced to nausea-inducing jokes like having guns manufactured by Sword, wild car crashes, and over used drug use. That's just stupid and unnecessary. This is an antiquated love story, made for its time and best when set in its time. There is nothing good about making a loud, obnoxious, absurdly anachronistic monstrosity and sometimes this movie go overboard. Everything is modern, but the language of the film. If you don't understand the language, READ and study the story first. The language is early modern English, but has been translated into dozens of modern languages. By modernizing many aspects of the story and using popular, engaging actors to portray the roles, a new generation of fans can appreciate the gift of Shakespeare. Who would've thought to update Shakespeare to a modern setting, keep the original language, replace daggers with gun, and add a kick ass soundtrack? Quite frankly, it's genius and the execution brilliant, but it's a bit annoying. This movie does shows how Shakespeare can transcend time,﻿culture, and age, but not well suite. I've always interpreted the story as a tragedy, not a love story. Romeo and Juliet is hardly a love story. Romeo (Leonardo DiCapiro) and Juliet (Claires Danes) are two love-sick teenagers rushing headlong toward doom. Claire Danes was so well casted. She fits this role as Julia perfectly. So innocent, so pure, so divine. Leo is not just a pretty face. It's his pure talent, his amazingly unique looks, the way he speaks, and laughs, his piercing eyes, the way he adapts into characters, his innocent yet cheeky intriguing personality, and his intelligence. I do love the scene where both of their character meet through a fish tank. It was catchy, but still both of their characters are flawed. Romeo and Juliet may be a satire of a romance story. Romantic love in the basic sense is nothing more or less than physical lust rather than﻿the deep connection between two human beings. This seems to ring thought the characters as much of the theme of the piece is more loin love rather than love. Throughout, we are bombarded by sexual references, most of which are jocular. In the Queen Mab monologue, for example, Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) points his heavy laden and loaded, weapon at his own youthful tangled emotions. A powder keg of hot blood tormented and moved in night straightening. Youth is often lead by it's loins, and often into trouble. The stirring of mad blood leading to a fatal fate. This movie kinda ruins that monologue using Queen Mab as a drug. Harold does a great old as Mercutio, but it felt like Mercutio was just there to be a homosexual cross dresser drug dealer. That's pretty far from the source there, Baz. As the film goes on, a number of great theme comes into play, the bright colors, immaculate hearts, religious symbols like crosses, and stage on the beach makes the film seem surreal and strange. The violence is not so poetic when you take a bullet to the head. Have they actually read the book? We are so in glue as if it's a true love story when it's source really wasn't saying that. The whole play takes place over like four days!﻿How is that true love?!Love is usually the cause of nothing but anguish for the character's in his plays. Love not only consumes their lives, but often ends with them dying, killing someone, or going through a lot of ridiculousness before they can have what they love. It's not based on the subject he wrote in, but how Shakespeare wrote about love that proves the above statement. There's a sonnet he wrote that details his thoughts on love, and it's not flattering. In the play they're supposed to be quite young and don't take time to make good decisions. Both Romeo and Juliet are deluded in their love for each other, and their romance is a product of them wanting to escape their realities. Wouldn't the simplest explanation for their romance﻿ be forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest? I think this modernization of Romeo and Juliet makes it more reliable and entertaining. The supporting actors like Pete Postlethwaite (Father Laurence), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Miriam Margolyes (the Nurse) all play their parts great. Kissing you by Des'ree is a great emotional song, but still Romeo and Juliet are so freaking unstable in the modern sense. It's not a happy ever after, but a tragedy that this couldn't live up to the 1968 version.",7,0,0,14 February 2013
Forrest Gump," Life is like a box of chocolates. You never truly know what you're gonna get. Forrest Gump is amazing!
","Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet.",9,2,2,30 July 2016
Southpaw," Southpaw wasn't a knock-out punch for me. It was watchable, but way too generic
","If you saw any boxing movie before, you seem them, all. This movie is no differs. Directed by Antonie Fuqua, and written by Kurt Sutter, the film tells the story of pro-fighter Billy 'The Great' Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to turn his around, on after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services. Can Billy Hope win this fight or will he lose his family for good? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I found that this sports drama to be pretty bland. Very unoriginal. To start with, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It was unbelievably predictable. It has every boxing film standard; the everyman fighter, the ultra-supportive wife, the rags to riches, riches to rags, type storyline culminating in the fight of the century. The film was originally considered as an unofficial follow-up to the 2002's movie, 8 Mile with Eminem reprising his role as Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith, becoming a professional boxer, instead of a rapper. Eminem even accepted the role and started to get ready to film a few scenes, only to back out of it, during the early stages of production. Since, Eminem wanted to focus on his music career, the idea of the 8 Mile sequel was scrapped. The role was then given to Jake Gyllenhaal, where the script eventually evolved into the film, that it is, today. Southpaw still does features a hard-driving hip-hop soundtrack by Eminem that meshes perfectly with jump-roping scenes and footwork-and-punching practice. The music was surprising, mixed very well, with the rest of the film. I have to say, the movie was beautifully shot. Great work from Antonie Fuqua. The acting in this movie, not so much. Don't get me wrong, Jake Gyllenhaal did an okay job acting, but he was totally unbelievable as a boxer, even after getting trained by pro-boxer, Miguel Cotto. Honestly, what type of pro-boxer, doesn't know, a little bit of defense!? It doesn't make sense. I have to say, his look was pretty good, for the most part. It was a huge accomplishment to get from playing an uber skinny man, a year ago in 2014's Nightcrawler to being totally ripped in this film. I give him, props for that, even if it's unhealthy as hell, to lose and gain that much weight in a short period of time. Still, it's not enough, to say, that his performance was great. Yes, he's ferocious and yet vulnerable, but I can't help, laughing at some of the character's deep dark moments in the movie, due to how over-the-top unsympathetic, his performance was. One thing that I didn't like about the film is that his character's metamorphosis from unlikeable immature boy to well-mannered adult, really comes out of nowhere. He and Rachel McAdams share a great chemistry, together on film, but sadly, it was short-lived. Rachel McAdams on her own, wasn't that great. Her death scene was a bit, silly. Oona Laurence as Billy Hope's kid, Leila Hope was mostly alright, but the way, she acted and look, remind me, way too much of the character, Margo from 2010's animation film, Despicable Me. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson was in the film, as Billy's manager, but he rarely add anything to the story. Forest Whitaker gives a crucial performance in this movie, as Tick Willis, Billy's new trainer. By far, he had the best performance in the film. The scene, where he's reacting to somebody's death was very memorable. Still, the movie lacks the heart of something like the Rocky series, or the smarts of 1980's Raging Bull. One of the biggest problems of the film is how uneven, it was. It really got unbelievable at times. I really don't know, how a man can go from being pay millions of dollars for prize fights to nearly bankrupt. There was no even flow from one situation to another. There needs to be more plausible reasons to explain the chain of events that leads to a person's downfall. The accidental shooting of his wife, I understand, but the loss of all his money and losing custody of his daughter in less than a few months was just a little to convenient. The premise needed a few more works. Overall: In my opinion, this was just a satisfying heart-tugging comeback story, that could had been great, but end up, being pretty mediocre. It didn't fight hard enough.",7,0,0,9 September 2015
Ant-Man," Ant-Man was kinda marvelous.
","Indeed, action comes in all sizes. Directed by Peyton Reed & written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd. This movie is based on the Marvel comic book property of the same name. It marks the twelfth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last entry in the MCU's Phase 2 slate. It was a great anty-hero movie. Its story follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a convict who is bailed out of prison by retired inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) for One Last Job: to steal Pym's research from his former company, before it can be abused by the firm's new owner Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). To accomplish this, Pym outfits Lang with the 'Ant-Man' suit, a piece of technology with the ability to both increase the wearer's strength and shrink them down to the size of an ant. Now, armed with this astonishing ability, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of evil villains. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say Ant-Man pull all sorts of antics! It was alright for the most part, but there were some things that 'bug' me about this film! First off, the whole movie is very clichés. Everything about the protagonist is kinda mediocre. The whole idea of him, having few legitimate prospects, and a young daughter and ex-wife to pay child support to, but wanting to commit one last job in a heist film before he retires from a life of crime is so overused. I saw this trope, in thousands of films. It's kinda boring. Another thing, is the whole corporate sabotage plot. It remind me, so much of the original 2008's Iron Man, film. I really didn't sense, much originality with it. Paul Rudd is alright as Ant-Man. It shows that he put, a lot of work, into the film, not only by helping write the story, but beefing up his body, very physique. Still, I didn't really see much of his comedic side in this film. By far, the best thing about the Ant Man is his ability to work with the Ants. I really wish, the movie focus more ant-training montages, than Scott, working a safe heist with his ex-con buddies. I really didn't like those characters, too much. I found them to be a bit one-dimensional negative stereotypes. Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym was fine, but it was a bit odd, seeing an older season Oscar winning, American actor like Douglas in a film like this. Still, he really deliver in whole, passing the torch, the mentor type role, very well. At first, I was very against Scott Lang being the Ant-Man, instead of Hank Pym, but I can now understand why, Marvel chose Lang over Pym. Hank Pym's past was indeed pretty dark. It might be a little too-family unfriendly for a Disney/Marvel film. However, I wish the filmmakers took the risk, and deemed Pym as Ant-Man, because it would make this film, more memorable. I would love the film to tackle, his several split personalities issues, his abusing relationship with his wife, and his fall to the dark-side, by becoming Yellow-Jacket, and making Ultron. It would make a very complex film. Instead, the movie plays it, off a little too safe. Evangeline Lilly as Hank's skeptical daughter, Hope could need some work. While, I know, she's there to showcase, her wanting to become the superheroine, the WASP. The chemistry between Scott and Hope is a predictable 'opposites attract' storyline. I could rather, have that storyline, cut from the film. While, the Marvel Comics 2 comics, Hope van Dyne/Hope Pym was an Ax-Crazy villain called Red Queen. Although she is on strained relations with her father in the film due to her mother's death years ago, she's more-or-less on the side of good here. I really doubt, she'll end up as a villain, in the next couple of films. However, Corey Stoll as the megalomaniacal villain, Dr. Darren Cross was an interested choice. He didn't shine, as much as I thought, he should had. While, Corey Stoll is a tremendous actor, his character was a bit underdeveloped and lackluster, when it comes to his plans. I don't why he couldn't sell, the goo gun to Hydra!? That's seem like a powerful weapon! The movie, Yellowjacket costume was indeed very threatening, and menacing. It's a lot better, than the silly comic-looking version. Still, it's too similar to the Ultron comic book design. I got often confused, coming into the film, on who's who. When it comes to the action, the movie did wonders, with the shrinking effects and some of the de-aged effects. I did like it. I did think the movie, overused the CGI, a bit much. Some scenes were really hard to believe in. Then there were some that were hard to see, due to the small ant-man flying around on the big screen. I would had, focus more on close-shots, than wide shots. The movie pacing is an alright, but it get a bit antsy toward the end. The movie has tons of Easter eggs and inside jokes to make comic book fans, laugh or take notice. Look forward to the Avengers and Stan Lee cameos. The after scene after the credits, will tickle your fancy. Still, my favorite, had to be Darren Cross jokes that the concept of a shrinking human sounds like a 'tale to astonish.' Ant-Man made his debut in the comic 'Tales to Astonish' #27, by the way. Still, there were a few jokes that were bothersome. The whole product placement gag, with Baskin Robbins was a little forced and Michael Pena was a little too annoying at times. Overall: Compare to the other Marvel Cinematic movies. Ant-Man wouldn't stand out tall, but Ant-man won't go away! It's permanent! It's a small wonder worth checking out! Go see it, if you want to.",8,5,14,23 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Let's jump into 21 Jump Street. Surprising it was pretty good.
","At first, I didn't want to watch this movie. Not that I'm loyal to the original or anything. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1987's show '21 Jump Street' nor did the trailers do any favors. The trailer look awful, and it seemed like an entirely pointless remake. I did however watch this movie when my friends told me that I should give it a try. I guess the movie had a lot of Street Cred. Surprising this movie was pretty good, and pretty damn funny. The movie starts out with not the original cast or even the same characters of the show, but two new characters in their high school days. While, it's only for a very brief time on film, just long enough to establish Schmidt (Jonah Hill) as an insecure nerd and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as a dumb jock. It then cuts to present day, where both are working as undercover cops on Jump Street. The new cops are tasked with finding the supplier of a new recreational drug called 'HFS'. For them, to find him, they must go undercover at the local high school, and forced to relive their old high school days. They soon find out that surprising, the high school life has change since their outing. The movie comedy is mostly hits for me, as I love how they make fun of high school comedy and buddy-cop clichés. There are a lot of unexpected and hilarious lines delivered totally straight forward. The movie does have quite a few moments of parody that were pretty funny. This is just one of those high school movie clichés that the movie had to hit. The high school over the top party. The twist here is that the party is being put on by a couple of totally irresponsible and stupid adults, who not only have access to alcohol but an entire evidence locker full of illegal drugs. I find this part of the movie, a bit of contradiction. Schmidt and Jenko try to arrest a bunch of bikers in the beginning of the movie, for smoking marijuana. Then later on the film, they steals marijuana to be used at the party. How is it, OK for them to smoke 'Mary Jane' and not the bikers? Also, the movie glorified their irresponsible for serving alcohol to minors is just wrong. Also how the movie makes it seem that if you want to have a good time, take drugs and drink alcohol. Don't add glamor to that kind of stuff for minors. That's why we have stupid shows like 16 & Pregnant. Don't ask how they even became cops in the first place, and how they never get punished for any of the mistakes they do throughout the film like forgetting the Miranda rights, stealing cars, and weapon discharge. Not one disciplinary action for anything they do. Also how is Jonah Hill's character Schmidt allow to hit on Molly (Brie Larson) when she could be underage? The movie never establish what her age is, but if she is 17, that's still a criminal act of having relationship with a minor. They make several gags in the movie about how Jenko and Schmidt look old, yet the actors portraying the high schoolers don't look like they belong there, too. The only ones, I did believe were in high school was the so called geeks. The acting is pretty good from all the cast. Yes, there are a few cameos of the Original cast of '21 Jump Street' playing themselves. While the TV show was taking as a serious crime drama, the movie makes it seem like a joke, even beloved characters are made out to be silly. If you are a fan of the 1987's show, you might find this movie making fun of you, and making you feel stupid for liking the original show. I don't get the film, is it trying to pay tribute to the show or parody it? The movie has false advertising written all over. For the regular fans of the show, do warning, this movie isn't like the show. Anyways their cameo is very short so if you're not paying attention, you might miss it. By the way, check all the shots on the TV in the film. Look at the scene where they are getting a car, and last the scene where the drug deal go wrong. You will find them there. The music choices for film are pretty good, but I can do without that damn Kesha's song in the end. Overall, the movie is pretty entertaining to me. So go see it.",7,4,6,16 May 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," USA! USA! USA! Captain America: First Avenger was awesome throwback to the Golden Age of Comics.
","Captain America: First Avenger is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its serves somewhat as a prequel. This film is not to be confused with the 1990 film Captain America, or the two Captain America TV movies from the 1970s, or the classic movie serials from the 1940s, all of which have no relation to this film, aside from being based on the same comic book character. Comic books such as the movie's source material, the original Captain America #1, gained immense popularity during World War II as cheap, portable, and easily read tales. Most of them, were about superheroes batting the Axis Powers. This movie is paying homage to those early comics! It has adventure mixes patriotism, and explosive action. Directed by Joe Johnston, First Avenger tells the story of US Army reject Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who volunteers for a secret government program which transforms him into the world's first super soldier. As Captain America, Rogers goes to war against Nazi Germany's military forces — including HYDRA division, Johann Schmidt AKA Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), who has his own plans for world domination. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie is fun to watch, but somewhat dated. There was nothing new to be found. Honestly, I was hoping for a more Indiana Jones type story, here, but the movie doesn't have much depth. The story felt a little one-dimension. It didn't even bother explaining what the Tesseract McGuffin does. The movie kinda forces it's viewers to do some research, coming in. It's like the movie is imposing you to see Marvel's previous film, 2011's Thor, so you wouldn't get lost. That's not right. The movie could have, so much more, explaining than it gave on its own. There were a lot of odd plot-holes, and misdirection. I wish, the movie focus more on the super soldier formula, more than the Tesseract. It kinda pull the plot, apart. Honestly, I have no idea why the German try to steal the super soldier formula, if weren't going to use it. The super soldier formula never pay off, in the film as it rarely mention beyond the first act. Also, I still have no idea, why Steve Rogers was put on USO duties for so long. It's really strange. Why didn't the military use Captain America, better? It's like having an Atom Bomb and instead of using it, Harry Thurman sent Enola Gay to do airshows for the public for War Bonds. It doesn't make sense!?! Even in comic book terms. It's also very bizarre, how many years, it takes for Red Skull is bomb, America. It's like the villains were wasting time! They had plenty of time, to build it! Way, before Steve Rogers show up, and destroyed all their production factories. For villains with a powerful superweapon, they were very underdeveloped. Red Skull spends more time building his death plane and reminding us how evil he is, rather than, showing that he can be a true threat for Captain America. No wonder, why Nazi Germany lose the war. Even, the climax was a bit confusing; they never did make a good account on how Captain America reach the present day. If the director and the script took more chances with the material, Marvel could have had their best movie ever. Instead, they have an alright film. While, the story is pretty mediocre. I have to say, the movie had some good set pieces. While, I got the sense that I was in the 1940s, the technology for the film didn't match up, historical. It was a bit jarring. I guess, they were going for a World War Sci-Fi Futurama feel. The action is a bit unrealistic at times, but it's somewhat entertaining. The CGI stunt work was alright; but I was hoping for more real stunt work. I love the way, the movie photo shop and use visual effects to transform Chris Evan's buff body to make him, look like a small skinny weakling. That's really amazing! Mad props to those guys! I have to give, Chris Evans, some credit for having a well tone body as well. He looks the part. What I like about Chris Evans's performance of Steve Rogers was that he didn't come off with the same attitude and cockiest of his previous role as the Human Torch in 2005's Fantastic Four. Still, the movie didn't take any significant creative risk with any of the movie characters. Captain America is a plain old boy-scout. Red Skull is over the top plain evil. The supporting characters are worse, the lovely-and-capable Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and James 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) had little to no chemistry with Steve Rogers. I really didn't buy them, being Roger's love interest and Cap's best friend. Both of the actors, acting was a bit off-putting here. One of the film's highlights are the Howling Commandos, a group of ragtag soldiers whom Cap breaks out of a POW camp. They honestly deserve their own movie, rather than extended cameos, here. Having big names play Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) & Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) was kinda a mistake, as they somewhat overshadow, the other supporting characters, due to how well- their acting was. While, the overall acting was meh, Captain America soundtrack was booming. I love the score by composter, Alan Silvestri. It really capture the over the top, superhero feel, without going all broody and dark. It's remind me so much of the original 1978's Superman main theme song. One thing that I love about the movie is the musical number, 'Star Spangled Man With a Plan'. This song would get me to buy war bonds. It was so catchy. One thing, missing in the film was humor. The movie was very lackluster when it comes to that. Overall: Captain America is like a firework. It's has explodes, but in the long run, it's get kinda smoky and unclear. Not the best Marvel film.",7,3,5,3 July 2015
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 Things why I hate this movie & 10 things why I like this movie.
","'10 Things I hate about you' is a very interesting movie in the late 90's. High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of our lives. I watch it when I was indeed at the age where it was fun to watch, but after 10 years of maturity out of my teenager stage and into adulthood, this movie became harder and harder to watch for me. It's still watchable, but the story isn't that fresh to me anymore. '10 Things I hate about you' is loosely a modern retelling of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and in here, its transfers to a modern-day high school comedy. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is the shrew, who isn't very kind to anybody. Her younger sister Bianca (Laris Oleynik) is more poised for high school wanting to date people. Don't know why they couldn't have kept the original last name of Minola, but Stratford works alright, since in this 'world', William Shakespeare's works do exist here. What I hate about the film version of Bianca, is that she isn't ingénue at all. She isn't that sweet, and not virginal at all. She doing this to get more and more popular in the school. Anyways, their overprotective father (Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until men-hating Kat does, which is to say never. Larry Millers gives a lot of good humor as the paranoid father who scare of his girls becoming pregnant teenagers. Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who wants to date Bianca, heard about this, he hires the boastful, selfish, mercurial Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to go on dates with Kate. Of course, like any other high school drama what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as both Kate and Patrick might love each other. Here is the 10 Things what I love about the movie. 1: it's sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teen humor. 2. Great adult characters such as the English teacher (Daryl Mitchell) could have stolen this movie out from under all the other stars if he'd had just one more scene. Or just a few more minutes of screen time than he already had. Like really, he had some of the best lines, the funniest zingers and the funniest things to say. Also the guidance counselor (Allison Janney) had some interesting humor like secretly writing a trashy romantic sex novel. In real life, I doubt these two characters would ever become teacher, and yet again probably not allow to step on the high school grounds at all. 3. Heath Ledger was just a promising actor at the time. He will be miss. 4. I love all the Shakespeare references. 5. The main characters aren't sugar-coated; there's something charming yet detestable about all of them. 6. Great soundtrack with awesome 1990's songs. 7. The ending works. 8. There are key scenes that I love such as the paint-ball scene, the 10 Things I hate about you speech and Heath Ledger singing. 8. Not really a chick flick, as there are things about even the guys to love. 9. Amazing cast of worth good actors. 10. In my opinion, the best high school comedy of the 1990s. 10 Things I don't like about the movie are 1. The over use of high school clichés as a grouping or labels. 2. The party scene with underage drinking 3. The cheesy rich character Andrew Keegan plays. It's a 1980's, early 1990's bad teenager stereotype. 4. The characters could be a little bit too mean 5. The washing down of Shakespearean characters and dialogue or mistakes. The cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. In the Shakespeare version, the younger sister could not marry until her shrewish sister did. This was a custom of the time. Here it's seems weird to have that in a modern day settling. 6. Lacks of the deep social themes that made Taming to the Shrew famous such as the economic aspects of marriage and the Effect of Social Roles on Individual Happiness. 7. The plot was completely predictable 8. Annoying teenager drama that doesn't really matter in the long run of life. The people who were dating kept on getting mad at each other and made up about three times. I don't want to hear people complain about their teenager's life when adulthood is a lot harder. 9. Some parts were unrealistic, it's a bit annoying. 10. The original story wasn't supposed to be romantic comedy. In the original play, Petruchio sees Katharine as a challenge for his manhood, and rather than using romantics, he abuses her into submission through starvation and intimidation. Petruchio wins the bet because he has essentially bullied Katherine into an obedient, submissive wife. Not a really romantic story indeed. Anyways, overall: the film is pretty good at the time. I was a bit surprised that it was PG-13 than R, but for parents do warning, even if its PG-13 doesn't mean it for all teenagers. There is quite a lot of sex-related dialogue, some nude artwork, and teen drinking that need a more mature audience to watch. Disappointed that there is little alleged connections to the 16th century play, but its OK because it works out for a teenager popcorn flick. So check it out if you want to.",6,3,6,30 May 2013
Predator," The Predator is worth hunting for. What a great horror action movie!
","Set in the jungles of Latin America, 'Predator' follows a team of mercenary-commandos led by Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) on a U.S. military rescue mission to liberate hostages taken by leftist guerillas; only to find themselves, secretly stalk and hunted by a mysterious otherworldly creature who is using the warzone as his own 'most dangerous game' safari. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this ultra-macho sci fi movie that inspired many sequels, spin off & remakes has more to offer than it seems. While, the violent, militaristic spectacle of biceps, bombs, and guns might seem more brawn than brain; in truth, the film is smarter than its leads us to believe. Surprising, it has a lot of Hitchcockism feel to it. First off, the movie directed by John McTiernan starts out with a McGuffin mission plot that is later, abandoned for the more intense, close encounters of the third kind. Then, there is the way, this movie is mostly view by the alien's point of view. It's almost voyeurism. Not since the days of 1975's 'Jaws', has an unseen monster viewpoint been so scary. Even the vantage point shots from the soldiers were suspenseful as hell, as one of the appeals of this film is trying to find the hard to see Predator, due to his light-bending camouflage suit. Yes, I know, this was done, because how limited the digital special effects were, back in the day, but it gave the first movie, a sense of thrills that current horror films seem to lack, by showing everything in trailers and in the opening moments of the movie. In truth, we don't need to see the monster, as much as we think, we do. I love films that built it up, until the end. When, we do, see the creature. It felt earn, as we invested, so much time on seeing, what this being, looks like. The pacing for this film is well-balance. Also, I have to give mad props to Stan Winston for the monster design, as the original suit look like crap. I can't believe, Jean-Claude Van Damme almost played an ugly giant cockroach. Muscles from Brussels obviously ended up leaving the film when he found out that he was little more than a stunt man, and ex-basketball player, Kevin Peter Hall took the role, and ran with it. Thank goodness, because I doubt JCVD can do, any of his martial arts with that heavy set suit. Despite that, this movie is led by an incredibly lethal military unit, made up of a cast of colorful characters, including Blaine Cooper, played by future-governor, Jesse Ventura of pro-wrestling fame & Colonel George Dillon played by Carl Weathers of 'Rocky' fame that gives the film, plenty of catchphrases. Whether they were getting to the 'choppah' or not having enough time to bleed, it was the surprisingly amusing characters interplay that helped make Predator so successful in the first place, despite the actors had to put through a variety of hardships such as leeches, snakes, stifling humidity, heat and rough terrain. They were indeed tough. However, there were some flaws in their characters. First off, the whole 'mercenary code of ethics' message isn't well-delivered here, as the men do seem a say a lot of awful things & might be a little bit over cruel and kill happy with their enemies. Also, while the movie has brilliant choreographed, setting up the men for battle. The action scene with the easy to kill Communists forces seem to be, a bit cartoonish and over the top with certain shots, badly & generic repetitive shot. Not to mention, somewhat cheesy, as some of the jokes, fell flat. In fact, this whole segment kinda took me out of the movie, for a bit. I felt like I was watching 1985's 'Commando', than a great horror movie. There is obviously some sizeable tongue planted firmly in cheek here. It kinda hurt the film, as it impossible to take these men as a serious threat to the Predator with their Gung Ho approach to the camp ambush. Radioactive levels of machismo! Thank God, the Predator shows up, and what was a textbook Arnold action flick rapidly descends back to genuinely cat & mouse stalker film. Still, there were a few things, I was disappointed by the later part of the film, such as the off-screen fight between Billy Sole (Sonny Landham) & the Predator. Could it, really be that hard to show them, fight to the death!? Also, why did Anna Gonsalves (Elpidia Carrillo) go to the chopper, instead of escaping!? After all, isn't this jungle, her home!? She could had just join up, with the rest of their guerrilla fighters, instead of being a prisoner!? It's a win-win for her. Despite that, I do have to say, Arnold is by far, the best part of this film, even with his nearly impenetrable accent, and cartoonish physique. Schwarzenegger manage to bring the guns, and the 'guns' AKA 'muscle' to what was a very entertaining climax to the film. A very well-deserve fight. The music that follows it, by composer Alan Silvestri, and the end credit, bow & smile with the cast members was icing on top of a delicious well bake cake. Overall: For a movie inspired by a running joke in Hollywood about Rocky Balboa of the 'Rocky' series of films fighting 1982's 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'. I can appreciate its evolution, magnificent and brilliantly take on the man vs monster aspect, even if it's a bit cartoony. I really do like this movie. I think you would like it, too. So check it out!",8,5,5,2 March 2017
Nightcrawler," To win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket. Nightcrawler is a wicked thriller
","Set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles, Nightcrawler tells the disturbing story of a career driven young man, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) who find that shooting footage of accidents and crimes in Los Angeles to sell to news channels is big business. Aided by Nina (Rene Russo), a veteran TV news producer, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to dangerous new heights. Directed and written by first time director, Dan Gilroy is indeed a character driven story, as Jake Gyllenhaal really pull, no stops when it comes to Lou Bloom. Note the subtly of Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He speaks in an eerie monotone. He speaks like an evil business motivational speaker who acts like he's for your best interested, but in truth, he's manipulating the people around him to get his way. This part remind me of something out of 2000's American Psycho. The way, he tries hard to hide his alternate motive and his psychopathic ego from his co-workers with a hollow smile and articulate demeanor. You can tell that he's misanthrope, who could snap in any minute. I like how he asks so eagerly for a job. How his eyebrows jot up during his little speech, displaying that this has all been thought out well beforehand, like he has rehearsed what he would say. Then, how he tries to hide his disappointment to mask his pride when things don't go his way. It was very creepy. Gyllenhaal might have got too into the character, as he literally hurt himself, during filming. A good example of this is the mirror scene, where he end up cutting his hand. When, it comes to his extreme weight lost for the film, it's scary how sharped, his skinny gaunt body tone does makes him look ghoulish as if a man who hasn't sleep in years. Remind me of Gollum. It makes him look metaphoric and physical hungry to get anything, he wants. It's like watching a 'Car crash'. In a way, you don't want to root for the guy, but you can't help, watching how captivating and unnerving, he can be. Clearly, an award nomination is worthy, for sure for Jake Gyllenhaal. Even supporting characters like Rene Russo really stand out, despite her, not acting in many of movies, as of late. Plus, she pretty attractive at her mature age. If anything can be said, against the film is that it wasn't disturbing enough. The violence in the film is pretty tame and not that graphic, compare to other dark movie concepts like 1976's Taxi Driver. This movie serves more like a dark satire social commentary of how dark the media can be. It reminds me, so much of 2014 David Fincher's film, 'Gone Girl', on how much, the media can be both dishonesty and devious. It kinda makes real life news people like Kent Shocknek, Sharon Tay, and Pat Harvey look like lying jerks. While, the movie is mostly fiction, there are some true in how cut-throat the news business can be. Unlike it portray on film, I doubt in real life, a news station would be able to show a lot of graphic footage. Still, I can see a story being change, to push an adjective on somebody. There has been examples of that in the past of people acting like vulture, feeding on other people's misery. The film also touch upon, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy. While, Nightcrawler makes 'stringers' seem like they can make big money off of filming tragedy, in reality, there isn't much money to be earned. Yes, a stringer could bag several thousand dollars for the right footage, but most of the time, local news operations are really unwilling to open up their wallets for film footage when they can get it for free or find other multiply choices. The world has change, as a lot of people with digital media cameras are giving away footage for nothing, posting things on sites such as Youtube or Twitter. To make things worse, for stringers; Police encryption on scanners has also become an issue. Now, it's harder to listen in, to 911 dispatch calls. The movie serves more like a neo-noir fever dream of an L.A. than in real life. The movie might have some symbolism, after all, the movie title character is named Lou, as if he's basically named after Lucifer. Think of the story of Lucifer when you look into this film. How he fell from grace due to his over-demanding pride. How he tempted others through manipulation and a clever tongue. It's really no surprise, that Lou drives a bright red car through the shallow streets of Los Angeles at night. Could, Nightcrawler be a symbol for evil? Who Knows? The mystery of the film makes it all engaging. This movie is indeed a thought-provoking film. One thing, the movie could had done better is the soundtrack. If anything, this movie needed Trent Reznor. I don't mind, James Newton Howard, but the film score sounds too generic. The cinematography could had work a little more. I like how the opening shots, but as the movie moves on, Gilroy's vision of modern-day Los Angeles isn't quite as visually sophisticated. I was really hoping, it would be just as beautiful as night films set in L.A like 2004's Collateral and 2011's Drive. Another problem of the film is its pacing. I believe the bitter ending went a little too long, and end unrealistic. How on earth, did he not get in trouble for the car chase? The film really didn't really end in a height note. Overall: it's a very skin-crawling film. This movie knows full well that these types of stories sell best, and Lou is happy to accommodate. In the movie words, what grabs the audience is 'a woman running down the street, screaming, with her throat about to slit'. Indeed, it felt like that.",8,3,4,11 December 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Do the Donkey Roll! This music mockumentary was really stupid, but also kinda funny.
","From the minds of Saturday Night Live veterans: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone (collectively known as The Lonely Island) comes an over-the-top comedy about a fading pop-star singer known as Conner Friel AKA Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) who must rethinks his career after his second solo album 'Connquest' tank at the Billboard 100 chart. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film directed by Schaffer and Taccone is offering nothing new. After all, 1984's 'This is Spiral Tap' & 1978's 'The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash' did the music mockumentary, way better than this movie even did. Also, this movie plot arc is a familiar one: An arrogant celebrity falls from grace, but eventually realizes his own pride and narcissism have contributed to that downfall. So, in sense, the story is a little tiresome, clichÃ©s and predictable. However, I think, the reason why, this over the top movie work is because it's so funny. While, this movie lacks believable. It's make up for its lack of seriously, in its utterly outrageous nature. Yet, the whole thing felt a bit lazy, as they were really going for the low hanging fruit with this film. The jokes were a little too juvenile and gross with the sexual innuendo and harsh language for some viewers, but for me, I didn't mind it, because it landed hard on my funny bone. I found the whole thing, very laughable, even if it's low brow and relies too much on shock value like graphic nudity, drug use, and violence. Who knows, if the penis feature in the film is producer Judd Apatow's junk or not, but it was funny to see. Yet, the whole joke about the man who entire job is punching him in the nuts to remind Conner where he came from, could had been, use more. It's seem like it was forgotten. I also like the fact that the movie is a parody of Justin Bieber's career and his 2011's documentary movie 'Never Say Never'. So, that is a plus. However, the parody of the Celebrity Gossip Show 'TMZ' was kinda fall flat for me. Still, I love the other cultural references in the film such as Disney 1998's 'Parent Trap'. That was semi-OK. However, it's the songs written by Lonely Island that made the movie. I have a blast, listening to the lyrics of 'The Finest Girl', 'Donkey Roll', 'Incredible Thoughts' and 'I'm so humble' written by the Lonely Island. Yet, there were other songs that I kinda wish, were in the film, like 'F**k Off' that was deleted from the film. Even the songs like 'Two Banditos' and 'Hunter the Hungry Is Gon' Eat' with controversial rapper, Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) were kinda funny, even if it's highly offensive. I think Andy Samberg did a great job as the narcissism Conner4Real in his acting, rapping and singing. His character was trouble, but not unlikable. The other fictional characters in this film, are just as watchable. I love the character of Owen (Jorma Taccone) even if it is way too similar to the Kevin Powell role from 2007's 'Hot Rod'. I also dig the short cameo of Justin Timberlake as Tyrus Quash, Conner's chef, even if it's uncredited. Made me wish for the days of SNL Digital Shorts. I also enjoy the cameos of other SNL alums pop up, too, like Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, Will Arnett, and Bill Hader. Yet, it's the other celebrity cameos that were a lot memorable. Singers like Adam Levine, Seal and Michael Bolton playing themselves, gave the movie, the best laughs. Others, not so much. The interviews parts with Ringo Starr, Nas, Simon Cowell and others, felt out of place, and not well-used. It's weird to hear them, talk about Conner4real as if he has been singing for years. It doesn't make sense that a young Usher would go into dancing, because of the Style Boys 'Donkey Roll', when, technically they're the same age. The whole 'archival' footage doesn't add up as well. I really have no clue, how old Conner4real is supposed to be. Overall: I wouldn't say, I'm a Style Boy for Life, but I do have to say the movie is kinda dope, even if being dope isn't always what it's cracked up to be. Still, highly recommended.",6,4,7,19 September 2016
Oblivion," Tom Cruise and this movie are an effective team, Sally. It's another day in paradise
","The best way to describe Oblivion is the Modern Day 1968's 2001 Space Odyssey. It's a movie that really makes you think, so it's a great Sci-fiction movie. I think a lot of critics are bashing it because the fact that Tom Cruise is a scientologist, and the film mimics a bit of their faith. In my opinion, I can care less about Tom Cruise's personal life, as long as the movie he is starting in is good. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but when he hit all the right notes and his acting is great, it makes a good movie. Still, it's wasn't a big attempt into character acting; it was Tom Cruise acting like Tom Cruise. Tom plays Tech 49 Jack Harper, one of the last drone repairmen stationed on a nuclear wasted Earth in the year 2077 who works for Sally (Melissa Leo), his mission commander, who is stationed on the 'Tet,' a massive tetrahedral space station above Earth. The planet was nearly destroyed sixty years earlier, during a nuclear war against an alien race known as Scavengers or Scavs for short where the Scavs destroyed the moon, causing massive earthquakes and tsunamis. He starts to question his assigned when a pre-war spacecraft crash on the planet and Jack finds a survivor name Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who tells him a different story then what he is supposed to believe. I just couldn't get interest in Olga's acting in this film. Her thin Russian accent was bothering me. Without spoiling much away, I have to say that the film is full of twists to the point, I thought I was watching a better version of M. Night Shyamalan's 2013's After Earth. Plus, all the twist do make sense in the end. It's not a prediction movie, but you have to accept what you got when you finally get to the bottom of the rabbit hole. I do hate the 1996's Independence Day like ending. I do question, what happen when the other Techs end up finding Julia after the ending. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice. This post-apocalyptic science fiction film is based on Director Joseph Kosinski's Radical Comics-edited unpublished graphic novel of the same name, but the movie felt like I said before, 2001 Space Odyssey. Not only that, but I also have to say 1972's Solaris and 2011's Another Earth, because both films deal with thoughts of motivation, the characters beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance. In Oblivion, Jack is haunted by a woman, from a past that he did not live, and force to confront it. While at the same time, he is trying so hard to keep it away so that his lover Victoria 'Vica' Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) who work with him as a team to maintain the autonomous drones can leave the planet and join the others in Titan. I love Andrea Riseborough in this role, not only is she beautiful, but the way she acts is both chilling and heart-broken. It's sad what ends up with her character in the end. Things get more complex for Jack when he also meets a 1999's Matrix's Morpheus type character Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), another survivor who tells him that what can describe as this movie version of 'the cake is a lie' by urging him to seek the truth in the so-called 'radiation zone' that Jack is forbidden to enter. What he find is shocking. I was pretty impress. I do like the visual effects in the movie. It's beautiful. Too bad, the movie stays too much on the remains of the northeastern United States, I would have love to see more of this world. The way, the director shot the clouds, and landscape is amazing to watch. If you had the option to watch it in 3D or IMAX. Do so, the sound & visuals are breath taking. Deserves numerous viewings there. The soundtrack by M83, Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapane sets the mood. I listened all the 30 tracks of the soundtrack, and I gotta says the soundtrack itself is the truly masterpieces. Daft Punk did a really nice job as well. There are some faults in the film, don't get me wrong, but some of these critics are deeply wrong. I think a lot of people didn't understand what was going on, or missed key points in the plot. I think a lot of critics think it's ripping off a lot of Sci-fiction films. In my opinion, it's playing tribute to them, while also using creative something new out of old ideas. I'm willing to buy a number of things for the sake of narrative, but one thing that bug me about the film is the lack of chemistry moments between Jack and Julia. I felt more for Victoria and Jack then them. I felt the ending where Julia and 'Jack' reunited was a bit of a cop out. It wasn't needed and should had been cut. It was very weak setup for one lame predictable final twist. Overall: I found the movie entertaining and liked it quite a bit, but it has the slight un-originality that will keep it from being great. Worth checking out in my opinion. Will recommend this to friends that like science fiction movies, good fun.",7,6,8,24 July 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," This motion picture will somewhat rock you! It still had that killer queen, even with, its semi generic paint by number plot.
","While, this movie hits the same old familiar plots thread that most biographic rockstar films have. There is one question, I had in my mind, after leaving the theater. Is this the real life, or is this just fantasy? How much of this biopic about British rock band 'Queen', front man, Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) was historical correct & what were made up? Well, after doing some research. I found this film written by Anthony McCarten & Peter Morgan to be, not as accuracy as it should had been. Without spoiling too much, director Bryan Singer did allow a lot of artistic liberties. One such example is how Mercury got started. In truth, 'Queen' was not his first singer gig. Before them, Freddie was in a rock group called 'The Hectics', and later as a vocalist for the band 'Ibex'. Nor did Mercury met the other band members, Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) coincidentally at their concert as 'Smile', right after their lead singer quit. In truth, Mercury actually met them, while attending Ealing Art College. However, it wasn't until May and Taylor came to see him, perform with 'Ibex' that the first steps toward of hiring him, as the lead singer of 'Queen' took place. Even with that, Mercury didn't get the job that night. As for Freddie meeting his future girlfriend, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) on the same night as his first run-in, with the other band members. It's also bollocks. In reality, Freddie didn't date her, until much later. Despite that, it is true, that he really love her. Even on his deathbed in 1990, he often refer her as his only true friend to the point, that he left the majority of his belongings, when he passed away. I kinda like, how the film portray that, because, a lot of people thought he was only gay. In reality, he was more than that. It's just too bad, that the movie doesn't show much of his other true love of his life, Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker). Even with the scenes, they did show, with him, it's not that accurate. Hutton was never a server at a hedonistic party hosted by Mercury, but a hairdresser, the singer met a nightclub. Despite that, I kinda dig the chemistry, the two performers had for each other. However, sadly, their character's relationship wasn't well established, due to bad pacing. Instead, the film focus way too much time, with the negatives of Freddie's other partner, Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). This course of direction feels a little bit one sided, as the film makes it, look like getting into a homosexual relationship might be bad. It gave the wrong tone. Nevertheless, it's during this time with Paul that the movie makes its biggest departure from the truth. In the film, we see the band livid at Freddie for going behind their back, for a solo deal. When in reality, the band all agreed on taking a break to focus on their solo careers, but they stayed in touch. Live Aid wasn't a reunion for the band. In real life, they had actually released their eleventh studio album and had been on tour all over the world that year. They were also well rehearsed by the time they were set to perform at the event. To dig further, one of their managers was never fired, because of the failure to mention that event. He was fired by Mercury for selling the singer's saucy personal information to newspapers, years later. As for record executive Ray Foster (Mike Myers), that hired the band and later, try to derail them. That character's conflict was also fake. That fictional figure was just add to put more dramatics & a punchline for an insider movie joke. Despite the band's personal story being less dramatic in real life, than the movie; their music is still impressive. Seeing how they were able to get the ideas for them, and produce it for concerts in a humorous way, was, by far, the highlight of the film. I just wish, the individual band members were explore more. We barely got to know anything about them. They were a little paper thin. Because of that, the acting for those performances also somewhat limited & didn't shine. It cause the performances to be only mediocre at best. Despite that, the actors chosen to portray them, did look the part. As for Mercury. Malek was alright. He truly did look & sound like the lead singer. However, the portrayals of Freddie's life and sexuality is a bit off. The singer was not as reckless in his promiscuity as the movie makes it out to be. He wasn't sexual harassing men. In truth, he was very extrovert and shy, particularly with others. The idea that Freddie would host all night orgies parties, joking openly about his sexuality, all the time is also very questionable. Most likely, he was in home, resting quietly, due to the pressures of performing during hectic musical tours & suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of skin cancer that cause him, great pain; that the film fails to mention. In conclusion, I think the director was just making Mercury seem like a sex hound to justify his own actions when it comes to the filmmaker's very public sexual abuse allegations cases. He's trying to say, he meant, no harm with his own engagements. Regardless of that, Bryan Singer still got fired from the production, after a fight with the cast & crew whom complained to the studio about the director's absences. While, Dexter Fletcher does a great job, completing the film. His editing style was not well balance. Too many quick cuts. Because of that, the timeline didn't float well. Everything seem rushed, even the visuals. Certain CGI parts were very choppy. In spite of everything, overall: 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is still champion material. It will make you go Radio gaga for it! That's for sure.",8,5,7,25 November 2018
American Pie," This 1990s teen sex comedy hasn't aged well. The pie is starting to stink.
","Directed by then-first time directors, brothers, Paul & Chris Weitz, this raunchy comedy was somewhat memorable at the time for its hilarious jokes about a group of high school seniors, named Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) & Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), all trying to losing one's virginity before their high school graduation. While, this movie was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: 2001's 'American Pie 2', 2003's 'American Wedding', and 2012's 'American Reunion', & a lot of really bad, direct to DVDs spinoffs movies such as, 2005's 'American Pie Presents: Band Camp', '2006's 'American Pie: The Naked Mile', 2007's 'American Pie: Beta House', and 2009's 'American Pie The Book of Love'; it's clear, after rewatching this film, a few days ago, I can say that 'American Pie' is not as good as I remember. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the movie's message to be a bit broken. After all, the film concentrates on bunch of friends trying to force sex to happen, rather than allowing it to happen on its own. It wasn't until, near the end of the movie, they decide that was a dumb thing to do, since sex shouldn't be a goal in itself, but something you do with a person who's important to you and when you both want it. That's a nice little moral that teenager can honestly get behind. However, the filmmakers kinda ruin it, later, by allowing all of them to have sex, all on the same night. As much as I like Mena Suvari as Heather Gardner and Chris Klein as Oz's relationship. I found it to be, a bit shallowed. After all, Oz does kinda bragged about sleeping with Heather, afterwards, despite their characters supposedly, taking their relationship slow. To make matters worse, some of the characters find themselves, being used, borderline getting rape, or committing adultery that night. That's not funny. Despite that, some of the humor in the film, somewhat works. I still laugh at some of the gross toilet humor, this film has to offer. The Pie scene with Jim's Dad, Noel (Eugene Levy), along, makes this film, worth checking out. Still, there were some sequences in the film, I found, to be, too low brow. One of them is the famous 'web-cam' nudity moment. I was never, really into actress, Shannon Elizabeth's work, here as Nadia. I found her foreign exchange student character to be one-dimensional and unrealistic. Not only, does her European accent sounds a bit rubbish, but the whole idea, that she would find Jim, kinda attractive, without his character, speaking once to her is just silly. Her character was pretty much, just written in the film, for fan service. If that, wasn't enough, I really didn't like, how the characters were alright with taping her, while, she's changes her clothes. The voyeurism in this movie is borderline creepy and somewhat disturbing. Anyways, she wasn't the only female character, I didn't like, about this film. Tara Reid as Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum was very annoying as well. I really wouldn't stand her b*tchy attitude with Kevin in this film. Their scenes, together was such a turn off. The same with the walking-macho-stereotype 'Steve' Stifler (Seann William Scott). Yes, I know, that film help spark Seann William Scott's film career, but gees, his character was really irritating to watch and listen to. Nothing about his character seem real. At least, his character kinda stood out in the film unlike others people's characters. I can hardly remember, the characters, who actress, Natasha Lyonne and actor, John Cho plays as. One character that was very memorable was Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), despite being introduced late into the first movie and had less than four minutes of screen time. I really hope, for more from her character than the running joke that she was, in this film. After all, Alyson really does make this character, very likable. It's sad, it's that her talent was somewhat wasted here. It is only the second film on, that her character being more than a one-hit wonder, but into a well-developed, prominent character. It's by then, I kinda fell in love, with this character, but for this movie, her performance was fine with me. Another person that really put it, his all was Jason Biggs. I know, a lot of people, crap on him for his mediocre acting, but he really did, make this film, fun to watch with his ability for slapstick. He nearly died from heatstroke and zinc poisoning, during production. So give this man, some props. While, Jason Biggs did fine as the main role in this film. In my opinion, the true-breakout star of this film, has to be, Eugene Levy. He really makes this film, somewhat watchable. Any scenes with him, were funny as hell. I have to give him, mad praise for making this film, work. Overall: While, American Pie upholds the tradition of horny teenage sex comedies made famous by 1980s films like 1981's 'Porky's', 1983's 'Spring Break' and 1985's 'Weird Science', for the late 1990s. It's doesn't hold up, with more of the recent ones, such as 2001's 'Wet Hot American Summer' & 2007's 'Superbad'. It's still, worth watching. Just not, too much, rewatch value.",6,4,10,4 June 2016
Watchmen," Who watches the Watchmen? Watchmen is an awesome movie!
","Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War, a group of mostly retired vigilantes, called the 'Watchmen', investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more sinister, that come affect the outcome of the whole world. The movie is based off the Watchmen graphic novel by Alan Moore. It took a while, for a live-action film adaptation to come, due to being stranded in development hell, but I have to say, director Zack Snyder really pull it off. The film deem 'unfilmable', finally came out, with such amazing production value. The movie was just beautiful to watch. Everything pretty much work, the CGI, the visual effects, and the costumes. Glad for the fact that Snyder choice not to shoot all of the film using green screens and opted for real sets instead. You really get a sense of depth with real sets. The opening slow motion sequence to Bob Dylan 'The Times They Are a-Changin'' was wonderful. The music choices were mostly great in the film. You really get the sense of the 1960s/1980s with the tone of the film. Even the trailer song, Smashing Pumpkins -The Beginning Is the End was delightful. Only song, I didn't like was Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'. It was a bit corny, during the love scene. The acting in the film is pretty good for the most part. Malin Åkerman as Laurie Juspeczyk AKA Silk Spectre II, Billy Crudup as Jon Osterman AKA Dr. Manhattan, Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs AKA Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Edward Blake AKA The Comedian and Patrick Wilson as Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl II were all great in their parts. Indeed, they did present six radically opposing ways to perceive the world, and to give the audience of the film, the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. It's really surprising, that this movie was even made, with a really hard R-rating, due to a lot of sex, language, and nudity. It was very faithful adaptation for the most part. Without spoiling too much, they did change one big thing toward the end, with the writers cutting out the alien invasion part and changing it to Dr. Manhattan. In my opinion, the whole Dr. Manhattan's plot works better. Glad, they didn't used the original draft by Sam Hamm features a vastly different vision than that depicted in the final film with all the assassination plots and time rifts. The pacing is a bit long, and drawn out. After all, it's came from a graphic novel with a Nonlinear narrative. So, there were a lot of flashbacks; that had little to do with the main plot, but was there for the comic fans. Alan Moore was influence by a lot of people to write, Watchmen. Alan Moore got the idea from Mighty Crusaders comic books. When he try to write for the comic book, they reject his storyline, and decide to write Watchmen, instead. William S. Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of Watchmen. This is where, he got the story written a story idea, and the use of symbolism. Like the book, Watchmen the film is full of them, like the stained happy face represent the Doomsday clock or the quote, 'Who watch the watchmen?' political representing warnings to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate. It's a great time, Easter egging all of them like looking for the Nostalgia logos. I also enjoy, looking at all the familiar famous people that have cameos throughout the film like Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, & Fidel Castro. I love the cultural references from history, slightly altered like Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous photo, Andy Warhol's factory or Studio 54. Even the flag have 51 stars, because in the film's alternate history, Vietnam became the 51st state after America won the Vietnam. This movie has a lot of replay value. Still, much of the story couldn't be fit into one movie in the normal version. Tales of the Black Freighter within the story, had to be its separate film starring Gerard Butler, and the fictional biography, 'Under the Hood', detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film's back-story had to be a DVD extra. If you love this movie, try to find the director's cut with 24 minutes of additional footage or the ultimate cut that has the director's cut of the film re-edited to contain Tales of the Black Freighter into the story as it is featured in the graphic novel, bringing the run time of the film to 215 minutes. Overall: Some people might hate the movie for its slow and nihilism tone, but it's still action packed and have some humor. For me, it was very entertaining. Worth the watch.",8,3,6,17 September 2014
Hot Rod," I dare you not to like this movie! Hot Rod is indeed funny!
","While, this movie isn't a Saturday Night Life skit turn into a movie. It's feels like one that works. Hot Rod is a sports comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer, written by Pam Brady along with Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, who were uncredited. Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) is a man-child daredevil stunt man, who is aspire to follow in his father's footsteps and become a famous stuntman himself. Meanwhile, his stepfather Frank (Ian McShane) fails to respect Rod as a man, often going out of his way to beat him in sparring sessions and mocking his stuntman dream, but when Frank is in urgent need of a heart transplant. Rod find the strength and courage to win his heart, by raising the money by doing a jump over the length of fifteen school buses, and give the proceeds to his stepfather's surgery. The movie's jokes, both physical slapstick action humor & dialogue humor, at less for me, hit me like the hard ground after a fail stunt. It really broke my funny bone. It's weird that Rod, despite the many accidents he's involved in he never receives any long lasting injuries. Great use of a brick joke. Brick jokes are a joke that introduce in the beginning of a film that have no punch line, until late in the film. A good example of this is the Taco VS a Grill Cheese fight. Great use of retro humor, but it is 2007 when it was film, not 1980s here. So, some of the jokes, the audience might not get. Still, there is a lot of Youtube type jokes that younger audience might find interesting. I have to say, while some of the jokes seem old, stolen, or recycled. Hot Rod gives a new spin to it. A good example is the dancing out of rage, sequence which is loosely based on the movie Footloose. While other comedies like TV show's Family Guy spoof it already, this version end up being a lot funnier, because you don't what happen next, coming. Another joke, people think Family Guy or Hot Rod stole is the mispronouncing of words gag. According to the producers, this was inspired by a skit on Gang Starr's album Moment of Truth. I wouldn't say it was stolen as revamped. It seems like the humor, here is updated and adapted well to the surrounds. It knows that the movie is supposed to dumb, and they over top it everything to the extreme. It's aim for those with high toleration for idiocy humor. It goes without saying, that this isn't a sophisticated comedy movie, but somehow, it works as being funny to me. Andy Samberg works both in the charm of the man-child character, and making up new jokes at the spot. I can't see, the original actor, it was written for, Will Ferrell in this type of a role. Already, at the time, he seems a little bit too old to be playing this type of a character. The supporting cast is just as easily as funny as Andy Samberg. All his friends Rico (Danny McBride), Dave (Bill Hader) and his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone) gives out some really funny scenes of their own. Even side characters like AM radio station host Barry Pasternak (Chris Parnell) and boyfriend of Rod's love interest, Jonathan (Will Arnett) nearly steals the movie from Rod. Will Arnett plays such an over the top over the top, jerk off guy, that it's serves a continuing inside gag of over acting. Indeed, he was more evil, than Evel Kenevel. Adding Denise (Isla Fisher) to the mix is great as Isla gives some really need, beauty to the group, even if she seems like a not- realist girl character in real life. It's still kinda weird to see, such serious actors like Sissy Spacek, and Ian McShane playing minor characters in here. They really get lost in the film as they don't bring that much humor to the mix. At less, Sissy's character, doesn't. I hardly remember, Sissy at all in the film. The music is great, and well-use in the film. I love Swedish rock band Europe. The band called Gown that plays at Rod's final jump is actually Queens of the Stone Age if you wondering. The best use of music for me, is 'You're the Voice' by John Farnam in the town scene. That scene alone, got me laughing my head off! Now, to the faults of the film. One thing, I wish wasn't there was the potty humor. It wasn't because it was gross, it's the fact that it wasn't funny. That whole tai chi Chekhov's Skill poop joke is stupid. The whole Acid trip scenes weren't that great. The whole scene with Rico going crazy on a guy was just pointless. Pointless violence play off like that as humor isn't my cup of tea. For a PG-13 film, there was a lot of raunchy jokes that clearly the movie got away with. Sexual dialogue is present, but it's nothing too explicit. There is very mild language in the film, and few crude humor. Overall: While the movie was a bomb at the box office, in the years following, it has gather up a number of cult fans due to its off-beat humor. If you go into this movie with an open mind, you should enjoy the heck out of it. It's really hard not to like this film.",6,6,11,22 January 2014
Baby Driver," It's time to face the music! Was Baby Driver, any good? It was alright for the most part. Worth the trip, seeing.
","Although, sadly, this movie about a young, getaway driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort) trying to escape a life of crime, was not as well-written and put together, as director Edgar Wright's other films, were, like the comedic, 'Three Flavors Cornetto film' trilogy of 2004's 'Shaun of the Dead', 2007's 'Hot Fuzz', & 2013's 'At the World's End'. Without spoiling the movie, here's some reasons, why this film doesn't live up to those standards. First off, the poor-written script, had too many jarring dead end, plot-holes & an off-tinted timeline. Action scenes like the unexplained action with the vet, and the shoot-out, while purchasing illegal arms, seem a little forced. It kinda hurts, the pacing. Other scenes like the odd way, they introduce a 2001 model of IPOD in a 1980s setting & the short use of 1950s black & white footage for the climatic fantasy dream-like setting comes off as bizarre and surreal. Yes, it could be, said that Baby sees, his world as a series of snippets similar to channel surfing on the televisions, like how he parrots, dialogue lifted from what he sees on the boob tube, but I felt that, the movie doesn't explained it, well, through the use of other characters, to justified that. As much as I love the acting for everybody, especially, Jon Hamm & Jamie Fox & Kevin Spacey as part of Baby's crew. Exposition is just awkwardly introduction, throughout the movie. With sentences being spill out, that doesn't seem natural in human language. A good example of that, is most of the diner scenes. Also, it seems to me, the some of the actors, like Jon Bernthal & Flea were a bit wasted, in roles that were so limited. Wright really could had, add much more for them in the script, because, they come and go, without much explanation. Another thing, I notice, is that part of the script was written when Wright first conceived the story in 1994, such as the mention of Baby's backstory with 'Spirit of 1985' dialogue, the flashbacks with his parents & Baby love of tape recorder. Yet, other parts, seem to be, rewritten much later, including the use of IPODS, & certain cars. Because of this, the movie makes Baby seems way older than he supposed to be. Not only that, but it come off as confusing and somewhat dated, at times, despite having a modern day settling. It just doesn't mixed well. Don't get me wrong, I still do like, the carefully crafted fun in sync diegetic cinemograph style of filmmaking & the eclectic taste in music, such in the long pan shots with songs like 'the Harlem Shuffle' by Bob & Earl or the quick editing shoot-out sequence with 'Tequila' by the Button-Down Bass. However, there were parts of the movie that could had been taking more seriously, with the music choice, like 'Easy' by the Commodores and Queen's 'Compton Rock' to make, more of a connection with some of the supporting characters with Baby. Instead, it comes off, as soft spoken & kinda gimmicky. It didn't help fleshed out the characters, as much as it should had. A good example is the love sequences with Debora (Lily James), the waitress. Does she really have, no life, besides, becoming an accomplice to a criminal, she only met, a few days earlier!? Don't get me wrong, Lily James is a fine actress, and she did the best, she was given, but her character seems to be, only there to serve as a one-dimensional, manic pixie girl, and nothing more. Are we really supposed to believe, that awkward quiet guy with barely any charisma, somehow won her heart, just by, secretly, recording her voice!? Honestly, in the real-world, actions like that, would creep, sane women, the f-out! Also, films like 2011's 'Drive' told similar love story, better and a more realistic tone. Plus, I would, rather have the bittersweet ending to 'Drive', than the cop-out, cheesy & impracticable happy ending to this film. The two of them, barely had any chemistry at all. Also, I hate the idea, that finding a love-one, is the only reason to get, out of crime is a lame excuse. You would think, that the moral grounds, would be, strong enough to quit, but I guess, not. Things like that, are just overplayed. Plus, 2010's 'The Town' told that subplot, a lot better, than this film. Despite that, I thought, Ansel Elgort was alright in what he was given, even if some the coolness factor is lost because how much the titular character is essentially lifted from 1978's 'The Driver'. Baby is not as original as critics, make the character, out to be. I guess, if you're going to steal. Steal from the best. However, the worst thing about Baby, is how much, a Marty Stu, he was. OK, I get that, he would be, great in, editing music & using sign language, but parkouring? Where, did he learn that, while, driving, most of his life!? Don't get me wrong, those action scenes where he was running, were amazing, but it did, take me, out of the movie. Honestly, in general, I felt like, the action scene were, a little too outlandish. It basically mirrors, the Fast & the Furious franchise, in how silly, parts of it, were. Still, I love the fact that, little to no CGI or green screen used to film the car chase sequences. The driving is all practically done. Nevertheless, the car scenes in this movie, were not as tight and grounded, as I wanted it to be. Still, I did dig the little comedy, those action scenes in 'Baby Driver', had. Made me, want to witness Wright's 2003 Mint Royale's 'Blue Song' music video, to see, what the differences were and where the cameos from Nick Frost & Walter Hill were. Overall: Even with its flaws, this movie was truly, mostly a super-charged & Adrenaline-Fueled fun flick. It's worth checking out. Highly recommended.",8,5,10,5 August 2017
Justice League," Justice League just wasn't in a league of its own. It really doesn't stand out, much. It's mostly generic. Meh for the most part.
","This Warner Bros Studios movie based on the DC comics of the same name, was just not up to par, in standards, comic book fans, were looking for. It's not as brave & the bold as it should had been. It was somewhat of a disappointment. First off, the film plot of a group of superheroes, stopping a run of the mill, alien invasion attacking Earth, led by a horn helmet medieval-like figure with the use of a mystic box of energy has already run its ground, with other comic books movies, such as 2012's Marvel Studios 'Avengers'. Even the Übermensch resurrection sub plot that producers thought was innovative, has also been seen before, in films like 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. In the end, I'm sorry to say this, Warner Bros & DC films, but Marvel Studios & Walt Disney Studios beat you to the punch. You're not really adding much of anything new that comic books fans, haven't seen before. Why don't you have try something new like, adapting risky, smart, complex comic book story lines like 'Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths' or 'Kingdom Come'. It's kinda similar to the comic books stories that director, Zack Snyder would probably do, well at. After all, 2009's 'Watchmen' was amazing and groundbreaking. This film story, not so much. Trust me, it's generic, safe, and thin, much like 2017's 'Wonder Woman' film, however, in that movie, it was much more, well-executed. Most of the action scenes, and characters in 'Wonder Woman' seem real. There were real emotional scenes, being played out. Don't get me wrong, even with the inconsistent of the lighthearted and dark tone in direction, due to gritty, Snyder having to step down, during production, due to the death of his daughter, and being replace by smart-aleck, meta, director, Joss Whedon. 'Justice League' is still watchable, even if the film is full of expensive odd-place dodgy reshoots, involving scenes where computer animators had erase mustaches off, superheroes faces, while, providing little too ugly looking fake-looking CGI action. It's not a total mess like 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' or 2016's 'Suicide Squad'. However, its story & visuals are not that compelling. It doesn't feel real. Much of that, come from the fact that we barely got to know, the backstories of some of the heroes like Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) & Barry Allen/Flash (Ezra Miller). In much, in the same vein, even Batman, himself, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) in the last movie with their short summary. In short, they should all, had their solo films, before this movie, even came out, much like Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) got, with 2017's 'Wonder Woman' & 2013's 'Man of Steel' to explore who they are. Since, they didn't do that, they come across, as cartoony & one-dimensional. It doesn't help, that one of the characters, is wearing a fake-looking CGI suit. Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher)'s appearance really disappointed me. Not only, was it, a bad choice to have him, over original members, like Martian Manhunter or Green Lantern; because it kinda eliminated a 'Teen Titan' movie & ruins the mystic of the original comic. It's also hurts the visuals. His presence really does take you, out of the movie. . Regardless of that, the best aspects of the Justice League team are the chemistry between its cast and the film's individual depiction of each superhero. Unlike the previous movies, they are decidedly heroic, instead of unlikable and impersonal. They make an effort to save each other and spare citizen lives. It's kinda of a story of redemption. Nevertheless, some of their actions, seem out of place & jarring, like Aquaman polluting the oceans with bottles like a beach-bum, and Flash being OK, with people throwing weapons at him & being a coward, at times. Still, those are nitpicks, for what was overall, alright performance. I just kinda wish the villain, Steppenwolf (Voiced and motion capture by Ciarán Hinds) was just as memorable. He really doesn't seem much of a threat at all, nor does any other enemies in this film. The action seem like a one-sided turkey shoot. Not only that, but the character was highly shallow & mostly full of one-dimensional, evil persona. It was really bland, much like the music from composer, Danny Elfman. The score from him, was very unsatisfactory. Nothing, but recycled tracks in darker tunes. It was not good. On the other hand, as least, the songs used in the film, were not that bad. I kinda dig, singer, Sigrid's cover of 'Everybody Knows' by music artist, Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Even, the Beatles track, 'Come Together' that was used in the trailer, was fine for the most part. Although, that song, alone, was not good enough to get, audiences to go to the theaters to see it. As of this writing, the film is really underperforming, much coming from the fact that the lukewarm reaction to the film's trailer & its predecessor. I guess, they don't care much, after the two post-credits ending, like I did. Overall: While, it might seem like I hate this first big screen union of DC Comics' top-tier superheroes that went through many development hells. In truth, I just disappointed on how much, a letdown, it was. It was very adequate. Look, if you willing to look, past that, you might find, yourself, being semi entertained. In the end, I can only recommended, seeing this movie; as a rental. It's worthwhile to a certain point. It's not marvelous.",7,6,13,24 November 2017
Man of Steel," It's a bird, no it's a plane, no it's Man of Steel and it's awesome!!!
","I have to say, watching it was Action Pack Fun! Forget Iron Man 3, this movie is truly the Man of Steel. It pretty much stole the hearts and minds of comic book fans everywhere. Still, it's isn't perfect, but a movie full of action, it was pretty intense and impressed. I would probably have to say, it's even better action than 2012's Avengers. It might be even better than 2008's Dark Knight in scope of DC adapted films. Like how Christopher Nolan save the Batman franchise from near ruins. Both Producer Christopher Nolan with his writer partner David S. Goyer team up with Director Zack Snyder of Watchmen fame, save Superman from the same fate. The reboot movie starts out with a longer look at the origins of Superman than the previous movies. On the planet Krypton faces imminent apocalypse destruction due to an unstable core from years of terraforming. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) broke the rules by having a first natural birth on Krypton rather than codex one. (genetic engineering). They then launch a spacecraft carrying their newborn son Kal-El and a genetic codex not only to escape Krypton's fate, but fallen in the hands of the rebel General Zod (Michael Shannon). The spacecraft lands on Earth, where Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) takes care of him, and raise them as their own keeping his secret identify, a secret. It wasn't until General Zod comes looking for a new planet to terraform by eradicate the human population, and replace them with genetically-engineered Kryptonians that Superman/ Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage. I like how the movie opens up the origins of Superman even more. I know generations of Kryptonians has controlled reproduction through a eugenics program, but why if they can terraform other planets. They wouldn't run out of planets to populate. So it was a bit weird for Krypton to lose a lot of resources. The mind-numbing CGI does kinda take over the film, but it was pretty impressed for CGI, nothing was used in a silly way. The story is good enough to stand on its own without too many CGI moments. I know some critics might hate the serious tone to the piece, saying it doesn't have enough comedy or romance, but I think it work best when it seem real and not campy like previous Superman films. For one, Superman honestly looks like a superhero. Good job for Henry Cavill, not only did he had the Boy Scout good looks, the Superman build, but this guy acting in this movie was truly super. He look more like Superman than the last actor that portray him, Brandon Routh. I do like how the writer gave him reason why kryptonite makes him weak. A superhero struggling with inner conflict makes him more human. It makes him more violable. Some critics hate the fact that toward the end, Superman had to kill somebody to save others. If you watch that scene, you can serious see that Superman is upset about doing it. It's not like Superman didn't kill people before in the comic books. I think some comic fans are taking this too serious. Some critics might hate the Religion force feed toward the middle of the film making illusions to Superman's sacrifice to Jesus. I didn't mind, it was too big a deal as well. The film might have too much expository dialogues, but it's doesn't get in the way of the action. I love how the Kents are more involve in the film in this film. Kevin Costner has always been his best when portray father like roles, and this one was pretty good even if his advice was pretty odd. Still, why in the hell did he had to risk his life for a dog? I surprised that well hasn't run dry yet. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane. Glad in a way, that Kristen Stewart wasn't hired for the job. I like how the writers, didn't portray Lois Lane and others supporting characters as complete clueless idiots when face with the fact Clark Kent is Superman. They hint at it at the end, but it never clear that they don't know or do know. The whole glasses disguise thing was cheesy, and dumb in the first place. I like how the military surrounding Superman was given roles during the actions scene rather than looking complete useless. While General Zod and his thugs can have the strength of Gods, they can still be stop by human beings. Christopher Meloni was pretty badass in the role. Michael Shannon was outstanding as General Zod. I like how they gave him some depth rather than making him a silly comic book villain. I kneel down to his performance. I like Faora (Antje Traue), the fight scenes with her was pretty damn interesting. All the fight scenes were good. It was like watching a live action Dragon Ball Z. The music was pretty powerful score by Han Zimmler, but I will miss the Superman theme song from John Williams. I like Zack Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences care about it. I didn't like the shaky camera at first, but it's die down mid-through. There is Easter eggs in the film like the Lex-Corp, Wayne Enterprises, & Blaze Comic logos. There is no extra scene after credits. Overall: it's a great watch. I was deeply impressed by it. I don't think it's a generic, C average, sci-fi, Michael Bay type action film. The origin story is explain way better than Richard Donner's version. The film is more serious in tone than 2007's Superman Returns, and last thing, what is wrong with non-stop action!? The first comic with Superman was indeed call Action Comic, so what's wrong with that!? I don't see anything wrong as long as they tell the story, well. So check out the movie so it's super well done",8,5,9,15 June 2013
Cast Away," Don't even think of casting away this movie! This harrowing tale of survival deserves to be told.
","The movie tells the story of a Fed-Ex worker, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whom find himself, away from his normal life with his love one, Kelly (Helen Hunt) when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island. Chuck has no choice, but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment, and find the courage to escape his island dwelling, when he's able to. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the structure of this film is divided into three parts: Chuck's life as a FedEx employee, the struggle to survive on the island, and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change. Each one has this 'show, don't tell', modality of storytelling. The movie doesn't have that much dialogue, which in my opinion works. This allows the beautiful, yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film's story. The way, the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work, show how Chuck Noland's lives life under the punctuality of a running clock. The way, Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen, show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is, where time doesn't really matter anymore. I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning, to slow, near one location standstill. The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch. Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin. It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island, and return back to normal home. Again, this could symbolizes, how much driven, he is at his job. It's really up to debate, what this item was really about or what's in it. Glad, they didn't use the deleted scene from the script that actually has Chuck open the box. It would had kill the movie for me. Another symbol is that of Wilson, the volleyball. The character was created by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. while researching island survival techniques in a beach in Mexico, in which this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. While, talking to a volleyball might seem weird on paper, it makes a lot of sense, as it show, how much people are willing to go for a sense of normal connection, when isolate from others. From a theatrical POV, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation. The movie really does makes a good job to it seem like Wilson, could be a person. In my opinion, he's the most famous inanimate object, put on film. It was heart-breaking, what happen to him, toward the end. Only Tom Hanks can make us feel something for a volleyball, and make it seem believably. In any lessor actor, this might come across as silly or boring. This movie is very engaging, because of him. Tom Hanks is a master of showing great range of emotion with his facial features and the way, he moves his body. You can tell, how much trauma, he went through, the way, he looks at things, or how he reacts. Not only that, Hanks went through, great stress to get his body ready for the role. Hanks gained 50 pounds during pre-production to make him look like a pudgy, middle-aged man. After a majority of the film was shot, production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his beard. He look like he had been living on the island for years. This was a very extreme weight lost, that might cause a lot of Tom Hank's health problems in later years. Hanks even was nominated for Best Actor that year for a Oscar. While, Helen Hunt isn't in the film, much. She did a great job as a supporting role. You really can tell, the struggle, she has, with trying to love Chuck, while also trying to move on. The film gives fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone. It's somewhat educational. I like how the movie begins and ends at crossroads. Two possible paths to an unknown future. It's all very symbolic. This movie has a lot of replay value. There are tons of little clever things that change into the timelines of the movie, you can only pick up on, if you watch it, a few times, such as how Chuck wears his shoes, during airplane flights, the irony of the dentist that cause him so much pain or the name of the ranch where the angel wing package came from. Then, there are those slight things, that foreshadow a lot of what will happen, later on the film such as seeing Chuck's sailing certification or the off comment mention of a tooth ache or the song 'Return to Sender' playing the background. While, the movie doesn't have that much music. Alan Silvestri's minimal score was beautiful to listen to, and good enough to win a Grammy Award in 2002. I like how he use nature sound effects to reinforce the feeling of isolation with his music. The weird product placement didn't really hurt the film. This film features a Fed-Ex cargo plane crashing in the Pacific Ocean, but it didn't hurt the company, as the film's success ensured help increased brand awareness. One thing that kinda did, hurt the film, is the trailer that really did spoiled too much. Seriously. Don't watch the trailer until you've seen the film. I like how the film, later helped developed the show, Lost. Overall: A great movie that showcase the triumph of the human spirit under harsh conditions. It's brutal, haunting and painful, yet compelling, enigmatic, & uplifting. This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.",8,9,11,3 March 2015
The Revenant," This movie shows that as long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. The Revenant is a visceral experience. Visually stunning & heart-pounding.
","Inspired by true events and Michael Punke's novel of the same name, The Revenant captures one man's epic adventure of survival and the astonishing power of the human spirit. In an expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, renowned explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is brutally attacked by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. In a quest to survive and guided by revenge for his betrayers, Glass must endures life-threating injuries, sickness, the harsh environment, hostile natives, and others to make it, back to home. Can Glass navigate the cold & vicious winter in a relentless pursuit to live and find redemption, or will this story of the rural survivalist, end tragic? Watch the movie to find out, if you really want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the visuals in this film, has reaches a new level of remarkability. It's a fully immersive, dimensional look, with jaw-dropping long takes and strikingly physical realism. Filmed in the remote wilderness of Canada and Argentina, the cinematography for this film, is one of the main reason, why I really wanted to see this movie. Beautifully shot by Emmanuel Lubezki and director Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film is famous for using only natural light to highlight these amazing set-pieces. Some of these tracking shots, were so complicated, due to cold weather conditions, the remoteness of the locations and director Alejandro González Iñárritu's strict aesthetic plan, that the film was infamous for its trouble-some long production. Even season actors like Leonardo DiCapiro and Tom Hardy, have stated out that this is one of their hardest movies to shot. And yet all of the film's visually arresting set-pieces would have been in vain had the viewer failed to connect with the characters. Lucky for them, I found the main and supporting characters to be very appealing. I was very invested in the human element of this tale of survival and retribution. Both Leonardo and Tom Hardy were astonishing in their roles; however, Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald is definitely the better of the two leads. I like the fact, that he's ruthless, greedy, tough and somewhat scare. Still, I think the movie made Fitzgerald, seem like a one-dimensional villain with him, killing his kid, than what was more like, what was exactly from fur trappers, back then. Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie, was the same. He seem a little too super human, good-hearted and embellished to be taken as a real Hugh Glass. Scenes like him, surviving a huge cliff drop and multiply waterfalls was a little too unrealistic for my taste. In my opinion, I think the movie would have a more realistic tone, if they kept, Hugh Glass's account, closer to the real-life event. The film took too many liberties. Unlike the movie, Hugh Glass didn't single-handed put down a bear; he had help from fur-trader buddies. Plus, that event happen in summer, not winter. Another thing, unlike the movie, which has Hugh Glass swim, in ice-cold temperance water, most of the way, down the river. In real-life, he make a crude raft and floated downstream. In my opinion, it doesn't make sense that he swam, because of hypothermia. Then, there was the ending, which I will not spoil, that I have mixed feelings about. It was action-packed, but somewhat disappointing as well. All, I have to say about it, is the 'Revenge in God's hand' arch wasn't well-developed. Still, it was better than what happen in the real-life account. Still, despite, the loose adapted of Hugh Glass's account; DiCaprio's version does have more of the punishing feel; because of that, it's more entertaining. Seeing Leo put himself truly through the ringer for his art is worth-watching on its own. So he deserves some credit. After all, it's pretty hard to do, all those survival stunts, eat raw meat, speak two Natives language, and risk hypothermia. Also, Leo's Glass' loneliness, desperation, bond with his mixed race son, and painful memories all make him a sympathetic and moving character, an all the more extraordinary, accomplishment given how little dialogue DiCaprio has. Yet this movie is not a film for all people. Some of the 'Terrence Malick' style, symbolism was a bit off, and confusing. It does comes off, as somewhat self-indulgent and pretentious at times. Still, the movie is somewhat passable for its 156 minute run-time. While, the runtime is long, it's not as slow, as certain critics, make it out to be. Overall: The utter ferocity of the action and performances, added with the breath-taking visuals makes, this survival epic, a must-watch from me. Check it out.",9,3,7,8 January 2016
Split," All the voices in my head, says this movie was truly crazy-awesome. I agree with them.
","After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999's 'The Sixth Sense' and 2000's 'Unbreakable', it's no secret that M. Night Shyamalan's career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002's 'Signs' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008's 'The Happening'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010's 'The Last Airbender' & 2013's 'After Earth', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with 'The Visit'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller 'Split' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man's deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like 'The Visit', a few years earlier, 'Split' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism 'Psycho' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin's fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it's true that most people suffering from 'DID', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are 'DID' people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn't paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don't be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you're a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night's smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended.",8,7,18,12 February 2017
Knowing," Knowing isn't worth knowing.
","Knowing. Knowing how to write a better movie would be better. I saw the movie, and it wasn't worth knowing. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. It was pretty mediocre. There were a lot of WTF moments in the movie. A couple of plot holes that I'm still trying to figure out. This movie had potential, but there were some issues. The idea of having numbers that predicted terrible events happening could've been interesting, but the fact that people die in large numbers every day would mean a larger paper. Excuse me, movie, but in the whole frame of the death charts. Any number from 100 to 5000 is too much, compare to the number of large deaths of 5000 or more that would fit the paper more. The movie starts out when a time capsule is opened, and a boy find and read a paper with numbers. His widowed father Jonathan Koestler (Nicolas Cage), a professor of astrophysics at MIT, notices the numbers have a specific set of sequences referring to the times and locations of fatal disasters over the last 50 years, including 911012996 (the date and death toll of the 9/11 attacks) and the last three sets of digits are dated in the immediate future. Once again, in the world map, 2996 is pretty small amount of death compare to the world population that die on Sept. 11, 2001 outside of the event. On average day, 6,744 die in the US only, in the world 155,000 or more. Anyways, Jonathan seeks to try to prevention another tragedy. The movie has some of the best special and visual effects. The train and airplane scene alone is chilling and looks decently realistic in terms of effects. Still, having tested the supposition under controlled laboratory condition and double-checked the findings, I can confirm that yes it is indeed easy to laugh at a burning moose in one scene in the film. The acting is OK. Nicolas Cage's character is just Nicolas Cage. What is happening with Nicolas Cage's hair? You will realize his hair is growing in one seriously odd pattern starting about halfway back on his skull. Most of the movie, Cage will spent staring at things. The characters are just cookie cutter Sci-Fi channel composites. Director Alex Proyas did a good job at sticking true the film's Twilight Zone-ism premise without copping out. Another thing, if you are not very very religious, you might have another problem watching this movie. There is a lot of Biblical references that will have to get used to. I kinda dislike the psychological manipulation and propaganda by using sci-fi and suspense techniques to dishonestly deliver an ultimate message of one-sided religious salvation. Knowing can also means Scientology according to their beliefs, since Nicholas Cage is a confirmed Scientologist. The movie is up to interpretation of what it is trying to say. The twist of Knowing, well, without spoiling it, I would hardly even call it a twist. It's just the movie dumps out everything it did in the beginning and starts anew with this new situation, which has nothing to do with the numbers. Makes me wonder what happens if you were pregnant in this movie toward the end. What happens to you? The ending with Nicolas Cage and his father probably will make fathers cry and hold their children. When the movie concludes, I was like you got to be kidding me, and come on. Still, 'Knowing' is a good enough movie to enjoy. If only I could have seen the future I wouldn't have buy it, just rent it.",6,3,6,27 April 2013
The Shining," The Shining indeed shines. One of the most iconic horror film, ever.
","This is the thinking man's horror movie. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the movie is loosely based off the novel by Stephen King with the same name. Kubrick takes the concept of King's novel, and makes it, his own. The movie is about Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) a writer with writer's block who takes up a job as caretaker for an isolated, snow-bound hotel over the winter. He brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young child, Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him, where he intends to get some good work done. The Hotel has an ominous murderous past, where previous caretakers and patrons had killed themselves or others. The madness of being isolate in the hotel takes its toll on the family, as the past start to haunt them, forcing one of them to snap. This is one of those confusing films with so many interpretations of what the movie meant. It's no surprised, that fans would love to explore more on its themes and subliminal messages. Some people even watch the film, backwards and forwards at the same time. There are hundreds of interpretations ranging from CIA, The Illuminati, the Gold Standard and others. The most popular ones are that the movie was about the massacre of the American Indians because the film is loaded with Native American symbolism from the hotel's theme, location, and it's never ending supply of Calumet. According to this theory, the infamous visions of gushing red liquid streaming from the elevators actually make sense, as it represents the souls buried deep beneath the hotel, with the elevator cabin dropping down into the basement like in a well, delivering a bucket blood upon its return to the surface. Others believe it's about the holocaust, due to the number 42 being throughout the film. Half-hidden numerology is meant to evoke the year 1942, the same year the Nazis launched the Final Solution. I found it to be a little bit stretch. It could be that the director was fan of Jackie Robinson or really love the romantic movie 'Summer of 1942'. Still, Kubrick loves dipping his hand into Nazism symbolism. Then there are those, who think Kubrick made this movie to come clean about helping the government fake the moon landing because a character wore an Apollo 11 sweater and how the room 237, represent the number of distance from the earth to the moon. Most of this theory come from a 2002's French mockumentary film, call Dark Side of the Moon that was made as a spoof. There is no prove that Kubrick had anything to do with Apollo 11. I do believe that Kubrick's does tackle the themes of coincidences of life, dreams, racism, repressed sexual themes, and the past does not exist in this film. I do believe he use Theseus and the Minotaur as plot references. The huge giant maze was indeed added for the film, only. I dig the part of the Red VW Beetle being smashed up as a jab at Stephen King's source material as an inside joke as if saying, it's my movie, now. The other theories of the film are less lunatic, but drawn from small details like chair disappearing, TV had no cord, the window being in an odd place, typewriter changing colors, the carpet changing patterns, Etc. Etc. The people in the film, think Stanley Kubrick can't make mistakes. I for one, don't think Kubrick is a perfect with full control of every tiny little thing on his sets. Most of these examples seem more errors, then metaphors. The way, its shot is great for the most part. I love the opening helicopter shot of the lake. Wonderfully shot, lots of long, smooth tracking shots and perfectly placed imagery and slow dissolves. One of the famous sequences in which the camera tracks Danny. That was pretty cool to watch. Really great striking imagery, like the blood-red and white bathroom. The use of color is one of the highlights. The title screens & accompanying screeching orchestra is amazing use of a countdown. The score is fittingly atmospheric and unique. The drum winding up and down is particularly great. The movie does have some different in International cinema releases and new releases. Stanley Kubrick shot Jack's typewriter pages in different languages for release in different countries. Also, some versions add the delete scenes to it. It makes for a lot of re-watch value. Although it made for a better, tighter film, if it wasn't there. It's interesting to see the film spell things out, but these scenes ultimately hurt the pacing, so it was right to cut. Still, there were some awful WTF frankly hilarious shot with skeletons with Shelley and the man in the bear suit that could had been chop. The acting was alright for the most part. Jack Nicholson is captivating and terrifying. He gives a believable performance. Still, his acting isn't much of a stretch, as Jack, the actor been known as a crazy guy, before this movie. Shelley Duvall is mediocre at best. Wendy, the clueless housewife, is barely tolerable before things go down. When they do, she's just there to be the final girl. I'm sure it was emotionally & physically draining for the actress, but nobody liked her on set! It's seem like Stanley and her, bump heads a lot in this film, and you really do see, how much Stanley didn't like, working with her. The writing is pretty good. I love how dialogue changes tone, topic, seriousness and deadly intent line by line. Still, I wish there were more things from the book, add to this film. I like the power of the Shining, be used more in the film. The book makes the father, more of a tragic figure, than the straight out jerk in this film. Overall: Here's Johnny and he's absolutely incredible to watch.",9,3,5,14 August 2014
Warrior," Warrior is on a Warpath! What an awesome movie! It was a knockout!
","This amazing family drama movie from 2011 made megastars out of then-unknown actors, Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Both really put great performances in and out of the ring. Both really took a beaten, to make the cage fighting seem real. Edgerton suffer from a torn MCL, while Tom Hardy suffered a broken toe, broken ribs, and a broken finger. It takes a lot of guts just to do that. Not only does Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, make very brutality and believable gritty fights, but I love how both were able to touch the heart-strings as well. The intensity from both of them, made this movie, very entertaining. Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie tells the stories of two estranged brothers, Troubled Iraq vet, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) & unemployed and indebt teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) who enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament to compete with each other, for their own good moral reasons. Who is going to win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love the fact, that the movie doesn't make, a bad seed out of Tommy or Brendan. Both characters have their faults, and their good side. However, I do believe that their one-dimensional fighting styles, don't really match up with their personality. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to see, Tom Hardy all buff out and knocking people out, with his striking ability, but it makes little to no sense in the context of the character's history. After all, wasn't this man once a former wrestling prodigy? Wouldn't he be, doing more takes down, and arm holds than his brother, Brendan!? I don't get it! Another problem with the film is the huge gaps in logic within the story structure. A good example is how Tommy even got back to the US, if he supposedly went AWOL in Iraq. You would think, that wouldn't be easy. Another problem with the film is how the film, has no epilogue, so we never see the repercussions of Tommy's desertion nor find out what becomes of the family he promised to support. What happen to them!? Brendan's story arch isn't any better. Brendan being forced into fighting by economic reasons, to supplement his income is bit of a joke. It doesn't make any sense, since most amateur fighters make little to no money at all. Most of them, pursuit this dangerous career, because it's their dream job. Brendan had no reason to go back into fighting; after all, he was a physic teacher! Colleges would pay, good money for his teaching ability. Brendan's main flaw is his pride. His absolute refusal to file for bankruptcy or move to a smaller house, even though his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison) would rather take that option than watch him risk his life in the ring is be too selfish than inspiring to watch. I know, that Brendan Conlon was based off, real-life math teacher turn UFC fighter, Rich Franklin, but unlike Brendan in the film, Franklin went from teaching math to fighting, because his love for the sport, not economic reason. In my opinion, it would make more sense that Brendan went back into fighting, because that's what he wanted to do; not because he had to. Another thing that seem a bit illogically in the film is how both men whom seem, a bit amateurism in their fighting records, were able to get into the Sparta winner-takes-all competition at all. You would think, that a high-profile, winner-takes-all competition with a $5 million purse would be fill with more season trained fighters than amateur fighters. The mixer of amateurs with mostly unsanctioned fighting records with pro-fighters seem a bit too jarring to be taken seriously. It's like if Daniel LaRusso from 1984's Karate Kid was against Martial Arts Master, Bruce Lee. It's kinda unbelievable to see that ever happening in real life. Although the competition action sequences takes itself pretty realistically; there were too many terrible calls from the ref and judges to make any the fights in this film, seem 100% realistic in real fighting accuracy. I give the movie, more like 75% in that. Still, the idea that a MMA sport event is a brutal blood sport where competitors are able to continue to fight with a broken arm is also a highly doubtful probability. I know that it was played up for dramatic effect, but in reality, getting your arm broken would result in an immediate stoppage, no matter how much you want to continue fighting. While, I have to say, the performances in the ring were really great, despite some flaws, I have to say, that the performances out of the ring, were a little better. Most of the best parts in the film, are the interactions between the family members. The movie deals with some weighty mature content that most people might find, a little too uneasily, to watch. The conflicted relationship between fathers and sons, the estrangement of brothers, PTSD, alcoholism, inferiority, abandonment issues and family debts are all melodrama clichés used at its best. Nick Nolte as the boys' father, Paddy, a retired, recovering alcoholic boxer is outstanding. I was really glad, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for this role, that year. His recovery and his will to redeem himself, made for a very inspiring side story. Another great part of this film is the soundtrack by Mark Isham. The track 'Listening to the Beethoven', is amazing. Not only that, but the music that came along with it, such as the band, the Natural's song 'About Today' was gripping to hear. Overall: This underdog emotional fighting story was a major hit for me. Tons of manly tears from me. A great inspiring punch, to knock some sense in you, if you're feeling out of the fight. A must-watch.",8,6,9,3 January 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator is back, yet again! Is this movie worth watching? Yes, indeed!
","Continuing the story of the first film, 1984's 'Terminator'; 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' finds a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the first movie, having now to protect her young son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from a more advanced cyborg, T-1000 (Robert Patrick) made out of liquid metal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love how nightmarish, the opening was, with its heaven and hell motif. The burning playground, with it symbolize the four horsemen of apocalypse made it, very scary. The scenery ends with the T-800 Terminator endoskeleton, symbolizing a chrome figure of death. Wow, intense. Directed by James Cameron, the film is designed in such way that the audience doesn't know which of the time travelers might be the good guy at first. Not only that, T2 conquered one of the biggest challenges in storytelling ever - to completely spin the audience's emotions on the character and turn the most ruthless killer into a sympathetic father figure. Arnold really did great, showing that with Cameron's help. The sunglasses are an important story device in T2. In the first movie they meant to dehumanize T-800 as he takes on more damage, becoming less and less human-like in appearance. In T2, the meaning of the sunglasses has an even deeper meaning as it represent his gradual transformation, from stone-cold killer, to something more human. Because of things like that, the movie carry a strong moral message. The fact that the Terminator was ordered not to kill people becomes a major point of the story as it really deliver the relationship, he has with the young John Conner. Both actors did well in their roles, showing their humanity. Linda Hamilton does the opposite, as she turn her character from a scared, vulnerable waitress into a tough, aggressive machine-like assassin with a muscular physique to match. It's the startling physical transformation that adds a whole other level of psychological credibility to Sarah's character. The way the movie is shot and the story and angles constructed, makes this, a well-executed, action-packed sequel to 'Terminator'. It has a great variety of action set-pieces, car chases and quotable one-liners to make anybody, entertained. Because of things like that, Terminator 2 still remains one of the best action films of all time! Not only that, but it's also one of the most influential sequels in Hollywood blockbuster history. It's nearly a perfect blockbuster movie. However, the movie does have flaws that other critics might overlook, because of nostalgia reasons. First off, the indifferences of Edward Furlong's age between shots. Since, the filming of this film, took some sufficiently time, in many of the scenes, Furlong has indeed visibly aged, despite, the whole film events, happening in a few days. It's clear that he was much younger, when they film the desert scenes, compare to the others. You can see it, when his voice began to break and had to be pitched to one level in post-production. Despite that, Furlong did alright in the role, and wasn't that annoying. Another issue with the film, is how dated, it is. After all, the film's significant date known as 'Judgment Day', is August 29 1997. It's a bit laughable, seeing that. Even the 1990s references, are starting to lose some traction, with every year that pass. One jarring thing, that some people might notice, is how Terminators don't really act like machines. You know, for killer cyborgs, they really do suck at their jobs. Isn't there, supposed to be a technological singularity, where humans can't compete with the machine? So, why does this movie have scenes, where machines are doing stupid things, like cooking dinner or asking people to call out, names? It doesn't make sense for them, too. Like, how did T-1000, time travel since only living tissue can go through time and he's liquid metal? Despite those nitpicking, the biggest fault of the film is the troublesome and convoluted timeline. While, Terminator 2 is probably the cleanness of all of the films, the movie's ending is a mixed bag for me. I get that, the key message of T2 is that, if events in the past are altered, an already existing future or present can be changed. However, if Judgment Day were prevented, as shown in the film, then there'd shouldn't been no Future War – and no Terminator sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, meaning no Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to father, John Connor. I guess, paradoxes can be avoided, by appealing either to the Novikov self-consistency principle or to the notion of branching parallel universes, similar to some type of multiverse theory, but my brain kinda hurt thinking too hard on it. As much as I dislike 2003's 'Terminator 3', as least, the inevitable type ending, made a lot more sense than 'Terminator 2', open-ended climax. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie's open road bittersweet ending. It will make you cry & yes, it is way better than the original altered ending, and 3 times, better than anything else in the previous 'Terminator' films, I saw, but it does leave too much open-questions on how time travel works. Anyways, the great quality of the film, surpass any of the flaws, the film may have. After all, this is the film that made CGI effects seem pleasant. Along, with Robert Patrick wonderful acting, the CGI effects made the T-1000, an iconic villain. Even, the normal practical effects, from Stan Winston was amazing. Terminator 2 even works with wondering haunting theme song from Brad Fiedel. Overall: The movie is masterpiece. The ideas of fate and destiny, determinism and fee will, and the empowerment of the individual and the ability of every person to change the course of the future makes this movie so great. This movie has a lot of depth that few action/science fiction films come compete with, because of that, it's a must-watch.",9,3,7,10 June 2016
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Walk Hard, Hard. Down life's rocky road. Walk bold, hard. That's my creed, my code. Walk Hard is a funny tongue-in-cheek movie, worth checking out.
","Considering how bad, the parody genre has gotten as of late. I was blown away by how good this movie was. It's so good, that somewhat belongs in the same levels of filmmakers: David Zucker, Monty Python and Mel Brooks's finest works. Directed by Jake Kasdan, and written and produced by Judd Apatow. 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' tells the story of the hard-knock life of musician Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly) from his rags-to-riches beginnings, his raise as a megastar country star, his struggle with drug abuse, and his redemption in his later life with his later-wife, Darlene Madison (Jenna Fischer). If this story sounds very familiar. The plot echoes the storyline of 2005's Johnny Cash biopic, 'Walk the Line' and 2004's Ray Charles biopic 'Ray'. While, Walk Hard mostly heavily references, those two films, there were also a various amounts of other biopics that the film used as inspiration, such as 2004's 'Beyond the Sea', about singer, Bobby Darin and 2007's 'I'm not There' about musician, Bob Dylan to name some. The film also includes elements of the lives and careers of Roy Orbison, Glen Campbell, Jerry Lee Lewis, Donovan, James Brown, Jim Morrison, Conway Twitty, Neil Diamond, and Brian Wilson. The film portrays fictional versions of artists Buddy Holly (Frankie Muntz), The Big Bopper (John Ennis), Elvis Presley (Jack White) and the Beatles: Paul McCarthy (Jack Black), George Harrison (Justin Long), John Lennon (Paul Rudd), and Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman). Additionally, some real-life artists were filmed, playing themselves, including Eddie Vedder, Jewel Kicher, Lyle Lovett and Ghostface Killah. In addition, the film feature several musical styles such as the late 1950's R&B movement, the early 1960's California Sound, the late 1960s Vietnam War Protest Folk-music style, the early 1970s, Space Oddity and last 1970s punk rock movement. Despite the humorous approach to the music genre, the film was so well crafted, that the parody music feature for the films became big hits on their own right. Songs like 'Walk Hard', 'Take my Hand', 'Guilty as charged', 'Let's Duet' & others was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award. Songwriter, Michael Andrews and Jon Reilly recorded 40 original songs, which 33 are featured in the movie. All with different music styles. That's pretty impressed. Not only that, but John Reilly sang most of the song. Who knew that John Reilly, not only was a gifted comedian, but also an amazing singer!? I didn't see it, coming. However, Singer Angela Correa did had to provide the voice of Darlene Madison Cox as Jenna couldn't pull it off. Despite that, she did pretty well for the role, that she was given. Honestly, most of the actors in this film, were funny in their own right. As a biopic parody, the movie is very funny. It hit every funny bone for me. Very few misses. If the movie had any faults; I can say, the later unrated version is very disappointing. Adding more juvenile gratuitous nudity and gross sight toilet humor doesn't really make your movie, any better. It's not fan service that most people want to see. Even women and gay people might think it's too much. Also, some of the jokes were a bit tasteless like the whole kid getting killed by a machete fight. Making fun of Johnny Cash's real-life boyhood tragedy is a bit much. It's somewhat offensive. It's shock value that really fails to gain any point of reaction than annoyed. It really doesn't add much to the film that the semi-smart dialogue double sexual entendres hasn't done better. If anything, it just makes the film plot go slower. It's no wonder, Sony felt like to cut over twenty four minutes out of the original film, when it was released. It really did make the film, seem way too long. In my opinion, just go see, the original version over this. Other negative elements of this film is how the movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The movie relates way too much on being clichés to be, really that funny. It felt a bit tiresome at parts, because it's predictable. It's so unlike the other comedy music films like 2003's 'A Mighty Wind' or 1984's 'This is Spiral Tap' that relies on some music movie clichés, but also brings something new to the genre to work with. Those films were a little more sophistical with its humor. You really don't know, what's going to happen in those films. Overall: Because of that, I felt like 'Walk Hard' could had been something, really great, but in the end, falls somewhere near above average. Still, I can highly recommended, seeing this film.",6,4,6,22 July 2016
Duck Soup," This soup wasn't hot. It was lukewarm
","I'm sorry to say this, but this movie is kinda overrated. When you compare it to the other Marx Brother's films; it's not that funny. Honestly, in my opinion, the only reason why this movie is well-remember, is because of the memorable mirror gag. The concept of the mirror gag isn't new, at all. After all, Charlie Chaplin used a similar joke in 1916's film, the Floorwalker. While, this might be the best known appearance of the joke, the rest of the film doesn't live up, in value. Directed by Leo McCarey, and set in the fantasy bankrupt world of Freedonia, Duck Soup tells the story of the country leader, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) declaring war on neighboring bankrupt Sylvania, so that he can win, the love of wealthy widow Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) in a last ditch attempt to keep his country afloat. Without spoiling the movie too much, I found the premise to be, very jarring. I can understand, why this movie didn't do so good, during the Great Depression. Audiences at the time, were taken aback by such preposterous political disregard, buffoonery, and cynicism at a time of economic and political crisis that many didn't bother to see it. A lot of those people didn't like how the movie compare nationalism to a minstrel show. The satirical depiction of Freedonia is said to have led then, Dictator Benito Mussolini to ban the film in Italy. Despite that, the movie wasn't a box office bomb as some people saw it. It did pretty well, despite mixed results from critics and trouble production. Although this by itself, did not end the group's business with Paramount. Bitter contract disputes indeed, did the group in. After the film was done, the Marx Brothers and Paramount agreed to part ways. Despite playing different characters with different names, the Marx Brothers are pretty much, playing their stereotypical stage act selves in their roles. There's Groucho that has the anarchic wise guy with the drawn-on moustache. He has some of the funniest zingers, insults, and comebacks. His chemistry with Margaret Dumont are some of the best. Then there is Chico who plays likable Italian stereotype in every role. He has some funny bits, here. Then, there is Harpo, the mute, childish, slightly annoying one, there for kid appeal. Sadly, this was the last Marx Brothers film to feature Zeppo. Zeppo knows for playing the traditional straight man, quit movie acting, overall, due to being the butt of jokes regarding him as the 'unfunny' Marx brother. Anyways, don't look for anything new from them. They just going with what talent, got them to the show. The movie story isn't that great as well. It's often very complex, and doesn't make any sense. I know that war was still a profitable business, back then, but how is having a bunch of people kill each other, over a silly reason, supposed to be funny? It's doesn't sound, funny. Anyways, it gets more confusing, when Harpo and Chico are found to be spies for Sylvania, but they able choose to fight for Freedonia, instead. It's hard to tell, where this movie is going for, between the spies business and them, trying to anger another street vendor. Also, why were they acting like dicks to that street vendor!? It's not like, he did anything wrong to them. Don't get me wrong, there were some funny moments. I did like how film pokes fun at the Hays Code by showing a woman's bedroom and then showing a woman's shoes on the floor, a man's shoes and horseshoes. Then it cut away to Harpo sleeping in the bed with the horse; the woman is in the twin bed next to them. That was somewhat funny, but overall, it was really dated humor. Another problem with this film is the musical numbers. The musical numbers, didn't really match well with the rest of the story. The first musical number in the film that accompanies Firefly's first day in office really wasn't needed, and felt too similar to the one that introduce Groucho's character in 1932's Horsefeathers. I didn't find it to be the worst. The worst had to be; the trial scene turning into an absurd musical number. That was really out of place. It wasn't really funny, it was just really odd. Anyways, breaking with their usual pattern, neither Harpo's harp nor Chico's piano is used in the film. Although Harpo briefly pretends to play harp on the strings of a piano, strumming chords in accompaniment to a music box that is playing the unlikely chime tune of 'Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf', ' from rival studio, Disney's Three Little Pigs, released the same year as Duck Soup. The songs got even worst, as the movie went on. One line in a variant on the old Negro spiritual 'All God's Chillun Got Wings' was cut out, from the film's current DVD release, due to its offending nature to African Americans. In my opinion, it's a product of its time, and should had been kept in the film. I just glad, the DVD didn't felt like censoring any more scenes. Anyhow, most copies of the film are pretty good copies. There are hardly any grains or film dirt in most DVDs. The DVD releases are in HD and worth checking out. It has tons of special features, worth watching. Overall: While, it's not quite as good as its predecessor. This is still a highlight in the Marxian filmography. It's a must watch",7,3,10,18 August 2015
We're the Millers," It's Millers Time. This was a pretty Dope movie! It was a good trip!
","I thought this was a pretty good movie! I have to agree with a lot of critics when thinking this movie should had gone raunchier with an R rated movie. It seem pretty tame for a Rated R film. Honestly, it seem like a PG-13 film. It could had been. I think the movie still work without the nudity, extreme violence, and gross out humor. It was still edgy enough. The movie was a high concept comedy with a lot of soft ball jokes. I think the characters were goofy and their interactions were fun, but once you got the characters this movie was the same joke over and over. There were some funny endearing moments that I did like, and I didn't mind some over-the-top edgy stuff that I found objectionable. The film is directed by Rawon Marshall Thurber. David Burke (Jason Sudeikis) is a small-time pot dealer who just got rob of his stash and his cash. Jason Sudeikis plays the role very smooth. While he is an unlikeable character, there is a bit of charm in him that get easier to deal with, as the movie go on. I like his quick quirks. I wouldn't say the character go to any character arch, because he was still a jerk by the end of the film, but at less he isn't the biggest one. By getting rob, this leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). Ed Helm is a huge surprise for me. I never thought of him as a crazy drug smuggler. He somewhat steals the movie from everybody else. In order to wipe the slate clean, David must now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest shipment in from Mexico by acting as if he is a family man. I do have to say, that some of the acting isn't that great. Jennifer Aniston as David's pretend to be wife, Rose is one of the less convincing strippers ever put on film. Not once does she have any of the stripper moves or attitude that I was hoping for this film, if any, she's like those mothers that take stripping classes for a feel. I would say she is pretty tame for an outlandish stripper. Also, if you came to this movie to see Jennifer Aniston's nude, then you will be deeply disappointed. Plus, you need a life. I have to say Will Poulter, as clueless good round kid, Kenny (Will Poulter) was pretty interesting to watch. The last movie, I saw of him was 2007's Son of Rainbow, where he plays a tough ass punk. In real life, this actor isn't that awkward. Total change from the norm. Talking about change from the norm, Emma Roberts as streetwise Casey wasn't too bad. I just wish her character had more to do. I do have to say the rest of the supporting cast wasn't that bad. The Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly Quinn), were interesting to watch. Molly Quinn is one hot lady, in my opinion. I think I felt in love, too. Nick Offerman was just great. The big jokes weren't that funny because it was so predictable, but the small jokes were just off the wall, funny. I didn't mind the dick and vulgar jokes. The skateboard drawing scene was pretty funny. Dumb sight gags are the ones that got me and are funny. I like the Orca eating the dolphin in the background, the funny big mug, and everything that Ed Helm did while talking on the phone. I did like the TLC 'Waterfalls' singing moment. It's family moments like that, that get to you. In my opinion, while they are not a real family, they really did seem like one. The other supporting cast who play a real family seem more fake then the Millers. Some critics hate the film due to its homophobic nature. The only thing I noticed was the main characters weren't very comfortable engaging in homosexual acts. Probably because they were straight. That's not homophobic, at all. So I don't get anybody logic in that. Another thing to note, a lot of critics hate it do to the weed promoting. While weed is throughout the film. None of the main character use or smoke it. I don't think it's promoting drug dealing at all. It's pretty much saying that dealing weed will end up badly for you. The Mexican drug war/drug trade is brutal with thousands of innocent people being killed in horrific ways on a yearly basis. Not to mention the destroyed lives on any number of levels. It's shows that there is negative side of drug dealing. I do have to criticize the ending. The ending was a bit of a disappointment as none of the characters really learn anything, and sadly wasn't punish for it. Well, it's a comedy, not a melodrama. I didn't care about the plot holes, like how the drug dealers were able to find the Millers so fast. So it was OK. In the end, We're the Miller was a good fun movie to watch that shouldn't be taken too serious. Just watch and enjoy.",7,3,6,6 September 2013
The Patriot," Don't Thread on the Patriot. It's pretty entertaining despite some faults.
","This movie is a pretty entertaining film, despite the fact that it lacks much historical accuracy and highly controversial for it criticized for demonizing the British Army, and for white-washing slavery out of the time. Still, the movie directed by Roland Emmerich of disaster movie fame, gave us a movie worth watching on Independence Day. I wouldn't be shameful to admit, that I honestly like this movie. The fictional historical war movie take place in American Revolutionary South Carolina, where Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is trying to raise his family in peace. When the movie comes to his doorsteps, and his family threaten, Martin takes on the arms, to help lead the American to freedom. The movie plot is basically the same with Mel Gibson's 1995's epic film, 'Braveheart', nothing really new. Once again, he's out for revenge, this time against Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaac) whom made Martin's life, a living hell. The movie is bloody, gruesome, and violence as hell. I have never saw a movie before this that portray the Napoleonic tactics so brutal. Still, there are some very light moments, some clever comedy, and even a love-story. While, the love-story isn't as strong as Braveheart levels, with Martin love affair with his widow's sister, Charlotte Selton (Joely Richardson) and Martin's son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) love affair with Anne Howard (Lisa Brenner). It didn't felt, too forced. The film does have a great relationship with the father/son that makes it worth checking out. I have to say, Heath Ledger was pretty much show that he could become a leading man with this film. I do think that Martin does have way too much children in the film that it's hard to keep track of them. I just glad, they didn't notice too much on them and more on him leading a rag-tag team of Militia men. The men were given some backstory, and each one was pretty interesting characters. You got the Reverend (Rene Auberjonois), the wild man (Leon Rippy), the slave (Jay Arlen Jones), the semi-racist Southern (Donald Logue) and the French Man (Tchéky Karyo). The movie also had some interesting real life historical figures played by great actors such as Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkenson) and Col. Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper), influence and based off of Henry 'Lighthorse' Lee. Honestly, one of the best scenes in the movie, had to be with Charles Cornwallis and Benjamin Martin doing prison exchange. It was just so fun to watch. Jason Isaac's character is loosely based on Banastre Tartleton who might had cause the Waxhaw Massacre in which prisoners of war were brutally executed. The event helped to create the common image of him as a brutal commander, uninterested in the conventions of civilized warfare, but is a subject of debate, if he indeed fully did those horrible acts, himself. While, Tartleton is indeed a bit crude, he was more human, than Tavington whom is played as sadistic over the top one-dimensional evil villain. Honestly, in real life, the British Army at the time, would probably hang him or discharge him for how often, he disobey orders and how many atrocities was caused by his own hands. Another fault that some critic pick on is how they made Benjamin Martin into the hero, even with him committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on real American Revolutionary War heroes: Andrew Pickens, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter, but mostly Francis Marion. Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, was the foremost guerrilla fighter of the Revolution; unfortunately, Marion had no qualms about slavery and he certainly didn't free any of his slaves. Hence, to make Martin more sympathetic to modern audiences, Martin is made anti-slavery sentiments and made Martin not a slave owner. This decision received criticism as a cop-out. What save the Patriot from being one-sided, is that it does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character's haunting guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the French and Indian War. Sadly, it get somewhat lost, once the film ends with the sappy happy ending. We never know if he still, being haunted by his actions or any new actions, he commit in this war. Rather than realistic anti-war character, Martin somehow is shoe horse as patriotism hero, even if that not the reason why he went to war in the first place. It makes no sense. Most of the war atrocities in the film, have no factual basis and parallel to the American or European 18th century wars, anyways. Yes, the movie is historical inaccurate, but the film does look like it takes place in 18th century, America. The location sets, the costumes, and the visual/special effects were all amazing. The score by John William is beautiful to listen to. Overall: Like Uncle Sam says, I want you to watch it. It's a good watch.",7,7,9,6 July 2014
Edward Scissorhands," On paper, Edward Scissorhands sound weird, but after watching this movie. It indeed rocks! It's cutting edge. A very beautiful film. A winner.
","Don't cut yourself, from this movie. This movie worth, being connection to. Written & Directed by Tim Burton with help from screenwriter Caroline Thompson, this nostalgia romantic fairy tale hybrid is an American Masterpiece. Without a doubt, Burton's best movie, so far. The film tells the story of an unfinished artificial man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors for hands. Abandoned by his creator, a lonely inventor (Vincent Price, in what was his final film appearance); Edward is taken in by a blind optimism saleswoman, Peg Boggs (Dianne West), and her suburban family after she discovers him, alone in the ruins of a once great laboratory. Peg tries really hard to get Edward to fit in, with society by showing his talents for yard decoration, pet grooming and eventually hairstyling. However, there are those, within the community, who doesn't like Edward, because of his indifferent, yet innocent kindness. Driven by envy, jealousy and hate, they try to cast out, Edward, out of the town. Can Edward win the hearts & mind of the people, or will the people slowing turn against him, due to his monstrous appearance and his mysterious, yet frightening past? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I love the mixer of Victorian Era Style Gothic Horror with that of the 1960s Americana Style of Comedy. It made for a very unique watch. The movie had some really wonderful set pieces. Some of them, remind me of the old German Expressionism set pieces of the silent era. The movie also had some of the best make up, I have ever witness. Great work from make-up artist legend, Stan Winston. Another beautiful thing from the film is the music by Danny Elfman. It was so enchanting to hear. I can still hear, it's haunting, but memorizing tune. It's also nice to see, that this film, started the long collaborate between Tim Burton & that of character actor, Johnny Depp. This movie indeed, shows, how good, a character actor like Johnny Depp would later become. Great acting from him. This movie also, felt like one of the last, charming performances of Winona Ryder, before she fell into mediocrity, in my opinion. She had great chemistry with Johnny Depp in this film. Supporting actors like Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin also add to the wow-factor of the film. Even, Anthony Michael Hall made a huge impact. It was so weird, seeing him, morph from a skinny-nerdy guy in his earlier films into a tough-looking bad guy here. Despite all, the praise, I gave the movie, I'm also willing to state out, that this movie does some flaws. Some of the biggest ones, come from the weak logistics of the story. It's full of jarring plot-holes, bad exposition and daydreaming direction. Some of the biggest examples are what were the reasons, why Edward was even given, scissors for hands? Another is whatever, happened to the body of Edward's so call, father? Last one, is the most jarring. Where does he get the ice to make snow in the first place? How can we even comprehend this!? The movie never answer those questions and some more. However, in my opinion, it doesn't really need to, since it's a fantasy film, and people should take it, in face-value, but I understand, if they don't. The story does seem a bit uncompleted. Another problem that people have, against the film is that it seem like it ripping off, author Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In my view, I see the movie more like a homage to Frankenstein than a rip-off. Like Frankenstein's creature, Edward, is born virtuous. Full of tabula rasa in the beginning, it's only, when he sees the ugliness of the people, through their intolerance, that he began to withdrawn himself, from such an ignorant society. I can understand, why certain people might hate the ending to this film, since it was indeed depressing, but in my thoughts. I saw that movie tragic ending, does works within the confine of the story. Changing the ending would had, a lesser impact on its audiences. They was no other way to end the film. There is an obvious purpose on why the suburban houses look nearly identical, oversize and full of bright colors. It's to show, that despite, the majority of Americans saying, they're for a melting pot, there are still somethings; they're unwilling to accept. It's a satire joke, well played by the director. A lasting thought, to take home and think over. It's also a good, sad social commentary on how our society, mistreat those who might have different culture, or those who are sick or ill, or those of a different social status. I don't care, if it's depressing, I care that it leaves a very thought-provoking message in the end. After all, there is a good reason why the movie shows the Ice Dance flashback, before the credits. It's to tell, the audience, that despite, cut off ties, we all, still connected, by one great human emotion, and that's love. So in the end, it's not too tragic, but bittersweet. While, the movie only a modest success at the time, in part because of the strange premise. The film has since gained a large fan base, and turned out to one of the best collaborations between Burton and Depp. In 2005, it was adapted into a ballet by British choreographer Matthew Bourne and thoughts of a musical Broadway play, are not off the table in the future. Overall: Edward Scissorhands is a great movie, not only because of its sheer beauty, but its strong message of self-discovery and tolerance. Thank you Tim Burton for making a great film.",8,5,6,5 December 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Trying to find the Silver Lining in this movie. It's just hard to find. It's one crazy movie. It was okay film.
","My opinion on the film can be describe by one scene. I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie but when the credits end, I was like Bradley Cooper's character, Patrick Solitano after finishing the Ernest Hemingway's book 'Farewell to Arms'. I was wondering 'what the hell?' did I watched. I don't understand the big buzz about this film. For me it was just another higher so-so predictable romantic comedy film. The movie overall was kind of a turn off for me, personally. Maybe, it's the fact that I know bi-polars people, and I hate to watch films that trigger feelings about those people, or just that the fact, all the yelling and arguing in the film made me wonder why am I watching this as an 'escape from reality' film when people yell and argue way too much in real life. It really hard to get through the film with such disturbing scenes like Patrick looking for his wedding video, and where Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) freaks out in front of the movie theater. Me, personally, I don't like movies that has too much yelling. It hurts my ears. The dramatic elements that were being displayed kinda left me more depressed than sympathetic. Don't watch the trailer by the way, gives out too much of the plot. After a stint in a mental institution, Pat moves back in with his parent's house and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more complex for him when Pat meets Tiffany. Like I said before, it's a romantic comedy so it's has a predictable like ending, but no way a chick flick. I really enjoy the director's work; David O. Russell. But the movie feels like three different movies mash into one. I felt the football theme and the ballroom dancing didn't mesh well with mental history as a background. It even look like a romantic comedy half way through the film, but seriously, they forgot about the characters' mental problems and it never gets resolve in the film. I was deeply disappointed. To get back to what Pat says about Hemingway's book, yes, it would be nicer to see stories that end with a happy ending, than tragedy. I glad the movie did have a happy ending, but still, I was left wondering how these two will keep a relationship going when its build upon mental issues, and a history of violence. It's like watching two mental people fall in love with each other without knowing if they will be OK. Most people, I know that has mental problems mixing with another person with mental problem end up with negative outcomes mostly in death or somebody getting hurt. The movie play it safe with a romantic ending. The film does captured the struggles of living with bi-polar. I love how the film shows the illness from the perspectives of those who live with them and those who interact with people affected. I can see Cooper in the role. I loved how he said rude things, but, he made it actually sound like he's just bipolar. I just couldn't get into the character of Tiffany. I know they were trying to make it seem like she was depress goth-head sex addict, but it didn't work out. She seem more like a stalker than anything. She follows Pat like a craze fan. Her character seem to be have more an Adjustment disorder then a normal depression. I just couldn't figure out what she was supposed to be. It was direction-less. Still, there was nothing in Lawrence performance that made me say, yeah, she really deserve that Best Actress win at the Oscars. Even Director Russell did not believe Lawrence was suitable for the role and her audition was only a formality at first. I have to agree with him. While, I do find her sexy and glad that she can handle a mature role. I felt it was mediocre at best. The chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence characters didn't make seem like they should even like each other. I was a little disturbed when I saw the age different between the actors. I did the math on Bradley and Lawrence ages, and while it does seem odd. I do love Robert De Niro as Pat's OCD over crazed Eagles football fan father. Still, it felt like I was watching Robert De Niro playing Robert De Niro. A darker, more extreme version was filmed and scenes were shot with De Niro's character being harsher. Glad, those scenes weren't used. I do have to say, another running gag was Pat's friend, Danny (Chris Tucker) trying to escape from the mental hospital. I have to say, this is one of the few movies with Chris Tucker where he wasn't annoying. So dark and sad, but so funny at the same time. The dialogue was clever, but seem forced. The movie was very different than the book written by Matthew Quick with the same name in that it was more rounded for broader audiences. The book took the more psychological route but was still heartwarming and comical. The end of the movie was totally different than the book, but I think it was done that way to achieve individuality from the book, in a way. The film has a subplot about gambling that is not in the novel, that the NFL didn't love. Notably, while Pat's condition is never specified in the novel, one can infer from both his narrative about his memories, and other events as they unfold, that he suffered from Traumatic Brain Injury. Overall: the movie is worth checking out, because it's entertaining, but if you feel uncomfortable about a film dealing with mental illness without really trying to solve it. Then check out another film. Just try to find a Silver Lining in the end.",7,3,6,29 July 2013
Divergent," If one choice could define you. I have chosen to watch the film. My test results for the film is that; it's a pretty good movie
","Divergent was indeed made to capitalize on the popularity of the Hunger Games book & film series by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, it's a total rip-off, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth was influence by the books and inspiration to make her own. It's no differ, than Suzanne Collins taking elements from previous novels like George Orwell's 1984 and Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. For people to say, Divergent is a total rip-off of Hunger Games is an understatement. If anything, the movie is more influence by novel works like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, Orson Scott Card's Ender Games, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Even the movie takes bit of its story from films like 2010's Inception by Christopher Nolan & Mark Water's 2004's Mean Girls. Other influences come from the Meyers-Briggs personality tests, Milgram experiment, and attitude toward divergent thinking (ATDT). This is a Psychology major fan film. With all this influences, Divergent create its own identify. The movie starts out in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Members join a faction based on their preference but are initially given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Every year, 16-year-olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, but something went wrong, with Beatrice's test; as she shows that she has more than one personality trait, meaning that she's a Divergent. Since Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they're considered threats to the existing social order. The premise can be too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. You have to suspense your disbelief on this premise, as it's hard to believe that people can only have one personality trait. Since, it's a Sci-fiction film, anything is really possible. Personally, for a movie that supposedly has a lot of one-dimensional personality characters, these characters really do have a lot of divergent type traits. The pacing is a bit slow, as most of the time, the film focus on her time with the Dauntless. The training kinda did go a little too long. The plot could be a bit confusing, with all the tests, they go through and seeing how some test matter and some don't. The whole exposition somewhat got lost between the transfer from book to screen, as it wasn't that clear to the audience. Seeing how this film is the first one of the 3 books with the sequels Insurgent and Allegiant on their way. This movie will leave you with more questions, than answers, if you haven't read the books. Even if you readt the books, there are some minor different from the book to the film. The dream scenes were a bit longer in the book. Some characters such as Peter (Miles Teller)'s level of bullying is reduced to verbal comments as in the book, he's more engage in sexual abusing, and physical provoke her. Another big missing piece from the book is one of the character getting stabbed in the eye. Hopefully, they can fit that in, the next movies. Nothing too big was change in this film, so it's a fairly well adapted movie. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Shailene Woodley nearly quit acting in 2011, so it's good that she didn't, as she was great as the main lead. Theo James as her love-interest was pretty cool to have. The only problem is that Theo James acting really doesn't stand out. If anything, he kinda could be mistaken for James Franco. The supporting cast made out of Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q and Kate Winslet were all great in their own roles. The movie could need some more minority characters. I don't know if it's part of the story, with the white washing due to its being a post-apocalypse or Hollywood just being ethnic bias. After all, the United States seems to be home to large groups of immigrants of many races and ethnicities and they rarely depicted in films like this. Even Hunger Games had more ethnic characters than this. It really doesn't look like people from Chicago. I also would like not everybody looking like a model. It kinda hurts the realistic tone that the film is possible to represent. The movie was shot beautifully by director Nick Berger. The mirror scene alone had some really good symbolism. The music choice was pretty good. My favorite had to be Run Boy Run – Woodkid. I wouldn't say this movie is a chick flick or only for young adults as there is enough material for everybody to relate to. Overall: It's a surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation. I'll be looking forward to the sequels.",7,8,11,11 September 2014
Rocky IV," Yo, Adrian! Rocky IV was pretty fun to watch!
","The Rocky Series has gone from being Oscar Winner Motion Picture to Over the Top Cheese fest. Rocky IV may be weird, but it's still fun to watch! After all, Rocky IV is most financially successful entry in the Rocky franchise. At less, it's not unwatchable as Rocky V. Rocky IV is probably one of those movies where you should leave logic and reasoning at the door and just have a wild time. I can't hate this movie. It's a guilty pleasure to watch. It's gloriously over the top. Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off, with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) enjoy his life, after his big win fight from 1982's Rocky 3. The fun is short-lived, as Soviet boxer, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is looking to dethrone the reigning boxer champions of America. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove to himself that, he still got it, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. The results were not in his favors as Drago beats Apollo mercilessly. Incensed by Drago's cold indifference and feeling a deep sense of guilt, Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's lost by agreeing to fight Drago in Russia on Christmas Day in an unsanctioned 15-round bout. Can Rocky beat the Russian, or will Drago prove to the world, how great, he is as a super athlete? It's awesome to see the near titan like figure of a maxed out Dolph Lundgren towering over the much smaller Stallone. You really can see him as a big challenge to Rocky Balboa even if the plot is pretty damn predictable. Lundgren as Ivan Drago is fine. . I do love the great one-liners from Drago throughout this film. Drago remind me a lot of Max Schmeling. Schmeling was a German boxer who fought Joe Louis in two fights that were seen as conflicts between the United States and Nazi Germany, the same way Drago's fights with Apollo and Rocky were Cold War conflicts. And like Schmeling, Drago dramatically won the first fight and received a vicious beating in the second, the major difference being Joe Louis was avenging his previous loss instead of the death of a friend. Max Baer, another fighter from the same era as Louis and Schmeling, may have been another influence, as Baer killed a man in the ring in a rather similar manner to how Drago end Apollo Creed. The action scenes are great, but Rocky hasn't really been known for boxing realism from the get go. Filming the fighting scenes was a nightmare, as additionally, Stallone claimed that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit due to being too aggression. Indeed, Stallone also got injury by Lundgren, due to the fact, that Lundgren punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body. He nearly died. The cold war propaganda backdrop is a bit cartoony, as the Russians fighter is so one-dimensional evil. I do have to say, Brigitte Nielsen as Drago's wife is amazing add on. She was so fine, back then. Not only did Stallone made the Russians made out to be vicious, but also cheaters, due to the illegal steroids use. The movie makes sure to make Rocky look good, as his character use old fashion hard work farm training to get his muscle tone. Honestly, throwing heavy logs, chops down trees, pulls an overloaded snow sleigh, jogs and even climb a mountain in heavy snow and treacherous icy conditions isn't a very healthy way to train for a fight as a boxer can get back & neck problems. It's so over the top unrealistic. In truth, Sylvester Stallone also cheated to get his body in shape, by using steroids for training for the movie. So all that training montage is damn shame, misleading. I do like the supporting characters returning back, but the film really gave them nothing to work with. Paulie (Burt Young) just accompany Rocky everywhere and use for a bunch of awful jokes like him owning a robot. Yes, a robot, just go with it! Talia Shire as Adrian, just does the old, I'm mad at you wanting to fight routine. It's so tired some. Sylvester Stallone Rocky Balboa here is so far from the Rocky Marciano mixed with Joe Frazier and inspired by Chuck Wepner, Rocky from the first movie. It really feels like two different people. They don't even have 'scrolling Rocky' logo in the opening. The world peace speech in the end was somewhat lost in translation as I couldn't understand, a word, he was saying. The movie did give us some great music. 'Hearts On Fire' by John Cafferty, 'No Easy Out' by Robert Tepper, and 'Living in America' by James Brown are great songs. Still, I really hoping for the Bill Contri 'Gonna fly now' to make appearance in the film. Vince DiCola did a good job with the soundtrack. Overall: a very enjoyable film with some good 1980's film cheese.",7,4,7,15 May 2014
In the Name of the Father," In the Name of the Father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This was indeed a great movie. Amen for that.
","Directed by Jim Sheridan, this biographical film based on the autobiography, 'Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four' by Gerry Conlon. The movie focus on the Gerry Conlon's memoir of his imprisonment in England, for a crime, he didn't commit. In the film, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a trouble young man who would rather explore free love and dope than get a real job. After Gerry Conlon get in deep trouble in Belfast for stripping lead from roofs of houses and causing a riot with British security forces. Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), saves him from IRA punishment, by sending off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. While, at London, an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 74, and Gerry Conlon find himself, prime suspect in the crime. Soon the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary arrest both, Gerry and Giuseppe. After being torture and threated, both agree to sign a confession to a crime, they didn't commit. After years of being mistreat in prison, Gerry finally grew up from bitter son who rails against his father's wishes, to fight for justice for himself, his father and those, whom were wrongly convicted when he discovers who the real perpetrator of the bombing are. With help with Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer, Gerry try to overturn the falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA's Guildford pub bombings. Will he triumph and gain his freedom or will he fail? Watch it, to find out. Even, so, the film is pretty predictable on the ending outcome, but that's not the main reason, not to watch this movie. You should watch it, to get a true understanding of the thought of being forced to live in a prison like that for seventeen years, accused of a crime, you had no part of. It made my stomach turn and I wept. In the climate of near-hysteria, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed, allowing the UK police to interrogate suspects for up to seven days without bringing charges or allowing access to an attorney. Americans like myself should watch it, because a similar Act was passed here, after Sept. 11, 2001. Both acts are not right, and need to review. If this movie doesn't raise your blood pressure over the miscarriage of justice, the arrogance of leadership and the need for each individual to judge according to their conscience and not their prejudices, nothing will. Another reason is because the film really work on being a gripping drama between the relationship of father and son. The movie took some liberties by showing the father/son relationship enhanced by sharing a cell in prison, which they never did in real life. I was immediately drawn into the story by Daniel Day-Lewis' as well, as Pete Postletwaite performances in both legal and personal perspectives. Both are great in this film giving the audience emotional depth. The language is a bit harsh in this movie, lot of cursing, but understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea. Some people might not like this movie due to its over impartially case that Britain misrules Northern Ireland, violates Irish civil rights and knowingly compromises its own legal system. I study a lot about the Troubles between England and Northern Ireland, but I really doubt every Englishman is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot. It might be a bit over exaggeration. Though some minor facts were changed, some the major 'facts' are just not real. Example like the crucial character of Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), an IRA man who might had something to do with the bombings is just a fictional character. Still, what remains as truth is gut wrenching when you think about it. Given the subject matter, the film was still well received in protestant areas of Ireland and in England. The film does shows that English public attitudes turned into a highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for these atrocities nor does the film make the IRA terrorists look like heroes. It is a bit frustrating that people take what the film tells them as fact, but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of people's political beliefs or the idea that the film might be a bit political bias. The film is a good movie that never really tip over into slushiness or being over preaching or ranting. The music soundtrack is amazing to hear. I love Bono and Gavin Friday 'In the Name of the Father'. Epic and beautiful. Another great song is 'You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart' performed by Sinead O' Connor. Quite inspiring. Overall, I thought this film was fascinating to watch. While the troubles are now over with 1998's Good Friday Agreement. I think the film is still very important to watch in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder if our government is or had jail innocent people. Hands down, a politically and emotionally charged issue such as that, is needed to be question. In the Name of the Father shows a good example of that.",8,0,0,18 March 2014
Face_Off," It's time for Cage and Travolta to face/off! Is this trading faces movie, any good? It's fun, but kinda cheesy. It's time to face your worst enemy!
","Magic Mirror on the wall, is this in your face action movie, the fairest one of all? Not really. Most of the time, I was laughing my face off due to the tongue-in-cheek action. Not to be confused with the series Face/Off, a makeup-F/X reality competition on the SyFy Channel. The movie, Face/Off is more like brain off, pay off film. Directed by John Woo, the silly premise movie tells the story of an FBI agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta) who goes undercover and assumes the identity of a ruthless terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) to foil a terrorist bomb threat. Soon, the plan backfires when the same criminal impersonates the cop with the same method, a face-transplant surgery. Now, it's up to Archer to prove that, he's the real Archer, and stop Castor from stealing his life. Without spoiling the movie too much, the film is full of director Woo's signature tiresome clichés like the overused of doves and over the top Gun Fu action sequences. It's nice to see Travolta and Cage each playing two different personalities, making both actors the protagonists and antagonists. In my opinion Nicolas Cage's acting is better than John Travolta's acting in this. Cage's gotten a lot of credit as a pretty good actor in a lot of good films in the past. But with the birth of the internet, people started to notice compilation videos of Cage's acting that showcased a certain craziness. Travolta's not so much. In this film, Cage goes total insane in certain scenes. The acting from these two was a bit over the top, but it's one of the charms of the film. The female characters are some of the worst written. Joan Allen as Archer's wife, Eve is just awful. She supposed to be a doctor, but she can't tell that Archer been replaced by somebody else. She's the wife, I would think she would know, every detail of her husband's body. She needed to do a blood test, just to prove that it isn't him. Honestly, how did Troy not notice that a needle's been stuck in him for a blood test? Does he not feel pain? Anyways, she discovers the truth, and waits forever to tell people about it, causing more death and mayhem. Not the best written character. There are bits in the movie that makes you scratch your head, puzzling, like how is Castor Troy, hard to find. He supposed to be the most secretive terrorist ever, yet he has a personal jet, nice suits and expensive rent-a-car. Another WTF moment is church choir scene at the LA Convention Center. Why are they there, and how did Castor Troy got away with groping with one of the choir girls, while wearing a priest outfit? So, he's OK about groping this choir girl, but help beat up Archer's daughter's boyfriend when he became a bit, too touchy toward Jamie (Dominique Swain). That doesn't make sense!? Also, didn't Troy earlier in the film, say and threatened to rape Jamie to her father's face. That was a bit odd. I have to criticize the fact that the film makes the villain more likable than the protagonist. It's weird that the villain makes a better father than the real hero who is never there. The protagonist seem a little bit creepier than Troy to his own family. He has the nerves to adopt a boy that mirror his dead kid without his wife, knowing. Then he has that awkward hand rub to the face. It's disturbing. No wonder, why Jamie is so mess up. The movie really goes crazy in its Sci-fiction premise, despite the settling of the film being 1997. The face surgery is bit out there in science fiction land. Don't ask how the surgery is reversed for the hero, toward the end, despite the Walsh institute being burned down. It's never explained. I like how the Walsh institute has no security just in case, Castor Troy wake up. I'm not even kidding: They leave Castor Troy with little to no security watching him throughout the majority of the first part of the film. Talking about security. That maximum, high tech secret oil rig prison that Archer-as-Castor Troy is sent to, is so surreal. Reusing props like the electric shock therapy and magnetic boots from 1993's Super Mario Bros the movie! Come on! The action is a hit than a miss. There were very entertaining. I like the Mexican stand-off at the church, it was pretty cool. I like the Mexican stand-off at the church, it was pretty cool. The Gun Fu action really did work. Still, there were some misses, I like how the stunt doubles, don't look anything like the real actors, during some of the action scenes or how a person that clearly got shot in the neck, is able to speak, very well. For a very silly movie, there were a lot of good scenes. The opening scene is a good example of this, where Troy tries to shoot Archer but kills Archer's son instead. To this film's credit, this is a pretty dramatic and emotional scene. John Travolta was able to show more emotional range. It's seem that the movie was trying to go with bigger themes like Christ references. Another is brotherhood, using Greek mythology names. Castor and Pollux were twin brothers of Helen of Troy that form the Gemini constellation, which is on the opposite side of the night sky from Sagittarius the Archer. The music score was mostly alright. I like the main theme. I dislike the use of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' playing over a gunfight. It was a bit jarring. Overall: I acknowledges that the corniness is what makes the film so fun. Only John Woo and these two unique actors, Cage & Travolta could pull something this whacky off. Great movie to watch. Good popcorn film to escape reality in.",7,5,8,24 January 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to have fun, watching this movie. I think I kinda enjoy this movie.
","The Mission: Impossible franchise really like the word, 'disavowed'. This time, it's the whole Impossible Mission Force after CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) convinces the US Senate that the IMF is a threat to public safety. Following the near-disaster from the end of the last movie, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has gone rogue in hope to show why the IMF is needed to stop an organization of assassins and criminals known only as The Syndicate. Can Hunt prove, the existence of the Syndicate or will the IMF be disbanded, forever? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I found the story to be, same old, same old predictable story. It built on the same foundation as the four preceding films, meaning there will be a lot of same repetitive somewhat wearisome tropes. The movie was really missing the great twist and turns of the previous films. While, this movie directed by Christopher McQuarrie feels like it was on cruise control. It's still really impossible to hate this fifth film in the Mission: Impossible series. There's a lots of thrilling action, funny humor, & death-defying stunts to get you through the film. It's has enough to get audience and professional critics seem to consider this the one of best film of the franchise to date, topping the already-acclaimed 2011's Ghost Protocol in glowing reception. In my opinion, as much as I like this film, I have to say, Ghost Protocol was more memorable for me in the wow-factor scale of intense action moments. Don't get me wrong, the movie has some really eye-catching stylized and heavy choreographed scenes. I love the huge airplane chase scene opening, but the action kinda dies down, after that. The whole swimming stunt is cool, and the car chases, but the movie, sadly ends very anti-climax. I wish, the movie had a better ending. It didn't have the same solid pacing as the last movie. While, the action didn't live up to my standards, I do have to say, the movie does more nail-biting emotional-driven powerful action scenes. The whole countdown to the bomb was pretty responsive. I found the performances in the film to be, very good. Despite, what's going on, in his personal life, I have to say; Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt seem very normal and well-like. I like the fact, that Tom Cruise does his own stunts. He was injured 6 times during the making of the movie. That shows how driven, he was, to his craft. Mad props, for him performing the highly dangerous sequence where Ethan Hunt climbs on the outside of a flying airplane without the use of special effects or a stunt double. Rebecca Ferguson as British agent Ilsa Faust was well-done. She is a strong, confident female character. I like that she bear a striking resemblance to fellow Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the point, that her character in this movie is a film reference to Bergman's character, Ilsa Lund from 1942's Casablanca. I like that the title character last name comes from the German legend Faust. It gives the impression that the main character is making an ill-fated deal with the devil. I also love the fact, whenever, Ilsa makes a scene, you can hear the music from Turandot, playing the background. It makes a classic spy feel to her character. I also love that Simon Pegg is given more to do, in this movie, besides his comedy shtick. Kudos to Simon Pegg's acting, the fact that Benji pretty much tears up as he angrily refuses to sell out Ethan to the CIA to avoid being branded a traitor, was wonderful to watch. One thing, that I didn't like, about his character was the odd product placement of him playing Halo 5 at his work desk. Come on, movie! You didn't need to do that! Anyways, the rest of the supporting actors were, just as good as the main actors. The Synicate figurehead, played by Sean Harris is the closest Rogue Nation comes to a traditional James Bond type villain. His delivery is cold and eerily. I like how his real motivations are left unelaborated. The only actor that I left wasn't given much to do was Jeremy Renner as William Brandt. It's kinda sad, that he spent, most of the film, arguing with Alec Baldwin's character, rather than doing some action scenes. It's weird that in one time, Jeremy Renner was the man that was supposed to replace Tom Cruise. Now, I feel like, he's just getting wasted. The movie also lacks the cool exotic locations of the previous films. I felt like the scenes in Austria and Morocco, were film, way too similar to the old locations of Prague and Abu Dhabi. Then, there is the fact, that some of the scenes in the film, were way too similar, to the other spy genre films, like the James Bond series. I do like the movie doesn't shine away, that the fact, they were mirroring it. The movie even hint of a James Bond/Mission Impossible, crossover, in the end, with the cameo of Aston Martin DB5. That will be very entertaining. Anyways, it was very wise for Paramount Pictures brought forward the release of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation to avoid competing with 2015's Spectre. I love how Rogue Nation is also a more love-letter to the 1960's TV series, compare to the other films, in which, they were based on. I love the fact, that they're still using the uber-popular 1990's version of the Mission: Impossible song as well. Overall: While, the film not as good as Ghost Protocol. I still have to say, it's a good popcorn movie. It's worth the watch.",7,4,8,6 August 2015
Dunkirk," No need to evacuate the theater, when watching this film. For the most part, Dunkirk was somewhat interesting and honest depiction of war. It was watchable
","Set during the Second World War, the film directed by Christopher Nolan portrays the Dunkirk evacuation, through three perspectives—the land, sea, and air. Each one of them, contain little dialogue, in order to create suspense solely through visuals by cinematographer, Hoyte Van Hoytema. For the most part, the film somewhat does a good job. However, maybe, the film could had spill a little more exposition, on the land part, as I really did get, who these fictional characters, were and why they were there. I felt that, the main three characters, Alex (Harry Styles) & Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) at the beach, were, a bit, disappointing. Yes, I know, that Nolan didn't want tell the backstory of these characters, only to focus on them, surviving, but it's hard to invest, the time, rooting for these guys to survive, if we know, barely anything, about them. Because of that, those sequences were really hard to watch, as the only thing, we see, as an audience member; is them, cowardly finding ways to escape by hiding, or lying to their superior. That's hardly heroic. Thank Goodness, for the sea and air sequences, because the land parts, was a bit, too cynical for my taste. At least, we got to know, a little more good things about those fictional characters on the boat, than the three nearly unlikeable soldiers, at the beaches. Plus, it was lot more suspenseful, rather than the repetitive cycle of the soldiers entering a ship, only for minutes, later, it to sink. The tension between the shell-shocked unnamed trooper, played by Cillian Murphy and Peter (Tom Glynn Carney) the son of the captain of the civil boat, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), whom sailing to rescue British soldiers from the surrounded city of Dunkirk on the boat was a lot better. It made for an interesting watch, with both actors, giving it, all. Don't get me wrong, the actors playing soldiers in the beaches, weren't bad; it's just that the boat characters at least, had more to work with. Also, despite, getting little information on who the two RAF pilots, Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden) were in the air sequence; I still found myself, rooting for them, even if the acting is limited, because of the intense dogfights. At least, they were fighting, instead of cowardly around. Those aerial shots, really did make it seem like two planes were really going at it. I just wish, the movie would use more visuals sights and sounds. I was really disappointing by the lack of large epic music by composer, Hans Zimmer in this film. Yes, I know, Nolan was really, trying to fight against, the system, not using cheap tactics like having emotional driven music and flashy or gory effects to get the audience to feel more, but I found, most of the film to be, somewhat dry and emotionless. Maybe, it's just me, use to the Hollywood formula, but I kinda like to be, move; not bored. Parts of the film was somewhat boring. It's just doesn't seem emotional. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were filmed, wonderfully on locations with the German Army & Air Forces, being mostly seen as an invisible tour de force of nature, and I love that Nolan and his crew didn't use, much or any CGI, in favor, for more practical, traditional special effects. I also, dig, how, Nolan use, three different styles of camera shots for each sequence, with crane & steady cam for the land, hand-held for the sea, and a mixed of both, for the air. However, there were a few others things, I didn't like, about this film. One is the non-linear narrative. It was somewhat jarring. Yes, I know that Nolan use this same tactic in better films like 2000's 'Memento' & 2010's 'Inception'. However, the gimmick with 'time', but really, come off, confusing, here, when watching it. A good example is, how it became night for the land sequence, and yet, in the sea parts, it was still day in some scenes. It wasn't until later, after, I got out of the theater, I figure out, that the film was covering different periods of time: one beginning on land and covering one week, one on the sea and covering one day, and one in the air covering one hour. Maybe, editor, Lee Smith, could had interwoven it, a lot better, or better yet, give texts on what the time and date, is. It was really hard to follow. The other thing, I dislike about this film is, the fact, that, all of the characters were made up. There was hardly any characters based on, actual real people that went through those events. 1958's 'Dunkirk' film, has more real-life characters, than this movie, does, and that's highly dramatization. I just wish, Nolan, when writing this, use more of historian Joshua Levine's 2011 book, 'Forgotten Voices of Dunkirk', which is a collection of firsthand accounts that are both humorous and tragic, a lot better. Overall: Christopher Nolan's first history movie is bold, visceral, and powerful, with many moving sequences -- though some of his filmmaking choices was a little too challenging to follow. While, most of these tactics didn't work for this film. I still, 'Dunkirk' was a good movie that still highly recommended. Just not the experience, I was hoping for.",8,4,9,26 July 2017
The Intouchables," This French film, about unlikely friendship, is amour with its viewers! It can't be touch!
","While the movie isn't that high in Avant-garde art, it's still hold Avoirdupois with its audience. Inspired by a 2004's documentary film entitled 'A la vie, a la mort', that tells the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou. The movie directed & written by Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano, tells the story of a young trouble Senegal man from the Paris projects named Driss (Omar Sy). While, he has no ambitions to get a job, he finds himself in a job interview. The reasons why is because for him to continue to receive welfare benefits, he has to apply to, at least, one job and get rejected. Instead of being rejected by the employer; wealthy quadriplegic, Philippe (François Cluzet), hires Driss as a caretaker. The reasons why, is because, Phillippe believes that Driss is the only person, that treat him like a normal person. That, and Phillippe feels that Driss just conning the welfare system that he helps pay for. While, Driss, at first uninterested in the job and his lack of professional experience shows, Driss does well, overtime, caring for Philippe, even if his methods are unconventional. Soon an unlikely friendships grows as both men, help each other with their trouble lives. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is both very charming and moving. It's a feel good movie. Maybe, a little too, feel good. The reasons why, I say this, is because the film, feels like its missing deeper drama that should have been tackle in the film. In my opinion, the movie doesn't really dig too deep into the complexity of their friendship. The socio-economic divisions that separate Philippe and Driss aren't substantively explored, enough. Yes, the movie show the different between both men, in the fields of art, music, and social activities, but it never goes any deeper. Call it, nitpicky, but I really wanted them to tackle, the issues of wealth, race and physical abilities, more. Another fault of the film is how predictable, it is. It's so predictable, that you knew that third act, break-up was going to happen. You know, that they were going to make up and find themselves, as friends, again. There isn't anything really new that makes this film stand out. I saw this premise, in other films before, like 2009's Blind Side, 2009's Soloist, and others. It's basically the French version of the 'White savior' & 'Magic Negro' narrative in one film. Despite, all those little complains, this movie is way higher than any of those films, I listed. This movie offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, race, or physical abilities. The movie is shot, very well. A good example of this was the interview sequence. When the camera pans over the men waiting for the job interview, it goes for their shoes. All highly polished, combined with ironed trousers and then it reaches a pair of worn out shoes, in which Driss is shown in establishing shot. With this simple trick audience knows how much he doesn't fit there. Very clever. The movie pacing is in good hands. I never really got bored, watching it. It doesn't go too long, or too short. The movie is fantastically acted. Both actors were great in their roles. As an American that knows little to no French; I found the French to be easy to listen to. The French dialogue is pretty clever. You don't need to know, much about the country, to get into the film. Also, the French doesn't sound rude, or uber romantic. It doesn't go, too fast that you can get lost. The subtitles are nearly in the same pace and really helps if you do. Despite, the language barrier, the movie is surprisingly a very funny film. I have to say, the whole cop chase, and the cutting of the beard, were the highlights of the film, because how laugh out funny, it was. The movie also have a great choice of music. I love the use of classical music, R&B, and others. It's nice to hear the band, Earth, Wind, and the Fire, again. It's no wonder why France selected the feel-good movie as its 2012 submission to the Academy Awards for best foreign language film, but I was deeply surprise, it didn't make the list. It's weird in a way, since the film was the most acclaimed movie of that year from Europe. The Weinstein Company, which distributed the film in the US was unhappy with the results. They note, the failure, came because, how unfamiliar the film was, to US audience and how people might mistake the film for being racist, due to the concept, of a poor black caretaker taking care of a rich white man. While, some American critics see a modern-day version of a black domestic and his white master, I see it as a movie about friendship. Like many French people, I don't find this movie offensive. I really hope, other Americans don't think so as well. While, the film has begun to receive more American attention with it having a prominent place on Netflix's Foreign Movies list. It's still clear, that more Americans need to see this film. If not, Weinstein Company might end up making an Americanized remake of this film. As of this writing, it's up in the air, if that remake is going to be good or not. I hope it is. If you like this movie, also check out, the memoirs, 'You Changed My Life' & 'A Second Wind'. Overall: This movie is a witty and sweet. It's must-watch. I do recommended. You will have a lot of fun, watching it.",9,4,7,24 March 2015
The Lego Movie," The building blocks, Lego movie fit in the right places. Like the song says, everything is awesome.
","Legos is probably the most successful toy line in the World. It has its own theme park, series of video games and now its own film. Directed by Phil Lord & Chris Miller, the Lego Movie is surprising pretty good creative, it builds well on its Lego concept. The movie is about Emmett Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an ordinary construction worker who doesn't really stand out from the crowd. He comes across, an out of this world relic call 'the Piece of Resistance'. He learns from the Wizard Vitruvious (Morgan Freeman) & a mysterious woman named Wild Style (Elizabeth Banks) that the Piece of Resistance is the only way, to stop the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchman, Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) from using a super weapon call the Kragle that can freeze the universe perfectly in place. Emmett join the Vitruvious's group 'The Master Builders', people that are capable of building anything they need, both with great speed and without instruction manuals as their prophecy chosen one call the 'Special', whom will bring balance to the all the worlds of Legos. It's really has this odd, Michael Crichton's Westworld, the Wachowski's Matrix series, and Michael Bay's Transformers series going on with it. I love how the characters jump into different worlds. The movie is pretty smart, using not only pop culture themes worlds, but also ancient stories like Cloud Cuckoo Land taken from the book 'The Birds' by Aristophanes, about an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The variety of some of this theme worlds are honestly real toy line set such as the Old West & Pirate World. They even mention Fabuland, Duplo, and Bionicle toy franchise. The computer animation is amazing. It has that glitch-prone characteristic of what a Lego movie might look like. While, it's not stop-motion, at all. It's really does look like a really good old fashion homemade Youtube Brickfilm movie. Even some of the running themes, remind me of earlier Brick films such as Lindsay Fleay's 1980's hit, 'the Magic Portal'. I give mad props to the filmmakers would decide to change the frame rate to 15 FPS for the smoothest motion, which give the movie, its style. Everything in the movie was designed to look as if built out of Lego pieces. This even includes effects like water, fire, laser bolts, explosions and smoke. Without spoiling too much, a lot of various Lego characters, either original or from licensed properties, make cameos or play bit parts. These include characters from, Star Wars, DC Universe, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, NBA, and many. The voice cast was excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer. The second had to be Will Arnell as Batman. He really got that down. The worst in my opinion had to be Will Ferrell. I had to say, he could had done better as the man upstairs. He could had shown more emotional in that hug. Other minor faults of the film is that the movie kinda go against Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Christiansen's policy of not war & violence wanting to make seem like child's play. It was nothing too violent for the kids. Some parents might find some scenes disturbing like a Lego figure getting beheaded or getting frozen. Still, it was made in a light hearted matter. The combination of both stop motion and CGI is a bit hard to follow during a few action scenes. There was way too much things on the screen, going so fast that it's hard to figure out, who or what is going on. It's harder if in 3D. The humor is full of one-liners, inside jokes, and subtle allusions that depending how much you know, would tell if it's funny or not. A lot of the humor kinda goes over the head of some of the smaller children, and certain people. The satire and parody elements stand out, often downright mocking other similar films. Unfortunately, this falls into a very common criticize of the film not being more original. The movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic if you think about it. It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. It has the same 'chosen one who would save the world' concept we've seen a few times before, but the way it's executed in the movie is very clever and the twist that occurs during the third act explain why the theme was so clichés. Even so, it's still formulaic as hell. The pacing is very brisk and moves the story along very nicely. The good things about the film is its unrepentant critique of social conformity themes. Much of the conflict revolves around organization art vs chaotic art. The movie's villains is George Orwell's 1984, trigger-happy cops, a corporate oligarch as president, rampant government surveillance and an oppressive system of compliance and mindless acceptance. The film's pop tune, 'Everything Is Awesome,' by Tegan & Sara is as catchy, but also frightening. Songs chosen by the government keep the masses pacified. The lyrics aren't just a generic call for teamwork and positive thinking, call for also conformity and consumerism, nothing short of a reminder of the fascist regimes of the 20th century like Hitler's Strength through Joy program or North Korea's K-Pop program. The happily and unquestioningly pays $37 for a cup of coffee as a good consumer should do. It's like paying for an over expensive movie ticket and popcorn. At less, the movie didn't take our beloved childhood memories of Legos, and use it a cheap, hollow cash-in or bloated, special effects. The Lego Movie reminds us that the power of imagination and teamwork can go together in the process of building and creation. Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are.",8,3,7,20 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Join the club and buy this movie. It's worth seeing!
","Dallas Buyer Club is a great American biographical drama film! Co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. Set in the 1980s, the movie tells the story of a real-life AIDS patient, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS. Fighting against the orders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ron must try to manage his 'Dallas Buyers Club' while facing the opposition from the government agency that originally sent out to protect him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while the movie is based on true events, it's also highly fictional. A good example of this, is the supporting characters of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Ron's transgender friend, Rayon (Jared Leto). Both were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. While, some critics might see these examples of artistic license as offensive, due those whom resent the reinterpretation of real event historical events; I saw it as a huge colleague improvement. After all, both Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto did very well in their roles. Jared Leto even won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his accurate depiction of a fictional transwoman with HIV who helps Woodroof. To portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body to look the part. Nevertheless, it wasn't as extreme, as Matthew McConaughey had to go, through, as Ron Woodroof. McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds, just to play the role in the film. The severity of the weight loss for these actors is getting way too dangerous. I can see McConaughey having problems, later in his life, because of this. Despite that, he was amazing in this movie. Kinda glad, he won Best Actor for this movie. However, while Woodroof was known for peculiar eccentric behavior, according to those who knew him; both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, with all the rampantly homophobic. Due to this, a lot of critics, believe that the portrayal of Woodroof in the beginning of the film, was very inaccurate and somewhat offensive, when many saw him, as a man that didn't harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. While, many of these real-life accounts are indeed mixed. Here is some truth about the guy. The real-life man did do hard drugs, and had a lot of sex, but also he was a family man, unlike the one, we saw in this film. I kinda do, hate the fact, that the movie cut this fact off from the story, because in my opinion, his ex-wives, family members and a daughter could help, push the character study, along, its character development. Despite all that, I do love, how the movie makes the main character transforms from a rotten person to a heroic one. Yes, he starts out as a homophobic, bigoted, promiscuous drug user, but he become very likable, over the course of the story, when he learns to take care of himself, eat healthy, and learns to appreciate and love others regardless of who they are. This is better than most tragic movies, are willing to give us. While, the movie's ending is bittersweet. I love the anti-corporate message demonstrated through drug companies' heartless action. It's true about what Woodroof says about the FDA. A good example of this, is the dangers of AZT when use to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. While, it's true that high doses of this drug is indeed toxic, it's also true, that AZT has worked for many patients at an appropriate dose. The use of AZT as a way to treat HIV/AIDS is still a highly target controversial, medical debate, even today. Just note that the drug does somewhat work, in small doses. Another good thing about this film is allowing the audience, in rethinking their apparent anti-gay sentiments. It indeed, changed a lot of opinions of straight people had on gay people. It also introduce mainstream audiences, to a realistic portrayal of transgender, outside of Comedy or Indies films. I love, how this movie was filmed. Lots of symbolism with the idea of riding the bull, sequences. Loves all the close up, and bait and switch camera movements as well. However, there were some historic inaccurate with some of the sets and props in this film. It's funny, noticing somethings in the background that clearly wasn't there in the 1980s. Overall: the diagnosis for this rodeo of movie has fine performances which are the highlights of Dallas Buyers Club, but you don't want to go believing too much of its history. The movie takes many shortcuts, compressing and compacting its story that it's hard to tell, which sequences are fiction and which are the truth. In the end, it's best for you to watch it, and judge yourself. I do recommended it.",8,6,8,21 February 2016
The Fast and the Furious," This movie is driving me crazy. It's an awful skid mark on film.
","The Fast and the Furious is just a movie with gas fumes of half-baked ideas for a popcorn flick. The movie is simple mindless full of hot chicks and fast cars. 'Petrolheads' probably did like it as it was the sleeper hit of 2001, and spawned many sequels. Still, the movie had mixed reviews, and in my opinion, they didn't go all the way in entertaining the kind of audience this movie was aimed towards. In the movie, there were few street races and not to mention the fact that the street racing element is just dressing for a bland, generic plot of thieves stealing commercial goods. If I went to go see a racing movie, and found myself watching a Point Break (1991) rip-off. I would be disappointed. The story goes like this, rather than having intense full-throttle action fun, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, the movie goes into another direction by having an undercover cop, Brian (Paul Walker) infiltrates an underworld subculture of Los Angeles street racers looking to bust them for stealing goods. He soon befriends the leader of the group, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and begins to question if he should turn him in, or let him free for one last ride. The movie is supposed to be fast and the furious, but it's not- it's slow pace like a grandma driving in the fast lace in the highway. The limit racing in this movie are over so quickly they're just boring as the movie puts countless amounts of filler scenes of talking that don't further the plot. There are unfinished sub plots. The movie spend all that time developing a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens? What the hell, movie! I know the movie was going to be for the low-brow, so I didn't expect a life lesson, I want to entertain. This movie was flat out lackluster. There's not enough action. The movie has a lot of flash, but the characters are dull and not interesting enough, with cars replace for personalities. That is, of course, with the exception of Toretto, who thanks to that scene about his dad and Diesel's performance, shines above the material. Still Diesel's acting is mediocre, at best. I presumed they were going to sell them off for upgrades to their cars and bikes, like Toretto was doing with his stolen goods. It's not made clear, though. It doesn't make much sense, either. The cars in the film are not that real to the real deal. Doing a wheelie while burning the the rubber on the rear tires of a 900hp Charger at the same time is simply not possible. First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie. I was dumbfounded when the Brian's Honda floorboard came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost and then his engine blew smoke. Next scene, after this, he picks up someone who was running from the cops with his car and drove away as if it's brand new. I didn't know Brian's puke green car came with a healing factor modified in his engine. What is with each of the 'underground street races' have so many spectators on long streets block off. Not once, you think the police would just look for a large street block off and arrested them. The women in this movie are just drop dead hot, but it's weird for them to be hanging out at underground racing. I don't see many women there, at less not as hot as Jordana Brewster. The movie is supposed to be about Import-car racing which is a spectacle started by Asian American auto enthusiasts. How does 'The Fast and the Furious' pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage? Make them the villains in the film. The movie has a lot of loud noises, and soundtrack full of the worst music artist at the time, Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule. The techno rock is a bit annoying. Like the 1955 film, The Fast and the Furious which is not based on, but took the title rights from, this movie is less for smart adults and more for kids who shell out money to pimp their car and add a 4' diameter exhaust to it, thinking it's cool. Don't get me wrong, I love cars, but you don't see me endangering other drivers by driving fast illegally on city urban street. I like driving fast in the country side where it's less dangerous for other drivers. I think the movie glorified the illegal street racing way too much that it's a bit unhealthy. I think the movie is a bit far fetch from reality where most illegal street racers end up getting killed due to crashes or other car racers car-jacking your car before you can race. So it's not worth it. People like seeing cars go vroom and potential cause untold amounts of property damage. That must be it. Still, there are better movies than this. Go see the chase scenes in Bullitt (1975), the French Connection (1979) or Ronin. (1998). Even modern movies like Drive (2011) are better than this movie. If you have to watch the movies, go rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't advice thinking too much into this, it's just mindless popcorn flick and also don't complain if you hate it, cause I did warn you about seeing it. It's still driving me up the wall.",5,4,9,15 May 2013
The Exorcist," Oh hell yeah! I finally got the Exorcist in my possession. This movie is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. What an excellent day for an exorcism.
","Without a doubt, 'the Exorcist' is one of most terrifying movie ever made. With a minimum of special effects, director William Friedkin and his small crew, including make-up artist, Dick Smith, art director, Bill Malley, cinematographer Owen Roizman and others, has made the existence of demons and the reality of possession into a realistic scary watch. It absolutely terrified theatre audiences when it came out, as some people went into convulsions, fainting or shock. It was even report, that a movie goer attacked the screen in an attempt to kill the demon and others got possession by it. Mass hysteria led to paramedics being called to some theatres, and others were picketed in protest but for me, even years after I saw this movie, I still have nightmares of the imagery, it use. It remains unparalleled in its ability to make the most confirmed atheist horrified by its depiction of primeval, mystic evil. It's really that compelling. Loosely based on a true-story of the possession of Roland Doe, and Assyrian and Babylonian mythology culture. The film and the best-selling novel of the same name by author William Peter Blatty in which it was adapted from, tells the story of Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), a young daughter of a movie actress, Christie MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) whom started to develop very odd symptoms of sickness and increasingly aggressive and violent behavior. After not finding a rational explanation of the cause of the illness, Chris seek the help of two priests, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) & Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) to explore the possibility of an exorcism. Without spoiling the movie, too much, several versions of the film was released with different cuts, due to its controversial content. Some of them, were edited to cut out some of the more obscenely scenes like the notorious crucifix-masturbation scene, the spider-crawling moment and the bleeding Virgin Mary statue shot, others not. Instead, they added to it, inserting new or delete unused footage. Despite that, this film is still notable for being one of the biggest 'R' rating box-office successes of all time even with all the leftover controversial content, like depictions of desecrations, graphic gory self-mutilation, and crude harsh language. To get the best version, seek the 2010's 'The Exorcist' (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) on Blu-ray version as it has everything to get through the film, including restored and remastered soundtrack, both with Mike Oldfield's unforgettable song 'Tubular Bells' and the three pieces from Lalo Schifrin's rejected score. Anyways, one thing, I didn't really like, how this movie is how much, Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to get realistic reactions. From what I heard, from the crew, he was a jerk to work with, often shooting guns and slapping his actors. He even went so far as to put Blair and Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently, causing injuries like breaking Burstyn's coccyx, which led to permanent injury to her spine. Not cool! Not cool at all! Suspense was also heightened by tales of a cursed film set, whichexperienced mysterious fires, hospitalized, and even death. Even with that, I think the film deserve ever Oscar nomination, it got that year including Best Picture. All of the acting in it was great. Burstyn was amazing as the mother of Regan, showing not only a sense of fear, but her wiliness to take some real physical bumps. She really deserve the Best Actress nomination. For Blair, while she wasn't the one who did the voice of the demon as that was Mercedes McCambridge; she did help deliver the best performance with her body language. Her transformation to the evil demon, Pazuzu is stunning. The things, the filmmaker put her body, through were rough. Plus, due to death threats against Blair from religious zealots who believed the film 'glorified Satan', Warner Bros. had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release. That proves, that she deserve her nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Nevertheless, I still glad to hear that McCambridge got credit for her role as the demonic voice after not getting it, for a very long time. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. The way, she alter her vocalization by bounding herself, chain smoking and swallowing raw eggs, is crazy! Furthermore, the actress gave up sobriety as she knew alcohol would distort her voice even more, and create the crazed state of mind of the character. The extremes which the actress put herself through to gain authenticity—still haunts the director to this day. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. Miller's performance in this film is a little bit more, questionable since Friedkin really had to go extremes to get a required startled reaction from him. I really didn't think, he stood out, that much to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. From what I heard, the actor seem hard to work with, as he felt too disgust, and depress, while filming this movie. It shows in the footages, they use. Don't get me wrong, Miller isn't bad actor, but he wasn't great. If anything, Sydow's character is more memorable. I'm surprised, he wasn't nominated. However, I really didn't think the movie need, all of those scenes in Africa with his character as it expose too much of the backstory. It really felt like time wasting. It really took the movie, forever to get to the possession with all the establishment shots in Georgetown. The movie has really bad pacing issues. Also, I didn't like how Reagan started to feel ill, after playing with an Ouija board. It felt too clichés even in the 1970s. Even with that, overall, it still hold the benchmark for being one of the best horror films ever. It's still a must-watch.",9,6,7,29 October 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-marks the spot again! X-Men: Days of Future Past was an xtremely good movie!
","From all the X-Men story lines that comic fans could see; they finally pick the one that most fans wanted to see. Directed by X-Men movie founder, Bryan Singer; the movie is based on the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline 'Days of Future Past' by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Most fans might remember the 1990's animated cartoon series, that feature this Sentinels storyline, but the movie really did improve of the concept. The only problem is that the movie is trying so hard to tie in all the X-Men film series with this storyline idea that left a lot of plot-holes, missing exposition, and huge changes to certain character's look and history. A lot of hardcore fans will probably rant about that from the unexplained Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) coming back from the death from the events of 2006's X-Men: Last Stand or how the Days of Future Past's 1973's doesn't match up with the 1973's settling of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I like to think that movie is trying to erase both the badly made movies events from history. With any time travel movie, there will be a lot of complex paradoxes. So let's just say this film is one of the many multiverse to save time. Since, it's also a comic book movie, you have to suspense your disbelief really hard to enjoy this movie. So, I wouldn't nitpick the movie so much, but I do have to say, the minor differs between the comic version and the movie version are not that big of a deal. I don't mind the artist license, they took, as much as some die-hard fan of the comics, because I really did find it, entertaining. As the film serve as sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. Much of the continuous story comes from those two movies, but you can see hints of all seven movies in this. This movie marks Hugh Jackman's seventh portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He will be the only actor to appear in the entire X-Men film series. That's insane, how big Wolverine has become. That's what the fans wanted. No wonder, why he took over Kitty Pryce (Ellen Page) place in the story. Without spoiling too much of it, if you haven't readt the comic. In the dystopian future of 2023, sentient robots known as Sentinels are exterminating both mutants and humans. The only way to stop them is for Kitty Pryce to send Wolverine back into time to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing their founder, Bolivar Trask, (Peter Dinklage) that lead to the upgrade the Sentinels needed to take down, the mutants. While, the movie makes Wolverine, the all-time hero, the movie gives as least, some more character arch to others such as young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique, giving them the room to grow. Great acting from all three. The cast for this film is really large, and I think for the most part, they gave enough screen-time for most of the minor characters. Still, I would had love to see Rogue (Anna Paquin) in a bigger role. Also, don't be surprise to find out, that some of the 2011's First Class characters introduce in that film, are now dead and few dead characters from the other movies returns. I think the addition of Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver was fun to watch. I really love his scenes. It's weird that he slated to appear in Disney's 2015: Avengers: Age of Ultron. The legal complexities over the license of the character just odd. Disney Marvel and Fox Studios had resolution to the previous legal issues, which had Quicksilver appear in this film as well as an Avengers sequel, though under certain parameters: no reference to Quicksilver's membership in the Avengers or X-Men can be mention in both films. It gets weirder when the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014 had a scene from this movie, making it look like Sony and Fox would team up, do a Spider-Man/ X-Men crossover. Once again, legal issues prevent that of ever happening. Peter Dinklage seem odd choice for Boliver Trask, due to his dwarfism, but I think its gives a way more self-loathing characteristic to Trask that wasn't there, before. Still, a lot of his scenes do feel weird. At less, pulling him in the film the assassination plot, makes more sense than Senator Kelly. Also makes sure, to check out after the credits for a certain cameo from another X-Men villain. I found the movie makes new Deus ex machine as it goes kinda annoying. One thing, I really did find offending is the outrageous story of the JFK assassination controversy. Not only, wasn't it explore in great detail, it felt like a throw away plot, just to have more action scenes of Magneto escaping the jail cell. Don't get me wrong, I love all the action scenes and found the Sentinels to be a great threat. I just wish the Sentinels were little bigger. I do have to say, the CGI for the most part was great, but the CGI for the 1973's Sentinels were pretty bad. Watch the train scene to understand, what I'm talking about. The soundtrack was epic. The movie was pretty dark for a PG-13 film. It was pretty gruesome at times. Lots of dead bodies, and limps being rip apart. This movie might not be for all children. There is a few surprising nude scenes that the ladies would like. Don't worry, men. Mystique is still look pretty naked in this film. Better than her look in First Class. The language is bit harsh. The humor was funny as hell. Lots of inside jokes, and winks to the comic book fans. Lots of symbolism metaphor messages ranging from civil rights to gay rights that people can debate on. Overall: In my opinion, the best X-Men in the film series so far.",8,7,10,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War is marvelous, indeed.
","Earth's Mightiest Heroes has return to duke it out with Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) or Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a battle for vigilance & superiority under the increasing political issue of government oversight. Directed by the Russo Brothers, Civil War marks the 13th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the first film of the MCU's Phase 3. It is based on the Civil War limited series, albeit on a much smaller scale. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the Civil War conflict in the comic book was a lot more intense, than it was, in the film. After all, it dealt with unmasking, secret identities, and high death tolls. However, since secret identities don't really existed in the film series, the conflict was change, significant with Rogers trying to protect his buddy, Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) from standing trial in a federal court. While, this marks a major point of divergence from the original comics, the film still somewhat deals with the conflict between freedom and security; and the fact that these super-powered individuals have to act under official regulation, somewhat akin to law enforcement with this plot device. In my opinion, I felt like the issues with the Sokovia Accords could have easily be solve, if simple-minded, Rogers, would just agree to it, and then, ask for a fair trial for his buddy. Yes, I get that Rogers might be, against government oversight, because of the events of 2014's 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' and Stark is for more security after the killing spree in 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'; but there was no reason, for these two, to really hate and disagree with each other. After all, both of those events from the previous films, effect both of the character in similar equally ways. If any, they should agree with each other. The rift formed between the Avengers due to their differing opinions on the Sokovia Accords stays civil only until Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) made it personal for both sides' leaders: By implicating Bucky in two international incidents, he tested Cap's loyalty to the team while forcing Tony to act on the Accords. He's by far, the best Marvel villain, these films had in a long time. Zemo actually manages to drive the Avengers apart, which is something his comic counterpart never achieved. He wasn't cartoony. He was a very compelling character. Brühl is wonderful in the role, despite his character actual scheme relies on a few too many coincidences, destroying the Winter Soldiers plot and also the fact that a video existed, when there is no way, it should or Tony not knowing about it. He did better, than the other villain, Crossbones/Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Crossbones was a little disappointing with his short appearance, since he had a major part in the comic. Another big change, from the comic book to the film, was Captain America's fate. While, many people might disagree with me, but I found the fact that he doesn't die; somewhat of a blessing in disguise, because I never like that comic book arch. Although, he lives in this version, at least, the movie does give depth, with other emotional deaths, and one shocking big twist ending, toward the film. It gave this movie, some real-world value, without going too grim or violent, like 2015's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Though this movie is significantly less dark than that DC Comic's mess of a movie, it does warrant caution for children, especially under the age of 13. Despite that, this movie is still pure escapism. Everybody in the film did their job, and it was well-acted. While, the humor is bit unbalance. There's still some laughs. The action scenes were amazing. However, it was a bit jarring to some of the reasons, why the other supporting characters were there. A good example is why Ant-Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was even in the film? Why would he risk, going back to prison and being away from his daughter? At least, Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner)'s reason for returning is pretty clear, because the fact that Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)'s brother save him, in the previous film. Another is Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Since, he wasn't unmasking, there was really no reason for him to be there, besides fan-service & cross-company partnership. As much as I love the character, I kinda sick of him, being rebooted, time and time ago. While, it's cool that characters who had only minor roles in the original comic book event like Black Panther/T'Calla (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) & Vision (Paul Bettany) have bigger roles and some time spent on them in this film, but nevertheless, it takes away scenes for characters like Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) to rise. While, she did receives a slightly larger role since the last movie, Sharon is still very underdeveloped as a character, considering her level of prominence in Cap's supporting cast in the comics. Anyways, with so many characters jam packed into one movie, it hard to keep track of all of them. The overall story of this film often relay on continuities from the previous films. It's doesn't stand on its own. After all, it's seem for any general or new viewer to these films, you would have to see, a good deal of the previous films, before even attempting to see this film. Not only that, but you might have to read the original Civil War comic book by writer Mark Millar to further get insight on what is happening, as well, as other graphic novels. It's a lot of homework. Also, this movie has pacing problems. Clocking in at 146 minutes. It's a long sit. However, once you aboard or caught up; you better, buckle in, because it will be, one hell of a ride! Worth the watch!",9,7,15,16 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," This spin-off prequel of the Harry Potter film series was indeed fantastic.
","In 2001, British author J. K. Rowling (under the pen name of the fictitious author Newt Scamander) wrote 'Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them' and its companion, 'Quidditch Through the Ages', in order to raised millions of dollars for children's charities around the world. The books became so popular, that it was made into a film by Warner Bros in 2016, in order to replace the lost of the Harry Potter film franchise that just wrap up, a few years, earlier with 2011's 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'. The first of many future stand-alone films in the 'Wizardly World' universe, the film directed by David Yates was quite enjoyable! Not only did it recapture the magic, but it expanded it. Everything about this movie was a breath of fresh air. It did opened up a lot of unique things to new audiences. The new characters were amazing. I like the story of a soft-spoken, awkward magi-zoologist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he attempts to return all of the escaped magical creatures to the zoo inside his briefcase, before it spell trouble from both the wizardly world & the no-maj (non-magic world) of New York City. However, there were a few flaws with the script that J.K Rowling also wrote. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I didn't like, how the movie had two disparate plot lines that really don't match, together. While, I like the idea of escape creatures running amok on the urban centers of the city, I really couldn't get, truly behind the other much darker, plot line about American wizard cops looking for a dark spirits that is hidden within a no-maj children. Don't get me wrong, both Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller does great acting to bring that story to life, but it wasn't what the film was supposedly built upon. After all, it doesn't make much sense that Newt would be trying to capture an Obscurus. It was a bit distracting, to see the movie switch tones, from the light-hearted relationship between Newt and his new muggle friend, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) trying to capture animals to borderline horror, with the abusive context of an evil over-religionist foster mother and her quest to kill magic. It felt like, two different movies, being clunk together. It was very uneasy. Despite that, the pacing did work for the most part. There were hardly any slow moments in the film that I can say was dull. The action scenes with the creature features were fun to see, however the ending fight with the Obscurus felt a bit forced, and the property damage magically fixed, and the minds of the No-Maj being erased, over-convenient. Despite that, the CGI visuals works well, both in 3D and 2D. However, I would love to see more practical effects in the future. The elves look a little bit off, compare to the other films. Another thing, I didn't think the film really took advance of the American side of the Wizardly World that much, besides showing the tiresome politics of 1926. It doesn't really embrace the rich history of folklore that America, has. So, where is the mention of the Native Americans of the Wampanoag and the Narragansett tribes that they talk about it? Where is the Wampus cat?! Where is the Horned Serpent!? Where is anything? Most of all, where is the American version of Hogwarts of Ilvermorny that the marketing for this movie, made die-hard fans, to look forward, for!? Well, sadly, we don't really get to see that, either, besides a small mention by one of the supporting character, that one does existed. That's really disappointing. I get that, the fictional make-up book is first mention in small discussion between the main characters in 1997 novel 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', but come on! I really don't like the mention of names like Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), and Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) being here, nor the last minute appearance of Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) who looks so out of place. Are we supposed to believe that he secretly act like a high-ranking Auror and Director of Magical Security for years, while in hiding!? Did we really need all those references to Hogwarts!? Also, while, I like the theme song from James Newton Howard. Did we really need that 10 second 'Harry Potter' jiggle!? Come on, let this movie, be its own thing, separate from the Harry Potter films. If anything, all these call backs and fan service only add to confusement of the main backstory of the 'Harry Potter' time-line. It also ruin any huge mysterious twist and turns in the future movies, since the history of what happen is already mention in the canon 'Harry Potter' backstory. Despite that, I can only, hope new characters like Jacob Kowalski, disgraced, former wizard cop Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) & bright attitude, sugary voice mind-reader, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) return to the second movie. They were some of the highlights of this film. Overall: While, I'm not a huge fan of the 'Harry Potter' film franchise. I just happy that this movie is more than a fictitious documentary about magical animals. It was an entertaining film. Highly recommended watching.",8,4,8,26 November 2016
Pearl Harbor," It was a Day of Infamy when this movie came out. This made up movie is an insult to those who died on Dec. 7th 1941. Still, it's not the worst movie.
","Pearl Harbor is a pretty awful movie looking back at it, but it was a successful box buster movie. It was kinda insulting to the veterans and those who live around the tragedy event. Directed by Michael Bay, and written by Randall Wallace. It feature a story straight out of badly written soap opera romantic novel. In my opinion, it's seem like a badly written remake or reimagining of 1953's From Here to Eternity. I would love for the film to focus more on the realistic story of those soldiers who died trying to protect our country that day, than those make believe characters with an unrealistic over the top love story that has nothing to do with the real events. I know Michael Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing of mixing tragedy with romance aimed for the young adult PG-13 audience, but with the success of 1997's Titanic. Michael Bay pretty much sold out, and went with the studio ideas. Still, there is a Rated R version DVD out there, if you want to see that. The story goes like this, two fighter pilots, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are both under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). Rafe happens to have an Army Nurse girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who he loved, but based on what we see on screen, seem to rather spent time away from her and mistreat her. Rafe go off to fight in RAF outfit for American pilots to fight during the Battle of Britain and presumed killed in action. Meanwhile, Danny, Evelyn and the rest of their fellow pilots and nurses are transferred to Pearl Harbor, as Danny and Evelyn move on. Both fall in love with each other, until Rafe return making it a love triangle. The love triangle is god awful trite and how they solved the rush love story wasn't the greatest ending at all. It had cop out end to the film. It wasn't until ¾ in the film, that 'Pearl Harbor' the movie really became about the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Japanese Empire. I do have to say, the Pearl Harbor attack scenes were very well done, action pack while giving the emotional trauma of that day. Still, there were some historic inaccuracy and major factual misrepresentation of the facts in such things like the Doolittle Raids and how Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr) should be portrayed. Like many historical dramas, Pearl Harbor provoked debate about the artistic license taken by its producers and director. The biggest is the use of fictional replacements for real people. One of the biggest faults is replacing the real pilots, George Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor with the two leads played by Affleck and Hartnett who took to the skies during the Japanese attack and, together, claimed six Japanese aircraft. The pilots could be more realistic in tone, if the film didn't take great liberties on making them look a silly caricature of what romantic movies think military pilots should look like. Not only do they endanger their airplanes, and themselves playing a game of chicken, but they are allow to take citizen on war planes to see sunsets over the harbor and afterwards have sex in the parachute hangar. Plus, they are dyslexic and one is squinty all the time. Excuse me, if I did that. I would be in jail and no way, a pilot! I do have to say, the portrayal of the Japanese were pretty well done. I see no faults in that. All the supporting actors were very good. Mako Iwamatsu and Dan Aykroyd were interesting. I have to say, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the closest thing to FDR coming back alive. Another thing good about the movie was the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and the song by Faith Hill, 'There You'll be'. In my opinion, there is no way to have a throwback World War II movie like the pre-Saving Private Ryan old days. Yes, the movie is full of war movie clichés, some good, some stale. America patriotism was written all over the film, like we single-handed won the war by ourselves. I didn't mind it, yes it somewhat true. I don't have that much of a quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events like other WWII drama like 1996's English Patient or From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941. Still, it's not a good idea. Overall: It wasn't the worst war movie ever. There are better movies set during the Pearl Harbor attack that better serve the public. Go watch a few documentaries, if not watch 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora! As it turns out, this disaster flick is both bomb and was the da bomb in the box office.",6,0,0,10 December 2013
Duck You Sucker," For the most part, it was a dynamite film! Yet, there were a few duds in it as well.
","Made after the success of the 'The Dollars trilogy', (1964's A Fistful of Dollars, 1965's For a Few Dollars More and 1966'sThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and a few years after one- off success of 1968's 'Once Upon a Time in the West', 'Duck! You Sucker!' was director Sergio Leone's last Spaghetti western. It was, as well, one of his most overlooked films. I think, one of the reasons why this movie didn't really shine and became an overnight success, was because, of the odd title. Known as 'Giu La Testa'(Keep your head down') in Italy, the title didn't really translate well with the American audience. For me, 'Duck! You Sucker!' sounds more like a Blaxploitation movie, than a Spaghetti Western. It's sound too cartoony. Because of that, I really didn't like the title. I'm one of those critics; that agrees with the studio. They should had retitling the film. They should had changed it to 'A Fistful of Dynamite'. That title works so much better, because how much this story, remind us, of Leone's older films, while, also giving us, something new. Better yet, I would rather see the movie be call, by its French title, 'Once Upon a Time in a Revolution', because it match so well with Sergio Leone's other 'Once Upon a Time' films. Though, all of those 'Once' films, widely differ in location, character and time periods, the recurrent themes of time and memory, plays a big part of these films. Not only that, Leone's style alters sharply here. It's here, where you see his bitter metamorphosis from Spaghetti Western to gritty post-modern Polizieschi crime drama. In scope, Sergio knew, times were indeed changing. Audience weren't as interested in Westerns, anymore. Sergio was able to show, with this Zapata film, in a metaphor way. He shows that the 19th century, primitive frontier life was indeed dying, to make way, for the 20th century, complex, and post-industrial revolution life. The way, he use weapons like dynamite, trains, machine guns, and tanks as a metaphor to bring the end of western is haunting. It's scary, when you think, deep around it. After all, a lot of his dark imagery here, remind us, way too much of massive World Wars imagery that later would come alive. Still, it wasn't that dark, there were a lot of cool, bloodless action moments, extreme close-ups, semi smart dialogue, great epic scope in cinematography, and funny moments to make it, a more rounded picture. Also, the moody soundtrack by composter Ennio Morricone was beautiful and simply wonderful to listen to. It match the film, so well. Set during the Mexico Revolution of the 1910s, the film tells the story of Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), an amoral Mexican outlaw, and John Mallory (James Coburn), an ex-Irish Republican revolutionary, trying to rob a bank, only to find themselves, accidentally and involuntarily becoming heroes of the Revolution. I love the allegory that Leone is using with these two main protagonists. Miranda is the old, Mexican bandit unaware that his era is almost over. And then we have Mallory as the 20th Century bandit, unaware where his love for technology is going to take him. While, it's might be hard to cheer, for two main characters who are technically murderers, rapist, and terrorists. At least, the movie gives them, enough positive depth and character development to overlook their dark side and faults. However, it's hard to understand what motivates them to do what, they do, since both Mallory and Miranda hates revolutions. Despite that, both actors in this movie were amazing in their roles. James Coburn is able to show how haunted, his character was, with his past, while also dreaming of living the American Dream. I love the scene where he was in the pub, looking at the mirror at his betrayer. Very moving. Then you got Rod Steiger, who pretty much seem like a real-life Mexican bandit. Despite the fact that he is playing off, a carbon copy of the Tuco's buffoon type character from 1966's 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. He was still able to pull this off with his strict method acting. After all, the character was originally written for actor, Eli Wallach, instead of him. Lucky for him, Eli Wallach drop out, during the early stages of production. That wasn't the only time, he got lucky. The studio save him, a second time, when Leone wanted to replace him, with Wallach, after they butt-heads over Steiger demands on Leone to film his scenes with natural sound. Once again, Steiger won out, and Wallach was cause to subsequently sued, when Wallach had to dropped out of the other project when Leone promise him, the role. While, Steiger and Leone didn't get along, I thought, personally, that he had great screen chemistry with his co-star, James Coburn. Both, seem to work best with each other. However, other than them. Most of the supporting characters were very bland and underdeveloped. Another conflict, I had with the movie is the pacing. Like, any other of Sergio Leone's movies, this movie also suffers from a long seat. It was slow and tedious, at parts. 157 is a lot of minutes sit through. I know, not all U.S versions of this movie has that long of a run-time, but most modern DVDs has this same copy, in which I watch this film. All, I know, about the other copies, is that it's 22 minutes, shorter with awkward editing. The ending is also disappointing. Without spoiling it, it's bittersweet, at best, but also a bit anti-climax. Overall: I wouldn't call this my favorite Leone film, but it's still worth checking out. There's just something very appealing about it. Check it out, if you want. Just note, it does have problems.",7,4,9,11 February 2016
No Strings Attached," I couldn't get attached with this movie. Too dumb and predictable.
","No chemistry at all. There is a hardly any chemistry between the two main characters in this Ivan Reitman's film. Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher). These two actors can act, but this movie should have had two different leading actors who could be more vivid in their acting, like Justin and Mila in 'Friends with Benefits' (2011) At least their faces were animated, they had chemistry, and they made the sex scenes very funny and easily watchable. I'm not saying that movie was great, but it's better than this movie. All we get is a bawdy comedy with a slow moving story in here. This movie just makes me depressed about how people view sex and relationships. So casual. So selfish. And we wonder why our culture is riddled with divorce and so many of us suffer from feelings of isolation and low self-worth. After first meeting at a summer camp as teenagers, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) run into each other a few times when they're young adults but never manage to keep in touch, until Adam find out that his girlfriend was cheating on him with his dad (Kevin Kline). When Adam finds out he gets drunk and starts calling the women in his cell phone directory seeking a hookup with Emma. Emma proposal for a causal relationship or friends with benefits. He warns Emma that she'll fall in love with him, but she dismisses that idea and sets some ground rules to keep what they're doing from becoming too serious. I'm sure that you can guess how the main plot ends. They fall in love, they deny their love, they separate and they get back together. Nothing new added to already predictable rom-com genre besides the role reversal. Girl interested in sex but not commitment. Boy gets attached. Girl breaks up with boy then realizes error of her ways. Boy willingly takes her back. The important criticism is that the storyline is a quilt of ideas are recycled from other rom-com flicks with the use of clichés such as detachment and insecure. If you're in the mood for some boring, obnoxious, pretentious, shallow and tacky people and their petty problems, this is a movie made just for you. I found myself wondering why it was important that these small people, with their small thoughts and small problems should concern anyone. I don't find their love affair interesting nor did watching them help me with my own relationship. This movie is largely revolting for anyone who has any sensibilities about love, sex, and romance. The evident here is that it's not going to be possible to have a purely sexual relationship without any attached feelings, and we go into the story hoping for that redemptive lesson to come through. It finally does, but not until a lot of crude and lewd and nasty dialogue and visuals have taken place. People simply do not behave the way these pretty people all behave. Basically, the premise here is that people jump in and out bed without much, or any, thought and that the jumping is the subject of endless vulgar discussion over cocktails or dinner. Put another way, this film is vulgar nonsense. Nothing wrong with that if it is also entertaining, but really, this film is a clean miss. And when the lesson is learned at the end, it's half-hearted. These two don't belong with each other. The story line is nearly implausible, even for a rom-com. Transition between scenes is poor. Slow and boring. The best scenes are the doughnuts and period CD. The jokes are hit and miss. Off color and gay activity jokes was uncalled for and tasteless. Then there is the sex. The film had little nudity for sex comedy. I guess the R rating was due to the drug references because there sure wasn't any sexual chemistry between the stars. I don't mind it. Natalie Portman is still sexy to me, but if you want something better as far as a sex scene with a much better story then check out 2010 Black Swan. It doesn't have much nudity as well, but the sexuality tension is clearly noticeable in that, unlike here. I think it's because the film use the usual same camera angled sex scenes seen in every similar sex comedy movie. Ashton is pretty much Ashton in the film and doesn't give anything new to the role. Kevin Klein is just an unfunny old bag that indulges in depravity. How not funny. Old people being disgusting is awful. My second celebrity crush in this movie had to be Olivia Thirlby. Overall, it was the same when every other romantic comedy. Predictable dumb. This movie will be in the 1 dollar bin at Wal-Mart sooner than later.",5,0,0,21 April 2013
Inside Out," This was mind blowing! This movie was a feel good movie.
","Don't be close-minded. Open your mind to new things, like this movie. It's worth-checking out. Directed by Peter Docter, the movie tells the story of a group of emotions in a little girl's head, trying to deal with a tough, life-changing event. While, the emotions; Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), and Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling), want to make the best, out of it; things start to unravel for Riley Anderson (Voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), as her emotions find, that growing up is more difficult, than it seems. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that this movie is more than a feeling. It's well-crafted animation. Still, there are things in the film that I can nitpick about. While, this isn't really a bad thing, I believe the movie might be a little too sophistication for certain younger audiences. I like how the movie is challenging kids to understand, their own brains, but the movie kinda leaves, some kids confused. Maybe, it need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are so much references to Trait theory, abstract thought, Cognitive neuroscience, and the subconscious that kids haven't yet, understood. The humor kinda blends, the same way. You have to be very observed to get some of the jokes here. Jokes like how opinions and facts often get mixed up on the train of thought, might fly pass you, if you're not paying attention. It's very smart, clever, and sublime. Not only is the movie full of mindful jokes, but the movie is the brim with throwbacks to Pixar's previous films, some of them obvious, some of them so hidden in the background that a deeper perceived might be needed. I like all the oddball sequences that the film had to offer. Places like Dream Production, Imaginationland, and Subconscious were pretty cool to see. The world in which, the character live in, is so unique. What a beautiful mind. I love it! I love, every character in this film. The voice acting is amazing. Each one of them, gave a lot of depth to their character. The story is very heart-felt. There are a lot of tear-jerking moments. So, make sure, to bring some tissues! 'Take her to the moon for me, okay?'- I was really crying when that moment came. While, the movie is PG, there are a few scary moments that might be a little too scary for small children. Watch out for Mr. Jangles! I love, how the movie deals with a lot of complex things, such as intertwined relationship in parenthood, camaraderie and friendship. Other things that the movie dealt with, is the heartbreaking realization, that the transience of time will inevitable, lead to more complicated feelings, that parents need to be aware, of. One of the most potent about the movie is learning to accept the undeniable encroachment of Sadness into your life. While, it's good to keep a relentless optimism mind. It's not a bad thing, to feel sad or depress when you need it. Empathy is very important and poignant emotion to have. That's heavy! Neuroscientists were consulted to help make the film's settling of an eleven year girl's brain, very believable and I believe, it's very close to how a young mind, might work. Director Peter Docter got the idea for the project, from his daughter. He always wonder, what was going through her mind. So, he created this movie, using it as an allusion/representation of him as a father watching his own daughter go through emotions like those; that Riley had to deal with. While, a lot of critics, are saying, this movie is very original. I have to say, not really. After all, Peter Docter pretty much copy the concept from his previous work on Cranium Command, the Walt Disney Epcot attraction about the human body and watching earlier Disney short films, like 1943's Reason and Emotion. While the movie isn't that original. The movie moves in a very logically pace. Still, there were a lot of head-scratching moments that made me wonder: What were, they thinking? One of them, is how Sadness and Joy couldn't find their way, back to the Headquarters. There were many good examples of ways, Sadness and Joy could make their trip to HQ, a lot easier, such as using Bing Bong's wagon or recall. Both were establish, way early on in the film, but barely use, until late into the film. Honestly, it would have work, better than the odd Deus Ex Machina trampoline that they found. Another thing that people asking questions is how other people in the film usually have all of their emotions match their gender, but not Riley's. There is a possible explanation to this. While, Riley is a girl with a unisex name. She's a tom-boy, so it wouldn't be, too surprising that she would have two male emotions. I really doubt, she is a transgender, but who knows. I think her mind is bit young, so she still possibly figuring her emotions and identify out. With time, maybe, she also will have emotions adequate to her own basic template. Another thing is while, there is a huge variety of emotions, I think the emotions, they picked, work the best. While the movie is full of familiar Pixar tropes and clichés. I'm glad, that Pixer is back, where they belong. It's was very worrisome, for a while. I really didn't like those lackluster, strategic sequels that they kinda put out, a few years ago. Overall: I really love this movie. I haven't met one person that hate this film, yet. You really have to out of mind, if you hate it, because the movie delivers in every way! So don't live with Anhedonia! Go see this movie! It's worth watching! It's mind-treat!",9,31,67,23 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame! I love you 3000! This movie is worth watching! I can do this all day!
","Walt Disney Pictures most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. Without spoiling the movie too much, this Marvel Studios film directed by the Russo Brothers was nearly a cinematic masterpiece. However, there were a few things that that drop it a level or two from being 10 out of a 10. The main one is the overuse of story convenience & plot armor. There is way too many Deux Ex Machina moments in the redemption journey of the Avengers team figuring out, how to undo the effects of Thanos' (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) actions from the last movie 2018 'Infinity War' that really took me out of the story. One of them is the whole rescue of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in outer space. It was not needed as most of the media trailers already spoil that Stark was able to make it back to Earth. Not only that, but it was a bit jarring & little too hard to believe that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) was able to find a small ship in the vast cosmos. That scene didn't really belong in the movie. The film could have used that time to explore the depths of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) depression and trauma. It was a bit much to see the God of Thunder reduce into an over the top comedy relief character. The writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should have treat his extreme lost in a nuanced and meaningful way. They could had cut back a little bit on the laughs involving him. As for the other sequences of the Avengers dealing with their post snap despair. It was fine for the most part, even if it's a bit slow. I just wish the world that they live in, should had been more chaotic & apocalyptic dystopia. Nevertheless, clocking in at three hours and one minute runtime, this twenty-second film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was already a very long watch. It really needed better pacing. It had too many 1989 'Back to the Future Part 2' time travel type scenarios & recycled footage callbacks. Some of them, are not that interesting, such as the Asgard trip. Those scenes could had been more compelling, if the setting were changed to them going to the Collector's hideout in Knowhere during the events of 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. Plus, the story would had been more compact as the Power & Reality Stones were at the same place. Nevertheless, others time travel moments like the one in the 1970s were not really needed, when you think about it. Don't get me wrong, it was a very emotional moment for Tony Stark to meet his dad, but, much of that time, could had been used to establish tears for other characters, such as the tragic love story between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Natasha kinda got the short straw here. After all, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Widow's skills in stealth and deception would have been better suited with any other mission. The superhuman demigods should had explore Vormir. Nevertheless, the time travelling sequences were highly entertaining. I just wish they focus a little more on establishing the David Deutsch rules how it honestly works, because where it stands. It's highly complicated & confusing. There is a lot of inconsistencies & contradictions that really stands out. Most of them, involves past versions of characters coming to the prime timeline future, & Captain America (Chris Evans) actions toward the end. Even Ant Man (Paul Rudd) being able to use endless amount of Pym particles is somewhat not coherent. I hate that the writers brush those unanswered plot holes off, because I really curious, on how Steve Rogers honestly return those stones back in their time periods without screwing up time even worst or getting caught. Those unseen moments could had been really interesting action scenes. Regardless, the ones we do witness, were fine, even if they were CGI heavy. There is just a few nitpicks. The Sanctuary II ship opens fire point-blank with all its cannons on the Avengers base until it's nothing but a smoldering crater but it doesn't even manage to injure, never mind kill, any of the people inside is really hard to believe. Those who do die, are somewhat predictable. Also, Carol Danvers's big rescue in the end, really does make the character, nothing more than a dull shrew, walking Deux ex Machina. To make it worst, there was a very phony put in political progressive movement message in Endgame's climax that pays tribute to the women of Marvel that really doesn't fit. It seem awkwardly push as fan service rather than fitting within the logistic of that scene. While, the movie does jump around, a lot; nearly every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on fine heroic. The goods outweigh the bad. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. Nearly every performer, including the cameos in this movie did a great job. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of hilarious moments for a surprisingly dark film. The music score by composer Alan Silvestri is beautiful to listen to. In the end, it will be very interesting to see what dangers, a universe without the infinity stones will bring. Hopefully the new crop of heroes can indeed stop them. Can't wait for Phrase 4. Until then, this entry in the MCU is worth repeat viewings. It's highly recommended. This movie entertain us with enough to overlook all the flaws. It's really is, a must watch. It's marvelous.",9,7,15,9 May 2019
Independence Day," Watching Independence Day is like watching fireworks. Beautiful to watch and ready to explode.
","Nothing says, American 4th of July holiday than a H.G Wells, 'War of the Worlds' remake from Disaster King German Director Roland Emmerich call Independence Day. Honestly, this movie has nothing to do with American Revolution or the founding of the country. This movie has much to do with Independence Day, as killer giant Ewoks have to do with Grito de Dolores, (Mexico's Independence Day) which is little to none. I can see the rationale for why some people think Independence Day is the coolest Alien Invasion movie ever, and why some people think it's massively stupid. It's both, it's kinda dumb, but also lots of fun to watch. This movie isn't worth taking too serious, over. The movie is meant to be enjoy. And yeah, it's a War of the Worlds adaptation and probably one of the better modern update of that book because it's fun and works in the book's way of defeating the aliens in a modern way that's not too absurd. For a movie that channeling 'War of the Worlds', it does show other countries and other places trying to fight against the aliens, than the original movies. I do like that. It really does seem like a War of the Worlds. There isn't much to the plot besides the fact that Aliens attacking bit cities and people trying to fight them off. The narrative mostly focuses on a desperate group of people who are some of most stereotypical clichés characters ever, but also the most interesting and awesome, people I would like to be with, if Aliens ever do attack. In my opinion, I think the actors are mostly playing themselves in this film. There is Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) who flies in jet fighter planes and on his free time, punches aliens in the face while giving out some of the best bad ass lines. Not only is he the ultimate cool hero type, but Will Smith gives one charming performance. This movie, pretty much made Will Smith's movie career. He just move from one big explosion addict blockbuster Director (Michael Bay) to another big explosion addict blockbuster Director Roland Emmerich. The second best character in the film is David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is pretty damn cool how smart he is in solving problems. Then you got President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), the Harrison Ford's Air Force One type of a president who gives one of the best speeches in the history of film. Last character worth noting is Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) who is pretty much just Cousin Eddie from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation with a different name who helps pilot the last comeback attack. As less, the producers gave him, a jet plane, rather than his normal biplane. It wouldn't work if he had to fly that to keep pace with F-18s. The special effects are awesome, even by today's standards of CGIs. I really believe the cities were getting destroy. The music compose by David Arnold is brilliant. Very uplifting and adventurous. There are a lot of cool scenes in the film, and a lot of dumb moments. One is the dog saving scene. I know dogs in film are typically seen as innocent, loyal, and uncorrupted, but to value animal life more important than human lives in film is just silly and wrong. If I had to choose between protecting my child and saving my dog, I would protect my child. That's not cold-hearted; that's called being a good parent. There are other questionable scenes worth asking. Like how do the aliens know the most ironic buildings for each city for point of attack, why did they wait six hours until attacking, and how can people give an alien computer a virus when they didn't even exist on OSX or basic Linux at that time? Specifically that the software would be incompatible. The biggest complain that I got for the movie is that nobody notice the aliens coming, even knowing they exist since 1947. For goodness sakes, you would have thought somebody would notice to tell somebody what was happening. Overall: personally I like Independence Day, even though I know it's corny. Really, though, the first half isn't all that bad. It's a cool set up to what turns out to be a bunch of reality pushing clichés. The scene where the big flying saucers are slowly appearing over the cities while the score lays on the horns is pretty awesome. Similar scenes have been tried in other movies since, and they just seem lame or excessive by comparison. In my opinion, Independence Day is how you film a good popcorn flick.",7,0,0,4 July 2013
No Country for Old Men," It's time to call it, friendo for what it is! A cinematic masterpiece.
","Based upon, author, Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name; there is no doubt, 'No Country for Old Men' was an amazing movie. This film written and directed by the Coen Brothers was mostly entertaining from beginning into the end. However, there were some flaws. Such in the case of pacing. This Academy Award-winning best picture crime drama and neo-western really takes its sweet time, telling the story of a disillusion elderly cop, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), having to find & protect an West Texas resident Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) whom recovered stolen drug money in a drug deal gone bad, before a psychotic and sociopathic hitman, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and the Mexican Cartels get a hold of him. Without spoiling this motion picture masterpiece, too much, while the game of cat & mouse story is a bit slow at parts, mostly in the opening & the subverted your expectations off-screen ending with Moss was a bit annoying. I still love this film. Glad, the Coen Brothers did cut out a few of the unneeded moments from the book, such as Moss picking up a hitchhiker. Nevertheless, most of the scenes, they did left, didn't felt unsatisfying & too scattered during most of the movie. The only one that was a bit bothersome was the swimming pool chat. I really don't get, why that was in the film. Nevertheless, while, the story is not that original, as there is striking similarities regarding the storyline and setting to 1973's crime thriller film 'Charley Varrick' aka 'The Last of the Independents' directed by Don Siegel & the 1968's novel 'The Looters' by author John H. Reese. One thing, the source material and film does well, is explores the human struggle toward trying to define the frameworks of code of ethics and morality, both within the perspective of the story's heroes and the villains with a minimal use of dialogue. I like how, each of the three main characters, has their own set of ideas of what that can be. Some of them, are very tired of the gruesome violent nature of humanity & struggles to find a moral center within it, to a point that they often abandon their authentic duties, due to being fearful. Others are not, like that; some function in a moral framework given to them by society, either by social norms, family or faith. However, the most chilling character in the film is the one driven by his own internal framework. His actions do not fall either, pragmatism or moral duty. That person operates outside of any sane understanding of morality and ethics, and continually raises conflicting philosophical questions to his victims often with a game of luck and chance with a coin toss. The only thing, he knows, is no matter, what people chose how to live life, death comes to us, all, either fast or slow. In his eyes, we all cattle, that one day, will be slaughter. We all, living pieces of meat. This is his mindset. No wonder, why his choice of weapon, the air powered bolt gun stronger symbolically his views. It's a powerful comparison. The actor, Bardem really did a good job, showing how unpredictable menacing such men can be, by his body language & facial expression, even if his character's haircut is a bit goofy. Glad, he still won Best Supporting Actor at that year's Oscars. As for the other performers, they were just as good, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The delivering of his character's dreams really does hold some emotional weight. It's here, we get hints what the title of the film taken from the opening line of 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem 'Sailing to Byzantium', means, as he felt really defeated by the harsh ambiguity of this new time and mourns of the loss of the bygone era of decently, even if this ideal world might probably never even existed but has been an illusion, all along. While, this pessimistic somewhat preachy, yet violent ambiguous ending might turn off some viewer from rewatching this movie. I do have to say, the film is worth seeing, regardless. The cinematography alone is amazing. Some of the shots of the West Texas desert is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer, Roger Deakins did a hell of a job, setting up the camera & scenes. However, I wish, the movie had more of a score by composer, Carter Burwell to go with. For me, the minimized of the score leaving large sections devoid of music was a mixed bag. Some parts, the suffocating silence, kinda works like the gas station stop; in other moments, it undermined some of the gripping gory action sequences like the chase scene involving the Pitbulls. Nevertheless, overall heads or tails: the film still fire on nearly all cylinders. This is one motion picture worth checking out. It is a must watch.",8,3,5,21 February 2019
Mamma Mia!," Mamma mia, here we go again, my my, I wish you were, a better host. The movie wasn't bad, but it's wasn't good.
","No Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! More! I can't stand you anymore. Mamma Mia, now I really know, my my, I can let you go. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, the movie is pretty mediocre. Don't get me wrong, I love the Swedish pop group band, ABBA and their songs. 'Lay all your love on me', 'Fernando', 'Dancing Queen' and 'Mamma Mia' are all in my music playlist. I even love musicals, but I was never a huge fan of this Broadway hit. I'll give you, my reasons why. Like the stage musical, the movie doesn't mixed the songs with the story that well. Honestly, what does a story about 20-year-old, bride, Sophie Sheridan. (Amanda Seyfried) who invite three of her mother's ex-boyfriends: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard), and Harry Bright (Colin Firth), to her wedding in Greece, so that she can find out, who her father is; have to do with ABBA!? It doesn't. Honestly, I don't know why the movie isn't set, during the disco era. The movie is apparently set in the early 2000s, way past, ABBA's popularity. I guess, the movie is supposed to feel nostalgia, but the settling of Greece as the backdrop wasn't much help. Greece is a beautiful country, and the movie shot the locations, very well, but it never felt like, the place channel the feeling of ABBA. I don't know, why the movie wasn't set in Sweden, in all places. When, I think of ABBA, I think of Stockholm. Sadly, if anything, this movie should had just went into biopic musical route, like 2014's Jersey Boys and have the movie be about the band, rise and fall. It would make a better film. This jukebox musical feels like it was written by drunk people who just went through a Marryoke. Somehow, they thought that partaking in drunken karaoke with a wedding theme, would make a good musical! And you know what? It doesn't work. Jukebox musicals movie like 2007's Across the Universe & 2001's Moulin Rouge work, because they took time, to make sure, the songs they use, have some connection with that of what happening on screen. They use it to add depth, and feeling. In this film, the ABBA songs feel like distractions. The songs were so random. It was obvious that they were thrown, willy-nilly. They even add songs to pointless comedy characters that hasn't nothing to do with the main story. It just there to add to the run-time. The songs rarely fuel any real deep emotion, or make us understand anything about any of the main characters. Honestly, I still don't know, anything about Sophie and her relationship with the groom, Skye (Dominic Cooper), after their song number and they're supposed to be the main focus. The movie is just careless, about the wedding sub-plot. It almost seems, secondary to the sub-plot of Sophie's mother, Donna (Meryl Streep), getting back with one of her exes. The movie has one of the weakest reason to conflict, I have ever saw in a film. They is really nothing much in stalk. I don't want to ruin the whole ending, but it's really stupid. There was no reason for the odd twist. I really hope, people got their money, back if they helped fund this wedding. This was an utter waste. Another fault of the film comes from the acting, and singing. Amanda Seyfried is OK in her role, but her character is such a clueless idiot, that I stopped caring for her. I was really hoping for Skye to leave her for another woman. I really couldn't stand with most of her bad decision making. Meryl Streep as Donna was ridiculous. It's nice to see that, she was having a lot of fun with this film, but I wish, she took her singing a little more serious. It's sound so mediocre. The worst singing, has to be Pierce Brosnan. This was his Waterloo. He can't carry a tune. It was painful to watch. The other supporting characters are just there for comedy relief, and in my opinion, takes way too much time away from the main characters of the film. I really couldn't get behind, seeing middle aged people doing god-awful dance moves with over the top costumes, while squeeing and giggling like schoolgirls. It really hurt my eyes and ears. I don't want to see this dancing queen. The movie has a problem with being way too cheerful, hamming and upbeat. Its reasons like that, the movie fails to be, really funny. Don't get me wrong, it's OK to have an upbeat story, but the movie could have play more on the misery of setting up a wedding, to a higher degree. There was so much, they could had done, to make the movie, funnier. It feels disappointing. I do love the cameos of the band, ABBA as Benny Andersson appears as a piano player during 'Dancing Queen.' Bjorn Ulvaeus appears as a member of the Greek Pantheon during 'Waterloo.' It's nice to see them, again. Overall: There are better chick flicks musicals out there, ones that are smart, funny, dramatic, even groundbreaking, but Mamma Mia isn't that. This film is disjointed, clichés, nonsensical, and fairly cheesy. I don't recommended. Just buy the Mamma Mia soundtrack if you want to hear ABBA songs.",6,0,0,25 March 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," This western might be slow and boring to some, but for me, this film was alright. At least, it ends with an evocative bang.
","Adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name, and based on true events, this western dramatizes the relationship between fame outlaw, Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his would be assassin, Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), during the events that leaded up to James's murder. While the movie might seem long and predictable to some critics, it was a unique watch for me. Directed by Andrew Dominik, the movie is full of great acting for both of the main cast. Brad Pitt has this eerily with his use of body language that makes his character so edgy, like you don't know, if he's going to strike you down or not. He was very sinister in this film. The same with Casey Affleck, whom seem like he was born to play the part, of the odd-lonely little man, whom scare for his life, but also do whatever, it takes to survive in this harsh world. I love how Bob's obsession is never explosive with fandom; rather, the movie adopts a near quiet, melancholy tone, creepy love for Jesse as his hero. It's even more tragic, when he is paralyzed by his prominent persona and ignominious actions toward other fans of Jesse James, until he finally falls victim to a society that couldn't stand him. I love how history can spin perceptions of people and the public so easily. Another person that seem to stand out in this film, is Sam Rockwell as Ford's slightly less-enamored brother, Charlie. He was probably, the best of the supporting actors. Don't get me wrong, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Renner, and Michael Parks are easily as memorable, but their scenes are far too short, compare to Rockwell. It's also, the same with the female leads. Although Mary-Louise Parker, and Zooey Deschanel are billed near the top, neither one has more than a brief cameo. Despite that, one of the best things in this film is the narrative by Hugh Ross. He really sets the mood of the film, very well with his tones of his voice without going too far into pervasive and perspective driven. Whenever, he describing things about the factual plot, I felt like I had to listen, as if a very good historical lecture. There is no bigger success of his skills than the 'No Eulogies' Ending. He's so good at reading, that he makes reading the phone book, seem interesting. I know, some people might not like this narration style, due to some instances of unreliable dry text book heavy-handed read, throughout the film, but I found the read, sophistical. Yet, I do believe that voice overs in movies like this, do needs to be used more sparingly, so to allow the camera to tell the story, not the words. Even with the large amount of narrative, this movie does have amazing cinematography to tell the story throughout the film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is heartbreakingly beautiful, alternately blurred and precise, the colors autumnal, the dark shadows long and evocative as if looking at an old tintype. All of this makes for an environment that reflects the inner lives of both Jesse and Bob, neither able to shake the other, off from each other. I love the sullen, near-resigned look that the final shot lingers on: superbly poignant and terrifically chosen. It really carries. Yet, I know, some of the critics found this movie to be boring or sad, due to the lack of action and its depressing brooding tone. However, it's somewhat good that way, because it's makes the film more, historical accuracy. The film completely destroys the hero myth of Jesse James and replaces it with a lot of sinister characters behaving selfishly, beset by squabbling, petty violence and disintegration is exactly what happened to Jesse James' gang. It's true, that the James Gang has more or less fizzled out by the time the film begins. So, there wouldn't be, a lot of action, if the gang is trying to hide from the public eye. One of the reason, why this movie wasn't released until 2007, despite being shot in 2005, was because of the conflict, Director Andrew Dominik had with Warner Bros. As you see in this film, Dominik wanted an impressionistic, Terrence Malick-esque approach; while executives at Warner Bros. who wanted a more action-packed movie. Eventually Brad Pitt, producer Ridley Scott and editors Dylan Tichenor, Curtis Clayton and Michael Kahn made and tested various recuts. It's currently unknown who's cut was picked for general release. I would love to one day, see the other versions of this film. Because of things like that, we never really got to know, what happen to certain characters, because how many scenes with them, were cut. Hopefully, those other versions, solve those plot-holes. No matter, what film version, you see; the music, throughout this film, by Australian composers, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is superb. It was very beautiful. The movie's soundtrack has made me cry more than once. Overall: For me, this movie is a must watch. At least, once. This was a haunting, well-crafted masterpiece. However, it's not for everybody, but check it out, if you want to!",7,0,0,5 April 2016
Remember the Titans," Remember this movie? I do!
","Tossing it out there like a football, this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football, but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough' of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye' Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans.",7,4,6,13 January 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," This movie has hardly any faults. It was a heart-warming film.
","Faults in Our Stars was a good movie, but be prepared. This is also a tearjerker, coming-of-age tragedy about two 'star-crossed lovers'. So make sure to bring tissue. I cannot tell you, enough, movie, how thankful I am, for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I'm a huge fan of author John Green's work. Fault in Our Stars is by far, his best novel, yet. Inspired by the autobiography of Esther Grace Earl, a young woman living with cancer, that John Green was friends with, and adapted from the fourth solo YA novel of the same name. The movie version of Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) & Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort); two recluse teenagers trying to discover with each other, what does it takes to fall in love, when dealing with a life-threating illness, like cancer. Directed by Josh Boone, the two characters in this film, are very well-rounded and likable, however, I found the casting choices, kinda jarring. Don't get me wrong, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley did fine in their roles, but it's still kinda weird to see, these two actors play lovers, when their previous released roles was 2014's movie, 'Divergent' in which, they played brother and sister. When you think about it, it's kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Another problem with the film and the book is how kinda disrespectful, it is, to holocaust victim, Anne Frank. I really don't understand, why they added a scene like that. It felt out of place. Were they, trying to be funny and make a Seinfeld reference, or were they trying to say, that every moment of life is precious, and you should try to enjoy, every minute of it. Was it, Hazel and Augustus's usual way of honoring the dead!? I still don't get. Anyway, you put it, it's not a good scene. They should had cut it, or change the settling. Anyways, one scene, I wish, the movie kept was, when Hazel goes to visit Isaac (Nat Wolff) at the hospital following his eye surgery. In the movie, she doesn't do that, and it's seem a little mess up, because he plays a big part in Hazel & Gus's relationship. Yes, it probably would have weighed down the main plot, just to build up Hazel's relationship with Isaac, but audiences may miss a lot of what could had been. Plus, Nat Wolff gave such a quietly heartbreaking performance that he really needed to be revisited. Also, where in the hell is Kaitlyn from the novel? In the movie, Kaitlyn doesn't exist, and it's sad; because she really could had add something to the film. Another missing person from the book is Augustus' former girlfriend Caroline Mathers, who died of brain cancer a few years earlier. This really kinda affects the movie for me, because she supposed to weighs heavily on Hazel's mind on deciding to love and be loved, even when you know it will cause pain. Since there's no mention of Caroline, we never truly know for sure, what is going through Hazel's mind or the effect her death had on Gus. Then, there is the fact, that the movie left out an important scene in which Hazel hear Gus crying and yelling at his mom before they leave on their trip to Amsterdam. In the book, that conversation foreshadows a big return to Gus that I felt would had work, to establish, his struggles. Still, I just glad, they didn't sugarcoat, the powerful and mature story, for these teen audience like they did with 2015's adaptation of Paper Towns, another John Green book. However, I didn't like, how director Boone decided to leave out Hazel's disdain for all the Facebook comments people wrote following Gus' death. In the book, Hazel is infuriated by all the clichéd sentiments and rashly posts something critical of another commenter, assuming Gus would have despised the sympathy notes. Having trolls on the Facebook page would make it, a little more realistic in tone. Anyways, the clever dialogue and writing, is still pretty much here, throughout the film. Yes, it makes the characters seem like their talking like old people, but here's the catch. It's supposed to work that way. Not only is, it's supposed to attract the young adult's crowd, but also the older movie going audience as well. In my opinion, it's rare to see, a movie treat its young people as well educated adults. So, I had no problem with that. Also, I had no problem with the soundtrack for this film. 'Boom Clap' by Charli XCX might not be, the best written love story, ever. However, it's works for the film. I love the many of fan theories that came out, since this movie came out, like how in-universe, The Fault in Our Stars was written by Peter Van Houten (William Dafoe) or how Hazel writes her own Fan Fic in the An Imperial Affliction universe. Overall: Whatever, people take from this story. It's a great adaptation. Yes, there is some flaws, but it's never drive away, focus on the main story. To quote, Hazel's favorite book, 'pain demands to be felt.' And feel, you will, which is more than okay. So check this movie for your own.",8,0,0,16 February 2016
Wreck-It Ralph," Game on! Taking on life one game at a time.
","Wreck-It Ralph is such a good movie, and it really does show that Disney doesn't really need Pixar to make good animation movies. The film tells the story of the titular 8 bit arcade game villain named Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) who is tired of playing the villain, getting ostracize by his co-workers and force to live in ruins of his old stump. I like how John Reilly stumbles in his lines, but it still felt real to me. The movie does a great job visual to make it seem like 8 bit world, even to the point of using jerky motion that spoofs the limited animation cycles of 8 bit characters. He rebels against his role and dreams of becoming a hero. He sees that the only way he can be a hero is to game jumps to another game to win a medal to earn their respect. When the Arcade closes at night, video games characters in its games are allow leave their normal roles and are free to travel to other games through plugs that lead to a place known as Game Central Station, but have to return to their game in the morning, if not the game would seem broken, and in worst cases. Shut down. Since Wreck-It Ralph hasn't return, the game Fix-It-Felix Jr. is now in danger of just that. The hero Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is starting to think that Ralph went 'turbo'. Going 'turbo' is name for a video game character whom went to another game, and try to sabotaged it, causing both games to be shut down. He soon find out that Ralph has gone to a first-person shooter game call Hero's Duty. Hero's Duty is a Call of Duty, Halo, type of game, lead by Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) where the game's winner receives a medal after fighting Cy-Bugs. Felix soon find out that he crash-land in another game called Sugar Rush, a kart-racing game similar to that of Mario Kart. Ralph searching for medal, meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a glitchy character whom like Ralph is shun by her game mates. Being PG makes Sarah Silverman so much more bearable, as she tend to too raunchy, but still Vanellope von Schweetz at first is such a annoying character, but the character's charm grow on you. It seems like a lot of critics hated her. I mean, she was annoying, but no more than a kid would be in most movies. Seriously, I swear most critics have completely mistaken her for an adult character because they constantly treat her like one, talking about how annoying she is when she's freaking nine! The way she acts is like how most 9-year-olds act! At least she was somewhat sympathetic. Ralph helps Vanellope build a kart to fight against it. King Candy (Alan Tudyk) the ruler of this world, refuse to let her participate, claiming that she is not really part of the game and her winning would cause the game to be shut down. Alan does a really good job on the voice, sounding more like Ed Wynn then his normal voice. This is where Ralph is force to decide about being the villain in the eyes of Vanellope to save her, or be the hero which will cause the end of both Fix-it Felix and Sugar Rush. A hard choice to pick. The final act has the most emotional and greatest twist to any movie that came out in 2012. The movie also contains a number of other video game references, to the point that I heard people calling this film the 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit of video games' or 'Toy Story with video game characters'. The film includes characters, sight gags, and dialogues from games like Super Mario Bros, Paperboy, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Final Fantasy Q*Bert, Street Fighter and others. I geeked out quite a bit seeing them. My favorite reference is Metal Gear. How much cooler would the movie be, if the games were from a Flynn Arcade referencing Tron? To me the big name video game characters seemed a little tacked on because they didn't affect the story all that much, and that's a downer in a way. Of course the Copyrighted characters aren't in it for very long, but I think it's pretty impressive that they got as much as they did, but then again, this is the very growing media empire that is Disney we're talking about. While they didn't use the cameo characters to their highest potential. I almost feel it would have distracted the focus of the movie from the characters that the story revolves around to the established video games characters. I feel the cameos were not necessary, but at the same time it is icing on the cake. The movie works due to it's use of video game nostalgia, while building a clear colorful visual worlds where the characters can come in and out as they want. It's a visual spectacle. It was great for what it was: a child's movie covering adult themes with a video game background with humor that sharp. I think it would have been so much better if it focused on Ralph. He became a side-kick in his own movie when Vanellope comes in. There also so many story lines, and the romance of side-characters was so tacked on. Again, it's already a good film, but stating it could have been way cooler if it allow Ralph's journey to continue. Vividly creative setting and concept, extremely likable characters, but obscured by a kind of cliché attention-grabbing comic relief character for parts of it, but worth watching.",9,5,6,31 January 2013
Non-Stop," Non-Stop Suspense. Yes! Non-Stop Action. Not really. Still, it was a great thrill ride.
","Some people might get confused, as there was a Lifetime TV movie made in 2013 name 'Non-Stop', with similar concept where a man put everyone in terrible danger on an airplane. This movie is a little bit better than that. So watch out when trying to find this film. In plane sight, this 2014 film by Jaume Collet-Serra, might fall into that type of stupid action film on a plane, but surprising, this movie had a lot of twist and turns that make up majority of the film. The film had little to no action to it. At age 62, at the time of filming this. Liam Neeson can still kick butt, but gees. I really doubt, he can for long period of time. There is very little room for Liam Neeson to engage a person if his character really wanted to. So, if you're looking for something like 2008's Taken, it's not that movie. It reminds me more of 1978's Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express or a Hitchcock's film, you really can't tell who the murderer is in this film as everybody is made out to be suspects. The movie is about an broken down alcoholic U.S air marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who on a non-stop flight from New York to London, receive a text message on his secure phone stating that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account. Soon enough, people start to die, and Bill is the only one who can stop it. Movie was a bit turbulence when it's come down being plausible because it all happen in a plane, but once you find out who the murderer is, the film kinda make it look like it's possible. I wouldn't say, all the plot holes were sealed. There were a few unrealistic things that go through the film, like how people can't hear anything or going on. Example is the fight in the bathroom. That was pretty loud. Honestly, if you dissect the film, you find others far-fetch things that might be bothersome like why the Air Marshal Service would hire a drunk Cop? For the most part, it's pretty entertaining that it keep your attention enough, so you don't question that. You will have to suspend a lot of disbelief. The film does make a good statement on our post 9/11 fear of air travel, as the movie digs deep into the discussion if Air Marshall are really needed or not. Some people might get offended by how the film portrays some of the 9/11 victims and a US soldier as terrorists, but I have to say. It could happen. The movie isn't being political correct here. Even the Islamic doctor, Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally) could be the killer. The movie even have a disturbing scene that remind me of Sept. 11's Flight United 93 where the passenger fought back against the terrorist to regain the plane. The film also dig into how quickly the media is, to able to villainous a person without learning any solid facts about what is truly happening. The film makes us know, how depressed Marks is, hating his job and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers before he boards the plane. Liam Neeson really made this movie, good as you can see the stress in his film. The acting is alright from the supporting cast. They weren't so annoying like other films like this. Julianne Moore as Jen Summers who sat next to Marks on the plane was an interesting subplot, because she seem to display an inordinate amount of concern for him. I can do without the un-necessary romance in action film. Jen Summer is example of this. Then there was the air attendant Nancy (Michelle Dockery) who had access to every place on the airplane; could she be the killer? Could it be the non-existent Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o)? I almost forgot that Oscar Winner, Lupita was even in this movie. Could it, be the hot-headed New York cop Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll) as the killer? Corey Stoll is amazing actor. I love him in this movie. Maybe, it's the cell phone programmer, Zack White (Nate Parker) or the man, Bill Marks talk with before the flight, Tom Bowen (Scoot McNairy)? Maybe the killer is the other Air Marshall, not-trustworthy Jack Hammond (Anson Mount)? You just have to watch it to find out. The camera work was pretty good. It sophisticated in camera motion that get you in that claustrophobia feel. Still, I can do without the shaking cam. The CGI special effects are mediocre, at best. One thing, I did love is the floating cellphones text showing on the screen, whenever a character use a phone. I love how they even add broken cellphone text to show damage, and struggle. There are few elements that remind me of other flight disaster movies such as 1970's Airport series, 1990's Turbulence series or 1957's Zero Hour. Overall: I have taken everything you need to know about the movie coming in, without spoiling too much of it. In my opinion, it's worth watching. So go fly ahead and go see it.",7,11,16,20 March 2014
Zulu," Boom Shakalaka! This UK inspirational, historical epic masterpiece really did captured what it felt to be hit by a strong tribal force.
","I felt like I was hit by an Iwisa. This periodic war-film from the 1960's, really did make an impact on me. Directed by Cy Endfield, the movie tells the epic account of the true story of an under-strength British forces defending an isolated African mission at Rorke's Drift against large packs of Zulu warriors, during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the depiction of the Battle of Rorke's Drift was amazing to watch. It's like the British's version of the Western genre. The beautiful landscape of South Africa was used very well. You really get the scale of how large, the Zulu army is and how small, the British forces, by the way, the camera frame, its endless hills and mountains. Yet, the movie doesn't really show or explain, why the Zulus and British were fighting. There was no mention of the British wanting greater control over non-renewable natural resources like Diamonds or how the Zulus felt unjustly treated by the colonial regime. Still, I like how the film doesn't do many cheap tricks to demonize, either one side. The film could had easily, portray the Zulus as killer hordes of savages; seeing how this movie was made, during the height of apartheid, where the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. However, the film doesn't do that. You see the Zulus be willing to allow the missionaries families to escape the battle, as well, punish its own members, for trying to stop them from fleeing. Yet, I wish the movie didn't make it seem like the Zulus were the invaders, when in truth, the British were. In real events, King Cetewayo (Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi) was hoping for negotiated peace with the British after the Battle of Isandlwana. After all, King Cetewayo didn't want to attack Rorke's Drift as it would make him, seem like an aggressor to the British public, as the Drift was nowhere near the borders of Zululand and there was no military value to it. Yet a party of some 4,000 Zulu reserves mounted, such of an attack. However, after King Cetwayo heard about it, the Zulus were forced to retreat after one day of battle, not because of show of respect to British for their bravery. The unauthorized of the attack is one of the true reasons, why the Zulus retreat, along with lack of supplies. It's one of the bigger historic inaccurate that the movie got wrong along with the British death count, which was 17. Another is the battlefield singing contest. While, I dig it, as a powerful scene in the movie, it's not really historical accurate as there were no much event, recorded. Another thing, the song 'Men of Harlech' features prominently as the Wales's regimental tune; did not become the official march song until much, much later in the First World War (1914-1918). In the time of the battle, the regimental song was 'The Warwickshire Lad'. Another thing, while both Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers & Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine), an infantry officer were heroic. In truth, the real hero of Rorke's Drift was Commissary James Dalton (Dennis Folbigge). It was Dalton who persuaded Chard and Bromhead to remain at Rorke's Drift when their first instinct was to abandon the post, and it was Dalton who organized and inspired the defense. Despite that, I think, both actor, Stanley Baker and Michael Caine did great in their roles in the action scenes, even if the real-life Bromhead is supposedly deaf and Chard was a heavy smoker. I also love the down to earth complex relationship between common-man, Chard with that, Brownhead's pompous aristocrat. I like how the film, makes them, likable, even with their questionable decisions. I just wish the writers did the same with Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins). All of his scenes were a little bit, too annoying. Despite that, I think, Jack Hawkins did great in his acting. The same goes with the rest of the supporting cast like Glynn Edwards and James Booth, even with their somewhat hard to hear, English accents. They did great in showing the anti-war sentiment, while unnecessary fighting in the action scenes. Even the Zulus extras were great in most of the action scenes. I love that majority of them, were largely descendants of the actual warriors who took part in the battle, among them the then chief of the Zulu Nation, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Seeing, none of the Zulus had ever seen a movie, it was difficult for them to understand what they were doing playing to a camera, but somewhat they pull it off. I just wish, some of the hand to hand combat were better. It really didn't look like some of the spears and swords were making skin connect. It's obvious with the fake-looking rubber bayonets that many of the close-combat scenes are done with more regard to safety than realism. The gun fight instead was very intense, not only by sight, but also by sound. I love the rattling of shields; and the thunder of marching feet. It really made the Zulus army, seem so much more powerful than they really were. The stirring music score is by John Barry was also amazing. Yet, the narration by Richard Burton could had done before. I felt like it wasn't really needed, even in the end. It's also just funny, that this movie was originally rated PG, seeing how much blood, and high death toll, it has. Plus, the fact that it has topless tribal dancers. I just glad, the producers didn't censored any of this. It adds to the realistic tone of the film. Overall: Filmed on a grand scale, Zulu is a rousing recreation of real-life events. A must watch for any film fan.",8,6,7,12 October 2016
Saving Private Ryan," This film is a masterpiece. A tribute to the greatest generation and those who serve during WWII.
","The fact that it didn't win Best Picture is outrageous. It was great from start to finish. The opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional. The music score by John Williams is amazing. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story of a mission following the D-day invasion. The movie starts Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. His mission to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him back to the United States so that it can save the family's bloodline and help softly the mother's grief. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore starts as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. I understand the everyman quality of the average soldier. There were also a lot of actors that you wouldn't have thought for once, playing soldiers as supporting characters such as Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and Paul Giamatti. Who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever. I like how the characters were written with everyday blue-collar Joes. It gives the movie realistic. They are brave while scare. Good, but also bit morally reprehensible. A great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a German Soldier. All of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free. It's toward the middle of the film, that the violence of the film dies down enough, to get a few character development. It was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here. Some people thinks that the movie glorified war or it's over patriotism. I think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war. In movies that glorify war, there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply don't represent the soldiers who fought in war. In Saving Private Ryan, the characters are down-to-earth-ordinary. This movie also shows that in war, there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive. It portrays war as what it is: violent and ugly. As pure hell. As for patriotism, I don't believe that the film is patriotism. There are scenes of American soldiers being as crude, cowardly, or just mean-spirited as some of the German's soldiers. I don't think the Germans are portray unfairly. About the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an American film presented to an American audience. Would it had been nice to see a British soldier in the film? Yes, but it wasn't needed in the film. The film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war, while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got. The film was balance between pro war and anti-war themes. Yes, there were a few historic accurates that wasn't corrected, but overall, many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. The first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the Normandy Invasion. The visuals are grainy, de-colorized, and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then, and since after Saving Private Ryan, many directors have used for their war films. The audio is astounding, and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film. Exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional, positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings. After this movie came out, I saw an interview with several D-Day survivors. They all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen. It was like they were there again. That is strong praise from someone who would know. Every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film. Show them how it really was. It's not what it is. Overall: It is a must-watch. It's a story of normal, average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it.",9,5,8,6 June 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," The movie have the heart of a chief, and the soul of a dragon. It was a great watch.
","Without spoiling too much, the movie was pretty good. Still, there are some questions that need to be asked. Honestly, why is this movie still call, 'how to train your dragon 2'? There wasn't much footage of human training dragons, here. Even, the tagline says that 'the training is over'. The movie should had been call, 'How to Control your Dragon?'. Since, that's most of the plot of this. Still, how to train your dragon 2 is amazing. I'm a huge fan of the first one that came out in 2010, and this sequel did not disappoint. Visually, it was beautiful as the CGI animation was outstanding. The flight scenes take your breath away as usual, and battle action was captivating. Lots of scenery porn. It's a must-see and it has to be 3D. Like the last movie, it's loosely based on the book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell. The film is written and directed by Dean DeBlois. Since Dean Deblois wasn't involved with the DreamWorks Dragons: Riders of Berk 2012 TV series and says that he didn't take it into consideration when writing this movie, but that doesn't necessarily make this film non-canon. The third season of the show will apparently bridge the gap between the two. Indeed, the film does a good job recapping the events of the last film. Does the audience really need a sum up in the first ten minutes, of what happen in the last film? I could do without the same recycle narrative as the last movie. I think, most people whom going to watch this, at less, saw the first film. It felt forced as hell. Anyways, the events of this film take place, five years after the Viking had made peace with the dragons. Searching for new lands, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) discovered that an insane conqueror, Drago Bludvist (Voiced by Djimon Hounsou) is looking forward to getting hold of the Kingdom of Berk's large supply of dragons to help him control the world. I do have to believe, that Drago Bludvist is creepy and menacing, but he's indeed a one-dimensional evil character that was a bit over the top. There are hints of a deeper backstory, but these aren't explored beyond a token mention. Then again, that may be entirely the point: Hiccup learns that not all enemies can be reasoned with. Honestly, like how on earth, did he train Alpha dragon to do his duties?? I love the main cast. Jay Baruchel as Hiccup is just as great as the original film. I can't see anybody else, playing the role. Hiccup's sub-plot is pretty interested, but pretty predictable, when the first time, you heard what Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast (Gerald Butler) got in store for him. You knew, that somebody is going to make it to the end of the film. As much as I love Cate Blanchett in epic movie; her presence as Valka in the film is a bit out of place and come out of nowhere. Valka's reasons for leaving Hiccup are a bit dumb. I love how Toothless, the dragon remind me of a really big house cat. It's so cute. By far, the dragons are the most interesting things in the film. I love the new dragons, they introduce in the film. I did find the supporting cast to be a bit annoying. I really can't stand, all of them. I can do without the sub-plot of Snotlout (Voiced by Jonah Hill) & Fishlegs (Voiced by Christopher Mintz-Piasse) fighting over Ruffnut (Voiced by Kristen Wiig). While, I do love Gobber (Voiced by Craig Ferguson), he sounds too much like Shrek to me. None of the new characters like Eret (Kit Harington) catch my interested. I wasn't kinda hoping, not to see his goofy self, again more in the film. The new character designs looked great. The credits roll over the film's concept art, which is just as gorgeous as the film itself. The movie score is beautiful by Jon Thor Birgisson & John Powell. Somehow the Norwegian release of this film, had an different song 'Into a Fantasy' by Alexander Rybak, but both versions are epic to hear. The pacing was alright for the most part, but there were some slow areas in the beginning, that could had speed up. For a movie about how much Drago is a threat. You don't see him, until middle of the 102 minutes, film. In my opinion, as much as I like this movie. I think the original movie was better. It had way better character development, better story, and just fun to watch. There were a lot of dark moments in this PG film, but not as gritty as the last film. There are some frighten moments that might be too scary for little children. It's watchable for an adult due to its depth about the mental outlook of a person when face with a disability. You see, how Hiccup doesn't allow his disability to stop him from living a mostly positive life, and you see how Drago took shame of disability to a dark path. Also, the film had the first openly homosexual character in a Dreamworks animation film that might find some LGBT fans rooting for him. I do think the film has a positive message about overcoming obstacles, friendship, and the quest of resolving conflict through peaceful terms. I have to say, don't watch the trailers. As the first full-length trailer gives away Valka's role and who is the Big Bad guy. Just watch it as soon as possible. Overall: It was a good movie, and I loved every minute of it.",8,5,11,7 July 2014
The Pianist," The Pianist plays the right keys. It's more A Minor than a B Flat. It's a cinematic masterpiece.
","The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Those whom lived through it, are forever scarred by its horrors. Even today, few can muster the courage to bring themselves to discuss the subject. However, one person did, and his name was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Based off his memoirs of the same name, 'The Pianist' tells the story of how he was able to survive the war, while living in fear, under Nazi Control, Warsaw, Poland. Without spoiling this 2002 film, too much, I have to say director, Roman Polanski and screenwriter, Ronald Harwood tried to keep the motion picture as historically accurate as possible. Why? It's because Polanski's inspiration for the film, came from the fact that he himself, had been a prisoner of a polish ghetto during the war. He wanted to make sure, common folks see the harsh heart breaking realistic truths about the events similar to what Steven Spielberg did with his 1993 masterpiece's 'Schindler's List'; rather than viewing something that is semi-safe, sugar coated & crowd-pleasing like the fictional movies, 1997's 'Life is Beautiful' & 1999's film 'Jacob the Liar'. Plus, he wanted to make sure, that there was no stone left unturned for Holocaust deniers to say that the events, feature in the film, did not happen. While, the movie does have some scenes inserted just to express the horror of the Holocaust, they far from legends. They come from Polanski's own accounts. Nevertheless, there was a few minor inaccuracy, I found, that didn't happen at all. One such thing was the relationship between Wladyslaw (Adrian Brody) and Dorota (Emilia Fox). Not only, was Dorota appears to be a made up character for the movie, but there was no apparent love connection between Wladyslaw and any woman, during the war. While, I do understand, that this character was probably created, in order to give a look at Szpilman's life before the occupation and to evoke audience sympathy for all that he lost during the war, but it wasn't really needed. The chocolate dinner scene with his family was really strong. If that wasn't enough, just rewatch the part where the titular character walk, through the empty ghetto. You see the pain, through Adrian Brody's eyes & body language. No able of dialogue, can vivid depict, how haunting & powerful, the actor's facial reactions are, throughout this movie. It reach me on a deeper level. Much in the same way, how the actor lost weight, in order to look more exhausted & weary & Brody learning how to really play the piano, very well. It's no wonder, why Adrien Brody became the youngest person to date to win an Academy Award for Best Actor at the age of 29. He did a good job, here. He deserve winning that prize in 2003. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, Polanski & his crew has cast this movie nearly perfectly. However, due to the huge amount of supporting performers and the lack of screen time focus on them. They don't really stand out, much as I wish, even though, their acting was great. Despite that, nearly every performer look and felt authentic with the little amount of time, they had. However, some of the literary references calls outs like the works of William Shakespeare & Fyodor Dostoevsky from Wladyslaw's brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard) felt a little bit jarring. I doubt, he quotes those works in real-life. Despite that, I did like how the film shows that there is good & bad people, within both sides of the fence through the actions of German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) & Szalas (Andrew Tiernan). Nice to see national groups so complex, than lopsided 100% demonic & angelic. The only real nitpick, I had on the historical value of them, were the fact that some of the army uniforms of the German soldiers, were a bit off. Nevertheless, the rest of wardrobe seem fitting with what people wore during that era. Another inaccuracy that, I notice in the film, was the idea that there was running water in abandoned bomb out buildings. In truth, water within the city, run out, way before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. As for action, the film focused on the terrible treatment and unjust punishment that the Jewish & Polish people really had to go through. The violence are really graphic and somewhat hard to watch, at times. According to the bonus features of the DVD, many such acts of cruelty in the film were recreated from actual photographs and archival film footage shot by the Nazis. Nevertheless, the way, the movie was shot, was also amazing. A good example is the opening sequence, where we see a statue with its arm pointing to the left, and people & the city in the background. Every so often throughout the movie, we see the same figure, only this time, the background is more & more ruin by war, until nothing is left, but rubble. That is highly great use of props and scenery. Despite, the loss of his wife and her friends at the hands of Manson's family, and his infamous involvement with an 13 year old girl which forced him to flee the United States. Polanski in the midst of this controversies, has always been a great director, which to be reckoned with. Through the help of real-life locations in Europe, cinematic CGI effects and camera techniques, Polanski & his crew was able to immerse the audience in the determination and will for survival that was displayed by Szpilman. It's no wonder, why he won Best Director at the Academy Award. It's one of his best works. This motion picture is able to offer a voice to the millions of Jews who lost their lives to the Holocaust. Overall: It's a film that needs to be seen, both a history lesson and morality tale. A must watch for sure.",9,0,0,7 February 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel was pretty grand!
","You can always tell when you're watching a Wes Anderson's film with all his director motifs. Like Tim Burton, Wes Anderson's films always have a distinctive style. You just have to be a semi fan of his work to get enjoy it. If not, this movie isn't for you. Grand Budapest Hotel is just as amazing to watch like his other whimsical films. One thing, that bother me, is the direction of the narrative. The movie is told through four people, in three different time-lines. The movie couldn't figure out who should tell this movie. It was bit annoying. The first is an unnamed young girl who reads an author's (Tom Wilkinson) book in the present day, about his time at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Then it's told by the young author now played by Jude Law in the 1960s, whom meets the hotel owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Then it's told by Zero who recounts to him, how he got the hotel as a young man (Tony Revolori) in 1932, but the movie isn't really about him. You can really see, how this is frustration. The movie should only focus on the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). All of the other beginning stories wasn't needed. M. Gustave was the best part of the film, and wonderfully play by Ralph Fiennes. By far, my favorite character, he help created. Gustave is very dapper and elegant and courteous and impressively foul mouthed. What a great character. M. Gustave is a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state. Still, I don't know why it is call Grand Budapest Hotel, when it's nowhere near Budapest? The movie also have a fictional World War 2, as Zubrowka's 'Zig-Zag' fascist and Communism movement fight for control of the country as a backdrop. With its mix of German, Hungarian and Slavic naming elements, Catholicism, fallen nobility and rising fascists Zubrowka is strongly reminiscent of the former lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between the wars. Anyways, when the elder Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in great make up) dies a mysterious death. M. Gustave is framed for her death and sent to prison. Mid-while, the story kinda get way more complex, involving theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune. I like how his films consistently center on the importance of and interaction between families. I found the relationship between M. Gustave and young Zero to be the greatest piece of the film. Still, the movie did had way too many characters. The movie has a lot of Wes Anderson recurring actors as side or minor characters like Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and others. Honestly, some of these characters were not really needed, but seem write in, so he can get some of his friends, a paycheck. Since Anderson film usually features an ensemble cast and a sprawling plot line, not every character get told. The odd telling of what happen to Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) seem lazy. Show it, don't tell it. It kinda lost the emotional impact, by just mentioning it, without showing. I didn't mind the bittersweet ending about M. Gustave, because the movie invested more into that character than Agatha, but it seem wrong, not to show, what happen to them. It seem a lot of the plot conclusion was unfinished. After all, the movie never truly tells how M. Gustave prove his innocent, or who killed him. The film was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. The film has bits from 1939 novel 'Beware of Pity' and 1982 'The Post Office Girl'. You see that in Anderson's films, that he truly love art. Indeed, it's an art-film about loving art. His films are full of charmingly obscure references to old music, theater, literature, paintings and photography. The locations that they use are beautiful. I love the nostalgia look of the clothes, you really get the time period. I also didn't mind the use of handmade miniature models. It was funny to see it, but fits in with the mood of the story, so well. The Deadpan comedy works so well, in this movie. I wouldn't stop, laughing. The silly dialogue is delivered in such a serious way that makes it fun to watch. I'm a sucker for smart comedies. I didn't like the lack of European accents. It was alright. The movie does have some harsh language, but unlike other modern comedies. It's works with the story, because it used to expression deep emotion depth, than a misplace adjective. The violence can be a bit too violent at times. This might be Anderson's darkest, most violent film yet. I really think some people might hate what happen to a certain cat in the film. The movie did a few scenes of nudity that could had been cut. It wasn't need. Overall: The movie takes the cake. In this case, Mendl's Courtesan au Chocolats. It's a good well-made movie with some faults",8,5,10,13 June 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Tuck & Dale were killing it. I was dying from laughter.
","I like watching movies about Good Ole' Boys taking out evil. Two reasons why redneck murderers get away with their crime. The DNA all matches and there are no dental records. Still, Tuck & Dale GITS-ER-DONE!! It's a fun watch! The people from the Appalachian Mountains has always had to dealt with outsiders projected them with negative Appalachian often derogatory stereotypes such as murderers Hillbillies or rapist Rednecks due to horror films such as Deliverance (1972), The Last House on the Left (1972), The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Friday the 13th (1980) & Mother's Day (1980). In these films, a group of city slickers gets lost in the backwoods and are hunted and slaughtered by psychopathic in-bred hillbillies. However, Tucker and Dale turns the table with its plot. Directed by Eli Craig, Tuck (Alan Tudyk) & Dale (Tyler Labine) are not psychopathic hicks, but just normal guys trying to rebuild their summer home, only to have out of town, college kids leaded by Chad (Jesse Moss) mistake them for brutal killers and try to murder them! This movie show a bright light on the misunderstanding between people and how jumping to conclusion about someone, based solely on his or her physical appearance can become deadly. The movie pretty smart with its themes. The jokes are funny. I love all the out-of-context misunderstanding jokes. The movie does spoof a lot of previous horror films like the weapons they use, like the over long scythe from 1977's Eaten Alive and 1982's Unhinged to the chainsaw from 1974's Texas Chain Saw Massacre & 1987's Evil Dead. Even the opening has this The Blair Witch Project (1999) feel with a lost-footage sequence. There is a lot of Sigmund Freud psychoanalysis topics running around throughout the film, ranging from understanding Inferiority vs superior complex, the understanding of dreams, life and death drives and others. The movie does have faults, as it's hard to suspense your disbelief, in particular, all of the silly mishap ways of dispatching the college kids through a series of accidents. Yet, it so surreal absurd that all the improbability doesn't really matter too much, as its funny to watch how the college kids end up dead meat. It's also a bit far fetch for a girl like Allison (Katrina Bowden) to be find herself, falling in love with Dale. Tyler Labine really does come off as 'Larry the Cable Guy,' type of a guy, as some fans might mistake it for Larry the Cable Guy movie. You also get a lot of inside jokes about Tyler Labine previous acting jobs such as Dale holding a Scythe, which represent his role as Alan Sock from 2007 to 2009, CW TV Series; 'Reaper'. I'm quite pleased to say all the actors play their parts well and are easily likable. Still, the movie kinda spoil the fact that Jesse Ross comes across, the villain; way too early in the film. I would rather have a slow build to that. Even the whole backstory of Jesse Ross seem a bit rushed. There is no reason for the closure that he got. Even the trailer, steal almost all of the best jokes and lines from the film. It even feature most of the deaths. So, I wouldn't advice, watching the trailer for this film if you haven't saw it. The gore and violence in the film is graphic, all done in a comedic matter. There is one scene of nudity, but it's in poor light and from some distance. It's a bit disappointing. The music choice for the film, kinda sucks with the teen rock type music. It felt quite out of place as well. I'm sure it cleared the theater very quickly when it came out. After that, there's a much more fitting country song. The DVD version is pretty good copy. The DVD likewise contains a 15-minute bonus feature called Tucker and Dale ARE Evil, which re-edit version of the film, told from the story from the college kids' point of view that makes Tucker and Dale look like they killed everybody. Overall: Very enjoyable, easy-going horror satire low budget comedy. Oh, hidey-ho, Tuck and Dale had a doozy of a day and it was fun to watch.",8,0,0,8 September 2014
Foxcatcher," It's time to weigh-in on this movie. Is it good? I'm wrestling with that question. It was alright, I guess. It's worth the catch.
","Ripped-from-the headlines, this movie turns real-life events into a compelling psychological portrait of power and class struggle, with Olympic wrestling as a backdrop. It made for a very interesting watch. However, without spoiling the movie, too much, my big problem with the movie is how much of the events, the writers, E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman change for the sake for story-telling. Directed by Bennett Miller, the movie tells the story of Olympic gold medalist wrestler, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his business relationship with billionaire/wrestling enthusiast John Du Pont (Steve Carrell) on their attempt to build a wrestling camp at Pont's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, without the help of Mark's successful brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). However, in real-life, Mark didn't move to Foxcatcher to build a wrestling camp for Du Pont, but instead, Du Pont wanted him to be the assistant coach at Villanova University. Prior to accepting John Du Pont's invitation, Mark had been fired from his assistant coaching position at Stanford. He went to Foxcatcher only to live there in 1986. Also, in real life, Du Pont wanted Mark's brother Dave more than himself. After all, Jon first contacted Dave to coach, who in turn recommended Mark. Another thing, neither of the brothers were living at Foxcatcher, at the same time, like this movie was trying to say. In real life, Mark Schultz left Foxcatcher in 1988 and his brother Dave didn't arrive until 1989. Don't get me wrong, I kinda like this change, as it adds tension between the brothers over the right to coach the Foxcatcher team, but I know, for fact, that there was barely any sibling rivalry. Mark never felt overshadowed by his older brother. In truth, they trained together and really supported each other from a very young age. Both Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo did however, show well that they could handle some tension, while also, showing that they honest do love each other. It made for a very compelling watch. Another thing, the movie add was the sexual tension between Du Pont and Mark. While it was implied by the filmmakers, that some sexual advances did happen between them; nobody for sure, knows, if it did. Mark Schultz has stated out that, while Du Pont and he, indeed did cocaine, together; he didn't have any relationship with John Du Pont, besides business and drug use. However, I found out, by research that Du Pont might not have been as asexual as folks make it out to be. Indeed, John Du Pont was married at one time. His own 1983 marriage dissolve after cases of domestic abuse came into light. Then, there were other abuse cases that was push under the rugs; such was the case of Andre Metzger, a Villanova University wrestling coach who said that he was fired because he had refused Du Pont's homosexual advances and suffer beatings. While, the movie doesn't mention about it. Du Pont indeed had a very close relationship with Bulgarian wrestler, Valentin Jordanov at the time as well; to the point that Jordanov was part of his will, when he died in 2010. While, Valentin wasn't really needed for this part of the story, I just wish, the movie explore more of the business relationship between Jon and Dave. I never really got, the reasons, why Dave was willing to work with Jon, besides feeding his kids. The movie doesn't explore Dave's dream to capture Gold in the 1992 Olympic Games. The film really does gloss over it. Nor does the movie explore the depths of Jon's insanity that much. It was somewhat a letdown for the film, not to show his paranoia. Crazy real-life events like Du Pont sending wrestlers like Kevin Jackson & Trevor Lewis into his attics walls to look for ghosts, using dynamite to destroy a den of fox cubs, driving his car into a pond, twice, or pointing a gun, and burning down, a house to force, wrestler, Dan Chaid out of his house, should had been added to the film. Nor does the movie talk about the amount of hunting that went on, throughout the farm. It really could had add, so much, more thrilling parts, since it deals with weapons. Nor does the movie show that Du Pont's love for swimming, track, and the modern pentathlon. Wrestlers weren't the only athletes to train at Foxcatcher. Where are their stories about Jon Du Pont!? It would make the movie, a lot scarier. Yes, I know that would make the film seem a little more predictable, but the failure to add these, makes the ending with Dave Schultz, seem out of place and forced. Movie should explore Dave's love for the Soviet Union style of living and Jon Du Pont's over-patriotism for America, and Dave wanting to leave Foxcatcher for Stanford more. Despite that, I think Steve Carrell really did a great job in the role. He was very mysterious, prideful and strange, adding a sense of danger with that of eerie melancholy and tragedy detachment to Jon Du Pont's persona. Foxcatcher works because of its three leads. Tatum displays a depth that hasn't been since, his previous undertakings. He really did surprised me, here, both in acting and physical presence. The mirror smashing scene is a great example, as Channing Tatum indeed cut his head open. Talk about dying for your craft. You really do believe that he was a wrestler. The same, goes with Mark Ruffalo in his performance. Both, train hard for these roles. I also love that the real Mark Schultz cameo in this film. Rob Simosen's score is equally as amazing. His score add with the camera work make the ending, so powerful. Although, that ending also, does make UFC look sleazy and low brow. Overall: Aggressively morose, bleak by design. This movie will be an unsettling ride that would wrestle with your soul for days after watching it. Worth watching.",7,0,0,8 October 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," All Hail Caesar! Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a good movie!
","It's pretty hard to beat the original 1968's Planet of the Apes, but Rise of the Planet of Apes was just as entertaining as the original. Directed by Rupert Wyatt, its story is similar to the fourth film in the original series, 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, but it is not a direct remake in that it does not fit into that series' continuity. This movie was intended to act as an origin story for a new series of films. Anybody looking for armor men in ape make up capturing astronauts might want to look somewhere else. The movie is about Will Rodman (James Franco) a scientist at biotechnology lab testing viral-based drug on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Will's boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) terminates the project when things don't go right, and orders the chimps euthanize. Will unable to kill a baby chimp life, save the baby by taking him home; calling him Caesar (Andy Serkis). At the same time, Will's father Charles (John Lithgow), is suffering Alzheimer's disease. After seeing, that Caesar (Andy Serkis) has inherited his mother's high intelligence due to the years of drug testing, Will thinks that his father Charles might be restored to better-than-original cognitive ability if he tested a new drug on him. Things go horrible wrong for Will, as the new drug take a negative effect on the humans. Mid while, Caesar grow smarter every day, questioning the horrible mistreated of apes as test subjects. Seeing the drug as a way out of their caged environment, Caesar use it to raise an army against humanity and on their quest to freedom. Unlike the original movie, in this movie, you have no choice, but to root for the apes. The way they presented it, remind me more of another Charlton Henson movie, 1956's The Ten Commandments. You really go through the mind of Caesar in this film. He is loosely based on the Caesar AKA Milo character from 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and 1973's Battle for the Planet of the Apes of the original series. Not only is Andy Serkis, one of the best CGI model motion capture actors of all times, he gives one hell of a performance as Caesar with his use of body language. The scene where Caesar is pressed against his draw up window wall at the primate shelter is heart breaking. In particular, Caesar's treatment at the primate sanctuary parallels Taylor's treatment as a captive in the original film to the point, you root him as the hero. You slowly see him as a sympathy character that is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard, Dodge (Tom Felton) because of his intelligent to a commanding alpha male looking for united the apes on their march to freedom. The visuals and special effects are great. The CGI apes truly look like apes, but some of their body actions during the action scenes can be bit questionable. Also the speed of the intelligent effects of the drugs on apes seem to be too quick at times. In a few hours, some of them master the art of modern warfare despite none of the apes being expose to that. It's a bit odd that the zoo animals know what even going on, when they haven't been expose to the gas yet. There are lot of Easter eggs or hints to the original movie in the names of the ape and the human characters. Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket and Bright Eyes (both play by Terry Notary), and Buck (Richard Ridings), are names of people that work on the film. Also look for the Charlton Henson's cameo in this movie. For the original film fans, look out for the Icarus mission in the background and listen to all the one-liners, as some are coming from the original film. The human characters acting are good, but blended. Even David Oyelowo's character seem more like a stereotype caricature of a greedy CEO than a real person. Does it have animal rights anti-animal testing message that PETA would love? Yes, but it also show why animal testing is very important to us, as well. If not, by testing animals first, we could unleashed negative effects on human like the film shows. There is a lot of symbolism in this film. Example is like Caesar uses a bundle of sticks to explain to Maurice how an ape alone is weak but apes together are strong. There is a great shot that represented this. The 4 leaders of the ape rebellion are shown standing upright on the roof of a trolley car. Their upright posture and the ascent give metaphoric connotation to the film's title as all of them representation of the 4 different dominant ape species (Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Gorilla, and Bonobo) united. Thus the bundle of sticks, or fasces, was a symbol of authority in ancient Rome, the origin of Caesar's name. It's a fascism statement that get even more chilling when you think of the Coba character. Coba is often known as the code word for Joseph Stalin. This movie mirrors a lot of George Orwell's Animal Farm with its allegoric politic message. The ending was a bit disappointing as there is no big twist like the original. It was pretty predictable. If you saw the trailer, you saw the picture. Nothing new by the end. At less, its post credit set up the sequel 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Overall: there is some minor mistakes, but it's a good film. I would gladly pay to see its sequel.",8,7,11,5 January 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Infinity War is a Comic Book Triumph. Everything nearly assembled flawlessly.
","Ever since Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; they have been on a blockbuster roll, with their comic book movies. Their Cinematic Universe lead by producer, Kevin Feige has introduces countless amounts of superheroes and their stories to vary amounts of success. In return, every standalone & 'Avengers' assemble movie, the studio had made, has been built up to lead up to an all-encompassing climatic arch, in which big villain, Thanos (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) will one day, come to control the universe, through the use of six powerful infinity stones. Most of those films in their Phrase One & Two, kinda work, as they help push the apocalypse doom subplot, in a somewhat foreshadowing constant rate. However somewhere, in Marvel Studios Phrase 3 film campaign, that story thread began to lose some ground, as more popular & recent Marvel Comic story elements were put in the foreground like 'Civil War' & 'World War Hulk'. Because of that, it really felt, like Thanos threats of worlds domination storyline was not only coming at snail pace, but simply, delay, more and more, in order to milk more cash out of establish standalone films. Not only, was this decision, causing, doubt that this assemble movie would ever get release, but it was also, making people, wonder, if the film can be possible to be made. Finally, in 2017, we got our answer, as one of the biggest & the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken start to take shape with screenwriter, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors, Anthony & Joe Russo with their crew on hand, shooting back to back with a direct sequel. In 2018, on the ten year anniversary of the Studios first cinematic universe movie 2008's 'Iron Man', 'Avenger: Infinity War' was finally released to the public. Without spoiling the 19th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too much, it did live up to the hype as one of the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. It was somewhat accurate to the first half of the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic book story, written by Jim Starlin, minus the absence of some key characters, like Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer and Mistress Death. Hopefully, they are in 2019 sequel. As for length. For 3 hour film, it was also surprisingly, well-paced. However, there were some really confusing exposition dump parts in the film that seem really odd. It seem like the movie cut a lot of sequences. One of them, involving the Nova Corp & the Power Stone, and the other, concerning the Soul Stone & Thanos's daughters. This also, includes the after credit ending, with the hints to Captain Marvel. Those parts really did seem like to come out of left field. Despite that, while, the movie does jump around, a lot; every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on many amazing heroic characters having to deal with such devastating stakes, in their own unique ways. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. It's also truly unique, in how well, the writers, fully introduced the villain with all the heroic characters, having to deal with him, one way or another. The screenwriters really did flesh out, Thanos from a cartoony over the top, out there simpleton baddie, into a believable down to earth, well verse, complex nemesis through his fatherhood subplot. Not only that, but Brolin's acting is so commanding, that he really seem like a serious threat with his voice. It was a huge improvement, since his last appearance. He's the best Marvel villain, yet. Even as a special effect character, Thanos kinda moves as if he's really there. The only scene, that kinda look fake with him, was, in the beginning, when he was choking out, a character. As for the good guys, the CGI suits on Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) & Spiderman (Tom Holland) could had look a little more realistic. It was given off, a 2011's 'Green Lantern' vibe. Other than that, all the action scenes with them, and the other CGI characters such as Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) were compelling enough to overlook the CGI spot fest. As for full make up performers like Dave Bautista (Drax), Karen Gillian (Nebula) and Zoe Saldana (Gamora). They did well in their scenes. As for Paul Bettany's acting was alright as Vision, but his makeup, was still a bit off. As for live action performers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) & Starlord (Chris Pratt) and others. Every performer in this movie did a great job in their action scene & their acting. Even, the Stan Lee & Peter Dinklage cameo was great. I have no complains about that. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of laugh out loud moments for a surprisingly dark film. As for the depressing bittersweet ending. I love it! While, a lot of diehard fans and young children might find, this climax to be upsetting. Just note, to take it, with a grain of salt. It's a comic book movie. There is always, going to be some kind of McGuffin or Ex Machina to bring them back. I just glad, Disney took the risk, rarely than play it safe. It was broad to subvert expectations. Overall: The movie was an exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more. In the end, 'Avengers: Infinity War' ranks among the best adventures, we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. I can't wait for the next movie. I highly recommended seeing this.",9,3,7,5 May 2018
JFK," Paranoid conspiracy theorists will love this movie, while other will see it as grotesque falsification and distortion of a national tragedy.
","JFK is a political thriller film directed by Oliver Stone that gives up an interesting account on why President John F. Kennedy was assassination in Dallas, TX in Nov. 22, 1963. While, the events leading up to the true real life event is still a mystery and the facts gather up on the case wouldn't be disclose until 2017 and 2029. Oliver Stone gives us his take on what happen, why and how the government might be covering it up in the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). From all the assassination conspiracy theories out there ranging from Mafia connections to Cuba exiles, Oliver Stone picked up one that is a bit outlandish to base his movie around. Oliver Stone largely based his movie on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book 'On the trail of the Assassins'. Jim Garrison's story first off, wasn't a real good choice for a movie. The movie does take a big dramatic license in this story. Stone's depictions of Garrison is that of a fearless seeker of truth who seeking revenge out on New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) to assassinate Kennedy. In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted Shaw in conspiracy so vase it's hard to believe. While other critics might see this as all a misrepresentation of the truth, in my opinion, I really have doubts that this conspiracy theory really happen, but it might had. I'm more open to seeing this movie, than a lot of people, but still can't comprehend the uneven 'facts' the movie is projecting. It didn't help that years later, science would prove most of these claims to be unrealistic. The state-of-the-art forensic and computer analysis of the assassination since 1991, clearly shows that Oswald might had acted alone. All the findings have been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both hits- the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. It's hard to think that Oswald was part of a conspiracy as he was known before the event as a loose-cannon. Oswald was originally trying to kill a general that day, not the president. The film says he was poor marksman, but in real life, he was quite good in his markings. About, Jack Ruby's action were a bit driven by his passion for the president. He did it for revenge. It's hard to think a strip club owner Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray) was part of a conspiracy even if he was part of the Mafia. In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the 'magic bullet' on a hospital gurney. The biggest out there claim the film has is the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'état to kill Kennedy. Ouch. The idea of that is preposterous in 1991 as it is today, as Lyndon pretty much had no reason to kill Kennedy and Stone knew it. The movie explains Kennedy was assassinated because his foreign policy would have meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex, and enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. This is hardly the case, as Kennedy was indeed one of the men that help the build-up of the military during the Cold War and help put the space race into play that made more profit than ever before. I had study the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations to the best of my ability, and I just can't find myself, putting Clay Shaw with John F. Kennedy together. The movie also takes some information accounts from Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission's fictional myth. What the movie does so well, is mixing the real life footage with that of the fictionist story as it looks like a veneer of documentary verisimilitude. No wonder, why the film won best editing and cinematography at the Academy Awards. Before the age of the internet, this was the first time, I have ever saw the brutal Zapruder footage. It was really was intense. It's really hard to tell, what is real and what isn't when watching this film. The acting in this cast was really good. The length of the movie is pretty hard to get through if not a history buff. Its 3 hours long, and most of the movie is talking. . It's even worst in the Director's Cut version as there is nearly 54 minutes worth of deleted and expanded scenes. It was a bit too long and excessively detailed. It could be more concise. Overall: a lot of people still believe that JFK die in a conspiracy theory matter. So this movie will continue to find an audience wanting to know more about the event.",7,4,13,25 November 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Light! Camera! Action! Is it this film watchable? Yes, but this film's limelight is not so bright.
","Although, the 9th motion picture from writer director Quentin Tarantino was hyped up as retelling of the infamous Manson family murders of Aug 1969, it really isn't the main focus. There isn't even one mention of the Beach Boys or Helter Skelter. In truth, 'Once a Time in Hollywood' shines a spotlights on the trials and tribulations of show business, by following the story of a washed up TV cowboy, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) on his pursuit to manage his fame and fortune during late 1960s. Without spoiling the movie too much, while, there is no business like show business. The movie could had been a little bit better. Some parts of the 2 hour and 41 minute runtime didn't quite dominated the red carpet or kept my eyes on the screen. Much of the film's flaws come from the fact that there isn't much of an uphill struggle for Rick to stay on top. It's not like he lost a lot of money, associates or gain a dangerous nearly deadly level of substance abuse during the majority of the movie. He's still living a pretty good life in a lap of luxury with friends like stunt performer Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Because of that, I really couldn't get too invested in his side of the story. Don't get me wrong, Leo is fine in the role, but maybe an older more season actor could had made the 'Lancer' arch scenes seem visually a little more powerful to me. Plus, it would make more sense in story, why, Dalton is so traditional when it comes to change. Another thing that bugs me is that Booth & Dalton rarely have any conflict or disagreements with each other, as Cliff is way too pretty easy going with his boss. I was hoping for, at least, one skirmish, in which, the conservative Dalton would get a little mad at Cliff for his counterculture lifestyle & connection with the Manson family. Sadly, we don't even see that. As there is little conflict between him and the main villains. As for Booth, while he has a good amount of screen time, the character rarely has much of a story in this, besides laziest introduce us to the villains in the third act. In truth, the movie would work best if Tarantino establish and focus more on the relationship between Booth & the family a lot earlier in the film. It really could had save time, rather than having him aimlessly go around doing errands and feeding his dog. Because of that, I felt Booth was a little bit underused. To added to that, while Pitt was great in the role. The part should had gone to somebody a bit younger. Why, because it would make Booth's feelings for the hippie culture, a more believable & complex. It would allow a really needed boost in drama. How great the movie could had been if Booth saw both Dalton & Charles Manson (Damon Herriman) as father-figures; each with their own views on how to live life and gain notoriety. It would had make a great dilemma. Sadly, this never came. Subplot like the rumors about him, murdering his wife goes nowhere & his fight with an over the top negative portrayal of Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) really doesn't add much. To make it worst, there is really no connection between the fictional versions of actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) with Booth or Dalton besides living on the same road. You would think, in story, they would be friends, or had work together in the past. Sadly, we don't get that. Because of that, the Sharon Tate scenes like her going around shopping and watching her movies didn't really mashed well with the main plot. It felt like time waster. The movie could had made her move to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting a little more a challenging endeavor. It would intercut much better with the scenes where Dalton is trying stay on top; much in the same vein as the 'A Star is Born' films (1937-2018). Regardless, I do like the over the top 2009 'Inglorious Basterds' like altered history changing ending, somewhat. I just wish they went all the way, by killing all the Manson members. It kinda stinks that Charles didn't mean his end in a gruesome matter. Nor did they mention anything about the murders of LaBianca family or Gary Hinman. As exploitative and jarring as the whole sequence can be, none of the scenes didn't felt disrespectful to the real life victims. However, the action in this film does not have the masterful building of suspense of Tarantino's other movies. It lack focus. The same goes to the many mishmash of styles. The blockbuster CGI is jarring and in certain scenes, hurts to see, such as Leo's awkward photo shop input in the 1963 'the Great Escape'. The comedy is a bit lackluster as many of the jokes fell flat for me. The sex factor is really awkward with all those foot fetish shots. Even the storytelling is sporadic and randomly with poorly plan time jumps. The inserted narration from Kurt Russell as Randy, a stunt director is also way out of the blue. Besides the set pieces, the acting, pop culture references and music. It's still sadly not well made. Overall: The 1960s version of the television show 'Entourage' has little rewatch value for me. It was too little over the place for my taste. However, what do I know! For others. They say it's worth checking time and time again. So go seek it out if you haven't watch it. Just note, the film might not have that movie magic, fanatics of this flick were talking about. It not quite a Hollywood Icon.",7,9,13,20 August 2019
Gone Girl," Amazing Amy has gone it! Gone Girl has gone to great lengths to make a really good thriller.
","Ben Affleck's new Chasing Amy is a great 'who-Dunne-it' thriller! It's one of the better films, I saw this year. There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold. The film tells the story of a man, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) whom returns home on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to find out, that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. What follows is a mystery full of twist and turns that would leave you, breathless. Director David Fincher and author Gillian Flynn really makes that connection. Amazing use of unreliable narration, plot twists, satire humor and suspense. While, the movie may looks like a Lifetime Movie of the week on the surface, the movie is way smarten written. It really go depth into exploring the psychology and the dynamic of a long term relationship. You really get the dark side of marriage through the use of lying, deceit, manipulation, and dissatisfaction. Not only that, but I love how much the movie really parody the media coverage of murder crimes such as HLN's Nancy Grace. Nancy Grace is known to jump the gun at times, when there is a high case victim allegation. A good example of these are the 2006's Duke Lacrosse case and the defamation of innocent suspect Richard Ricci in the 2002 Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case. She really often blames suspects for their crimes, with little to no prove of them, committing it. You really get the sense of defamation, and dishonesty that comes with being put in a media frenzy where suspicions are running wild. You really can see how Nick Dunne's awkward behavior could be interpreted as characteristic of a sociopath. This is Ben Affleck's best work in a long time. Still, the best acting is in the movie is indeed Rosamund Pike. She is just insidious throughout the movie. Very creepy performance. She will probably be in the 2014 Best Actress Oscar contender for sure. The supporting cast is a hit and miss. Normally awful characters actors like Tyler Perry & Missi Pyle are just god-awful, but in this movie for some reason, they gave their best acting to date. They were very entertaining. At the same time, other semi good actors seem a bit disappointing like Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-lover Desi Collings & Kim Dickens as Detective Rhonda Boney. Harris looks and sounds more awkward than creepy. Very unlike his character in the novel. Harris even admits that his scenes were some of the hardest things he's ever shot. For Kim Dickens, she sounds more like a country bumpkin than a smart detective. Nick and Margo's parents aren't given nearly as much focus in the film. Adding the misogynist father would be a little boost to the plot. Once again, very unlike the character from the book. How Faithful Is David Fincher's Gone Girl to the novel? Without spoiling too much of the movie and book, the whole third act is new, but still have the same character arch. Author Gillian Flynn whom help with the screenplay, wrote a new esoteric happy ending for the film. It's by far, a better ending than the book. I really didn't like the whole memoirs idea from the book, anyways. There were a few missing characters and clues from the book, that wasn't in the film, but for the most part, those things weren't really needed. The movie is more brutal in the violence than the book. The whole sex scene remind me of 1991's Basic Instinct at times. I love the symbolism of the movie/book. Gone Girl is a story about puppet shows. Somebody is pulling the strings on the other, forcing their hands. Punch and Judy dolls are used throughout the film. Another one worth notice, is the board games in the beginning of the film. Mastermind & Life are used as background props as Nick talks about his anniversary to his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon). I love how the 'Amazing Amy' children books are foreshadowing the events to come. You really see how truth and illusion are woven into the fabric of the plot. You don't know, what's real and what's not about Amy's past. It also show, how foolish people are to only look at complex things in a simple one-dimensional childhood black & white matter. I love the word play within Amy's romantic treasure hunt for their fifth anniversary that has double meaning. It seems like romantic charming quest, but like everything else related to Amy: it's two-sided. One side is sweet and charming, while the other is insidious and vengeful. Amy is a wolf in sheep's clothing to the worst degree. I love the whole 'Cool Girl' speech. The Cool Girl speech has divided feminists over whether Amy is making a good point about women not changing themselves to fit the ideals of men or whether she's just condemning women who don't fit her ideal of what is proper behavior. Some critics might view the film as misogynist or misandrist. I have to say the movie is both. Both main characters are not good people. So, in every way, both shouldn't be viewed as a hero figure. What I love about this movie is how much, it change the genre. Here, instead of the psycho ruining the perfect wife's life, the perfect wife is the psycho. There were some things that the movie could had work on, better. It could had work on, more on the idea of how economy affairs marriage. I rarely see it in the film. Another would be fixing a few loose ends of the script as some of the prep ups seem kinda unrealistic. The movie is beautiful shot. The Eerie electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sound a bit generic. It's a disappointment that it doesn't stand out. Overall: A well-made film that would end up as 2014 Oscar Contenders for sure. A must watch.",9,4,14,16 October 2014
Django Unchained," When I heard about this movie it had my curiosity, but now, it haves my attention
","The movie isn't a Western. The film starts out in pre civil war South, several male slaves are chained and being transported. Among the slaves is Django play by Jamie Foxx who has been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The slave owners then encounter Dr. King Schultz play by Christoph Waltz, a German immigrant dentist and bounty hunter. Schultz takes Django from them revealing that he sought out Django to aid him in identifying the Brittle brothers, a trio of ruthless killers. The two come to an agreement: in exchange for helping locate the Brittles, Schultz will free Django from slavery and help him get his wife Broomhilda from the current owner Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie by posing as potential buyers of a Mandingo slave fighter. The reason Dr, Shultz helped Django is because he was moved by his story and felt obligated to help because of the German legend of Siegfried and Broomhilda. Schultz would introduces Django as a free man and an expert on Mandingo fighting. Django raises the suspicions of Candie's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who correctly deduces that Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the Mandingo sale is a ruse. A lot of films inspiration Quentin Tarantino to make this movie. One inspiration for the film is Sergio Corbucci's Django, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo in this film. Other inspiration are the 1970's films Mandingo, and the Great Silence. The costumes of the film were also references from works such as Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting Blue Boy, 'Big Daddy' Don Johnson Miami Vice white vanilla suit, King Schultz's Kojak like chinchilla coat, Broomhilda's Ida Galli's dress style from Blood for a Silver Dollar and Calvin Candie's costume came partly from Rhett Butler from 1930's Gone of the Wind. Quentin also has a kicking soundtrack, ranging from Elisa Toffoli 'Ancora Qui', Beethoven's Fur Elise, Dies Irae from Verdi's Requiem to modern hits from Tupac, John Legend, & Rick Ross. I can do without the Rick Ross. Rick is an overweight, rapping, misogynist who raps about gang violence and drug sales that has nothing to do with slavery. Few of the rap songs that played kind of took my brain out of the time period. For me, in terms of dialogue, it outmatches even Pulp Fiction, it's not just clever and ironic, it's gripping and brilliantly paced. One of the best dialogue scenes focus on Calvin Candie with the skull talking to both Dr. Shultz and Django. Like Dr. Schultz, I Couldn't Resist finding out that, when Leo punches the table & breaks the glass, he actually gashed his hand open while filming that scene and just kept going. You could tell that Kerry was taken aback when he wiped the blood all over her face. It was his real bloody hand. The acting is brilliant. Waltz and Dicaprio outdid themselves. The blood and violence can be over the top at times. The violence was gawdy, the squibs used were over the top, even for a gory movie, its a caricature of his passed films, in a very horrible manner. Jamie Foxx as Django was OK as the hero, but I felt the character became way too dark in the end of the film. Not only he lost most of his humanity when Dr. Shutlz force him to kill the farmer, but also bossing around the other slaves. Honestly, I know it's a cover within Candyland, but it's seems Ray Charles was just there to shot white people in the face in revenge show in the film by killing Candie's sister. Also with enough bullets, you can get what you want. Like freedom, equality, and slight remnants of civil liberties. Martin Luther King's civil disobedience doesn't go anywhere. I felt that to be wrong message being sent out. Django true enemy is Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen. Pure gold in funny one liners, Jackson stole the show as the character is so damn racist. Stephen is an angrily self hating black man, whom disassociates himself from other African American. The Uncle Tom character in this film. Some people have complained about it saying the 'N' word too much, but I have to imagine back then it was just a commonplace word; I didn't feel like the movie was using it excessively or in poor taste. Still, I'd say that Tarantino was actually uncharacteristically sensitive to race in this film. I reject criticize that it disrespects black ancestors because it has some comic elements. On the contrary, I believe that it is the lack of discussion about horrors of slavery that hurts black history. I think more slavery movie should be made and Tarantino somewhat brings light to a sour subject here. There were scenes in the movie that gave audience members a hard time to take in and somewhat painful to watch. Firstly, that is not a slavery movie, but a love story and a western spaghetti that occurred during slavery time, it's might seem like a pro black film, but it's for real moviegoers who love stories. Quentin was dynamite directing and writing this. This movie was a montage of everything you would ever want in a movie. It's three hours long, but it's go through you fast. If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it.",9,3,7,24 January 2013
Get Out," This horror movie is worth getting out to see! It's mind-blowing!
","Pour some milk and get yourself, a bowl of Froot Loops, because it's time to go to the sunken place. Written and directed by Jordan Peele; 'Get Out' chronicles a 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' series of unfortunate creepy twist and turns, that befall a good-hearted, an African American photographer, Christopher Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), while visiting his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams)'s family in rural America. Without spoiling this satire/horror movie, too much; the film was a massive success; financial and critical. It even won awards. Not bad for a first time director. Still, as good as this film is, it's not without some flaws. The biggest one, is how it portray, all Caucasian people in the film as untrustworthy evil buffoons. Don't get me wrong, people should remember, the harm cause by racialized slavery and unequal social status, in which ethnocentrism, somewhat create; however, this film felt a little too reverse racism. After all, the film's controversial, negative prejudices is somewhat, discouraging minority groups from intermixing cultures, by ridicule their peers for engaging in behaviors perceived to be characteristic of white society. In truth, it isn't a betrayal of culture, by wanting to get into an interracial relationship nor should it be warned. All, this is doing is creating various expressions of hostility or indifference toward one race; which isn't good; as there should be, any animosity between races. It was a huge mistake, not having one decent light-skin person in this film. It fueling a negative stereotype of a certain race. Another problem with this piece, is how, it didn't take full advance on making some of the villains, a little more believable. All that backstory of them, belonging to an ancient secret society descended from the Knights Templar; trying to seeking eternal life promised by the Holy Grail, and finally achieved it with the Coagula procedure, wasn't really needed, nor was it explain well. In short, it should had been cut down. After all, a little mystery is better than over explaining it. Another problem, with the film is how the villains talk. I get that, Peele was going with something, very creepy, in the way, the 'Stepford' type-characters, robotic talked & how, out of touch, these elderly characters are to certain dialect, slang, and gesture. Nevertheless, it come across as too jarring; because these folks, should know, everything, how young minorities should act. After all, the film's concept is built upon, the notion, that they're obsess with black culture. So, seeing them, not know; certain simple things, like the word, 'snitch' or the gesture, fist bump, makes them, look clueless than sinister. Also, the way, they act, gave away the big twist toward the end, way too soon. Much of the twist and turns of this film, are pretty easy to predict. Despite that, the movie does make great use of most of the language that they were going for, through the use of double meaning & calls backs. Scenes like Rose talking to the police & Chris talking about Judo shows that. Even seemly out of place comedy scenes with supporting character, Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery) felt like it deserve, another watch; even if it's not that funny, as it shows, maybe the cops are not as incompetent as it looks. It is intricate part of the movie's fabric. Howery still gave, a great performance, regardless. The same with the other performers like Betty Gabriel, Catherine Keener, Lakeith Stanfield & Allison Williams. They all gave deeply unsettling performances. As for the main lead, Kaluuya delivers a very compelling dramatic performance. I do like the character arc that Chris goes through, even if it's not much. Seeing him, come from, observe type-victim to a more, hand-on survivor is somewhat believable. Nevertheless, some of the aspect of Chris's character, should had touched upon, a little bit better, such as his addicted to cigarettes. That concept really has no pay-off. As for him, being a skill photographer; it does pay off for him in the end, however, it does beg, the question, why he was chosen in the first place. After all, it seems like camera flashes, apparently undoes the procedure, at least temporarily. So, why risk it? Well, the only thing, I can gather, is that the villains, didn't know of that. Still, even if you roll with that, why did they still go with the surgery, knowing full-well, that the beneficiary, deals in the photography industry!? It just doesn't make sense. It's going to fail; like having a much older brain in a younger body. It really not as sound, as the film makes it out to be. After all, where is the other victims? Maybe, not all the brain transfer doesn't actually work. Regardless of that, I still like the deer in the headlight, metaphor toward cultural appropriation. By exploring 'the bystander effect' it make for an incredible experience. Nevertheless, some of the key moments that led off to action scenes could had been better explained; such as why Rose's photos, were just lying around, and why the girlfriend could not hear, all the noise, happening downstairs, while she was in her room. Despite that, the movie had assured fine rhythms, great camera placements, and amazing editing. Barely any sloppy shaky-cam work or dumb jump-scares here. Even, the alternate depressing endings were powerful. Still, I kinda glad, they went with this one. It's more crowd-pleasing. As for the music by composer, Michael Abels. 'Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga' AKA Swahili whispering, 'Redbone' by Childish Gambino, & 'Run Rabbit Run' by Flanagan and Allen; it really does adds to atmosphere of the film. Overall: 'Get Out' is more than just a standard-issue horror movie, this brutal, smart film is impeccably made, as well as surprising, shocking, and funny, while also offering a compassionate, thoughtful look at race, without getting too preachy or heavy-handed. It's a must watch. Definitely go see this movie. After all, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.",8,28,56,21 February 2018
Drive," Drive is worth the ride. It's an amazing movie.
","Life is like a bumpy road. After a while, you just have to learn to drive on it. 2011's 'Drive' shows that. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, and based on a 2005 novel of the same name by author James Sallis. The movie tells the story of a mysterious nameless getaway driver for robberies (Ryan Gosling), trying hard to get away from the criminal enterprise that he stuck in, as a Hollywood stunt car driver. He sees his chance of a new life, when he fall in love, with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). However, Irene's ex con-husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) own a large debt to some dangerous mobsters, Nino (Ron Perlman) & Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks), that puts everything that the driver is hoping for, in jeopardy. Can, the driver live a quiet, simple, peaceful life, or will his dreams be shatter by the harsh reality of a life of crime? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, the first thing, most people notice about this film, is the lack of car chases. After all, you would think, a movie call 'drive', would be full of action scenes like that. The trailers give the impression that the film is a straight car chase thriller similar to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious', when it actually features quite a lot of quiet drama scenes sprinkled amongst the bone-crunching violence. One woman even try to sue because she didn't receive the movie, she wanted. Instead, the movie is more focus on the character development of Ryan Gosling's character, from isolated bad guy to a man trying to be the hero, despite being driven to a life of crime. You see this, with the film metaphor of the famous 'frog and the scorpion' fable, in how it relates to his associates. No wonder, why he wears that cool neon scorpion jacket, all of the time as if he's a frog. I like the director approached to a typically American crime genre with its silence, but deadly Euro-chic sensibility and style. He paints a very realistic picture of grimy landscape of dark, neo-noir, seedy underbelly of the modern LA with his mise-en-scene style. From his amazing shots, and lighting, comes a great impression of what characters are thinking, without the mastery of a lot of dialogue. While, some people might see that, as somewhat boring to see, two people stare blankly at each other in long cuts, both in romanticism and in crime drama. In my opinion, there is no better, example of great use of that, then the surrealistic scene in the elevator. It's really shows, the complexity of light of hope versus dark of destruction, all while maintaining the consistent mood, tone, and look of the film, until the climactic end, which furthermore, spark the audience member to think, even if 2012's direct sequel novel 'Driven', kinda spoils it. It is not often that a filmmaker is able to do that. The film's soundtrack is also amazing with electropop songs like 'Nightcall' by Kavinsky & 'A Real Hero' by College & Electric Youth. A mix of earnest '80s-synth-inspired tunes and original pieces by composer, Cliff Martinez were also worth listening to. Drive also has the ability to be one of those movies that reminds us of other movies like 1963's 'Scorpio Rising', 1967's 'Point Blank', 1968's 'Bullitt', 1978's 'The Driver', 1981's 'Thief' and others. Yet overall, I thought the film was less about making direct homages than blending its influences together into fascinating hybrids. So, it was no surprised to see the movie being set in Los Angeles. There is also theories online about the film, being a spiritual sequel to 2012's film, 'The Place beyond the Pines'. Anyways, I enjoyed Ryan Gosling's enigmatic, messiah complex, type of a character. He has the right amount of graceful swagger and sex appeal to pull off, a character, that look tough and sinister, but also has a bit of a heart, while speaking fewer than twenty full sentences. I like how the film didn't spoil his mysterious character, outright like the novel, did. There's a moment past the midway point of the film in which his character looks at Mulligan's Irene with a mixture of self-awareness and confusion as if he was a small child, who knew he upset somebody. It's the expression of a man who knows he's a shark and wonders if he can be a good one, without speaking one word. Gosling and Mulligan have an incredible chemistry, which is impressive when you consider how little they actually speak to each other. Each actor manages to say more with a glance or an awkward smile than most do with pages worth of dialogue to work with. Still, I wish, the movie would had hired a Hispanic actress for the role as Irina, as it would focus the book, more. Despite that, Mulligan does a wonderful job. So, it was little lost. Albert Brooks is also wonderful. He achieves a level of intimidating menace that hasn't really been seen from him before. Ron Perlman is reliable as ever, but not as memorable as Brooks. Maybe, because he's more typecast as these types of a role. Bryan Cranston effortlessly applies a lot of heart to his supporting role as Driver's boss and loyal friend, Shannon. Behind Brooks, he's probably the second most memorable supporting character in the film. Overall: I have to say, the excellent synth-pop soundtrack, great performances and the juxtaposition of beauty and shocking violence, ensure that Drive will become an instant cult-classic for years to come. It's a must-watch for any fan of neo-noir. Highly recommended.",8,4,5,29 June 2016
The Theory of Everything," This movie show a brief history of Stephen Hawking's time and it was pretty good. Where, there is life, there is hope.
","2014 was a big year for ALS awareness. You got videos of the ice bucket challenge that went viral, and then you got movies like this, becoming a huge success. The Theory of Everything really showcase how ALS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA Lou Gehrig's disease really damage the body. It doesn't shy away. While the movie is depressing in that limelight. It's also show how uplifting and inspiring people are, when they face that problem. No matter how grave the diagnosis that the main character receives, he doesn't let it get in the way of what he wants to do with his life and work, thanks in large part to his support system. Directed by James Marsh, and adapted by Anthony McCarten. The movie is based on Stephen Hawking's ex-wife, Jane Wilde's second memoir, 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen', which focuses on the more positive sides of their relationship than the less flattering memoir, 'Music to Move the Stars'. That memoir provided part of the basis for the 2004 BBC TV movie Hawking starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The filmmakers behind The Theory of Everything felt best if they portray Hawking, in a better light. This might be good for the film, as it doesn't show, much of Hawking's dark side, but it can also be a fault, because it makes him seem least than human, and more saint-like. Anyways, the movie tells the story of Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) over the years. The movie moves in very good pace. It opens up during their time studying at Cambridge in the 1960s, move to the struggle that Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde had to deal with ALS, and finally climax, with Stephen Hawking's biggest success in physics, when he release his book, 'A Brief History of Time' in the early 1990s. The first half is robotic, force, slow and cliché, but it's the second half that really makes the film, very interesting. It was very thought-provoking and one of the few movies that had a good objective love triangle. While, the movie plot is predictable, there were some scene that really did shock me that I didn't know, about the man. The acting from both Eddie Redmayne as Hawkings and his co-star, Felicity Jones as his wife were very good. In the wrong hands and the wrong actors, it could easily gone sour, with a cartoony approach to Hawking and unlikeable presence for his wife, Jane. Redmayne really got Hawking's mannerism down. It was very believable that he would transformation to what Hawking is today. Even, the real life Stephen Hawking love Redmayne's performance in this biopic based on his life. Like Hawking, Jane Wilde was amazed to see that Jones had incorporated her mannerisms and speech patterns into her performance. She was very impressed. The movie made the audience feel sympathy to what Jane was going through and it's sad, how apart, they became, over the years. The movie deals with rough topics from everything from marital discord, infidelity, and near-death experiences. The movie kinda digs into Hawking's studies, but it never truly goes into a huge detail discussion about it. I hardly remember anything say about black holes in this film. I believe the movie couldn't had work if they did. It's better off, for a documentary to tackle that subject, than a film like this. It would turn most people off, from the main story. The movie kinda downplays Hawking's strong atheist beliefs. The topic of God is only mention, a few time throughout the film, so that they can attract, both religionist and non-religion viewers. It kinda makes sense. Also, at the time, in which the settling of the film is set, Hawking still believe that the universe is governed by the laws of science, created by a God, but God does not intervene to break the laws, but as recent as 2011, he restate himself, that he believe no God, because there was no time before the big bang, and with no time, there cannot be a God. One of the best things about the film, is the music that covers it. The movie is very accuracy to Stephen Hawking's life, with only a few minor changes to his life. A good example is like how he found out that he was diagnosed with ALS. The real Stephen Hawking feel the movie is accurate enough to his life. The film still is met with mostly positive reviews and it will indeed go on to win a few awards in film festivals. Overall: An excellent film with an astonishingly good transformative lead performance. A must-watch.",8,0,0,8 February 2015
Frozen," Frozen is pretty cool. I love it 'snow' much!
","This movie was pretty good musical. Indeed, this movie reminds me of 2003's Broadway play musical Wicked on ice very much. It even has the actress, Idina Menzel from Wicked in this film, playing a similar character. Not only does it has a similar character to another musical, but the movie somewhat reminds me of other Disney princess films. It did kept with the Disney's princess movies formula, with a few changes in the end. This movie was always wanted to be made by Walt Disney as he always love Hans Christian Andersen's work. At first in the 1940's, there were going to do a bio pic of the poet with the company MGM. Disney was going to do the animated sequences of the bio-pic that feature his works such as the Snow Queen which Frozen is loosely based on. The only problem is that there is not much of a kid friendly story in Snow Queen that they could adapt to the young audiences due to its dark subject matter about complicated relationship of good and evil as experienced by a little boy and girl, Kay and Gerda at Spitsbergen. The poet had scary images of devils, hell and trolls that would scare little children. Plus, the movie had a lot of religion symbolism that a younger audience wouldn't get. It wasn't until early 2010's, a kid friendly version came around, and the 3D movie finally came alive by Director Chris Buck & writer Jennifer Lee. In this version, the movie is more about sisterhood. Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) is struggling with her ice powers, and the protagonist Anna (Kristen Bell) try to help her while Elsa is trying to protect her from herself. After a big fight about Anna wanting to marry a man, she just met, Elsa accident put her kingdom of Arendelle. Indeed, Frozen was frozen for a very long time. I have to say, when they did thawed it out, they did a good job, but the film version has little to do with the original works by Hans Christian Andersen's work. I'm glad, they didn't make the Snow Queen into the villain, but when the true villain does come up ¾ into the film, it does seem badly executed or out of the blue. Idina Menzel did great as the Snow Queen as she really does seem royal. Kristen Bell did a great job. I always love her singing voice since her work in 2005's Reefer Madness the Musical. It does sucks that not a lot of people heard her voice until now. Anna is an OK character. It's seem like her own exist, centered around being beautiful and getting a man. At less, it's show the warnings of falling in love, way too soon without understanding who you're trying to marry. The supporting cast was great. I have to find Olaf (Josh Gad) as cute. He wasn't annoying at all. I love Oaken (Chris Williams) as he reminds me so much of Peggy from the Discover Card commercials. I like Sven & Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), they remind me of Chewbecca and Han Solo from 1977's Star Wars. I adore the Norwegian mythology theme here. I like how they hint Christmas with this movie with Kristoff. He reminds me of Santa Claus because he delivers things in a sleigh pulled by a reindeer in the winter. Hans (Santino Fontana) seems kinda out of place if you think about it. I don't know, you can give temporary power to your kingdom to a foreign diplomat prince? Second off, if he really wanted to be king. Why didn't take power there? It's doesn't make any sense. The musical score was just amazing. The open music score was just epic with Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim's Eatnemen Vuelie with kulning was great. This song contains elements of the traditional Sámi singing style joik. I love the Norwegian music choir. The music was pretty good, but in my opinion, none of them really stand out due to its simplistic. Even 'Let it go' looks and sounds like any other Disney coming to age song. 'Snowman' was cute, but often cut up for small dramatic or comedy visuals. I didn't like how the movie blitzs you with song after song. It gets a little bit annoying. The animation for the film was great despite some really odd animation mistakes with the body parts going through other things or the figures not showing shadows. In some scenes, such as the bad bed hair was just amazing to see on film, while others such as Elsa singing, and her hair somehow go through her arm was badly done. I just can't believe, the animators didn't notice, that towards the end of the movie, when Kristoff is holding Anna in his arms, his thumb passes through her torso for a moment. It's pretty minor, but gees, I just wish the animators took their time retouching some scenes. The visual effects were just beautiful. The 3D really did work out with computer-generated fjords and ice. It really did seem like it was coming at you. I like how the ice is symbolism by good and bad by its color. Whenever, Elsa use the ice powers for good, it's visually blue. Then, when ever, Elsa use the ice powers for bad, its looks red like a subtle hell-like imagery. I also love the idea of foreshadowing like how Anna talks to Joan of Arc painting. Joan of Arc was condemned of sorcery like how Elsa is being witch hunt. I like how three of the supporting characters are name after the author. Frozen is PG, but in my opinion, it's pretty safe movie for G audience. I don't think snowman being their head cut off is disturbing. The movie is overall good, with minor faults, too little that nobody will really care, because the story carries the film. Frozen will thawed your heart. It's worth the watch.",8,4,9,20 December 2013
2012," Like the Mayans, this film fails to pretend 2012 right.
","The plot to this is real simple -it's the end of the world. In 2009's 2012 solar flares from the sun are melting the earth from the inside-out, causing massive earthquakes, tsunamis, & everything you can think can happen in any disaster movie happens here. It's the mother of all disaster movies. Director Roland Emmerich provides us with a couple of poorly developed cookie-cutter meat-bags to experience the action with, as they continue to run away from while figuring out how to live throughout the disasters. Roland Emmerich's movies tend to have the same formulas to his films. Too much characters in a film that the audience rarely cares about. 2012s narrative is told from two points of view: those who know about the cataclysmic events that await the earth and those who remain in the dark. At the center of death and destruction is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a failed author with a failed marriage. He stumbles upon the news that the world as we know it is coming to an end. John Cusack is just playing John Cusack here. We rarely see any character development in the film. All he wants is becomes a hero in the eyes of his kids, his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Pete) and her current husband, Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). He heard this news from Charles Frost (Woody Harrelson) a hippie doomdayer. Woody Harrelson is just playing Woody Harrelson full of intentionally funny scenes. Woody Harrelson's character as the whack-job conspiracy-theorist and pirate-radio DJ that ends up being correct about all that 'end of the world' nonsense. As useless as it is, the story and explanation behind 2012 is decently believable, the actions and escapes the main characters make however are anything but. Suspended disbelief is required for any film like this, John Cusack out-running earthquake by limo, by airplane, RV, and others. The film was trying to be so epic, that it made it unbelievable. This movie had too many cheesy 'close calls'. By the time the audience reached the end, it become unreal. There are supporting cast that wasn't really needed in this film if only rewritten a bit. It eats up screen time what's little left for the main characters. The film's middle-act definitely tends to drag, as it's just one suspense-filled disaster sequence after another - with very little time given to character development or even inter-character dialogue. Another thread in Roland's films are the destruction of famous landmark. the Vegas Strip, the White House, Yellowstone National Park - are blew away, even if the geography and spatial orientation doesn't make sense in half of them. The film is just a joyful orgasm of exploding cities! But after a few of these eye-popping monstrosities, the novelty wears thin. Most of the films length (158 minutes!) is just CGI special effects. I even caught myself rolling my eyes at the preposterous conclusion. People only watched 2012 for the destruction, to see people dying, explosions, death, depressing scenes and actually enjoy people's suffering as they attempt surviving the' end of days'. Curiously though, a movie fraught with death and disaster ends on a uncharacteristic up-beat, which I felt was awfully shameless given the near six-billion humans that died during the film. The film is corny, and cheesy. The biggest disaster in this movie is it's clichés, and huge plot holes. According to the film, the apocalypse is near. The Mayan calendar is set to reach the end of its 13th cycle on December 21, 2012 and nothing follows that date. 2012 tells the story of whats to come. Nothing happen in 2012, the world didn't end. So this movie is nearly pointless. Films like this are suppose to involves powerful emotive suggestion & hidden meaning thats different to what what you think the film is about. Try interpreting this film as if the disaster element was not a component. Interpret it in terms of political, economic and social change. There are a lot of gullible people out there who think the world is gonna end in 2012 because of this movie. Really lame marketing, sub-par film. The film is not tolerable in the eyes of intelligent people, it get really boring to hear about 2012 and see every minute of the doomsday propaganda. I just glad 2012 is done and gone-- so people can look at this movie for what it is, a comedy.",6,4,5,29 December 2012
Room," Save some room, this movie will makes you think outside the box. It's a well-made film.
","Prepare to cry, to feel, to be angry, and to cheer. This is one of those kind of films that will stays with you long after the credits roll. It's captivated. Not to confused with the awful bad, 2003's The Room, 2015's Room is an admittedly unsettling adaptation, based off, the novel by author Emma Donoghue of the same name. Room tells the story about two people: 5-year-old Jack Newsome (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) living together in a single room. Told from Jack's point of view, the movie makes it clear that he's used to the idea of never going outside. What the audience knows that Jack doesn't know, is that he and his mom are prisoners, by a serial rapist, named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Now, on Jack's 5th birthday, Ma must finally tell him, the truth, so that they can siege the dangerous and heart breaking opportunity for her and Jack to escape. Can Jack cope with the decision of life outside of his own four walls; or will the room continue to be, his inner sanctum? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, Room really hit close to home. I had known people that went through similar trauma like this. While, this movie is hard to watch, it's a movie that needed to be seem, as it shows how to cope with the rest of your life after going through life changing event like sexual, mental, and physical abuse. Indeed, there is something worth discovering, outside, beyond these 4 walls. The movie is beautifully acted. Brie Larson is a tour de force. By far, one of the best acting of my generation, I have saw from an actress in recent times. You feel the love, angry, and dramatic heartbreak in every scene, she is in. After all, she essentially missed out on her formative adult years and was forced instead to raise a child in inhospitable conditions. You sense every emotional range of a mother whose young life was drastically altered at age 17. Not only that, but Larsen, well-mastered acting gives strong testament to the unsinkable bond between a mother and son, whose love propels them to rescue each other. I have to give credit to the young Jacob Tremblay, as well. Tremblay, in particular, is mesmeric. He has a lovable charm about him. I really felt like he was a son, I never knew, I had. That's how close, I got with his character. Both Larson and Tremblay make a remarkable duo. Another thing, I love about the film, is how accuracy closed, it was, to the source material. Screenwriter, Emma Donoghue didn't change much of anything from her novel. Inspired by real-life kidnapping cases like the Fritzl case, & the Jaycee Lee Dugard case, author Emma Donoghue was able to use symbolism, themes, and metaphors, from both real-life news, and classic literature to make a very well-written film. I love all, the references to Count of the Monte Cristo, Alice in Wonderland, and the Book Thief. Not only that, but all the Religious symbolism ranging from Sampson's hair to the villain, being called Old Nick, help make the character development of Jack, being told here, very believable. If the movie had any fault about Jack's story, it's the fact that many viewers were confused by, Jack's appearance. He had very long hair and very soft voice. Because of this, there has been elaborate and incorrect theories speculating that Joy is pretending that Jack is boy, to hide it from her captor. While the first half of this film was entertaining, it still lacked a lot of logic. Like, why didn't they just smash the window and climb out using their table and chairs? Also, how come Old Nick didn't see Jack when he was sitting straight up in the truck? Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that? Those are really big jarring questions. If you think about it, it's something worth debating about. Thinking outside of the box. Another fault of the film is how it does feel a bit disjointed. It's kinda like watching two different movies. Filmed in two parts; the first half, is learning to survive and escape, your torment hell. While, the second half is learning to cope after the trauma has happened. Yes, I know, a lot of critics might think the second half, might had gone a little too long, and repetitive, but I believe, the movie is well-paced. After all, you rarely see films tackle character study after a horrible event. This was something new to me. Another person that deserve some credit, is director, Lenny Abrahamson and cinematographer, Danny Cohen. The movie is well-shot. I love the scenes where they showing time has changed. A good example is how the camera focus on, the skylight of the room. Another great shot, is the whole rug sequence. Wow, that was really intense. In my opinion, while, this movie is Rated R. I didn't see anything that was graphic. Most of the rape scenes, were not shown, and the film had no nudity. Even the violence, was tame. If anything, it's just the dark subject matter. However, I saw harsher films rated PG-13 that dealt with a similar concept. So I don't get, why this movie was Rated R. It makes no sense to me. Overall: This haunting and disturbing movie is amazing. Worth the price, checking out. I hope, many success for it, during Oscar season.",9,3,7,27 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Wake up from your daydreaming and go see the Secret life of Walter Mitty. It's pretty alright film
","I glad it was finally made after going through development hell, but it doesn't really follow the 1939, short story by James Thurber. It's so loosely based on. The 1947 movie of the same name was different from the book to the point that the author hatred the film for its crude humor, but as less it was follow the book more closely. This 2013 adaption directed by Ben Stiller is very different from the original. In this film, Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a negative assets manager of photographs at Life magazine who frequently daydreams of fantastic adventures, and has a crush on his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). When he lost a very important photograph from Photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). He is forced to stop daydreaming, and live life by finding Sean O'Connell across the world and recover the MacGuffin type missing specific negative Frame 25 call ''Quintessence' of Life' before Life Magazine final print issue converts to online status. In the short story, it deals with a vague and mild-mannered man who drives into Waterbury, Connecticut, with his wife for their regular weekly shopping and his wife's visit to the beauty parlor. During this time he has five heroic daydream episodes. These heroic episodes should had been in this film, or at less, mention, because the movie is really slow to start off. It takes a very long time, before Mitty is call to adventure here. Surprising, the movie doesn't have that many daydreaming sequences which kinda bug me. It lacks the satirical over the top tone of the original story. I would had love to see him as a magnificent surgeon performing a one-of-a-kind surgery, then as a deadly assassin testifying in a courtroom, and then as a Royal Air Force pilot volunteering for a daring, secret suicide mission to bomb an ammunition dump. I guess, jumping into an ocean with sharks and escaping a volcano is daring, but it's less Mitty when you think about it, because he does those things for real, not imagining it. The best thing about Walter Mitty was the daydreaming and how it was fantasies by details of Mitty's mundane surroundings. It was cool to see what triggers them. The movie could use the symbolism better, like the Stretch Armstrong scene. It's weird to see, Walter Mitty had an over the top fight with obnoxious corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) over it, then easily give it away to some kids for a skateboard, seeing that his family got it for him. The Stretch Armstrong toy could represent a lot about his child life nature, and him slowly getting over it, to grow up. Surprising the daydreaming scene weren't that funny, it felt really dumb, than smart. One joke kill it, Benjamin Button. The only time, it was semi-funny was when reality hit in. I love the whole isolated frontier humor. I do love the film for its great use of music. David Bowie's 'Ground Control to Major Tom' was the highlight of this. I do like the Life magazine symbolism as he works for a magazine, when he doesn't have little to no life of his own. Still, the film put Life magazine in a negative light with how they supposedly treat their workers, badly. I surprised, Life magazine allow them to use their brand. I do have mixed feelings about the use of pop culture references such as Papa Johns and E-Harmony. The movie has way too much product placement. There isn't much of a secret life of Walter Mitty as everybody can tell that he is daydreaming all the time. Also missing in the film is Thurber's love of wordplay can be seen in his coining of several nonsense terms in the story. What I love about the film is that Walter Mitty doesn't intentionally attempts to mislead or convince others that he is something that he is not. He's pretty honest about who he is, and what he does. Still, it bit unrealistic to think that Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty was once a skater. In this film, Walter stops being Walter Mitty and more like Edmund Hillary halfway through the film. It seem really unrealistic for him to become that good in hiking in two weeks. Honestly, it felt like a movie about mountain climbing. It was pretty beautiful shots of Iceland throughout the film. Then there was a pretty good scene with Mitty trying to photograph a rare snow leopard that represent the whole film very well without being too preachy. In my opinion, they could had stop there, and I would be happy with the ending. The true ending was a bit lacking. It felt like his unrealistic romanticism of his fantasies were coming true. That isn't what the film should be telling as it became too predictive. It should be telling, how to understand disappointments in life, and move on and keep dreaming. Overall: This movie lacks a lot of things that the original done well, but it shows the 'Be in the moment' lifestyle in a good light that it's worth watching.",7,3,5,3 March 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.
","Don't get me wrong, Director Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. Even with Two Towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. By the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. A lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. It's like being in the middle of a mile run. You glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. Since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just OK. In my opinion, The Two Towers is just alright. The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. It is book III: The Treason of Isengard and IV: The Journey to Mordor AKA the Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East in the book series. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's Fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. Instead, we get a cool new intro with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) fighting the Balrog monster from the last movie. We come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. Frodo (Elijah Woods) & Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey and meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the way. Gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. Andy Serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion CGI capture acting, I ever saw. Since, there was a decision to leave Shelob for the third movie meant that Faramir (David Wenham) had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam's journey. This change was indeed different than the book. It does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. Frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. His real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. This resistance is Frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. It had some pretty powerful symbolism here between Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I do have a problem with Frodo & Sam's friendship. I have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. It's obvious Tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so I don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. While this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) find themselves fighting the Orcs invasion at Helm's Deep and helping the war-torn nation of Rohan. While in the book, Helm's Deep is a small battle. In this film, it's the big climax of the film. It's one of the best battle scenes in film, I ever witnessed. I can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of Orcs without much battle scars. I can do without Legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. I couldn't stand Gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. Also, glad to see Arwen (Liv Tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside Aragorn. I can still do without Aragorn's life is now tied to the Fate of the Ring bit. It makes little to no sense. I understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. The movie is more about Aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike Ents and trying to stop Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army at Isengard. Environment themes are question here. Still, the whole Treebeard part were a bit boring. One thing, I hate about Lord of the Rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. Aragorn, Frodo, and others. As much as I love seeing Gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. For him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. I blame it on Tolkien. I didn't like the whole Jesus Christ metaphor with his character. Besides Boromir (Sean Bean), does any main character dies in this movie. The movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. Everybody seems nearly invincible. Water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. Gandalf, Aragorn, and Frodo were save by large bodies of water. Similarly, Saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. Like a baptized, it's free from sin. Even the elves depart Middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. The film has a lot of Christianity themes. The music by Howard Shore is amazing. Overall: Good visual film that can be a bit confusing. Just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches.",8,3,5,15 December 2013
The Lion King," This movie is not quite a roaring success with me. I found the mighty lion mediocre at best.
","It's sad because this I was really looking forward to seeing what filmmakers Jon Favreau & Jeff Nathanson could do to make to make this photorealistic computer animation not live action remake stand out from Disney's classic animated 1994 film of the same name. Yet this film heavily influenced by Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' & Japanese anime 'Kimba the White Lion' felt like a rethread. Don't get me wrong, the story of Simba (Voiced by Donald Glover) having to retake his kingship does have some new things going for it. However the added backstory of how the villain got his name & how the famine start didn't really enhance the viewing experience. Honestly it lean more to becoming a bigger illogical plot hole on why the lionesses would continue to follow his lead knowing full well that he once challenge Mufasa (Voiced by James Earl Jones), force their queen for sex & continue to mistreated them. After all in this adaptation, Chiwetel Ejofor's version doesn't have the Machiavellian charm that Jeremy Irons brought in the original movie to make them trust him. To add onto that, Scar is not ruthless powerful enough to overtake their physical strength both in size and numbers if they rebelled. In the original he was. After all, he killed most of the Lion Guards including Nala (Voiced by Beyonce Knowles)'s father. In this movie, he's just an untrustworthy scrawny recluse whom cover story doesn't make much sense. He didn't even knock out the witness. Instead he exiled Zazu (Voiced by John Oliver) yet the bird still considering warn the lionesses of his lying. So you would think that the cover story would be expose long ago. On a similar beat, even if Scar didn't get cocky in deus ex machina way and expose the truth about Mufasa's death like an idiot. The lionesses didn't ask the wildebeests what happen in the first place seem odd. Even if the herd are sentient. Lionesses should be more willing to hear Simba out when he come back. He could expose who led him into the gorge to practice roaring. The only thing I can think of the pride thinking otherwise is if a Scar follower like Zira was introduce into the film. That or Simba having shown severe psychological issues or seem more physical mangy than Scar. After all, no lion will became a strong mane just by eating bugs. All this could had made the ending more logically. Still this remake needs more humor. I hate that the comic relief aspects are toned down to make everything gritty including the hyenas with no Ed. They now lack less personality, nowhere near expressive and are taken too serious. Yet the biggest letdown is how the film interpreted Hakuna Matata. According to Timon (Voiced by Billy Eichner) & Pumbaa (Voiced by Seth Rogen), there is no circle of life only a meaningless line of indifference. The way they said it, made responsibility free philosophy seem highly negative & nihilism than fun. No wonder they seem more coldblooded and open to help the carnivores killed their fellow animals. Don't get me wrong, they may have protection due to their closeness with Simba, but there still a famine going on. The chance of them getting eaten is high. Anyhow, the filmmakers still ruin the enjoyable humor with them. For example, jokes about being a pig is turn into a somber forced message about standing against bullies. It's unfunny PC comedy at its worst. Padding also made the movie suffer. 88 minutes runtime is now 2 hrs. The flick really wanted to prove that there is more of a Circle of Life than Hakuta Matata by painfully showing long sequences of fur travelling in the wind or a mouse wandering around. Talking about Circle of Life. I do find it odd that the lions has achieved harmony with the animals they eat by exodus hyenas under the pretense that they weren't part of it like an evil diaspora. The idea that they overhunt is outrageous. In real life, hyenas are vital components the ecosystem. They gotten a bad wrapped in these folktales. Simba should figure out a way to coexist with them. Another unique thing the movie could had done is use more of the Broadway Musical beside the trailer. At least, most of the original songwriters return to add new touches to their memorable hits even if the visuals to follow it are a bit lackluster. For example 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' & 'Be Prepared' sequences just doesn't compared to the fun original trippy animation with the cubs doing circus tricks or gusto delivery of strong fascism imageries of the hyenas. Then there is the opening of 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' whom visuals also don't match the tone as it is still board daylight when sung. It also sucks that the triumphant score played over Simba racing back was replaced with 'Spirit'. It doesn't quite have the same heroic tone need for the audience to understand his journey. As for voice acting. Besides Ejofor being way off, most of the other performers were alright even if BeyoncÃ© has her limits, Rogen can't sing and Jones sounds old. However it was very jarring to see the filmmakers remove nearly all range of human-like anthropomorphizing expressions. It made true to life creatures look so emotionless & stilted. Sadly making the animals move realistic also hurt the action as the film kinda screw up Simba's childhood pinning move. Even memorable spiritualism moments like Mufasa's physically spirit appearing in the clouds is tone down. Very little emotional punch. Regardless the CGI looks vivid accurate. Still overall I'll probably not see this remake again. The highest grossing animated movie of all time as of this writing is not really worth stepping foot on the lion den again and getting bit. That's for sure. I'll stick to the original.",6,3,5,24 January 2020
The Elephant Man," Let's talk about the Elephant Man in the room
","'I'm not a animal, I'm a human being!' screams out John Merrick surrounded by a crowd looking at his face at the train station. One of the most powerful lines in movie history was born and it's just heartbreaking to watch. The onlookers, so stifled by the conformity of their Victorian age, gather around in their top hats and well trimmed mustaches for a rare glimpse of 'abnormality' that evaded the circus, the hospital and the madhouse. The prudish judges of normality are still everywhere even today, judging by and how some people still look down on deformities. John Merrick was human, and not only that a truly great intelligent man. The movie starts out with London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) in at freak show where he is managed by a brutal man by the name of Bytes. Frederick Treves tries to help the man, with not only his condition, but also to escape from the exploitations of Bytes. On the way, Merrick is both love and look upon by the public. Merrick is so deformed to the point that he must wear a hood and cap when in public due to Merrick's most life-threatening deformity, his abnormally large skull, which compels him to sleep with his head resting upon his knees, as the weight of his skull would asphyxiate him if he were to ever lie down. John Merrick tries everything to try to be normal. He talks in a sophisticated and articulate matter, he appears at operas, does art, reads, makes model and every looking for true happiness. Directed by one of the greatest directors, David Lynch, the movie works in every level. The black and white gives the film, its serious tone, while also giving the film, it's creepiest. The dream like scenes are chilling reminds me of his work on 'Eraserhead'. As clichéd as it might sound, about an hour into the movie, I didn't even really notice Joseph's deformities. At first, I was somewhat intimidated, but after a while, I focused more on who he was as a person and David Lynch makes you see him more like a human being by giving him depth. It would have been an astonishing act if the writers decided to show the true reaction of complete submission and self degradation of the Elephant-Man. I think David Lynch could have easily directed this alternative twist as well. The music of the film is ground-breaking. Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber or Andre Previn gives the movie, its tragedy ending, while the theme song composed by John Morris gives the film, it's haunting score. The Victorian sets are has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie. Anthony Hopkin are well-acted, but I have to give it to John Hurt, You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive eyes does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. I think 'Elephant Man' not getting an award lead to the creation of the annual award for best makeup. Prior, makeup awards were given rarely, I believe. Just on special occasions. But when 'Elephant Man' didn't get any nods for it, people rightfully complained and the academy then created the annual makeup award the next year. Still, the movie has it faults, first off John Merrick is really Joseph Merrick in real life. Dr. Treves' reminiscences mistakenly names Joseph Merrick as John Merrick, an error widely recirculated by biographers of Merrick. The film was based on Treves memoirs, and in them he crosses out ''Joseph'' and writes in ''John'' above - hence the confusion. No one knows the reason for the ''deliberate mistake'', because everyone knew Joseph was called Joseph, plus its written on his birth certificate,and he signed his only surviving letter ''Joseph Merrick'. There are many things that did not actually happen in the movie. Such as the beatings from Tom Norman AKA Bytes who treated Joseph Merrick with great care and respect in reality. Why would they beat him if they are making a lot of money off of him? We are also to believe that Joseph's mother never did love him in the film, in true, he was rejected by his father and stepmother, not his mother. John suffered from a rare, degenerative and progressive disease (Proteus Syndrome, I believe), and Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was 'stripped naked, and felt like an animal in a cattle market' by Treves. So there is a lot of information that is left out. Period films are hard to pull off convincingly and here we are plunged into this utterly alien world but the story is never depressing nor preachy. Still poignant , deep,﻿perfect illustration of human flaws and human kindness. Such a gentle soul filled with deep inner beauty and not a mean bone in his body despite all of the painful horrors inflicted on him by a so called civilized society. There is a lesson to be learned about the dignity this one of a kind man maintained in a world that judged him on the texture of his outward appearance such so that he went through life with his head held up high even when he was sleeping. Bless you Joseph Merrick your inner beauty trumped all.",9,3,6,21 February 2013
I Am Legend," The story about a man and his dog is not that legendary.
","This movie is not legendary. sadly, but it's still worth checking out. It's really good, but can't hold the same value as the IMDb high highs such as Godfather and others. It's should be higher than where it is. The film is based on the book by the same title which was written in 1954 by Richard Matheson, a entire 150 pages book that shows depth and is cleverly written to make one think of their moral stand point, and how our view of humanity may skew our perception of who the real monster is. The book is full of irony and makes a very interesting dark tragedy. This author also penned some other well know tales which became excellent movies including Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come that follows that pattern. His writings were also inspiration in many Stephen King novels (The Stand), as well as the first survival horror films such as 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Man and his dog' '28 Days Later' and 'Silent Hill'. 'I am Legend' also feed the works and movies of 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964, Vincent Price), and 'The Omega Man' (1971, Charlton Heston). 'The Omega Man' is the closest movie similar to that. In my takes, this would be a remake of that movie. While Richard Matheson book is a great read 'I Am Legend' the movie, shows the world in the near future where scientist have recently created a virus altered cure for cancer. After thousands are cured with this revolutionary drug, the virus-cure mutates and eventually leaves the scientist Robert Nevell (Will Smith) as possibly the last man on earth and immune to the virus. The plot follows his life as the only remaining human in a lonely abandoned New York City with his dog and his search for a cure to save the remaining infected populace which remains in a zombie/ vampire/ undead state. This survivalist horror film makes several good moves that gave it the potential to be a great film. It's not a bloody gore-fest of a zombie movie that is a mainstay these days, and that's a good thing, it counter-acts the lack of blood with an edgy and unnerving feel throughout the entire film, especially being set in an abandoned Manhattan. The acting is excellent, and Will Smith's portrayal of being totally alone is on par with Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away'. It's really capitalizes on the loneliness of the character, who only hope for a normal life is his dog, and a few mannequins he talks as if people. The film kept the same dark feel of the book, but someone decided that all the underlying plot and depth which makes one actually use some brainpower and think about what this story is saying, is unnecessary. So the viewer is left with a movie which starts out strong and slowly dissolves into the same played out special effect heavy, heroic man takes on legions of infected zombie vampires all while trying to save the world action flick. The CGI zombies are just so fake looking. There are subtle hints that someone may have actually read the book before making the movie, but they are easily passed over, and not very prominent. Those who have never read the book (or a book for that matter) will probably love it, and add it to their DVD collection. The other group mostly those who have read the book or who like depth, consistency, and a clever plot line can wait to rent it and be angry that the movie didn't use the original ending. All in all, 'I am Legend' is entertaining and has Will Smith in it, that being said, it will not go down as legend and will be in danger of becoming just another zombie movie.",7,0,0,24 September 2012
A Quiet Place," I can't stay quiet any longer. It's time to make some noise about 'A Quiet Place'. A movie worth talking about.
","In the dystopian future of 2020, it's not quite peace and quiet for the Abbot Family; father, Lee (John Krasinski), mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt) & their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe). They live in a post-apocalypse world; where creatures, attracted by sound; kills anything that makes a large noise. Things get a little more complicated, as the mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt) is about to give birth to a baby, putting the family more in risk. Can the family survive all this, and save what's left of their humanity, or will the pregnancy of their mother, Evelyn, doom them all? Watch the movie to find out! It's really worth viewing. However, it's probably best, not to see this PG-13 horror movie at movie theaters; when there is a pack crowd. The highly talkative, semi noisy audience might be a distraction. It kinda does ruin the brooding tension and unceasing anxiety experience. Still, that alone, shouldn't hold you back from seeing this movie directed & co-written by John Krasinski; along with screenwriters, Bryan Woods and Scott Beck. If you can, find this film on DVD or Digital Download, it's worth the buy. The depth of the world-building with the monsters is impressive, given the limited narrative real estate. However, it does beg the question, how was the family able to get so much crops grown & electric to power their farm, without using heavy machinery? Nevertheless, the world still looks beat up & frightening; even if it's the creature design doesn't seem that original. After all, the monster in this, looks and acts like Demogorgon from Netflix's 2016's television series 'Stranger Things' & the Clickers from 2013's horror video game, 'Last of Us'. They're still scary. Still, it does beg the question, how much, can the creatures, honestly really hear? What's the frequency, along with volume? Can they hear farts, snores, and squeezes? Also, how is there still noisy animals in this earth? Seeing fishes in the river come across, as highly jarring. If running water running can cancel out, smaller noises; why didn't the family capitalize on it? It would have, made the birthing scenes, less painful & stressing for the wife. Things like that, along with character's other poor decision making; might takes some audience members out of the movie, for a bit. Nevertheless, the silent, but deadly premise is still pretty compelling to get audience back hooked on it; even with its outlandish moments scatter throughout the film. This movie makes better use of that gimmick, than director, James Wan's 2007 film, 'Dead Silence'. That's for sure. On the other hand, I felt, a bit disappointed, of the parenting subplot, the director is supposedly trying to build. Maybe, it's just me, but I couldn't see the allegory at all; as the parents barely takes care of their kids, only focusing on replacing lost-ones. Honestly, the movie would had work better, if they focus less, on the conflict between daughter & father; and more on creating a heavier, complex conflict, between the parents, over the idea, if they should abort, the unborn baby's life or not, in order to save their own living children. The film could had been more visceral with that; as it would pose, a challenging ethical dilemma, asking viewers if bearing a child; is still a natural and unqualified good if the quality of life surrounding it; is so deficient? Would it be still morally right? That should had been the message, but instead, the moral of this film, was muddled; by predictable & pointless self-sacrifice toward the end, that clearly, wasn't needed. The finale felt a bit anticlimax. Regardless of that, all the acting in the film, was pretty damn good, despite that the lack of dialogue. It's pretty impressive to hear that, most of the cast, had to master ASL (American Sign Language) for this role. Knowing some of it, I really couldn't see, much mistakes. Also, it's pretty good to have a real-life deaf person in the film to represent, the feeling of being a teenager's whom voice is hardly being hear, nor communicate against. That was a nice touch. Blunt as the mother, really goes through a lot. While, the idea that woman who just gave birth, would still have the stamina to shot a shotgun. Blunt's presence made it, a little more believable. Also, is it, just me, or is it weird to see John Krasinski's career turn from business-dress, funny everyman into a gritty, action star? I like this new look. Please hold for a moment of silence for Jim Halpert. May that character from 2005-2013's 'The Office' rest in peace. Now, that we're done with that awkward silence. It's time to talk about the lovely way, the camera for this movie was used. The movie is well-shot. The action scenes were intense. While, the film unrepentantly relies on jump scares and graphic gore for its biggest shocks, it still manages to establish an unrelenting undercurrent of tension in the isolation farm location that hums beneath every scene, aided by some truly inventive sound design. Overall: Unlike M Night Shyamalan's 2002's horror film, 'Signs'; this 90 minute movie will leave the audience in dead silence, because how good, it was. Its money worth spend.",8,0,0,1 August 2018
22 Jump Street," Time to jump into Jump Street again. It was a pretty good movie.
","I think the character, Captain Hardy (Nick Offerman) sum this movie up within the first 10 minutes of the film. 'Nobody cared about the Jump Street reboot. But 21 Jump Street got lucky. So now this department has invested a lot of money to make sure Jump Street keeps going.' Indeed, nobody really care about 2012's 21 Jump Street being made. After surprising, folks when it was release, due to its humor. The studio indeed put more money into the sequel. It really does show. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, once again, the movie hit all the bad sequel clichés, while make it work due to its being self-aware. It wasn't as annoying as 2011's Hangover 2 type remake. Indeed, the movie pretty much follows the same plot as the last movie, but this time, the duo cops, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) & Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are going undercover as college students, looking to locate a mysterious drug dealer that deals with a drug called Why Phy (Work Hard Yes, Play Hard Yes, and pronounced 'Wi-Fi'). I guess, people loves same old same old concepts. For me, I was all for another round of laughs from this movie, but I felt that, it was a bit cheesy at parts like the whole using a woman body as a weapon at the beach seem so out of place, the whole Mexican accent by Jonah Hill or the killer octopus attack slapstick. Then, there are the same old gags made for laughs that was a bit bitter taste such as I'm dating somebody you know, so get angry gag. Honestly, I like 2012's 21 Jump Street. It's like the taste of your first drink, but having more of the same old, same old, isn't going to be that great. Nothing can beats the original. After all, 2012's 21 Jump Street really did surprise me. This movie felt a little water down. What made this movie work over other recent comedies sequel such as 2013's Grown Up 2, and Scary Movie 5, is how it's mastered the meta approach towards sequels with clever inside genre movie tropes jokes, the movie is based on and for. It never sink so low, to add a lot of gross out humor. The movie is Rated R for crude language, sexual content, drug material, and violence. For a college term movie, it's pretty tame. I'm glad, it really want too raunchy like other movies. The acting is alright. Jonah Hill was a bit annoying at the beginning, but toward the end, he kinda was alright to watch. Channing Tatum was great as the clueless jock. I think the movie works due to the chemistry shared by the two leads. You can really see it as bromantic comedy. The supporting cast was a mostly a miss for me. Ice Cube as Captain Dickson wasn't that funny, after all, his shtick as the angry yelling black man is way old. The whole sub-plot of him getting mad over somebody dating a family member is just too cliché for me. I saw it, better use in his other movie, 2014's Ride Along. If anything, Jillian Bell as Mercedes was just wicked fun. She really didn't get that funny, until toward the end. The whole comedy exchange between her and Jonah Hill's character was just brilliant to watch. Without spoiling too much of it; one of the funniest things of the movie is during the credits gag. It lampshades a lot of 'maybe' sequels to this movie with a lot of celebrity cameos. The credits show possible concepts for future movies, from 23 Jump Street (med school) to 2121 Jump Street (undercover in space!). Who knows, maybe one of those movies will be made one day!? There are a number of memorable actions scenes in this film. My favorite, had to be the helmet cart car chase. Yes, some people might hates these movies because they are a mockery to the original material, 1987- 1991's dramatic show, 21 Jump Street, but it's hard to take the original show, seriously. After all, one of the original cast returns in a cameo in this film, to once again to give his blessing to the newer films. Overall: The movie is a masterpiece of both smart and dumb comedies. Yes, it use cheap laughs to get people through the plot, but the fact that most of it, is a retread of the first film and people don't care, really shows, how funny, people are willing to take it as it is.",7,5,11,25 June 2014
Amadeus," Rock me Amadeus! Amadeus is a beautiful musical masterpiece
","Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing! The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse. And then, suddenly, high above it, beautiful music. A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film.",9,4,5,20 August 2016
Ghostbusters," Need a good movie to watch! Who are you gonna to call? Call, Ghostbusters!
","Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis. The movie is pretty original with its concept. The original script call 'Ghostmashers' had a very different story than the film we got. The script had traveling through time, space and other dimensions to fight large ghosts. It was deemed financially impractical and the movie was rewritten. They had written roles specifically for Belushi, John Candy and Eddie Murphy, but were forced to change the script after Belushi died and the latter, when the other actors couldn't commit to the film. The movie was saved from being scrapped by the charm of Bill Murray, who took John Belushi's original role as parapsychologists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray). Most of Bill Murray's lines are ad-libs, and his performance was great. Along with Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), they set up a ghost-catching business after a series of apparent paranormal activities seem to come alive, when an uptown high-rise apartment building becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient Sumerian god, Gozer. Gozer become an ever bigger threat to the entire world and the only team that can stop it, is the Ghostbusters. The visual effects for this movie is amazing. I love the proton packs and how they work. The stop motion animation is bit odd, but still pretty impressing for the time. My favorite monster is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I like how they were able to pull off the man in the suit attacking a city visual effect. This movie has one of the best movie theme songs ever, written and performed by Ray Parker, Jr. Without him, catchphrases like 'Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!' and 'I ain't afraid of no ghost', wouldn't be there. The song was a huge hit. Still, the song does sound like Huey Lewis 1983's 'I want a New Drug'. He sued Ray Parker, Jr. for plagiarism, claiming that Parker copied the melody from his 1983 song, but it was settled out of court. In my opinion, the Ghostbusters song will outlive the drug song with each generation of fans. The acting is very good from all of the Ghostbusters. Even the not so attractive, Sigourney Weaver as the love interest, Dana Barrett was made sexy and charming. Even side characters like Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) and William Atherton as the villainous prick, Walter Peck was fun to watch. William Atherton later states that the role kinda ruin his life, because fans would often treated him badly or start fights with him. As a kid, I always thought the man playing Walter Peck was Kenneth Branagh. Another villain Gozer, was originally to appear in the form of Ivo Shandor, a slender, unremarkable man in a suit, played by Paul Reubens; but the role was played by Yugoslav model Slavitza Jovan. Her role was short, but Gozer used to creep me out with that both sex evil form. What is really odd is how a really old deity, know what a Stay-Puft Mashmallow Man was. What I didn't like about the film is how downplay the role of Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is. Had Eddie Murphy accepted the role of Winston, the character was actually meant to appear in more of the film. When Murphy declined the role, the script was re-written to have him appear about half-way through the film to show that they need help to cope with the demand of catching ghost. He seem to lacking a lot of things. Not much chemistry between him and the others Ghostbusters. People often forget him, and remember the first three. He doesn't help move the plot. He is just there to be there. I would love to see more of him. I like how the films are very, very thoroughly researched in the paranormal. Nothing in the film sounds too Techno Babble far off from real exorcists and psychiatrists dealing with possession. In addition, all of the books Ego and Ray mention actually exist. The film produced a popular Animated Adaptation, The Real Ghostbusters in 1986. Then a sequel in 1989. In 2009, a video game adaptation was released. As of this writing, no third movie. With the death of Harold Ramis in 2014. It's most unlikely. Many sequences were shot but removed from the film, but put into the DVD as extra. They're worth watching like the scene where a policeman tries to ticket the Ectomobile, but the car won't let him or Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play two bums that witness Louis being chased by the terror dog. Bill Murray acts like Carl Spackler from 1980's Caddyshack in this scene, so check it out. An awful lot of swearing and sexual innuendo for a family comedy. Not to mention the fairly obvious sexual symbolism of the key and the gate. Some children might fear the Demonic Possession, and the ghosts. Surprising there is lot of people think the movie is a metaphor to a lot of things like the war between Religious Vs Science because the scientists kill the Oldest known civilization 'God' with nuclear weapons. The reason why some people got angry of this, is because historian often state out that the Hebrew Yahweh AKA God is often model from the Sumerian folklore. Then there are people that think the film is pointing to an Illuminati threat. The character of Walter Peck can seem like liberal government bureaucrat who barges into a small business and his interference causes disaster that some conservatives find funny. Of course, the homo-erotic implications of men fighting with phallic science-stick. It's pretty Freudian. The movie is smart and deep, even pointing out if Ghost have civil rights, but I think these people are over-thinking the film, but I do like their discussions. It's worth talking about, but in my opinion, just enjoy the film and see it as it supposed to be. A really good supernatural comedy. Overall: They came. We saw. The movie kicks ass.",8,0,0,11 March 2014
The Hurt Locker," Hurt to say this, but Hurt Locker might not be 'da bomb' as what people think it is. Still a good movie.
","Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was one of the most accurate depictions of the war in Iraq. The look and feel of living on the edge as a bomb disposal team during the Iraq War seem realistic, but once again, Hollywood love portray soldiers as undisciplined suicidal cowboys. Most bomb disposal are 99% detonate by remote controlled robot, not a guy in a bomb suit. Still, homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were such a problem that most of the deaths of Iraq War for American soldiers was cause by them. During the summer of 2004, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) had to deal with them with his partner team of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Elbridge (Brian Geraghty) and that's pretty much sums up the plot. In my opinion, I don't know if this movie really deserve the Best Picture Award that year. It was a good movie, but not it's no way the best film that year. Up didn't win because it's hard for animated movies to find Best Picture. Inglorious Basterds was probably too out there for the Academy and last Avatar was probably too much of a sci-fi. Most of the other movies didn't have much of a fighting chance. I wouldn't say the character of William James is likable, he is just a 1991's Point Break character put into the Iraq War just there to search for the ultimate physical rush. He is egotistical fool who runs into danger not caring about how it impacts those around him and couldn't give two craps about his family. I just found it so anticlimactic. It's not like he learn anything new by the end of the film, like valuing his life, or the lives of others. At less, they could have gave him a good reason to be such a war buff similar to Eric Bana's character of SFC Norm 'Hoot' Gibson in 2001's Black Hawk Down. He is not a hero in a conventional sense. At less, this movie help discover the actors Jeremy Renner, and Anthony Mackie. The movie nearly didn't get made, due to production problems while filming in Jordan, but Director Katherine Bigelow got it done. The action scenes were pretty good in my opinion. I think the movie is great would been better if they use more of the paranoia of bombs going off any minute. While I do like the sniper scene toward the middle of the film, I think its turn away from what made this movie interesting. It's a war movie about the bomb squad with a lot of suspense. That sniper scene would work better in a normal war film about infantry soldiers, not here. Plus that scene made the British SAS (Special Air Service) look horrible compare to the U.S Soldiers. The movie isn't pro war or against the war in Iraq, it's just tells the story of the soldiers who happen to be there. I do have to agree that the film serves as the most effective recruiting vehicles for the U.S. Army bomb squad for anybody seeking an adrenaline rush. Response among veterans are mixed, as most of them think it's a good film with a few military inaccuracies. The dialogue in the film is very limited. There is a lot of scenes with little to nothing said. I do like the scene with Colonel Reed (David Morse) and William James talking about his career. Overall: it was well-acted, probably one of the best film about the Iraq War, but just need a little bit of retouching to make it as good as other war films.",7,5,6,4 June 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Yo! Ho! Yo! Ho! A Pirates Life is not for me. It's getting pretty tiresome. This movie was just meh.
","ARRRRGGHHH! This swashbuckling film is notorious for its troubled and chaotic production, involving multiple rewrites, injuries, recasts, and ransom affair with hackers. Although, the biggest problem, this movie had, was its main star, Johnny Depp, whom broke international laws, while filming this movie in Australia. Not only did, he breached the country's laws when he smuggle his dogs into the country, but Depp's bitter divorce from actress, Amber Heard put a black mark on the film, due to allegations for domestic abuse. This left Disney with doubt, on how bankability, Depp was, after his latest set of films underperformed at the box office. However, with 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tells No Tales'. It did prove that Depp's star power hasn't fade out yet, as the film is projection to gross a good amount of money for the franchise, international, despite domestic, the film's opening being below standards. Nevertheless, the film's total gross, compare to the other films in the franchise is still pretty low, and much of that, comes from the fact, that the film franchise has run out of ideas. The fatigue is very noticeable in this film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the plot is pretty much, the same from the other films, just recycled and rewritten with new characters and locations, but yet have the same old McGuffin treasure hunt, with Deux Ex Machina, moments, sparkling, throughout it. This time, ruining the mythical of the previous movies. Some good examples of this, is how the movie, has Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his crew being pursued by ghosts, yet again, this time, commanded by Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), a Spanish pirate hunter who seeks revenge on Sparrow, for leaving him to die in the Devil's triangle. I wouldn't mind, if this curse was related to the treasures from the first movie, as that, would make more sense, but instead, of that, this curse comes unannounced with little to no exposition, on how Armando is able to stay undead. Nor does the movie explain, why the compass, keep them, there in the first place. It get even more puzzling, when a plot point in the film, about 'betraying the compass,' releases them, all free, despite the fact that in the previous movies, Jack has lost, stolen or given his compass away to other people to use throughout the saga, having no mention of this. Another thing, this film shows the compass being given to Jack by somebody else, besides Tia Dalma (Naomi Harris) from 2006's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. Even if she was still involve with the compass delivery. Are we to believe that, the goddess of the sea, was willing to keep ghost pirates hunters in bay, knowing full well, that it was the pirates lords that trap her in human form!? Another thing, the idea that Jack and his crew's only hope of stopping them is to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon that will be able to break all of the curses of the sea, seem a bit much. Are we to believe that compass can't hold them, back, anymore!? Also, wouldn't the destruction of the trident at the end of the film mean, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) would die, seeing how his heart was cut out, during the events of 2007's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I guess, death doesn't really matter in these films, seeing how, the after credit, pretty much, shows that, another character from a previous movie is being brought back. In my opinion, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. This movie makes no sense. Not only, did this movie kinda ruin the lore of the franchise, but it also kinda hurt the backstory of some of familiar characters. The idea of having one of the character, be related to Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and him, sacrificing himself, felt a bit forced and out of character, knowing his history. Despite that, I have nothing bad to say, about the new youthful characters of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) & Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) They were far better than the ones, established in 2011's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'. I can say that. They were somewhat memorable. Even the other cameos in the film weren't so bad. However, I did think Depp was sleepwalking through this. It's clear to me, that he's getting really tired of this movie. For Bardem, I found his performance to be boring and never amounts to much more than a drooling wet mop full of ink stains. While, both leads were a disappointment, at least, I thought, the high production values were impressive. I did like, all the real life, set locations, they built. Also, the special effects, while, not the greatest, work for the film that was being made. However, I just hate that the movie has, too many action sequences set, during the night, filmed in pitch black darkness with barely noticeable ghost. It made for a very hard to see, movie at times. Even, the action scenes shot in the day, were a bit jarring, due to the film, not understanding how physics work and it's ripping off, action sequences ideas from mediocre films like 2011's 'Fast Five'. At least, the musical score by composer Geoff Zanelli was great to hear, even if it's not Hans Zimmler on the wheel. Overall: For a film franchise that started out as joke, based on a Disneyland theme park ride. I have to say, it had a good run. While this film is probably not the best movie to end the series, with, but I have to say, it's time for it to end. Any future films will never quite manages to recapture the magic that launched this film series to such stratospheric heights back in 2003. It's truly time, for Jack to sail into retirement. I'm sorry, but in the end, this movie was just mediocre, at best.",7,4,10,2 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: Apocalypse was X-cellent, despite what some people might say about the film.
","Following the critically acclaimed global hit, 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', director Bryan Singer once again returns to the X-Men Franchise with 'X-Men Apocalypse'. While, this movie might not be as good as the previous movie, it was still a blast to watch! I found it, very entertaining, in the face of its dark somber and emotional tone. I was very invested in the brutal story. It's just sad that some critics don't agree with me. I think, the main reason, why they might dislike, this movie is, because the fact that Warner Bros DC Comics 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and Disney's Marvel Studios 'Captain America: Civil War', has been trying to do, more complex mortality stories, while 20th Century Fox is trying to simple it down with the standard comic book 'save the world' plot line. For the most part, I think, they're just being a little over critical. After all, the X-Men franchise has always been a little too serious or stretch out, with its stories, dealing with bigotry, prejudice, and diversity. It's time for them to take the franchise, a little more simple and straightforward with a standard extinction storyline. After all, it's a superhero film. Yet, this movie is no lightweight. It's still has depth and strong character development. While, the civil rights issues is not explore much, here; it was still kinda refreshing to see, the X-Men have to deal with issues, something bigger. I like the concept of rational humanism vs God worshiping, here. I just wish, it was discuss more, than being limited for more a visual disaster movie, tone. Don't get me wrong, I like the visuals in this film, but I felt that the CGI could need some more work. There were parts in the film that look utterly unnatural, due to the fakeness of the green screens like the Quicksilver/ Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters) running scene. Despite that, I love, how absolutely brutal the action is for a PG-13 movie. I just wish, I knew, what was the villain's motivational was about. I get that, the Egyptian God/Mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wanted to destroy the world, but I'm not entirely sure what he wants to do with it, really. It's never truly explored. He looks confused and clueless. Honestly, does he want to destroy mankind or not? It look like he could had wipeout the world, as least, 3 times, earlier in the film. Besides that, I kinda like this version of Apocalypse than the 'Age of Apocalypse' comic book version. After all, the comic version was a little too over the top with the caliber of his mutant powers. I thought Oscar Isaac did well for himself in this film. He really look and act very sinister. Still, I had a big problem with his henchmen, the Horsemen's motivations. I really don't get, why they're so willing to destroy the world. I get the reasons, why Archangel/Warren Worthington III (Ben Hardy) would, based on the story, presented and the comics; but why would Storm/Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp) & Psylocke/ Elizabeth Braddock (Olivia Munn) join Apocalypse? Their motivations are not credible at all, unless, they were supposedly brainwash. Even with that, why the sudden change of heart, toward the end? Did Apocalypse's mind control suddenly turn off? It makes no sense. Anyways, there's a lot of destruction in 'Apocalypse', but very little consequence for the people that kinda starred it. It's weird that Storm would get away, scot's free, toward the end. On the other side, the motivational of the X-Men, both recurring characters and new ones were very clear. It's just odd, that Mystique/Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence) is nothing like her comic-book counterpart. I get that Jennifer Lawrence is a big name and hate going through the long make-up process but couldn't they get her to appear and act, more like the Mystique from the comic books. After all, I kinda like villain, Mystique than hero version. It's really taking away, yet another leader role from Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). He seem a bit, underdeveloped, here. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was alright, despite, kinda being bitchy. Still, her American accent doesn't sound quite right, as her British sounding voice is really showing. As much as I dig the new characters, by far, the best is the recurring characters of Professor X/ Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Both were amazing in their roles. It's just sucks, that the pair barely share a scene together here. I love that fascinating relationship between them. Stan Lee also has a cameo, but it come across, as really disturbing and awkward to watch. Also, it can't be, an X-Men movie without Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman). He was alright in his small bit in the film, but the inconsistency with his character is just confusing. It doesn't match, well with the end events of the last movie. I guess, that scene was just a red herring. Still, it makes you wonder, how did the real Col. William Stryker (Josh Helman) capture him for the Weapon X program? The film is full of plot-holes like this. I know this movie marks the first installment in the new X-Men series following the Cosmic Retcon. However, I don't get in the timeline, that history has been altered so much, that some mutants have now been born long before they were in the original timeline and how the recurring characters are able to age so slowly. It's a bit jarring, but I willing to give some leeway, because thinking too much about it, will give you, a headache. Despite, the trouble timeline and artistic license to both history, science and comics; I didn't really allow it, to take me out of the movie. Overall: As a conclusion to a trilogy, 'Apocalypse' falls somewhat short. Still, I say go see it, as if there is no tomorrow! It's worth the watch.",8,12,18,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Amazing Spider-Man 2 for the most part was amazing.
","This sequel movie to 2012's Amazing Spider-Man was a lot better than that movie. After the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in 2010, the reboot series had a rough start for me, as I couldn't stand the first movie. Watching the trailers for this sequel. It look as bad as Spider-Man 3 with way too much villains. After watching this film, I'm glad it was good. Hands down, it's probably my favorite movie from all of the Spider-Man movies. Directed by Marc Webb, the movie is about Spider-Man's most important conflict: separating his real life as Peter Parker from that of Spiderman. As the villains become more and more dangerous, Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) is having a hard time, trying to keep his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) away from the danger. He's haunted by the memories of Stacy's father ordering him to keep Stacy safe. Meanwhile, an old friend Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) has come back to ask Peter Parker to help him with his father research, so that Peter can save him from a life ending disease. When one of Harry Osborne's experiments go horrible wrong leading Harry Osborne and his co-worker Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) disfigure. Both men seek revenge on Peter Parker, the one that turn his back against them. Without spoiling too much. I have to say, that the movie has a lot of sub-plots going on it, that it can be a bit confusing if you haven't remember much of the first movie. It felt a little bit cramp and rushed. I felt the movie could have work better, if it kept to one villain. Originally, the movie was just going to be about Electro (Jamie Foxx) hints the early title of 'Rise of Electro', but the producers add way too much villains here. First off, the movie doesn't make Electro seem much of a threat. He is quickly defeat time after time by Spider-Man in the film. Still, Jamie Foxx makes the role, his own, and he was pretty good. I just thought, the way, he became Electro was a bit too cartoony. I still love the modern update look of the villain. The way, they bring in Harry Osborne into this movie was sloppy at best. The idea of Harry Osborne still being good friends with Peter Parker since grade school seem out of touch. Really, he was sent to boarding school around the same time Peter's parents disappeared, and Peter meets him for the first time since then seem awkward. Both, don't look like they have any connection with each other. Honestly, are we're supposed to be believe that they are so close friends? I think, the originally movies did this, better, making Harry Osborne, a well-rounded character than a stereotype bad guy dark loner that this movie does. Even the character of Norman Osborne (Chris Cooper) seem wasted as he was mention in the first movie, and in this, have a few lines and dies. Wow, Oscar winner used badly. Don't get wrong, Dane DeHaan is a fine actor, but he comes from the young Leo DiCaprio's acting school where screaming and shouting is the norm. Honestly, I don't even think the Green Goblin was even that menacing. He look like evil Peter Pan. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man was great. He had some of best funny moments, and lines in the film. The way, he plays off as the charming, yet direct-less orphan is top-watch. I do have to say, that bringing in father plot gives the character new light, but nothing new is explain. Big props to using bits of the novel Mary Jane to explain what happen to his parents. Also it seems the arc from the first movie of Peter hunting Uncle Ben's killer has been dropped, which is horrible since it was a sequel hook. I also love how the movie greatly made the Spider-Man suit, way better. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was OK. I do think the weak conflict between them was pretty bad, but I did like how the movie kept true to the comic #121–122 with the ending scene with Gwen Stacy. I love most of the supporting cast in this movie. Sarah Fields as Aunt May was good, but I was a bit tired of how much she mention Uncle Ben. She mention Ben in every scene with Peter. I don't like Paul Giamatti as Alekesi Sytsevich/ The Rhino. It was a bit too hammy. I don't like Felicity Jones as Felicia. She looks a bit too young, and I just don't like Cat-Woman rip-offs. I do like the cameo character from Adam-Troy Castro's spin-off Sinister Six novel trilogy. Also look for Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee cameo. Also check out, the delete scene with Shailene Woodley as Mary Jane Watson. The action in this movie was some of the best. The CGI visual effects wasn't that bad. It was pretty watchable in 3D and works with the gimmick. The music by Hans Zimmler was epic. 'It's On Again' by Alicia Keys Feat. Kendrick Lama was sick in a good way. I dig the 1960s Spider Man theme song having a cameo. The closing scene gives us, much to look forward to. Even with it being a bit cheesy with the Spider-Kid. I will be looking forward to the third movie in this series. The post-credit teaser scene was a bit from 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past where 20th Century Fox, allowed Webb to direct the film if Sony would promote the X-Men film for free. The scene's inclusion sparked confusion as I thought there was a X-Men–Spider-Man crossover film being planned, but I really doubt it. Sony announced two spinoffs of the series, which include the Sinister Six and Venom. So look forward to that. Overall: Good comic book movie. Welcome back, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",7,4,11,25 April 2014
Ex Machina," Ex Machina is a very smart movie. It didn't feel robotic.
","This movie is a thinking man movie. Still there were some Artificial Indifferent from me in some parts in the film. Directed by Alex Garland, this spectacular low budget film, tells the story of Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a coder at a global search engine company, who is invited to do a Turing test, with the company's rich, reclusive, genius boss Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). It's there, that Caleb's test of a machine's AVA (Alicia Vikander) ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human, turn into a psychological thriller. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this movie is really beautiful and powerful in how it was shot. The estate is an ultra-modern clear, full of glass and steel, but it's located in a beautiful, secluded spot underground in the mountains, surrounded by greenery. It use the spacious frame to juxtapose nature and science, chaos and order. Indeed there's something Kubrickian about the cold and calculated precision of the movie, which perfectly complements the subject matter. It has that feeling of, 'while, we might think of ourselves, as civilized men, but we're only, one step out of the jungle', type of a feel. Seeing how most of the film, takes place in one location, it gives the audience, a sense of isolation and claustrophobia. It makes the escape, so much more memorable. The ending to the film is also a shout-out to philosophical, Plato's Allegory of the cave theory. The ending is a bit upsetting to some viewers, I can understand why. After all, the movie is titled, 'Ex-Machina', which is a phrase that originated in Greek tragedies in which, an actor playing a god would be lowered down via a platform AKA machine to solve the characters issues, resulting in a happy ending for all. In this story, there was no last minute 'Deus ex Machina' that changed the story. The pacing is good, plodded along, from start to finish, as flawed characters made terrible decisions, and bad outcomes followed. Even, with the twist toward the end; the movie plot seem very predictable. My problem with the film isn't that, but how oddly, the film tries to dumb down the complex material. There were times, where Caleb speaks, very fluently about technical concept, only to have Nathan shut his smart psychoanalyze down to beat around the bush. It doesn't make, any sense. He can understand Caleb's jargon perfectly well; but he's dumbing himself down. Yes, I know, the movie had to have some entertaining moments, so it doesn't sound like a boring science exposition lecture, but gees some of the pop culture sum-up dialogue didn't work. It doesn't make, Nathan look believable, as a man that create A.I, when he is dancing, and acting like a fret-boy. Still, Oscar Isaac's performance was one of the better parts of the film. He has the right amount of charisma, and charm to be, somewhat likable. Domhnall Gleeson matches, a great, against Nathan. He fills the character with the right amount of innocence and vulnerability that make him the ying to Nathan's yang. Alicia Vikander is pretty good as Ava. She was able to show Ava's stillness and the robot like manners in which she moves, and how she talks. She's aided by some pretty remarkable-yet-subtle visual effects work. She's a stunning sight to behold, her face the perfect depiction of feminine beauty. The movie does have graphic nudity, but it wasn't done in a titillating, sexism gross way. This film is very European in its approach to nudity. More poignant than eroticize. It shows the beauty of the female form, as a natural thing. Could, the movie cut down on it? Yes, but it wasn't exploiting nudity, just for eye-candy. It was needed for the film's plot. For the most part, other than the nudity, this could have been a PG-13 film. The violence is very tame, the language wasn't harsh, enough. It could had work. The creepy, futuristic music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury rings true emotionally, bringing a combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings. It's bursting with ideas, theories, and moral questions about the concept of artificial intelligence, and it leaves these theories open to interpretation by a smart audience. Still, I wouldn't call this movie, original. Most sci-fi movies made these days, recycles old ideas like the dangers of artificial intelligent so much, that it might be tiresome to some viewers. In 2015, along, when this film was made, there were more than a dozen of the A.I films, similar to this. While, this movie has a lots of familiar themes, taken from art, literature, psychology, film, sciences and other. It's not gimmicky. Many were very thought-provoking. There are countless amounts of references, worth researching on your free time, ranging from classic material, like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Charles Perrault's Bluebeard, Ovid's narrative poem about Pygmalion, and the Greek myth of Prometheus to post 20th century, media sources like the Blue Book by Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1966's Star Trek episode 'Requiem for Methuselah,', and Embodiment and the Inner Life: Cognition and Consciousness in the Space of Possible Minds, a book about the history of Artificial Intelligence Embodiment by Murray Shanahan. The movie even makes us, wonder about real life issues, like how companies are using people's personal data for their own use and sailing it to third parties. It's very creepy. Overall: While, the movie might have some plot holes and inconsistencies; for the most part, it's a very well-made film. I wish, I could go into more in-depth analyzing, but it would take, pages upon pages of discussion to get, through it. Still, viewers should have a great deal to talk about, on their own. It's a must-watch. Recommended it.",8,3,7,31 May 2015
La Grande Illusion," There is a grand Illusion indeed with this once-banned film. Everybody thinks it's the best film ever. It's a good film, but kinda overrated
","Don't get me wrong, I love this film, but I don't see it being one of the greatest films of all time. It was pretty hard to watch and get through. It's not the fact that it was made in 1937 by French director Jean Renoir for a French speaking audience, and I can't relate to the film due to its aged and language. It's the fact that the film's themes put me in odds and the editing was just horrible. It's not the director or the editor at the time fault. It was World War 2's fault. For many years, the original nitrate film negative was thought to have been lost in an Allied air raid in 1942. Then, it was revealed that the original negative had been shipped to Berlin during the Nazis control of France due to the ban of the film during WWII. Then in Cold War, Berlin in 1945, the film was controlled by the Soviet's zone and consequently shipped along with many other films to Moscow. The negative was returned to France in the 1960s, but sat unidentified in storage for years. In the early 1990's, it was found, restored, and re-released in the United States in 1999. Overall, watching the badly damage film getting restored was a blessing, but it didn't make the film any better. Probably in pre-World War 2, the film was pretty amazing, but after World War 2, this film feels like a long lost puzzle just put together, with a few of the original pieces missing. It just doesn't have that same grandeur. La Grande Illusion is about a small group of French officers who are captured during World War I and are plotting an escape from a German prison camp. The title of the film comes from the book, The Great Illusion by British economist Norman Angell, which argued that war was futile and pointless. One thing, I do love about this movie is that there is no all-good and all-bad type characters in this film. The Germans were portrayed in a mostly positive light, and not like negative evil madmen like other war films do. Elsa (Dita Parlo) had a very powerful scene about talking about how big the table is, now. It really hit you, when you see how the toll of the war has cause this woman, so much pain. Erich von Stroheim as Captain von Raufeenstein, the warden of the prison had great acting. You can tell through his acting that the character felt pain, not only because of what happen to his body, but also to what is happening in the world. The French characters like aristocratic Captain De Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay), working-class Lieutenant Maréchal (Jean Gabin) and Wealthy Jew, Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio) were all great in their roles. The film was generously humanistic to its character of various nationalities. Still, the movie has this odd tell rather than show moments. There is a scene in the beginning, where De Boeldieu and Marechal are going to do an air reconnaissance before captured, and a minute later, they are sitting down with Captain von Rauffenstein for dinner, captured. Where is the scene where they get shot down? They talk about it, but we, the audience don't see it. It was a bad jump cut. Even in the meal scene, the music cuts off pretty oddly to show people do die in this war, as symbolism by the funeral wreath, but still it's awkwardly cut. There are hundreds of badly made cuts in this film. Then, there was a vaudeville-type performance that was pretty weird, that remind me of 1963's Great Escape and 1953's Stalag 17 type humor. I do like the 'LA Marseillaise' scene that remind me of 1942's Casablanca. Still, most of the film felt like watching Hogan Heroes, then a real life movie about prison camps. The different between Great Escape, Stalag 17 and this movie is that this movie fails to make the prisoner-of-war camp look a place, you want to escape. Yes, the guards here were kinda mean, but in no ways, brutal like other two films. The prisoners were living in a castle, no less, better off, then the soldiers living in the trenches at the time. The film loves to say that there is a language barrier between the characters, but throughout the film, the characters understood each other more than I did, watching. The movies go quickly with the French, German, Russian and English dialogue, it does get confusing. The English seem out of place. There is a scene where Boeldieu and Von Rauffenstein spoke English for some odd reason. When did this English speaking came from in the film? I don't know how Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner, when Boeldieu speak English. Boeldieu and von Rauffenstein, are aristocrats represented as cosmopolitan men, educated in many cultures and conversant in several languages. In true life actor Erich von Stroheim didn't speak a word of German. The film would be easier for the audience to understand if they stick with just French. Indeed, watch the film with sub-titles. You need them. I do like the message that critique the romantic idealization of duty, by showing how the aristocrat old order of European civilization has died in this war. I love the symbolism of the flower in the prison. I do like how the movie fights against the anti-Jewish campaign enacted by Adolf Hitler's government at the time, by making Rosenthal looks like a good man. Overall, this film does one thing right, it shows a realistic interpretation of the relationships of soldiers fighting a politician's war. That is why it's one of the great movies of all time.",8,4,6,4 October 2013
Coco," Gracias Pixar! You did a good job, once again! Your brush with death, made for one vibrant entertaining movie!
","'Coco' is an affecting, coming of age story of a young boy, Miguel Rivera (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), whom desire to become a musician despite his family's wishes. Hoping to win, the local talent show, he steals a guitar off a dead man, and find himself accidentally transported to the land of the dead, where he must seeks the help of his instrumentalist great, great grandfather to return him to his family among the living. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, it seems like similar film, 20th Century Fox, 2014's computer animation film 'the Book of Life' has shown everything special about the Mexican holiday of Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) to families, around the world. In contrast, Pixar & Disney Studios, with their own unique visuals style, not only show the holiday, mostly culturally sensitive right with their use colorful, beautifully computer animated of holiday decorations, but also the history of Mexican art culture, accuracy as well. We see that, with their homage to real life deceased Mexican celebrities, including Frida Kahlo, Mario Moreno, El Santo, Jorge Negrete, & Pedro Infante, through muralism art, music, lucha libre mask & fictional cameos. Nevertheless, not all the visuals from 'Coco' work. Some of the Easter Eggs, Pixar used, was a bit jarring. Although, it was pretty cool to see cameos items from other Pixar films. It just doesn't work with the world, Lee Unkrich & his crew, are trying to build. It was also a bit jolting to see Alebrije in the afterlife; when in truth, both really have barely anything to do with each other. Still, like the Pixar cameos; seeing the xoloitzcuintli, become one in the end is only a small nitpick. After all, it was also a nice smart nod to the famous author of 'The Divine Comedy', even if the book technically, not from Mexican culture. As for the writing, I thought, 'Coco' told a more focus and accuracy version of life & death with unique twist and turns, a little better than the other movie, even if bits of 'Coco's foreshadowing is a little shallow & predictable. While, the afterlife sequences still contains some potentially disturbing imagery, most kids will probably get used to all, quickly. However, a few others tension might be, a little rough such as the out of nowhere, murder subplot. It's been days, I'm still shock, on how the villain manage not being caught for his crimes for so long, even after he admits to poisoning on film. Nor do I understand, why he would do that, in story. Does, he have that huge of an ego!? Also, is it just me, or does it seem odd, that, the character can't write music, but he's somehow able to write scripts. It's bizarre; just like how dead people have jobs in the afterlife, even, when there is no such thing as money. Nevertheless, while both movies has huge gaps of logic. These two parallel works couldn't be more different with the direction. After all, Día de los Muertos was never, truly about one man stuck between the battles between two supernatural beings for the rights to own the dead. It was, about the rights of the dead to visit, their love ones; which 'Coco' really did capitalize on, better. Because of this, I found 'Coco' to be a little more emotional well rounded for the viewers than the far out there, epic fantasy 'Book of Life' ever could be. Despite being a little clichés & over familiar; powerful themes of perseverance, teamwork, and appreciate your their family, while following your dreams will make audience love this movie, even a little more. Trust me, when I say this, there were a lot of moments, throughout 'Coco', where the audience will indeed shed a tear or two. It will be especially moving for anyone who's had to separate from their family, whether because of death or another reasons. There is also smart commentary on the immigration complications that it's happening, in today's world. Even if we're not from that culture, deep inside us, we can all relate to the story of their struggles. This rare musical story from Pixars really get you to felt something, regardless. While, the screen writing was mostly alright; the songs in the film, such as 'Remember Me,' an original song from Robert and Kristen Lopez and other songs written and produced by a team of Mexican songwriters and consultants, including award winning composer Michael Giacchino score, will make you cry, cheer and laugh with its five different musical versions (Ranchero, Lullaby, Reminiscing, Power Ballard, and Pop Version). Not only that, but 'Coco' original soundtrack felt more of authentic with its Latin Mariachi sounding songs, than the other movie's generic bubble gum homage covers of popular US billboard track music. Because of that, I felt that 'Coco's music will be a little more memorable, over time. Another thing that help this movie separate itself from the other movie is that all the voice actors were, in fact, Latinos. It's nice to see that; since, providing Latin American's cultures through speech is really hard to pull, if you're not from there. All of the voice performers in 'Coco' did a great job, singing and acting, both in Spanish & English. However, the Spanish version does have some problems. One is the title. Not only does 'Coco' mean supernatural connections, but sadly, it's also means, the name, the native people of Mexico gave to smallpox. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem with Disney & Latin American relationship. Trademarking 'Dia de los Muertos' for merchandising applications, also cause controversial. Other marketing blunder, Disney did, was attached this film with badly receive, critical failure 2017's short film, 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure'. Replaying 'Dante's lunch' (2017) would mesh better. Despite that, overall: I have to say, heavily idealistic, emotional, and touching. 'Coco' is a must watch. Viva Mexico!",9,4,8,4 December 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Time to Chew the Fat
","Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is a awesome classic children's book, but it's doesn't chew right as a good movie. It's rainy cheese and it's somewhat smells bad. Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is a inventor whose contraptions end up not working as plan. His newest item accidentally unleashed on the world, turns out to be his biggest success. Flint Lockwood is able to turn the weather, into a food raining frenzy. The people quickly loves it, making friends out of enemies with overprotection cop Earl (Mr. T) and town mascot local hero 'Baby' Brett (Andy Sanberg) and slowly grew to like Flint for it. No one was as huge as a fan as the Mayor (Bruce Campbell) whoms seeks to make Flint's town of Shallows Falls into a tourism destination with help with weather girl Sam (Anna Faris). As the Swallow Falls residents become greedier with their daily meal requests, Flint's invention becomes more and more overheated -- until it leads to a culinary disaster that could destroy the world. In which in the end kind of does. In the end, Flint Lockwood does bring chaos and damage across the world, not counting the countless numbers of death cause by this doomsday machine that creates the hurricane of pasta and avalanche of leftovers. This age-appropriate 3-D food adventure doesn't fully satisfy at all. Parents need to know that this adaptation of the classic children's book is bound to attract the10-and-under set as show by it's lack of depth in the character development department. There's no emotional attachment to the main characters, the way you feel about others. The characters seems cookie cut, over the top cartoons and is a tad unengaged for adult and young adults audiences, who are by now used to more sophisticated animated films. For a character supposedly smart, most of the movie treats its viewers with stereotype common popcorn arch story lines, audiences see in other rush movies with boy meet girl, boy create chaos and fix it . Not every, main female character should end up liking the main male character. The movie seems quickly producted without looking for key things to stand out. The relationship between Sam and Flint was a bit disturbing in a stalker type of way. Yes, they are socially-awkward, smarter-than-you-might-think type of characters, but this film formula would be suite for films of PG or PG13 standards than young childs who doesn't know about relationship. Talking about relationship, although no grand life lessons are offered, the movie does center on a son's need for fatherly encouragement and the idea that you shouldn't compromise who you are just to be popular. They never really explain why Flint's father (James Caan) couldn't understood Flint, when its clearly in the opening shot that he approved of his work, and commonly helps Flint with his work. It's doesn't help that Flint doesn't want to get to know more about his father by trying to understand his life. We don't know what made Brett chances his opinion on Flint so much toward the end, when in the first quarter he clearly acts like a jerk as well. The movie, by comparison, seems like a cautionary tale about dependence on genetically modified 'techno-food' -- a science experiment gone amok. There's nothing overtly age-inappropriate in the movie, expect a bit of salty language, some potty humor and and the occasional mild insult. The few tense/slightly scary scenes are weather- and giant food-related -- which could upset little kids who are sensitive to fears about natural disasters. The animation is mediocre at best. The food doesn't stick to people's clothing in some scenes, yet others it does. The leftovers don't grow old or look like it's smells. The body types don't match well with the animation. It's not that great, but the film seems like a step backward in serious sophisticated cartoons, even though it's an obvious transition into the profitable 3-D genre. The movie's plot is very different than the book's, so anyone expecting a straight adaptation will be disappointed. Give it a watch. If you can like the taste, you can eat it up, if not-- just spill it out.",6,3,5,22 November 2012
1917," I can't stay quiet on the western front. This war movie needs to be heard. 1917 is an intense powerful film.
","This 2019 motion picture tells the harrowing story of two British World War 1 Tommies soldiers William Schofield (George MacKay) & Thomas Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) who are ordered to deliver a message about a German ambush before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie too much, composer Thomas Newman's music is jaw dropping haunting yet beautiful to listen to. 'The Night Window', 'Gehenna' and 'Sixteen Hundred Men' are some of the best tracks I ever heard in a war movie. Along with that, the visuals by cinematographer Roger Deakins with his crew are epic. They really did capture the perspective of what a soldier from the first world war will go through with the visuals. Everything about the camera work was near perfect. To add onto that the film was so meticulous edited that it really did look like the entire film was shot with one continuous real time seamless take. It's hard to spot where the cuts are. While some people might think that this way of shooting is highly distracting and gimmicky. The long take sequence wasn't too much of a turn off for me. I think that way of filming works within the story as it shows how vast the scale the dangerous journey is and how much time it takes to get place to place in order to save lives. However, the contrived coincidence moments involving the milk and the truck transfer just appearance out of nowhere was kinda jarring. Plus, I would had like to see the film done without the whole black out intermission flash forward sequence. That took me out of the story a bit as I was reminded that I was watching a film rather than real time occurrence but that's nitpicking. If anything, most of sophisticated camera movement was surprisingly smooth for a war movie. Glad to see that they went the spiritualism third person viewpoint rather than the first-person shaking cam look with their plan sequence. You really get to see all the details such as the vast number of extras with historical well-made accurate costume & make up work trapped in a claustrophobia sandbag trench surround by muddled empty field of craters full of corpses, barb wire, and shell cases. Then there is the wore down farm house including the burn out ruins of the urban settling that reminds the audience that the battles of WW1 weren't always fought in nowhere trenches, but also around people's homes. Surprisingly for a war movie, there was a very limited amount of action scenes here. Instead most of the film has the characters move from one upsetting site to other to build fear and suspense. For the most part, it kinda works. I would rather have that rather than a poorly done large CGI battle. The fake looking special feature failure of Schofield jumping off a cliff into a river to escape the Germans was enough to prove that direction would not work. Instead just seeing them scout around was very intense as invisible enemies are always hinted to be nearby. The acting from these two along with the supporting cameos of several seasonal performers like Colin Firth, Mark Strong & Benedict Cumberbatch was top notch. You really do see the anxiety and heart break spill out within their faces. The movie could has work with just the two main characters being silent and letting the body language speak for itself. However, I do get that it might cause the characters to seem more fictional shallow one-dimensional everymen that the audience can put themselves into rather than realistic living breathing human beings. Nevertheless, I felt that most of the dialogue between them could had been more detail. I really didn't get a grasp of who these characters really were. Regardless I did like the small semi conflict between the two over patriotism and just wanting to survive the war. After all, WW1 by contrast was a global conflagration in which nationalism was the spark. While other war movies might pick a patriotic or antiwar side. This movie was just more focus about the goal of enough saving individuals as possible rather than making a political statement for or against war. There is no better example of that than the beautiful reading of Edward Lear 'the Jumblies' poet sequence & the haunting singing of 'I am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger' later on the film. The character at first feels like he is just a wander in a deadly nonsensical world. Until he finds purpose by seeing unsung heroic done by his comrade for the immediate love of the family unit. That's deep character development. We also see this with the symbolism of the white cherry trees throughout the film. They are use to represent both death and life. For example, the cutting of the trees are the first signs of the salt the earth strategy employed in the war, yet the film points out that in the long run it will result in even more cherry trees growing in the area. The movie even opens and closes in a tree of life settling. It's very powerful metaphor. Fortunately, contrary to many other works about World War I, the film makes no attempt to show sympathy with enemy soldiers. Germans troops in the film are portrayal as uncivilized brute killers when in truth, most of them hold the same moral valor and honor as the allies. While the movie does take others artistic liberties such as the mixer of British units when most of them were regionally recruited and weapons like Mark II tank yet to made. For the most part, the film is historical accurate despite most of it was loosely based on various real-life accounts that director and cowriter Sam Mendes's grandfather told him in his youth. Although the screenplay by Krysty Wilson Cairns might be fictional set in a real historical backdrop; '1917' is one film worth fighting in the trenches for. Highly recommended.",9,3,4,19 March 2020
Lincoln," Lincoln is not a perfect film, but it is an important film
","I'm not a historian, but I do agree, that the audience is spoon fed a story where Lincoln is always the crusader against slavery, and everyone else is playing politics against him. Seeing Lincoln only as always fighting slavery painted the most unrealistic picture of Lincoln, I've ever seen. While it is true that Lincoln regarded slavery as an evil and harmful institution, it is also true, that he shared the conviction of most Americans of his time, and of many prominent statesmen before and after him, that blacks could not be assimilated into white society. He rejected the notion of social equality of the races, and held to the view that blacks should be resettled abroad. As President, he supported projects to remove blacks from the United States as well suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which allowed him to arrest thousands of U.S. citizens that protest against him. This Steven Spielberg movie borders on propaganda somewhat, as the media hold Lincoln to be about the closest thing to a Biblical figure in American history without really looking at those facts. The movie makes 'Lincoln' look like that everybody love him at the time, while a small few whom has slaves are against him. It's hardly the truth. Not all people that protest against him was because they for slavery. He was just as unpopular in the north during the war for his attempts among other things to control the press. He didn't become God-like popular until after his assassination. The movie was to sanitized and staid for my tastes, but it does somewhat show how Lincoln certainly willing to do questionable rule-breaking actions for the greater good. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and there's a certain amount of rule-skirting that's right and proper when engaging in a noble mission like the abolition of slavery. Still the movie placed Lincoln the man on a near messianic level. He was a man of great accomplishments--maybe the greatest President--but he was not the faultless figure portrayed in this picture, still Lincoln the movie is a moving piece. The movie starts with two fan boys soldiers quoting Lincoln's greatest speech--'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation' after witnessing the brutal civil war battle in the rain between Black Soldiers and White Rebels. It's set the tone of the film, it's about trying to heal the country during the closest months of the war. There will be no more battle footage beyond this point, as the battle go from the fields to the House of Representatives. The pacing of the film is not for all audience, as the movie can seem boring to those who seeking an action-packed Civil War movie. Anybody seeking a movie like that will be disappointed. The movie focus more on efforts, during January 1865, to obtain passage for the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the house which would formally abolish slavery while seeking for peace with the South. Daniel Day Lewis is magnificent in the role, the acting in the film was just awesome. He can really show Lincoln's melancholy side, his weird side of humor, and Lincoln's great use of story-telling. He will scoop the Oscar without doubt. The make up in the film makes him look like Lincoln to the point, it wasn't Daniel Day Lewis playing Lincoln, but Lincoln playing Lincoln. So uncanny. Daniel is surrounding by a great supporting cast, such as Sally Fields playing Mary Todd Lincoln. She was the right actress to portray all the fragility and complexity that was Mary Todd. There was sub-plots about Lincoln dealing with his oldest child Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), joining the Army. The way, Mary Todd makes Lincoln's life miserables over this issue is interesting scene. It's creepy when she mention the death of their other child like that. I'm surprised the film didn't bother dealing Lincoln's homosexual overtones with others men as a way to get away from Mary Todd, but it's explain a bit the sexual history between Mary Todd and Lincoln by stating out that Lincoln was too busy with the war to be the husband that Mary Todd wanted. The scene where Mary Todd hold Thaddeus is smart, but I was kinda disappointed with Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens. Tommy Lee Jones was good, but I'm so used to Tommy Lee Jones playing this type of role that I was kinda bored by his performance. It felt like Tommy Lee Jones playing Tommy Lee Jones. I groaned at the obvious foreshadowing of Lincoln's death, but the movie doesn't show the assassination. It felt like a lost chance to make the audience feel more for the character, as it's probably one of the reasons, people went to see this film. They wanted to feel sad about Lincoln dying. Sadly, the large movie audiences won't appreciate this film, because there's a fine line between learning history and living history. While the movie makes history come alive, it's doesn't have the features to draw people to see a movie. There is little violence, no nudity, and has way too much talking scenes. A lot of people will be missing out of this movie just because of those reasons. Check it out-- and see it yourself. You will find yourself, smarter and wiser after watching it.",8,4,7,21 January 2013
Children of Men," Oh Man, yes! Children of Men deserve the rights to be call all-time masterpiece. It's one of my favorite movies
","Loosely based on a novel of the same name by author P.D James, 2006's apocalyptic thriller 'Children of Men' tells the story of Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a disillusioned bureaucrat who spends most of his days wallowing in drunken self-pity as the world around him, dies a little each day, due to the fact that the human race has been rendered infertile. But that all changes when he's abducted, and force by his ex-wife turn refugee freedom fighter, Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) to agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman, Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitney) around a war-torn England to a sanctuary at sea. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, certain audience members might hate this movie for the lack of exposition. I have to say, does do enough, as the movie opens with a new casting. Even without that, 'Children of Men' still explores the themes of hope and faith in the face of overwhelming futility and despair, so well, with visual effects and well-crafted music that it didn't need to tell it through words. You see how the world deals with issues like immigration through the background and sounds that it plays. You know that something isn't right. The War on Terror looks more like the Holocaust. It tells you in an interesting subtle way by lingering on it, even if the foreground has pass the camera frame. It's brilliant filmmaking. It also rich in symbolism, both historic, political, religious, and cultural. You can't help, seeing images that remind you of arts, ranging both modern and classic. Works like Sandro Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus' to Michelangelo's 'Pietà hit you very strong with feelings. The film's visuals is also full of references to famous literature works such as George Orwell's novel 'Animal Farm' to T.S Eliot's poem 'The Wasteland'. Plus, you can't get away from all the Christ imagery. While, some of these imageries can be a bit heavy-handed. Most of it wasn't annoying like other films. Plus, I like how the visuals for this movie, help influence other works like 2013's video game 'Last of Us' & 2016's film 'Logan'. The cinematography from both Emmanuel Lubeski & director Alfonso Cuarón was amazing. The use of dark color palette really shows the bleak dystopian future, the film was going for. However, the most obvious achievement for this film, was the consistent use of long takes. Scenes like the 'Car Ambush' & 'the Tank' moments are some of the best well-shot sequence, I have ever saw, in a movie. The film is full of top-notch action scenes like that, that comes off as chaotic, despite being meticulously planned out. Cuarón shoots most of these scenes like a combat documentary, using hand-held cameras. Thank goodness, for no shaky cam. I also like how the film used natural light wherever possible. You see, a lot of it, in early dawn in the urban centers, and the forest sequences. While, the camera shots are impressive; the acting in this movie is just as good. The people in this fictional world is reflection of our current society. It shows a range of human emotions: ranging from anger to violence, hopeful to religious, disengage to hedonism, and downright depressing to defeat. Everybody in this film has a role to play, and all the actors pull it off, even Michael Caine as Jasper; whom I think, is the weakest of the characters. I think, they pull it off, even if in order to bring the book to the big screen, several key character roles were switched and streamlined. Theo as a government worker rather than an Oxford Historian, makes more sense. Other great things, the film change or delete, was the way, Theo's kids die, and his unneeded love triangle with Julian and another man, and Theo's over the top brotherhood with cartoony evil villain of warden Xan. I also like, how the film stick to a one place settling, rather than going with the novel's idea of Theo going on vacation to a different continent. It makes it, seem that travelling is dangerous and not easy to do. However, some of the changes felt a bit not wised. Julian's new role as the rebel freedom fighter, rather than the carrier was somewhat a downgraded; seeing her original role, not only affect with the people around her, but also the whole country. Also, the new ending with the ship of 'Tomorrow' felt a bit, out of place. I get the Human Project, part, but why would a reproductive medicine team would need be in the ocean to do their studies. Did I miss, something, political here? As much, as I hate the Xan being comically evil in the novel; I would still rather have the 'coronation ring' ending, instead. Despite that, I did think the film did the right decision, with switching the infertility from male to female. It makes the film's ending, a lot more ambiguous, & bittersweet. Overall: As far as dystopia sci-films go, it doesn't go much higher than this movie. 'Children of Men' is quite simply one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Thought-provoking and spry. It will aged well, overtime. You will get a lot with repeat viewings. Highly recommended.",8,3,5,30 March 2017
Garden State," Garden State of Mind
","Great debut from Zach as writer/director/actor in a soporific type performance that inspires the open minded. The movie is just as beautiful to watch, as if watching Adam from the Garden of Eden coming alive for the first time Adam taste the forbidden food, as Andrew Largeman (Zack Braff), a moderately successful TV actor living in LA has been going through life in a drug lithium-induced coma until his mother's death inspired a vacation from the pills to see what might happen to truly taste life. Zack does a great job on his character, as it's so unlike his role as J.D in the TV Show 'Scrubs'. Andrew is medicated with antidepressants and therefore emotionally numb. Braff depicted perfectly that feeling of aloofness when you are just not into taking drugs with a crowd you don't really know. This captures the dissociative nature of the drug experience so well. the way drugs alter your thinking can be stimulating and exciting but at times very unsettling in others. So sick of drug use being glamorized, and sick of seeing it in almost every movie, but in this film, it's really does show the negative light of it. In my opinion, the character development is part of what makes this movie fantastic. He returns to New Jersey AKA the Garden State for a few days to attend his mother's funeral staying with his domineering over barely father Gideon (Ian Holms) who also his doctor. Meanwhile, at home, he does his best to avoid a long-simmering but inevitable confrontation with his father. Stunned to find himself in his hometown after such a long absence, Large finds old acquaintances around every corner living quite unique lives as gravediggers like Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), fast food knights (Jim Parsons), rich inventors (Armando Riesco) and the panderers of pyramid schemes. Not only that, Large meets Sam (Natalie Portman) at the hospital for a check up, a girl who is everything he isn't. A blast of color, hope and quirks, but also corky pathological liar with epilepsy. Natalie does a great job in the role, making her charming and innocent, yet somebody trying to open up to somebody herself. He opens up his life to Sam for the first time, with speeches in both the pool and bathtub. 'The Home Speech' is just great writing from Zack Braff. This scene is great. And I love their conversation. But it always made me giggle,because the way that their heads are just at the surface of the water, and the way that their bodies look under the water. It looks like big heads with no necks and little legs. This movie has plenty of deep meanings which works with the beautiful camera shots. Some of them are written, some of them just out there for the audience to figure them out. The 't-shirt' in the bathroom scene, the children crossing the street, the alligator ice skating, and the 'Ark' on the edge of infinite abyss. This movie looks amazing I love the way it is shot, very good cinematography! Suspiciously﻿ Wes Anderson-y. Not only the great cinematography. Zach has an amazing good taste in music. The music like New Slang-The Shins, Fair-Remy Zero, The only living boy in New York-Simon & Garfunkel, Let go-Frou Frou, Don't Panic-Coldplay, Such Great Heights-irone and wine all works, but the film get criticize for being a hipster movie, personally I don't see that. If the film need some criticize, it's will be with the pretentious. I can do without Methon Man cameo and the hotel scenes. It feel disturbing. Not needed. The many contemplation Zack Braff poses can be annoying. He can be poster boy for narcissism, heralding in the facebook generation. I think it has something to do with the how there's so much going on in his head but it doesn't show through to an outsider's perspective. Some people just live life without thinking and some think through life without living. There's a middle ground in there somewhere but there are people that are so far off to one side they can barely function. The movie is about him trying to get his bearings on life. Strangers think he's just bored but those who relate to him know better. Criticize can say, how much it's mirror Zack's real life's life. Funny, how Andrew, a waiter at Vietnamese restaurant. Before he played in Scrubs, Zack actually was a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant . He's struggled with OCD since he was ten. Also his character has been medicated since he was ten. He's also Jewish in real life and his parents were a sociologist and a psychologist. He's really from New Jersey. Also at first he really struggled becoming an actor until he got his break with Scrubs. I mean the movie isn't his biography but the basis is from his life. Still it's discomfort, combined with laughter. Kudo to Zack, that's a hard combo to do. This ending to this film is perfect, because life is just a series of moments and decisions we make, and he needs to make one right there that could changes everything. We don't see what happens next, because we don't need to. Funny how the last part of this scene takes place in a 'baggage claim' area too. Sam warmth and fearlessness give Large the courage to open his heart to the joy and pain of the infinite abyss that is life. The question is, will Andrew have the courage to face his father, and accede Sam into his life. Watch the movie to find out.",8,0,0,22 January 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," What's this!? This is a good movie, sir.
","Nightmare before Christmas is a movie that you can watch both on Halloween and Christmas and the time between them. The Nightmare before Christmas is often mistaken as a Tim Burton's film. While Tim Burton did indeed produce and helped write the story when it was first thought out as a poem. It was director Henry Selick that made the movie that most people all love. I will give mad props to Selick and the hundreds of animators that work on this 74 minutes film as the stop motion in this film is amazing. There were little to minor mistakes, that aren't very noticeable. The movie tells the story of Jack Skellington (Voice by Chris Sarandon), a skeleton from Halloween Town whom is having a identify crisis, he is tired of celebrating Halloween. In a state of depression, he wanders off into the forest, only to finds himself in Christmas Town. He found the holiday very fascinating and decides to steal that holiday instead; that leaded to deadly consequences. I think there is a lot of symbolism in the film that mirrors how modern society Christmas is so different than the original holiday in which it was based on. There are several trees with special doors on them by their symbols it is clear they are portals to other holiday worlds. However, Jack finds it difficult to come up with definitions for these symbols. His followers are also unfamiliar with these themes can only relate them with what they see in their normal Halloween culture. Jack has an abstract definition that he has learnt through books, but he never gets a chance to live and experience the meaning of Christmas. This leaves him with an unclear vision, and therefore an unclear understanding how it works. Like Jack Skellington, modern society know little of what Christmas is really about; only knowing it as the capitalism materialism ritual form. Thus, Christmas have become less about spreading love, and more on what society deed is what it an expression of love. Modern Christmas due to appealing nature, has began to become too big and popular to the point that it over-lapped the other holidays. While this might seem like a good thing, it does disinterest or lost of others cultural traditions. The film took inspirations from older stop motion television specials classics like 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with its style. I like how Halloween Town, looks like something out of a German Expressionism film. The score in the movie is amazing by Danny Elfman. I love all the songs in this film from 'Kidnapping the Santa Claws', 'Sally's Song' to 'What's this?'. All of them are beautiful to the ears. The songs have often been cover over the years by bands like Fall Out Boy, Korn, All-American Rejects, Flyleaf, Panic at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, and others. I think the Fall Out Boys is the best cover. The movie might seem a bit too scary for little children. Hints why Disney decided to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner. Due to the popularity of the film, Walt Disney Pictures has reissued the film annually under their Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D. I saw the 2D and 3D versions, and I don't see much of a different, really. The supporting cast was very interesting. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake is one of the best Disney villains ever. I don't find the character as racist as of some members of NAACP due to its jiving and dancing nature. Oogie Boogie is a bogeyman type creature, not Black-face. That's total nonsense, NAACP. It's weird in a way, that Catherine O'Hara voice Sally: A rag doll-like creature that is Jack's love interest as Sally doesn't sound like O'Hara at all. Glenn Shadix as Mayor of Halloween Town: An enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings was hilarious with his wild mood swings. I just didn't like the Santa Claus's character. He seems like he was a jerk who is tired of Christmas. Overall: With excellent writing, stop-motion animation, legendary soundtrack, stunning visuals, wonderful story, likable characters, with little flaws, it's truly a classic.",8,2,2,22 December 2013
Big Hero 6," Don't be a hairy baby! Go see Big Hero Six! Big Hero Six is a lot of fun. Fist bump! Balalalala
","Loosely based by the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name by Duncan Rouleau and Steven T. Seagle, the action comedy adventure is about a young brilliant robotics prodigy boy Hiro Hamada (Voiced by Ryan Potter), who finds the only hope of stopping a criminal plot that will threatens to destroy his fast-paced, high-tech home town city of San Fransokyo is become a superhero, himself. With the help of his health care provider and closest companion—a robot named Baymax (Voiced by Scott Adsit), Hiro joins forces with a reluctant team of first-time crime fighters on a mission to save their city. The film is directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, and is the 54th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Studio Classics series. Much of the comic book original premise, is mostly gone, and replace by new concept. People like Silver Samurai, the bodyguard to X-Men/Avengers foe Madame Hydra/Viper & former X-Men team member Sunfire are omitted from here. Hiro is mostly the same from the comic book, but it still doesn't make sense why Hiro had to be orphan. It never play, much into the screen. Are all superheroes supposed to have their parents killed?? Kinda lame. Comic Characters like Honey Lemon (Voiced by Genesis Rodriguez) are recreated with new characteristics. Instead a hot blonde Japanese girl with the ability to access items from another dimension through her magic purse; she now a quirky chemistry Hispanic-Caucasian major, with the skills set to allow her to create a purse to mix different chemical elements into balls that she can use as explosives & traps. Her story about being the nano-bots inventor was also rip away. Other members like GoGo Tomago (Voiced by Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Voiced by Damon Wayans, Jr.) & Fred (Voiced by T.J Miller) had the same similar powers, but bits of their characters were change to meet the PG levels of Disney's key audience. The biggest change is Baymax from scary robotic dragon lizard monster to lovable inflatable robot built by Hiro's brother Tadashi (Voiced by Daniel Henney). I love the change. Much of the humor of the film, comes with the fact that Baymax is limited in human understanding and asking a lot of questions. This can be a bit annoying, but kids will love him due to the cute and hilarious kind nature. Some of the originals fans of the comic, might find this part, disappointing, but most of the new things, they added, works out for the best. There have been two releases of this comic in the mid-90s and 2008 and both were criticized as being racist and offensive. All the characters were Asian, but were based on stereotypes. Basically, it was Marvel trying to be Manga. When Disney approached Marvel and asked to make a movie on the comics, Marvel had pretty much forgotten about it and told them they could do whatever they wanted with the story and characters. This is why there's a lot more diversity among the members and that the Asian characters were portrayed respectively. Some things, I didn't like with the changes was, how the movie was set in a fictional city of San Fransokyo rather than Japan. The movie city name doesn't really exactly roll off the tongue, here. Plus, it's kinda disturbing in a way, as if the movie was saying, what would happen in Japan won World War 2 or the tech war of the 1980s? It didn't look right. I know, the filmmakers felt like they wanted to create a world; that would separate themselves from the other Disney's Marvels canon, but the movie portray Japanese culture, a bit too gimmicky. Did they feel that an American audience wouldn't see a film, set in Japan? I'm also disappoint that the movie didn't use more of the Anime-influenced animation style. There were hints of it, like how Hiro's hairstyle, but the film really stay away from that. The only part of the film that has it, is the end credits, as the characters are drawn in typical anime and manga format with Marvel comic pastels and printing. The movie is more Americanizes than ever. It's still nice to see the main characters in the film, are played by Japanese-Americans, you rarely see that in Western Culture Mainstream films. The voice acting is very well-played. All the actors did a good job. I even like the special guest cameo after the credits. It was pretty cool to see him, again. The music score was alright, but pretty forgettable. The movie is great to watch in 3D. The action scenes really do pop out! The animation is pretty beautiful to look at. It's nice to see that Disney Animation Studios is hitting home runs after years of disappointing films. For a while, it was very under looked by the power of Pixar Studios. I really enjoyed this movie, but I had more love for the characters than I did for the story. I hate to admit it, but the movie is a bit predictable and one-dimensional. I saw the twist coming, miles away. The American trailer focuses more on action and comedy, while the Japanese trailer delves more into the drama of the story. Still, there are bits in the second trailer that kinda spoils a lot of the things that supposed to make the film, more emotional and suspenseful. It was little to no surprise, what happen to Hiro's brother, but his part in the film plot drag really slowly. Big Hero 6 was released on DVD with the short film 'Feast' with it. The short film was alright. The movie has a ton of Easter eggs throughout the film of previous Disney Studios works so look for a lot of freeze-frame moments. It will give you a lot of replay value. Overall: I am satisfied with my care. It was a pretty good, movie.",8,23,34,30 November 2014
Grave of the Fireflies," It's one of the most depressing movies ever!
","I have to say this movie is really hard to get through. It's so heart breaking. Grave of the Fireflies is based on the semi-autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka. While the movie is well-made, there isn't much of a story arch. The opening minutes of the film, pretty much explains what happen to the characters of the film. There is little to no point of watching the film if you know it doesn't end well for them. People love watching Survival movies, because they know that the character will beat the odds and live. If you open the movie, knowing the characters are doom from the start. It put out that tribute of the human spirit out, quickly and you're just left in the dark. The movie by director Iaso Takahata (co-founder with Hayao Miyazaki's fame animation studio, Studio Ghibli) has this very dark overwhelming guilt trip hanging over it, like a black cloud. While, some people quoted the film, one of the most anti-war films of all time. The reason why Iaso Takahata made the film, is convey the image of the family living a failed life due to seclusion from society. While also, invoking sympathy in the 1980's youth of Japan, whom the director felt needed to straighten up and respect their elders for the pain and suffering they had experienced during World War 2. I found the movie trying really too hard to make sympathy for the two leads. Throughout the film, the movie had a lot of padding, only there for making us feel warm hearted to the characters. It could have easily been removed from the plot without affecting the story significantly. The film tells the story of two orphans trying to survive on their own, Seita (voice by Tsutomu Tatsumi in Japanese, J. Robert Spencer or Adam Gibbs in English version) & Setsuko (voice by Ayano Shiraishi in Japanese, Rhoda Chrosite or Emily Neves in English version) after their mother is killed in a firebombing raid by the Allies. Most of the English dubbing is mediocre, at best. The supporting cast pretty much read their lines without much emotion added to it. In my opinion, it's just better to watch the movie in Japanese with English sub-titles. The animation is pretty good at the time, but I did notice they did reused multiplies shots for the fire-bombing scenes. Also, in some scenes, the figures in the background tend to limited in animation. I would gladly want more. Like I said before, the whole story and characters are just one-dimension, and has no story arch to it. I think the 2005's life action version, delivers the characters arch even better. In that version, we see why the Aunt became crude and mean to them, due to the limit of food, rather than being told about it, in this film. She has selfish impulses as she singles Seita out and resents the fact that the kids get special treatment because their father is a Navy man. She accuses Seita of being lazy and not supporting the war effort, and praises those who do. Eventually, Seita grows tired of her criticisms and sets off on his own with his sister in tow, believing in his own capabilities to care for the two of them. In the end, he could had learn how to swallow his pride, but nothing is clarify here. All I know is his naiveté and pride end up shutting him away from the rest of society and cause doom for himself and his sister. Blind patriotism is talk throughout the film, that masks selfish impulses during the war and, afterward, Japan's inability to confront this past. The movie does use great symbolism with the fireflies. Like human beings, firefly shine from the inside out, as if liberating its interior beauty. Only in facing darkness, does the fireflies stand out. Fireflies represent light, illumination and mysterious. Fireflies symbolize inspiration and hope. Another symbol of the fireflies represent is guidance. The natural instinct of a being is to follow the light instead of getting lost in the night. And it's true that when you're walking in the night and you suddenly see a firefly, your natural reflex is to follow it, because it is fascinating, and because it looks like it's guiding us towards the right path. The Sakuma fruit drops is another symbol, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. The quick emptying box of fruit candies stands for disappearing hope, that get refill by ash. Ash represented sacrifice, sensitivity and higher awareness. In a way, while not explain, the box that Seita carry around, is indeed his mom's ashes. It's weird in a way, that this film was initially distributed with the 1988's My Neighbor Totoro because the different in the films. One is really happy, while this film lead audience saddened. In the end, My neighbor Totoro became the more popular of the two. Overall: Wonderful tear-jerker based on autobiographic novel. While, the film is market to children and their parent. I doubt many children would like this film. However, I think it's a film that children indeed need to see, when they mature enough.",9,6,7,7 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Jedi. This movie is not going to go the way you think & that is a good thing. I like surprises.
","Just in case you live under a rock in Jakku. This movie has been rather divisive for audiences, despite the fact, that the visual/special effects from ILM were impressive, the sets & costume were beautiful, the film score by John Williams was amazing, and the action scenes, while, nothing really new, was entertaining enough to get by. Most of the criticism, come from director/writer, Rian Johnson's sharp retelling on the space fantasy mythos. Some examples, being discuss & highly criticize about, is how the sequel does not sync up, well, with the previous movie, 2015's 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' continuous story elements. Fundamentals key points, like Rey (Daisy Ridley)'s journey for closure with her parentage, the disaster-like effects of the Resistance & First Order, losing key battles, like Starkiller Base & Hosnian Prime, and Kylo (Adam Driver)'s quest to kill, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) with his knights of Ren, were downright ignored, talk little about, or turn into 'red herrings'. Even, significant original trilogy (1977's A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) establishment tropes, like powers of light-speed travel & how force projection works, are drastically changed to serve Johnson's vision, thus, become a little more muddled for the fans, on what, characters & vehicles can and cannot do. So, it was no surprised, these changes to the mythos, rub people, the wrong way. For me, I really didn't mind too much, as excessively familiar with no mystery, can led to mediocre rehash writing. Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed, by certain story beats that the film glaze over, such as how Snoke (Voiced & Motion Capture Performance by Andy Serkis) rose to power, or why the New Republic was so ill-prepared to stop him. You have to go to outside sources to find any information on this. The movie story is not so flesh out. Because of that, it weakened, the last movie and this. Another, frustrating thing about this film is the morality, it's trying to tell. Using examples of unseen forces, playing both sides into conflict: such with the 'on the nose', side-quest filler, through Canto Bight, the burning of the Jedi texts & the scenes onboard Snoke's ship, 'the Supremacy'; its seems that Johnson was going to take, the ultimate risk, by praising something that was good about the prequels (1999's Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith), by exposing how the universe isn't as cookie cutter good vs evil, as the original trios of films make it seems to be. However, it seem like he got cold-feet, and backpedaled, quite a bit, by this adult-driven nihilism approach. In the end, the film play it, safe, by showing yet another kid-friendly coercive persuasion repetition hopeful message. The climax with another naÃ¯ve generation following in the same footsteps of its forefathers into believing in one ideal symbol, over another; rather than seeing the whole picture; that seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent, was disappointing & somewhat cheesy. I wanted the film to show, that the old-school dualistic dogma thinking about morality is not that fundamental sound; as it only leads to the same tiresome continuous circle of violence. Because of that backpedaling, it kinda ruin any big counterculture beliefs like 'the Grey Jedi' concept; which I felt, would had work, better for these series of films. In short, it makes more sense that the only way, to find balance in the force is to walk the thin line, between the light & the dark. Maybe, producer and director, JJ Abrams would introduce that concept, in the next film. Regardless of that, this movie had other problems, going against it. A great deal of the film is devoted to a fleet chase scene that just wasn't that good of a premise; seeing how the First Order could have ended it, just by calling another fleet to interception the Resistance fleet during hyperspace travel, but whatever. The film had to go somewhere, even those sequences led only to more awkward & pointless filler doesn't really connect much, with what's happening on Ahch-To. Although, as much as the movie suffer from pacing issues; at least, most of the acting in the movie is good enough, to overlook it. Ridley as Rey was commanding in her role. Unlike some fans, I wasn't really bothered by how the picture portrayed Skywalker, as grumpy bitter old man/ teacher. Hamill was good in that type of a role. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa, on the other hand, felt a bit wasted, & misused. It's sad that this will be her last role. All people will remember from her in this movie is the 'Shooting Star' meme. As for Driver, he brings a certain gravitas to Kylo Ren that makes the character, one of the most interesting villain, in a long time. A fine good job from him. With John Boyega as Finn, I found him, less annoying in this, than the last movie. Boyega is enjoyable. Plus, he does have better comedy chops than Oscar Isaac, as Poe Dameron, ever had. Any jokes fed to Isaac felt force and awkward. As for supporting characters like Kelly Marie Tran, she never really deserve the racist attacks from some Star Wars fans who were dissatisfied with her character. She was alright, as newcomer, Rose Tico. Once again, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & felt that, Benicio Del Toro & Laura Dern were wasted in their roles, as well. As for the cameos, I like all of them. Overall: I somewhat enjoy the film even with its flaws. It was still an entertaining popcorn flick, worth going to. Nevertheless, films like this, are starting to feel more and more like a postmodern experience. While, the spirit of repetition doesn't sit lightly for some viewers, this movie brings enough nuance to the table to stand on its own. So seek it out. It's a force to reckon with.",7,5,15,22 January 2018
Brave," Time to brave here and give you my true opinion of the movie. I'll bear it all. Brave was pretty disappointing.
","The animation is beautiful, but it looks like they stole or mirror CGI designs from DreamWorks's 2010's How to Train a Dragon film. It get worst, as the story is mess. Directed by three people, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell & Mark Andrews, and set in medieval Scotland. The movie tells the story of Princess Merida (Voiced by Kelly McDonald) whom just come of age. Her over-bearing mother, Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson) is so intended is to keep her people alive, that she is willing to marry off, her daughter to the firstborn sons of the clan leaders, in hope for peace. Merida thinks, otherwise, ignored her duties, in hope, of making her own path in life. Soon enough, both women are, in the crosshairs, with each other. Both must learn to sacrifice, some their values, and ideals in hope to grow, a stronger, and meaningful relationship. Can they work out, their issues with each other or will their kingdom suffer, because of it? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I give credit where credit due, the writers did try to add something new to the Disney princess motifs, with the whole mother & daughter, mend the bond relationship. The problem with it, is the fact, that it's very underdeveloped. Not once, throughout the film, was I convince, that they truly understood each other's problems. The movie rarely gives them, any time to talk it out, and listen to each other, due to all the weak conflicts. I think Queen Elinor turning into a bear, kinda hurts the plot, since she's unable to show, her side of the story. It's very odd for Disney to do this. The usual talking animal trope that often comes with humans-turned-animals is sadly not here. Another problem with the plot is that it felt very recycle. The whole 'magic bear transformation lesson', storyline seem like a rip off, another Disney movie, 2003's Brother Bear. That movie did such a better job, in showing the dangers of selfishness, while understand responsibility when it comes to family and growing up within a community. While, yeah, they're two different movies; I felt like Brave fell flat where Brother Bear didn't. Personally, I think they should have removed these magic bear sub plot lines completely; and focus more, on the conflict of war & marriage. These magic odd legends that doesn't mesh well, with the rest of the film. First off, the curse of Mor'du and Merida situation only vaguely relate to each other, when it comes to theme of selfish in this movie. The curse, overall, deals more about total greed. While Merida is about breaking tradition for individual rights. Vastly different. Near the end, Merida and Eleanor fight this supposed selfishness curse altogether, to show that they're willing to change. Symbolism or not, though, it's still very sloppy writing. Another problem is the Will-o'-the-wisps. They're portray as good spirits, that help the protagonist lead her to her fate. This is far away from the truth folklore, in which they are evil beings that lure victims to their deaths. I don't understand, why Merida would trust these creatures; not once, but three times. They always lead her, to more misfortune. What is the movie, trying to say? That you have to be brave, but willing to let fate, lead you to own demise? I somewhat get the brave part, but who says, that you have to clueless and lead yourself to danger! Maybe, the movie should be, call 'stupid'. Anyways, Merida's problem was never, about how brave, she was. It's all about the issues, when it comes to her freedom of choice. The film is so heavily invest in that theme. So when, it tries hard to introduce, fate into the mix in the opening. Merida's message comes off, as confusing. Fate says that you have no choose, that decisions are meaningless and choices are an illusion. If Merida was so into her fate, why did she bother trying to change it, with the Highland Games and with the witch!? It doesn't seem brave, when you think about it. In many ways, this show how pointless, this movie with its choices. In the end, Merida doesn't really change, anything. While, the film is certainly set in a feministic world, where the women secretly control the state, while the men ruled in public. The agnatic seniority society still lives and she still has to marry somebody. All, she did was postpone her, trouble fate. That isn't brave at all! The whole easy conflict wasn't resolve, when it could had. It comes across as weak. I think the title, The Bear and the Bow is a much more apt title, because of that. When I think of 'Brave'. I'm thinking it was chosen to be subtly reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Scottish Oscar-winning blockbuster smash. No wonder, why the trailers for this film was so confused. Some of the trailers try to play up the 'epic adventure' while others emphasized Shrek-like slapstick, subversive humor. In reality, both weren't even close. The movie is shallow with its humor and the movie wasn't that epic. The movie is offensive, both to women and men. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Some accents are laughable and rough to hear. The historic anachronism are strong, epic music doesn't felt Scottish, and story fails to deliver a satisfying pay off, when the movie ends. The only highlight is the movie has a lot of Easter eggs cameos from other Pixar's films; that some viewers have started a Pixar film theory, where all the films were connection. Overall: It's a shame this film is such a mess. Best Animated movie of 2012!? I doubt, it, Academy. It's a wasted opportunity of something that could had been great. I absolutely have zero desire to ever visit again.",6,4,5,5 August 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy is out of this world fun. Very entertaining.
","When people first heard that Marvel Studio & Walt Disney Company were making Guardians of the Galaxy; a lot of people were scratching their heads, what & why!? First off, the comic book series created in 1968 by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan, wasn't that popular. Second off, there are way better comics that could be made into movies. Third, some critics thought that the movie couldn't be pull off. After all, who will go see a movie about a talking raccoon and walking one word talking tree? This movie prove, every doubter, wrong. It was very successful. You can pinpoint the exact moment in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy became a success, when the comic book was reboot in 2008 with the Annihilation: Conquest storyline. It was there, that the comic book, got a face-lift, with new characters, and new story lines. The film would use these comics as an outline, but even the film would change things around. As of most comic book characters, there are reimagining's, and different version of people's past. The film writers Nicole Perlman, and director James Gunn change the group from an interstellar group of space cops into a group of criminals turn super-heroes. James Gunn also add some really needed humor and indeed also a very awesome soundtrack, made from 1970s & 1980s hits. Great use of Blue Swede's version of 'Hooked on a Feeling'. The soundtrack on a mixtape in the Walkman, and the pop culture references work for the audience as it was a good way to stay connected to the real world. Too many, out-there fantasy would made the audience feel lost, and disconnect, as they can't relate with the characters. The story tells the story of a theft named Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who find himself, being chase down by an alien lunatic name Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) after rediscovering and stealing an Infinity Gem from an abandoned city. Along the way, he teams up with an alien Assassin, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), two alien bounty hunters, Rocket Raccoon & Groot (Voiced by Bradley Cooper & Vin Diesel), and a vengeance driven maniac named Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) to prevent Ronan from getting the stone and destroying entire planets that go against him. I wouldn't say, the plot is anything new from Marvel. It's pretty much the same plot in most of their films. It's just in space, this time. The movie did need a little more exposition, and things did felt a little bit rushed. The whole thing about them, becoming friends so quick seem a bit forced. There were a few good emotional scenes. The acting was pretty good for the main cast. Chris Pratt proves that he can be a main lead actor. Zoe Saldana is alright. Fans and children will probably go crazy over Rocket & Groot. Bradley Cooper did a great job. You really couldn't tell that it was him, the whole time. While, Vin Diesel is limited in his speak; he was charming. It was like watching Iron Giant if he was a tree. Last of the main actors, Dave Bautista was pretty good with his role. He has really improve his acting chops. The villains were alright. Lee Pace was menacing, but his character was a bit one-dimensional villain type. Karen Gillan as Nebula is just plan hot. She was pretty good as the henchmen. Still, there were a few supporting actors were a bit disappointing like Michael Rooker as Yondu or John C. Reilly as Corpsman Rhomann Dey. I'm sorry, but I can't picture, Rooker as an alien with his redneck voice. Also, I can't picture Reilly as a starship trooper with his overweight body. There were a few scenes that I just couldn't picture, as well. The movie became a bit too unrealistic even for a Sci-Fiction with scenes like the heroes surviving dry-freeze temperance in deep space or them surviving large spaceship crashes. I just had to suspense my disbelief to get through them. Still, for the most part, the movie was indeed great. The humor was mostly hits, then misses. I love the 'over my head' joke. For a PG-13, the language is a bit harsh, there were a lot of frighten imagery, and extreme violent, but I think it's still alright for most children to watch it. The special and visual effect are pretty awesome. The action scenes are really stunning to the eyes. The 3D works, but it's not a must to see it in 3D. Watching it in 2D was good enough. The movie is also comic book Easter eggs nest that would make any comic nerd come to see the film and notice. Look for the cameos of horror director Lloyd Kaufman, musician Rob Zombie, and comic book writer, Stan Lee in the film, when watching. The whole collector (Benicio Del Toro) scene had enough to get fans talking for months as it has a lot of characters from previous films. The post-credit sequence was a bit disappointment, as it didn't really, promote 2015's The Avengers, the Age of Ultron nor any hint at any other oncoming Marvel film. It was a bit of a bad joke. Why did the movie had to remind me that Howard the Duck still around? At less, we know, for sure that a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy will happen, one day. Overall: While, it's a good movie, it's not the best movie, I ever saw. It was indeed a pretty good popcorn film. I have to say, I can say I recommended watching this ragtag epic.",9,7,12,5 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Sometimes, it's the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine. This movie kinda does that.
","Let's decoded this movie! Are you paying attention? I hope you are. The whole opening, voice over narrating is just a brilliant way to get the audience to pay attention to the film. I like how the movie really challenge you to think. If you don't want to think, then the movie tells you to bugger off. It has some balls. The Imitation Game is a historical thriller film directed by Morten Tyldum, with a screenplay by Graham Moore loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. The movie is about British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), whom during World War 2, was trying to crack the Nazi Germany's Enigma code to help the Allies win the war. Without spoiling too much of it. The movie is indeed, Oscar baiting. It's bad and good. It has everything that the Oscars tend to like and want. First off, it's a periodic piece during World War 2 about a loose-cannon homosexuality genius, who might have some mental problems. This will clever help or hurt the film, as time goes on. Indeed, the film engrossing closer and closer to Oscar-caliber and would look so generic, because of those reasons. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, and its shows why he deserve to be a leading man. He really makes this part, his own. He delivered in every way in his acting. The supporting cast was just as good. This is one of the very few, Keira Knightley's films, that I can stand her. She was pretty good as Joan Clarke. Another good actor in the film, had to be Mark Strong as Sir Stewart Menzies. He was just wicked. Allen Leech as John Cairncross was amazing to watch. He had this presence in him that make the character very charming, even with the deep dark secrets, he hiding from everybody else. The movie framing was also well establish. You really get what year, the movie is trying to portray, when the film jump from one year to the other. Each flashbacks works within the story structure and you can easily tell them apart. In terms of historical accuracy, there was some criticism from other critics regarding the film's purported downplaying Alan Turing's homosexuality. I agree that the war effect should be the main focus of the film, but I disagree on them that the sub-plot of Alan Turing's homosexuality problems is overtaking the main plot of the high stakes game of life and death of solving of Enigma concept. It didn't undermined it, at all. I think, they downplay it enough, so that the main focus on the film is about the war effect than his homosexuality. Yes, the movie has a lot of twist and turns, like a secret Soviet double agent in their midst of solving the Enigma code, but it's in the small scale. It wasn't until, the Enigma problem was solve, that the movie then focus on moral questions and Turing's sexuality. I like how the movie has a ticking time bomb. You really can sense, the pressure and need of them, to solve this problem. It was well balanced. While the broad outline of Turing's life as depicted in the film is true, a number of historians have stated that elements within it represent distortions of what actually happened, especially in terms of Turing's work. First off, the movie gives way too much credit for him. Progress was actually made way before he join in 1939 and to say, that everybody was against his computer plan was an understatement. About Turing's social difficulties. He never had Asperger syndrome or seem near in the autism spectrum. He was very well-fit, physical and mentally. He got along with most of his colleagues in the colleges, he was teaching before and after the Bletchley Park project. With his co-workers in Hut 8. They say that he was very well-spoken and often jokes when there is free time. This is not coming from a small group of people. By the time of 1945, thousands of people were working on the project. Not only that, he work for a time with American scientists in Ohio and Washington on their coding problems. To think, that Alan Turing was in-closed from the world is understatement. About the fact, that he name the Enigma-breaking machine 'Christopher' in the film after Turing's childhood friend is very false. In actuality, the machine was widely known as the Bombe. It was originally designed in 1938 by Marian Rejewski, who along with other Polish cryptographers had had successes in decrypting Enigma messages during the 1930s. It wasn't anything new when Turing took over the machine. He just redesigned and made it effective. I can understand, why the writers didn't mention the real life setbacks after the codebreaking of Enigma, to highly the Hut 8's moral code about who lives and who dies, but to say that solving Enigma was their only problem isn't true. After solving the code, the Germen often change the design or the use of the German Enigma machines so that the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt, more and more as the war went on. In reality, decisions about when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence were made at much higher administrative levels. About Turing working with John Cairncross. It isn't true. There isn't enough evidence to prove that they ever met. About the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. It still a mystery if the suicide was accidental or not. Overall: it's still a pretty good film. It's hard to believe it took these many years for it to be produced. The film's screenplay often topped the annual Black List for best unproduced Hollywood scripts. This film will win Oscars. No doubt about that.",9,6,14,11 January 2015
8 Mile," You can lose yourself in 8-Mile. It's a pretty good movie.
","It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson, the movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit, struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith, whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way, he could show the world, he meets business, is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful, violent, and somewhat silly lyrics, ranging from killing his wife, homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see, Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly, I don't think this movie would had work, if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad, Eminem took this seriously. After all, after this movie, his music had gotten more serious, and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for 'Lose Yourself'. It was the first time a rap/hip-hop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem, the best rapper? It's up in the air, depending what you think is music. After all, 2005's Encore & 2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But, it's still hard not to find yourself, jamming to 'Lose Yourself' when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great, the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah, most of the raps were pretty funny and clever, both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends, playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good, all around. Eminem has never acted before this, but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor, Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love-interest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film, is the alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole sub-plot of her losing her home, a bit underdeveloped, as surprising near the climax, she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race, class, and segregation in the urban lower socio-economic environment. Indeed, it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood, when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs, murder, and loot. You really see how economic devastation and de-industrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting, until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly, another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit, but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day, because when I first saw it, I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie, it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong, it's R Rating for a reason, but I really think the producers were going for a PG-13 rating here. Yes, there's a lot of harsh language, but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall: If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one.",7,4,6,22 June 2014
Clash of the Titans," Trash of the Titans did release the Crap end! I meant the Kraken!
","Don't get me wrong, I like the whole movie start to finish, but it's so disappointing. It's not like the original 1983 Clash of the Titans was any better. I'm usually fairly easy going when it comes to popcorn flicks that serve no real purpose except to exist as silly fun. Still, there is a little bit of drawbacks in this film. If you follow real Greek mythology, you will be disappointed. If you follow the original movie, then you will be disappointed, too. This film takes this myth to a new direction, while keeping the basis close to mind. The movie by director Louis Leterrier was still interesting. Surprising a movie that has a title 'Clash of the Titans' and titans are only once briefly mentioned, that if you say a word, you lose it. Who the hell made the decision of placing an monster named Kraken in the Ancient Greece? Isn't that Norse mythology? Then you got Djinns in this? Isn't that Arabic mythology? The biggest change from the original 1983 movie and this was the love story between the hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) and the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). They change it, to love between the hero and the immortal nymph Io (Gemma Arterton). It was rather a better love story than the original in my opinion, but still the princess made more sense since it's in the Greek mythology, and Io wasn't in this story. Anyways, Perseus is a demi-God who must rescue the princess from a sea monster sent by the Gods. By doing this, he has to kill the Gorgon monster known as Medusa who can turn any onlookers into stone and use her head as a weapon. All in all, this movie was just another visual CGI feast. The CGI is breath taking, but the way they conversion the film 2D to 3D made the movie look horrible. There are blurry scenes, and examples of with people's hair flowing beyond their heads without anything holding it. The hero is hardly likable as he doesn't talk much, the two hunters really served no role and kind of left the group before they did anything useful, the Medusa battle killed nearly everyone within minutes, including all the soldiers I actually cared about. The only actual scene I enjoyed was the Medusa fight, the combination of stealth, fighting an enemy you can't see, and arrows was pretty cool. But what on Earth were they trying to make Medusa look beautiful? The original 1983's Medusa was scary. This one makes her look like a super model with snakes on her. With all the hype behind the Kraken, you'd think it would be an epic battle but it only in screen time for a short period of time. Way disappointing. I got confused, I thought it was the Cloverfield monster or a Rancor from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. I have to say the flute scene was a bit funny. Who knew bitch was a word in ancient time as well. About the acting. It was mediocre. Sam Worthington plays the exact same character he played in every other film he has been in. Gemma Arterton's performance was boring and emotionless as usual and even though Liam Neeson tried his best to fit in with the role as Zeus, his talent was utterly wasted. Ralphs Fiennes does his Voldemort voice for Hades which was kinda annoying. Overall: Effects looked pretty but the story was half assed and character development was non-existent. It's just mindless eye candy. Probably good for a rental or a free watch on television one day.",6,5,7,21 May 2013
Jurassic World," Hold on to your butts. It's time to return to Jurassic Park AKA Jurassic World! It's was surprising very entertaining
","While, this movie does have some cheesy dumb moments. It was Dino-mite for the most part! Directed by Colin Trevorrow, this film is the first of a new era of films in the Jurassic Park series. Like the other two sequels, 1997's Lost World: Jurassic Park & 2001's Jurassic Park 3 in the series, the film uses concepts and characters created by Michael Crichton and original director, Steven Spielberg. So, if you haven't saw the first 3 movie, go see it, before this film. You will notice a lot of homage and nods to them. I have to say, it's a Nostalgia trip! Still, the movie does go a little overboard, with the original Jurassic Park theme song from John Williams a bit. Anyways, this movie is set, 22 years after the disastrous events at Isla Nublar in 1993's Jurassic Park. Since then, the dinosaur park has been rebuild and now is fully-functioning. It's beautiful to see how the park works. Nevertheless, the public has gotten used to the dinosaurs and attendance is slowly declining over the last certain years. Hoping to spark new interest, IGEN create a new dangerous attraction to bring in more visitors. However, it backfires disastrously, leading to once again, chaos and havoc. Can the park employees reclaim law & order in the island, or will the dinosaur once again, ruled the world? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too movie, I kinda enjoyed this movie. Yes, the plot is paper-thin, recycle and predictable, but I can somewhat, overlook this, because how entertaining the film, was, for me. The movie pacing is pretty fast, and straight forward. There weren't hardly any slow moments. Jurassic World takes the best aspects of the first three movies, bits from both the novels, and even some of the games, throws it all into a blender and create a somewhat fun movie to watch. I'm glad, this movie was successful at the box office, because it look like Jurassic Park 3 would have extinct the franchise, but the guess, life found a way. They spared no expense in its production. The movie sets, costumes, and props were wonderful, but the visuals CGI effects, not so much. The dinosaurs didn't look realistic and believable. It's felt like an illusion like a flea circus. I wanted something that looks real, something that people could see and touch. An aim not devoid of merit. Sadly, the movie disappointed me, with its lazy CGI work. It was like looking at a huge mound of dinosaur feces. I wish, the crew use more practical effects. The acting was mixed bag. Chris Pratt stars in the lead role of Owen Grady, a man hired to study the behavior of the Velociraptors. He kinda works as the cool action star, but the movie made him, too much of a badass. He barely had any weakness or fear. There wasn't any moment in the film that I thought, that he might die. It really kill the mood. The movie also fed him, some really awful one-liners, that he delivered in such, a bad cheesy way. Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager, Claire Dearing was annoying. While, she has the looks, she doesn't have the charm. Her character was such a headache to watch, due to her greedy and b*tchy attitude. I didn't felt the movie, gave her character, enough time to have a character arch. I really didn't buy Owen and Claire, hooking up. The two stars, barely had any chemistry. I also found it, a bit jarring, that Bryce did all the action scenes, in high heels. It was a little too much. The kid actors, Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins that played her nephews, Grey & Zack, weren't that bad. Honestly, they were pretty good. I just wish, they would show more emotion, during the tense, life-threating action scenes. Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of the park was great to watch. Still, it was a bit odd, that he flips erratically between comedic relief and angry CEO stereotypes. Jake Johnson and Jimmy Fallon as the tech guys were a lot of laughs. I really love how their character was used by the writers, as a way to make fun of themselves in a Meta and self-unaware fashion. Vincent D'Onofrio as the head of security staff, Vic Hoskins was a little over the top. His military motivations kinda makes the IGEN overthrown plot seem, even more- murky. I was deeply confused. B.D. Wong is the only actor so far reprising his role from the original trilogy, as Dr. Henry Wu, but I was a bit off-putting by his performance. Are the writers trying to makes him, look like another villain!? There's no explanation for why he's become so egotistical and suspicious. The movie seem to have some themes, when it comes to consumer and corporate excess. The Indominus Rex hybrid really embody humanity's worst tendencies, indeed. For a PG-13 movie, the movie had enough gore to feed my inner blood-lust. I just wish, there were more tense suspense moments. At least, the movie have a really cool showdown, toward the end, with the new vs the old, fighting to the death. It was pretty awesome! While the movie has some lazily writing, when it comes to scientific accuracy. The movie does kinda explain, why the dinosaurs in the film, doesn't match up, with the real dinosaurs in a clever way. Still, I would love to see some feather dinosaurs in the film. At least, it didn't use those ugly looking human/dino hybrids concept art. Overall: For a movie that a decade of 'development hell'. It did pretty well. Of course it's not gonna be as good as the first movie, but this is the sequel we deserved! I went in with very-lowered expectations and for the most part, set your expectation, low as well and you might enjoy it as much as I did. I'm recommended watching.",7,8,23,13 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Watching people sleep. Yawn. This movie sucks. Sleeper hit made me fall to sleep.
","I'll give the movie, some credit. It did have a good marketing campaign that was very effective in creating hype for the film. It even ask for audience members to demand that the homemade movie, be shown in theaters around the world, that didn't bother selecting it. This movie was so over-hyped; it got me watching it. Man, was I such a sucker. I was deeply disappointment when this movie came out. Paranormal Activity is supernatural horror film written, co-produced, photographed, edited, and directed by Oren Peli. The film centers on a young couple, Katie (Katie Featherston) & Micah (Micah Sloat) who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. Micah, decides to buy a high-end video camera to film the house at night in order help solve these phenomena, only to find out something more menacing than an average ghost. The movie is known as a huge Indy hit that help re-launched the 'found footage' style that 1999's Blair Witch Project help pushed. Too bad, it's cheaper & less interesting than the Blair Witch Project. Why, because first off, it's settlings. Paranormal activity takes place in a nice modern day house in San Diego, rather than anything creepy, like an old abandoned house or the woods. It's like filming a scary slow pace horror movie in fancy fast-pace hip Apple store. It doesn't mixed well. Another fault of the film is the worthless dialogue. I know, the director wanted natural dialogue, but it made a really awful lot of filler. Just get spit out the exposition, already, so we can move on. For a movie that 86 minutes long. The pacing is really snail pace. We have to sit through a lot of pointless scenes before it get scary. Let's be honest, does anyone like the main characters? They were some of the most unlikeable beings. It was hard sit, watching them talk crap with little to no humor or charm. Then spent the other half, watching them sleep. After a while, the gimmick kinda wear off, and it got really boring at times. In this movie, alone, there were tons of stupid tiresome overused nightmare clichés. The worst thing in the movie was probably the whole Ouija Board sequence. It really make the movie look silly with the mostly harmless parlor game. It like making a murder mystery movie like 1995's Usual Suspects and adding the board game, Clue to help solve the crime. It's stupid as hell. Another stupid cliché in the film was the Spiritualist that visit the house and warn them. God, it's not like, we the audience, haven't saw that a billion times before. I like how the movie doesn't even bother, getting information right. Micah is seen flipping through a book on demons, which features an article on Baphomet - in actuality this was a medieval European swipe hatred at Muslims AKA Baphomet. In real life, Baphomet is often mistaken to be a demon, so it's likely the fault of the book's author, not necessarily the film maker, but still that pretty insulting. This movie isn't anything new. It's a cheap Youtube movie that got viral. It's so easy to make, that it create a subgenre of hand held crap series. All of the sequels to this film are pretty awful. The movie series does have some clever gimmicks that I like. I do like the image of seeing the timeline on the video footage, speed on, and slow down. It's give a creepy edge to the film. Attempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, the director chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera with little to no special effects. It gave the movie a more raw and stationary format, that made it cheaper to film. It eliminate the need for a camera crew. Like the original 1963's the Haunting, the film works off well, using sound effects and dim darkness to help create the fear of the unknown. You never really see much of anything in the film besides door opening and closing, things getting mess up, or flickering lights. One thing, I like about the film is the three different endings. Without spoiling it, the original ending was the best. Once Paramount acquired the rights to the film, two other alternative endings were created. One of the alternative ending serve as the theatrical version. Overall: This movie is one of the most-laziest film, ever made. The film is asking you to participate by looking for the ghost that never show up. Like the Blair Witch, it's insulting to the audience, by presenting a film with no payoff. The movie was just a waste of time for me.",6,0,0,30 October 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Abort Mission! Abort Mission! This film really is mediocre! Don't bother, seeing this movie! Disavowed this!
","While, the more recent films in the 'Mission: Impossible' series, are highly enjoyable. This movie is not. It's impossible to watch! Although, this 2000 sequel directed by John Woo is far more stylized and action-packed than the first action reboot film directed by Brian De Palma in 1996, also based off the television show of the same name (1966-1973). It's also, a lot more over the top, and cheesy. While, some people might like that, I found it, to be, too much of a dumb repetitive overused rethread that got quickly tiresome. All the flying doves, unrealistic wire-works, dual-wielding pistols, explosive, mirror shots, and ridiculous face masks make it seem like, I was watching the 1997's action film, 'Face/Off', all over again. It barely resembles 'Mission: Impossible'. You would think a spy movie like this, would have cleverer, well-thought out infiltrate scenes like the original. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the movie fill up the time, with clumsy and pointless similar actions scenes of the Pierce Brosnan's 'James Bond' era, such as people in love, nearly running each other, off the road in car chases, everybody shooting at and drunkenly handling the dangerous, fragile McGuffin that can wipe everybody off, the face of the world, as if it's a bottle of booze, and tons of climbing and jumping off things, just there to feed Tom Cruise's ego. It's really lame. Another thing, this movie destroys with its shallow action, is the sophistical twist and turns of the psychodrama that the first movie, established. This sequel's plot of finding and destroy, a genetically modified disease is unique, but it's also, a bit paper-thin & disappointing. I was really, hoping for something more complex. Something in the same vain as 1998's thriller novel by Richard Preston, 'the Cobra Event'. Don't get me wrong, the movie tries to be smart in its unrealistic out of the blue love-story between IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & pickpocket theft, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), by copying the classic Alfred Hitchcock's 1946's film, 'Notorious', by having a spy falls in love with a woman, whom arrangement, requires her to get back with her ex, in order to find a dangerous weapon. Yet, the screenwriter, Robert Towne doesn't do much new development with it, so the subplot in this film, come across, more like a rip-off, than a homage. The love story was also so bad written with its over-lovely dialogue that the relationship between Hall & Hunt, became so fake-looking that the couple don't even carry over to the other sequels. Despite that, the acting between Newton and Cruise was alright. The two had some chemistry, but the film doesn't give enough time for the characters, much to click. It doesn't help that the villain for this film, doesn't add much, weight to the triangle. He was highly forgettable to the point that I forgot his name for this review. I had to look it up. It's also sucks, that Dougray Scott's thin Scottish accent makes it, really hard to understand, anything that ex-IMF Sean Ambrose is saying. He was by far, the worst thing, in this movie. Regardless of the villain, Tom Cruise doing 95% of his own stunts like the 'knife near the eye' scene, is pretty impressive. I just don't buy him, knowing martial arts. As for the music score, I have mixed feelings about the soundtrack. I kinda dig the new rock version of 'the Mission impossible' theme song with the guitar rip. However, rap-rock band Limp Bizkit 'Take a look around' version of this song is not good, as the lyrics has little to do, on what happening in the film. It's more of an excuse for Fred Durst to defend and bash his critics for their troublesome music career. Regardless, it's not the only song that seems, out of place. The Zap Mama 'Iko Iko' song from the beginning of the film, doesn't match, the Utah desert-like settling. It sounds more like music, you would hear, in a Caribbean Cruise Line with 1988's 'Rain Man' film, playing the background. Another, out of place tune was the exotic Middle Eastern forlorn music, being played, during the love-scenes. Its seems like composer, Han Zimmer was taking a day off, and just gave the leftovers/unused music tracks from the 2000's historic film, 'Gladiator'. It really doesn't match anything, that happening on screen. It's also equally as bizarre to hear music, here, that Zimmer would use in director, Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (2005, 2008 & 2012). Overall: All the jarring flaws, this movie, has, proves, without a doubt, in the end, this is one mission, you shouldn't accept. Just avoid. You're better off, not watching it.",5,3,6,28 September 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," Adjust your free time, it's worth watching.
","What is more important, have a meaningful life or a life of happiness? This film directed by George Nolfi is about a successful politician David Norris (Matt Damon) who has to choose between the woman of his dreams (Emily Blunt) or his career while trying to stop a group known as the Adjustment Bureau from making the choice for him. The Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's short story 'Adjustment Team'. I went in looking for a clever sci-fi flick with philosophical tones and it was pretty OK. It had what I love to debate such topics like 'Determinism VS Free Will' and 'Predestination VS Freedom'. The problem with the movie is there is no reason to root for one side or the other. The powers that be, the Chairman and the fedora wearing hat men want him to be elected to the senate and then president. Thompson (Terrence Stamp), the leader of the hat men, says when he becomes President, it would benefits the world. While it never stated how; but if he able to save millions of people from dying when president, then he should choice duty over lust and sex. For him to choice a woman over the stalk of humanity might seem little too selfish. The only thing standing in his way of obtaining the highest political office is his love for a free spirited dancer, who he meets while she's hiding in the Men's room from hotel security. Damon and Blunt have very little chemistry, which leaves you wondering why he would drop everything for a girl he made out in front of men urinals, after only 5 minutes of dialogue. The lover connection is too weak between the two. I can understand if they were childhood friends, high school or college sweetheart. A flashback scene, or just some scenes in the beginning that showed other 'near miss' moments between the two would have been a breath of fresh air. They barely knew each other. Love at first sight is probably what the filmmakers were going for, but the way both Norris and Elise acts in public and in private isn't classy at all. At this point, both were at their lowest point, it wasn't like they felt in love, it look like they made out for a chance of pity sex. The movie makes a great deal of David and to a lesser extent Elise taking their fate into their own hands, by having free will. However, this is contradicted early in the movie, when the adjustment agents find out that the reason they want to be together in the first place is that they were supposed to be together, then the plan changed. How do you have 'free will' if you destined to fall in love in the 1st place? The film isn't about 'free will', but chasing destiny even when the plans changed. If the bureau had anything to do with them from the beginning as far as their 'supposed' connection to each other, it wasn't free will, but past bureau programming. The film acts like you can't have both ways as well. They act like she can't be a famous ballerina if she dating a President, and the President can't be the President if he married a famous ballerina. Case in point: Matt Damon's character: he can still be president he can amass enough money and power to eventually find time for Elise. For Emily Blunt character: if she dating a President, that would only help her career even more, and it's not like a ballerina can't have vacation or spent time with her husband. It might be hard for them to meet up due to the demands of their career, but it's no way impossible that they couldn't find a way to work it out. While the romantic part sucks, I do like the Sci-fiction part, with the Bureau men able to teleport place to place through doors. How comes there isn't any women bureau members? Honestly, they can be a bit dumb. If they wanted to make sure, David Norris sticks to 'the plan'. How come they didn't adjust his memory that day, they met? Instead of trusting him to keep their secret, a secret. He is a politician, you dumb, Adjustment Bureau! You can't trust him with your secret! I know that a total mind reset would turn Norris into a vegetable state of mind, but why couldn't they just make small decision making 'adjustments.' To Norris like they did to his coworkers. It seems easier than threating and forbidding him to see the girl. You can have him decide not seek the girl, or tell the public, your secrets. You can even change Else's mind to not see him. The ending is a bit of a cop out. He should have met the chairman. Why didn't they reveal the chairman? That would be awesome to see. Some people believe there might be some theological gnostic over tones with what the bureau really represented. They say that the chairman represent God and his caseworkers as its angels and the bureau is really about religion. There are some people that think the bureau represent illuminati type inside government, similar to the Men in Black. For me, I don't care who they represented, the whole concept of what the Bureau is on film is interesting. The story does remind me of something. It reminds me of the real life historic story of King Edward VIII and his choice to abdicated the crown when the Church of England refused to allow him to marry Wallis Simpson, because it was morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce and goes against the church teachings. Overall: it's an OK film with rather white-centric movie plot. Thomas Newman's music score for the film is brilliant. The man is a truly talented composer. I would say, adjust your free time, it's worth watching.",7,0,0,1 June 2013
World Trade Center," I can clearly say, 'United We Stand'- that 2006's 'United 93' was indeed the better movie about 9/11 than this movie. Yet, this film isn't half bad. It was just alright.
","Oliver Stone's 2006 film, 'World Trade Center' follows the close biographical survival story of two Port Authority policemen, John McLouglin (Nicholas Cage) & William Jimeno (Michael Pena), whom became trapped under the rumble of the once-World Trade Center, after the skyscraper collapse, during the events of the 9/11 Terrorist Attack on New York City. Without spoiling the movie, too much, although, it's been 5 years since the tragic event, when this movie was made. I still think, films like this, were greenlight, a little too soon. After all, there was still an empty lot in Ground Zero, where WTC once stood; haven't yet, been replace by One World Trade Center that open in 2014. Another thing, although, producers of the film met with all relevant September 11 victims groups before production began to inform them of the intention of the film. New York City absolutely prohibited any filmmaking of any kind about Sept. 11 in the Big Apple besides the New York Port Authority Building, not wanting any recreation of destruction or chaos to be display for the public. The filmmakers were not even allowed to film actors looking upward toward where the towers would be. Instead, those shots were created in sound stages in Los Angeles, using limited CGI or badly intercut, archive stock footage. Hints, why some of the buildings that they use as a city background look a little too small in height, and far apart for an ideal depiction of NYC. Sadly, even some real-life characters had to be fictional, due to family members, not wanting their demise love-ones names, to be portray in a bad light. It really hurts, historic accuracy and somewhat confused others, such was the circumstance of supporting characters, like Marine Sgt. Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) whom some viewers saw as fiction. In this case, he was really real, much like the other Marine Sgt. Jason Thomas (William Mapother), whom happens to be African-American, in real-life. Meanwhile, there were also plenty of examples of characters deaths, being omitted due to demands of love-ones, not wanting it; which in return, make the portrayal of some characters, unfinished. It even made some characters seem like they took their own life. Its warning sides like this that shows, that the wounds of that day, have not yet healed in NYC. Already, the idea of Hollywood profiting off, a tragic event for studio gain, was a little inky & not cool. It didn't help that the money earn from this film, was not given to, many charities of the victims, involves in this recreated storytelling. Sadly, I don't think, that was the case, with this movie. Still, regardless of that, I found Oliver Stone to be respectful enough to the real-life story, not to delve too much into misguided conspiracy theories like he did with 1991's 'JFK'. Although, it does depict a few events that blatantly contradict official explanations of what happen in real-life, such as the film's showing of TV footage of the precipitous collapse of WTC 7 and the attack on Israel. However, I'm willing to let that past, due to the fact that confusion was very rampant, that day. Glad, there was little-to-no political themes. At least, not until his later film, 2008's 'W.'. Another thing that I found alright about this movie, is the acting. While, I wouldn't say, this is Cage's best role, but it's far from his worst. Cage is fine, here. He honestly tries his best, by focusing on accurately speaking with a New York accent. And to also capture the fear and claustrophobia of McLoughlin's ordeal, Cage spent hours in a sensory-deprivation tank. So mad props to him for that, even if Michael Pena still out-acted him, in this film. Pena really look like he was in the brick of death, with his pale face of fear and pain, even with his face, cover in mostly darkness, during the second & third act. That's how amazing, he was. Given that, I have to say, the supporting cast was equally as good, but if I have to nitpick, I felt that the filmmakers didn't give female actress, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello as the two-police officers' wives, Allison Jimeno & Donna McLoughlin, much to work with. Overall: While, not as good as other buried alive trapped films like director, Danny Boyle's 2010's film '127 Hours', which had better pacing, editing, and music. Given the epic intense violence of the Towers' falls and the thoroughness of destruction evident at Ground Zero, it was still interesting enough to watch a movie about people trying to survive during its aftermath, even if it's super pitch dark & hard to see. Much like director Paul Greengrass movie, 'United 93' about United Airlines Flight 93 — which crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers apparently tried to overpower the terrorist hijackers, also released in 2007, the movie will also be very subjective and hard to watch for some, emotionally. Nevertheless, at least, 2006's 'World Trade Center' is more accuracy, watchable & respectful, than more recent films about 9/11, like director, Martin Guigui's film '9/11'. Check 'World Trade Center' in its place of that crap. That's for sure, but if you have a choice. See 'United 93'. Now, that's a powerful movie.",6,3,5,11 September 2017
Black Snake Moan," Black Snake Moan is off the chain, great.
","The title of this film, 'Black Snake Moan' refers to a really old song by country blues musician, Blind Lemmon Jefferson in which, the singer talks about his sexual addiction and his moans for love, once more. Full of explicit sexual nuances, Jefferson's song full of unconventional melodic style and utilization of double entendres, was able to fly pass the radar of censorship, back in the 1920s. As much, I like how Jefferson was able to pioneer this style of music. I have to say, actor, Samuel Jackson sings the song, so much better than Blind Lemmon Jefferson, ever did. Jackson was really able to update the song to fit with this new generation with his electric guitar playing, deep shouting gravitas voice, and depth of his character's backstory. It was very moving part of the film. Honestly, most of this movie is very compelling with its controversial subjects that include but are not limited to rape, sexual addiction, parental abuse, anxiety disorders, and religious outlooks. Without spoiling this polarizing film, too much, I have to say, I kinda like the story of the grumpy hermit/ former Blues singer, Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to rebuild his life after a nasty divorce, while also, trying hard to cure, a known nymphomaniac, Rae Doole (Christina Ricci) from her faults. It made for a very well-told story. I love all the metaphors and symbolism that this film has to offer, too. A good example of one is the chain that Rae wears around her waist, during most of the film and the type of shirt, she is wearing. If you don't realize it, already Rae represented the South, and its struggles, after the American Civil War. Not only, does her chain, represented the heavy weight of learning to live, with the mistakes and haunts of the past, but her chained up character is also stand-in, for the continuous, ignored issue of modern day slavery. After all, the region, is known for being a strong bible belt, but it also been known to keep that belt unbuckled when it comes to the dangers of having too lust, over the sense of love. The high reports of human trafficking, sexual abuse, and sex slaves is signed of that. Although, the chain can represented, something bad and naughty, it also can somewhat represented the unity that the South has, with its supply chain, when it comes to addressing the issue, in hand. There is no bigger metaphor of that, than the radiator in which Lazarus chain up Rae. It represented, the ever changing social climate of the South, as conflicts can indeed heat up, or cool down. No matter, how far, you run away from your issues. You will always been weighted down, by what society, thinks and wants from you. It's only, when you able to address the past, and learn to live with yourself, in a moral life, is when the removal of the chain, can be seem, as a meaningful step toward a better future. Another thing, I like about this film is that Lazarus, isn't a mysterious 'magical black negro' type character with no backstory, nor does Rae represented the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' that is there to save his soul. In many ways, both characters are well-defined, with each, having their own issues to deal with, on their own, with or without the help from the other. Nobody is depended on the other, at all. Like Lazarus's namesake, it's about the redemption and resurrection of two, clearly mess up people. However, people might not see that, through the film's poster and exploitation marketing. The way, they market, this movie makes it, seem like a more like a porno than a character study film. It really does overblows the potential fetish fuel of the film, at the expense of everything else. It's not the best. Don't get me wrong, Christina Ricci is one, attractive woman, but her character wasn't made, just for nudity and fan service. She really, put some work, in showing how ugly and unhealthy, Rae can really be. She really does look pale and pasty. Even Samuel L. Jackson, ugly himself up, by letting his hair grow out, not dying or shaving, to show, how wash-up, his character has become. Both actors, really made their character, their own. I also have to give, mad props to both, the supporting actors in this film. Justin Timberlake as Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie was great. He really was, able to show his character emotional crutch, with the way, his body language moves. He really did seem like he suffers from extreme social anxiety. It really shows Hollywood, that the then-newly made solo singer can indeed, acted. Another person that need some praise is Michael Raymond-James as Ronnie's friend, Gill Morton. He was able to show both, his loving cares and hateful lust for Rae, making his performance, a very sympathetically real-life person. Even thought, he tries to make advances on Rae, which is a no-no, in my picture; I still can understand, what stress, he had to deal with when dealing with mess up people who supposed to be your friends. Overall: While, still many viewers will undoubtedly be offended by director Craig Brewer's representation of a still-segregated, racist South; I have to say, I love how the film acknowledges the importance of sex, while also highlighting the danger of having sex irresponsibly, all without being too heavy-handed and preachy. I also cherish the film, for its use of 'Delta Blues' type music and how well-shot, it was. In the end, this clever morality tale about two unlikely characters is a must-watch. I do recommended. It's pleasantly amazing.",7,8,11,4 June 2016
Prisoners," Like, a prisoner, I was caged in. I couldn't stop watching this film. It was just that darn good.
","Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter and her friend is kidnapped. Minutes turn into hours, hours turn to days. Keller turn to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help. Their only clue, is that RV has been parked on their street, earlier that day by suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano). While, Detective Loki is looking for evidence that links Alex Jones to the crime, Keller takes the matter in his own hands; how far will this desperate father go to find his missing daughter? Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013 in my opinion. It's sure to get a few Oscar nominations. I have to say Hugh Jackson deserve to win, if he does. There is a very powerful scene with him talking to Loki in a car, stating out, how his daughter is looking for him to save her, not Loki. You can't help feeling for this character as he goes through an emotional hell storm. He was a man who can only trust himself. He was a survivalist, and somewhat a paranoid. He prides himself on his strength and independence as a man who can make decisions and get things done alone. That is why he did what he did and he went through a great deal of punishment for it. Keller though loses his way, and ends up in a literal pit in the ground, a 'hell' as it were. Great use of symbolism. I love the fact that his wife's name is Grace. (Maria Bello). Grace gets more and more lost, as Keller lose more and more of his morals. Basically he has lost the 'grace' of God through his actions. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass that was pretty interesting. Nobody in this film was the clear cut good guy and villain. Remind me of the verse 'Through a glass, darkly' in the Bible. Then, there is the many crosses, including one hanging from the rear-view mirror in Keller's truck. The symbolism doesn't get in the way of the plot, too much until the snakes came into play. I guess, it was a play on the serpent in the Garden of Eden, but it also could had meant the Norse symbol for the god Loki which is two entertained snakes, eating each others' tails which Jake Gyllenhaal is name after. Still, it could had been left out. Then the movie became a symbolism smorgasbord with the endless mazes, one eye themes, opening Pandora's boxes, tattoos, free-mason rings, and that got the plot more confusing. Research all the examples, I have stated out. You find yourself, surprising in depth this movie goes. Trust me, the plot will get confusing. I had to watch it, multiply times to get all the twist and turns. It was a maze of suspects. The allegory of the prison is a significant theme throughout the film. Each character, whether psychologically or physically, is the subject of some kind of confinement. Without giving it away, the ending of the film is a brilliant bittersweet ending, that can be seem as both a happy and tragic at the same time. A lot of parents will be hugging their children tonight after watching this film. A few people might not like this movie due to its controversial subject matter. I think some Christian conservative might find the movie as liberal anti-Christian propaganda that makes Christians look bad. I didn't see it that way. I think a certain Alex Jones in the world, might, but I see Keller going through the same emotions if he wasn't a Christian. The characters put into huge stressful tragic events that makes them challenge their own faith. I think the use of faith was highly welcome into this film. It made the film interesting with its symbolism. The second thing, people didn't like is the animal abuse. First off, no animals were harm during the filming of this film. Second off, the killing of the deer makes more morality sense than it's made out to be. Deer can actually overpopulate an area and starve the local species if not controlled. Some states have actual contracts with hunters to maintain a quota by cutting the herd. Then there is the dog scene. Let's remember, Alex Jones is not a smart guy, so it would make sense that he wouldn't know how to handle a dog. I hate to see PETA boycott the film over those, without understanding the facts and story. The movie isn't about the animals, but looking for kidnap children. People coming in, should focus more that, then what happen to the animals. The question comes down to morals and ethics. The acting is amazing. It's seems to me that Jake Gallenhaal's Loki is such an interesting character that fans of the film is asking for a spin-off movie. By the way, Loki blink so much, is probably because he is a detective, and they rarely sleep. At less, that what I got from his character development. It's a very long movie directed by Denise Villeneuve, but not boring. It was a very tense film with little slow areas. Overall, it's can be a bit depressing, but the thrill factor made this movie bearable to watch and it deserve the critical acclaim that it got.",8,5,7,9 October 2013
Logan," For the most part, this R-Rated superhero movie was as solid as adamantium claws, but it did have a few flaws in the design..
","Wolverine is one of the few X-Men characters that appears in nearly every media adaptation of the X-Men franchise, including comics, television, and video games. He has always been a popular character. His willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes, for the rest of the late 20th century. As a result, the character was also feature in films, with Australian actor, Hugh Jackman playing him in nine different movies, with 'Logan', supposedly being his last. Directed by James Mangold & set in the near-future, the film follows a past-his-prime James 'Logan' Howlett AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarking on a road trip across America with his diminished mentor/friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) for one final mission to safety delivered, a young mutant girl, Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) to the protection of the Great White North, Canada; while a group of scientists, and their security team led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) tries to stop them. Without spoiling the movie, too much, director James Mangold and his writers does an OK job, helming this piece in the style of comics, 'Old Man Logan' & 'the New Mutants'. I just wish, he didn't his characters bash the comics, in-universe so much. What's wrong with having Wolverine, wear his iconic yellow suit!? Fans like myself, really do want to see it. It's sad that Hugh Jackman, will never done that suit. It could had made this film, so much better. Also, if this comic book plot sounds very familiar, it's pretty much, is; as the movie and comics, borrow elements from classic westerns such as 1953's 'Shane', 1972's 'The Cowboys' & 1976's 'The Shootist'; as well as story elements from other dystopian mediums hits like author, P. D. James 1992 'Children of Men' novel; which in return, became a movie in 2006; as well as 2013's survival horror video game 'The Last of Us'. All of this, been cited as one of its story's primary influences, even if the film loosely use all of them. Because of that, it kinda diminished the story, a bit, as 'Logan' is place in a future that's not quite post-apocalyptic as 2014's film 'Days of Future Past' timeline, but not quite as normal. So, it was not as intense as it should be. The film also became a bit confusing at times, as parts of the film talks about events like the Liberty Island accident in the original timeline, when technically, they're living in the revised timeline, set for them. It's really doesn't make any lick of sense. It's all f*** up! When, you think about it, 'Logan' has a lot of plot-holes that goes unexplained like Transigen killing mutants, yet, trying to create them. Don't get, where they were going with that. Also, the question who was in Canada, kinda bug me. Maybe, it's the Alpha Flight? Who knows!? The film never tells you. Because of this, the lack of exposition is pretty noticeable, toward the third act. It will leave you, puzzling, yet somewhat confused. Also, whenever, they do spill exposition about what is happening, it's told in the most laziness fashion like the well-made video on the smart phone. Like honestly, who had time to shot the video, and edited it, when it's supposedly smuggle out, quickly!? Also, why didn't Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) just publicize it to the public? That would save time. Another problem for the movie for me, was when they unearth the new villain, X-24. In my opinion, I found the surprised villain to be, jarring and yet, also disappointing. It felt a self-jerk. It was just as awkward as 'Albert' from the comics. It just doesn't mesh for me. The film could had been better, if it had Donald Pierce take that role, since Boyd Holbrook was surprising, pretty good, as the extreme fanboy villain. If not, Donald Pierce. They should had use the character of 'Sabretooth' from 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Actor, Liev Schreiber was one of the best thing about that movie, as Victor Creed. So use him, instead! Despite the scenes with X-24, the rest of the action was alright in this film, even if it's not as bloody or gory as people make it, out to be. Just glad, it's not CGI heavy. I also like how Hugh Jackman still had the chops to do, most of his stunts. It's also cool to see, a young actress like Dafne Keen, be able to stand out on her own, in those fighting sequences as well. I just wish, the movie establish, more of a father/daughter relationship with the two, besides the fighting. I found those driving scenes part, to be below standards, due to the lack of dialogue and interaction between them. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman's performance in this film, but couldn't they had him, lighten up for a few moments. I don't like, how much Logan is a sourpuss. Let the movie had some more fun with him. The film is dark and downer enough. Have some scenes with him, bonding with his kid. For the most part, I enjoy the connection that Logan had with Charles Xavier, more. It seems like they had more of a relationship than Laura and Logan. I found Patrick Stewart's acting to be the best, throughout this film. He really it, took some risk, like losing 21 pounds to look more elderly and ill. That's really intense. He really gives, something new, here, as the sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, mentally deteriorating mentor-figure. You've never this side of him, before. It's sad that this will be his last role as Professor Xavier, as well. Overall: I thought the film was well-made. I have to say, this movie was just decent enough to be, a good finale for Hugh Jackman's run with the character. It's good, but it's not quite cutting edge great.",8,5,10,11 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," This uncanny movie directed by Joss Whedon is still pretty marvelous.
","When the Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; there was lots of doubts that story of the Avengers comics book, could ever be put on screen, and make sense to non-comic book readers. Marvel Studios, somehow pull it off, with the Phase One film campaign. From 2008 to 2012, the first set of movies introduces the core main characters of the Avengers superhero group, such as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), one by one. All this work in creating a Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaded to 2012's megahit, The Avengers, which compare all these characters into one film. Once again, Marvel Studios is trying to recapture the magic, by launching Phrase 2, which focuses on even more new characters, while exploiting the establish characters in solo missions type films. Most of those films, kinda work, as they help push the Infinity Stones storyline even more, while showing the breakdown of establish agency groups, such as S.H.I.E.L.D. When Marvel Studios once again, wanted to bring back Avengers, back together, it brought all types of sub-plot storyline back into one film. Sadly, in my opinion, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron doesn't really connect that well, with the other previous solo films. The film left a lot of the previous films plot-holes, unexplained and continue to make it, wider, with even more confusing, rush subplots. It kinda felt, like the movie was repeating itself, more than often. While, the movie does bring new light into the main characters dark gritty back stories, the main plot is pretty generic. Instead, of aliens trying to destroy the world, it is robots leaded by Ultron (Voiced by James Spader). The whole idea of the Avengers bringing Vision (Paul Bettany) to life, to protect the world, comes out of nowhere and seem kinda forced. Also, I didn't like how the Vision look. He look kinda stupid due to the costume changes. He looks a robot made out of Starbursts. Other than that, visually, this movie directed by Joss Weldon is amazing to watch. It had tons of great action pack scenes, but the writing would need, some work. The 'story telling' in this movie is practically non-existent. The movie is nothing more than a giant action sequence sprinkled with what passes as dialogue in between. The humor was alright for the most part. The acting, throughout the film is pretty good. It was a bit weird, seeing Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, because he destroy most of his technology in the end of 2013's Iron Man 3. Robert Downey Jr is indeed Iron Man. It would be, hard to replace him. I really hope, they will be able to keep, Downey aboard, until 2019's Avengers Infinity Wars are over. Chris Evans is everybody favorite Boy Scout, and he continues to make Captain America, seemed new. I love, how, the movie is settling up, the events between him and Stark, leading to 2016's Captain America: Civil War. It looks great. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, honed this part. I just didn't like his little sub mission. It didn't bring anything new to the table. I like, that Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is given, more depth. The whole romantic subplot, of Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) seem odd. It was a mixed bag for me. I like, the whole Red Room exposition scene, but I really didn't buy, into Natasha having a thing for Banner, after having flings with both Captain America & Hawkeye in the previous films. Still, both of their acting is pretty well-done. The villains are pretty good. James Spader is amazing as Ultron. He has the right amount of wit and smarts, to play a convincing robotic megalomaniac. I really didn't like the changes, they did to the character origins, but I was willing to go with it. New characters like Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch was really needed. She pretty own it. I really didn't mind, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, but it was kinda a disappointment. Evan Peters did a better job in 20th Century Fox's version of Quicksilver in 2014's X-Men: Day of Future Past. I really thought, that having Quicksilver in this Marvel Studios film, was very pointless, and I was somewhat right. I really had, no strong emotion ties with Aaron's version of character. Both Baron Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) & Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) seem like a waste. I hate to see them as half-baked, side villains. Still, it's nice to see Andy Serkis, not in a motion-capture type role. Also, look forward to the Stan Lee's cameo. The ending action scene to the film was kinda disappointing due to how outlandish, it was. It was simply impossible for the sequel to recapture the magic of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled on screen for the first time, especially when they've popped up in each others' movies in the ensuing years and the overuse of trailers spoiling way too much of the film. Still, as far as second installments go- it was alright. It was good popcorn fun. It's a solid and entertaining follow-up. The post-credits scene wasn't anything, worthy to wait for. The music was kinda underwhelming. Wish, the music had the same tone of the first film. Overall: The film was OK. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded most of my expectations. It's time to assemble again and go see this movie. You wouldn't regret it! I do recommended, seeing this sequel.",8,8,17,29 April 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Monster Mash is a Graveyard Smash
","Hotel Transylvania was surprising good. Adam Sandler plays Dracula, the over bearing father trying to protect his adventurous world traveler dreamer daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from anything human, while at the same time tries to keep his hotel business running. Adam Sandler's role as the father figure, is a great new look into the actor's skills unchecked since Punch Drunk Love and Click, it's nice to see him playing something else than an annoying stupid voices, immature characters in movies aimed at teens and men who never grew up. I just glad he didn't play the 'nails scraping on a blackboard' cringe-inducing way man-child. He is put to the test to try to protect his daughter Mavis when an young free-spirit, bag pack hostel, human named Jonathan (Andy Sanberg) walks into the hotel. In fear of losing his hotel business due to the presence of a human being, he has to figure out a way to quickly get him away. Dracula is force to dress up Jonathan as a monster, so he can freely able to get rid of him without his guest knowing. Before Dracula can get rid of him, his daughter and his guests find Jonathan as the life of the party, and very friendly to the point, that Mavis starts to have feelings for him. Jonathan and Mavis sub-plot relationship isn't as remotely as cheesy as Twilight. The movie even has a scene taking a jab at the Twilight movie in it. The movie is a lot of fun. There is a few sprinkling of potty humor, but it's doesn't detracts from an otherwise fun ride. Full of interesting-to-look-at characters and zany, hectic animation, it's a feast for the eyes with enough jokes thrown in for the parents in the audience, especially in Sandberg's character. The guest of the hotel made out of Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne the Wolfman (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) and Murray the Mummy (Ceelo Green) are play their roles great and gives something new to each of the old school monsters. The film is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky well known for his work for Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack. The computer animation is Pixar level. From all the animation monster-related movies put out in 2012, this one was worth the money paying. So check in to 'Hotel Transylvania' to find Adam Sandler and his pals playing the greatest monsters in movie history.",8,8,11,1 November 2012
Quiz Show," I'm going to quiz you about the movie
","Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that 'Quiz Show'—as enjoyable as it is—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.",8,3,5,14 December 2012
Everest," Everest was hard to watch. It was kinda rocky & way too depressing. Still, the film was worth the climb
","This movie was indeed a hard mountain to climb over. It's even harder to watch, when you, stop and think, that people indeed die, trying to make this movie. While, the movie was being filmed in Nepal in 2014, an avalanche struck, while the second unit crew was shooting remaining scenes of the film at Camp II on Everest, killing 16 Sherpa guides. The Sherpas were carrying equipment and supplies for the filmmakers. Lucky for the film production, they were not present where the disaster took place, but they were nearby. Indeed, that was close-call. Still, this movie was released, way too soon after April & May 2015 Nepal earthquake. That disaster alone, triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19; making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. So, I really don't get, why the film distributer, Universal Studios really felt, like this was a good year to release this film. I guess, they were really trying to capitalize on the recent Mount Everest craze. I really don't like, the idea of people capitalize on people's death, but whatever; at least, they could push the release date, Sept 2, 2015 back, a few months later, for a little more, for respect for the recent victims. Anyways, like the 1998's IMAX film that share the same name, Everest tells the story of the same event. Everest tells the story of the 1996 Everest disaster, when eight people were caught in a blizzard and died on Mount Everest during a summit attempt. Directed by Baltasar Kormákur and based on Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, 'Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster' and Beck Weathers' novel, 'Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest'. The movie is a tear-jerker, disaster film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is pretty much, historic accuracy to many of the film portrayal of true events. However, there are somethings worth noting that didn't happen, weren't mention or was change at the last second. First off, there were a lot more other team expeditions that were climbing the mountain, those days, besides the South African, Mountain Madness & the Adventure Consultants. There was a Japanese, Taiwanese, and Indo-Tibetan expeditions, climbing, both from the North Col & South Col side. There is no mention about the three-man expedition attempting to become the first Indian team to reach the top of Everest from the northeastern route in this film. Another thing that the film fails to mention is that the helicopter that was sent to help them, rescue two people, rather than one. One of those survivors in the helicopter rescue, wasn't even discussed in the film. Another thing, the movie didn't show, was that the helicopter pilot took two dangerous helicopter trips from base camp to Everest. Still, for the most part, it was pretty intense movie. Not because of the action, but because of how grim, the settling are. The movie has some really good moral messages, worth exploring. Explores issues of life and death, such as when is a dream, worth risking your life? Another question would be, when is it OK to abandon morality and save yourself -- or to stand by someone even if it could cost you your safety? It's a movie about ethics and what does it takes to be a team. All the actors show this. They were pretty good in their roles. They all, look like they could be real mountain climbers. Jason Clarke as the leader, Robert Hall is perfectly cast as organized, detail-oriented man. Josh Brolin is great as Beck Weathers, as the fearful newbie, trying hard to fit in, while, not show, how scare, he really is. John Hawkes is wonderful as Doug Hansen, the ordinary every man trying to do the unordinary. Jake Gyllenhaal as Hall's foil, wild ski bum/mountaineer Scott Fischer was pretty interesting. Last, worth noting is the delightful, Naoko Mori as Yasuko Namba, a woman so driven to reach all of the Seven Summits, that you can't help, cheering for her. I really like, how the film gave enough time, for each one of the team members, to have a little bit of character development, and backstory. Most of the characters in the film were pretty memorable. I just wish, the movie focus a little more of a few core characters than everybody. It was hard to keep track, of each of these character. It was even harder to comprehend, what's going on, when the blizzard scenes hit, because you can barely see them, hear them or see the surroundings. Also, once the characters put on all their gear on, most of the characters are hard to distinguish, unless you memorize what were they wearing. Sadly, the IMAX 3D isn't worth the price, because of this. I don't recommended. Most of the 3rd act is in night & blizzard, so you wouldn't even see anything, anyways. The 1998 IMAX movie is better to watch for the visuals, than this, in my opinion. Another movie worth checking out is 1997's Made-for-TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest was also based on the same events. Overall: Everest is tragic, but watchable. This gripping drama is a harsh mountain of a film, worth checking out.",7,0,0,26 September 2015
Annie Hall," If they ever made a Hall of Fame for great movies of the 1970s. Anne Hall really does belong on that list.
","Though some people prefer 1979's 'Manhattan', 'Annie Hall' is generally regarded as the one of the best in Woody Allen's pretty solid filmmaking career. Worthy of the many Academy Awards, they won. This romantic-comedy was amazing, even if writer/director/actor Woody Allen kinda hates it. It's a classic that still relevant even today. Made during an era, where Allen was transforming from making silly, yet funny broad slapstick comedies to dramatic mature material that are somewhat good, but boring films, influenced by European art cinema. The film was indeed made at the right time. Full of priceless, witty and quotable one-liners, clever break the fourth wall jokes, beautiful cinematography, charming music, outstanding animation, wonderful complex supporting characters played by up and coming actors and actresses like Jeff Goldblum, Carol Kane, Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Shelley Duvall, and fun cameos like philosopher, Marshall McLuhan & singer, Paul Simon made this great. I like how this movie, not only tells the fictional love story of a fixated New York comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) with a ditzy, aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton); but give us, insight on the then-relationship between writer/director Woody Allen and his co-star, Diane Keaton and why the relationship didn't work. Several references in the film mirror Allen's own life, such as using Diane Keaton's original last name for Annie, and having his character, be a Jewish comedian living in New York has made most film critics believe profoundly that this film is just another of Allen's deep autobiographical. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions, saying, the film is so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people that it was loosely based on. Regardless on his beliefs, the film is truly self-reflexive. It's hard to denial that Annie Hall does capitalized on many of the ingredients that had been the content of his earlier films, the subjects of cultural stereotypes, romantic angst, drugs, death, his use of therapy and analysis for comic effect, and his obsessive love of New York & his dislike of Los Angeles. Added to that, is his introspective neuroses and pessimism, his requisite jokes and psychosexual frustration about sex, numerous put-downs of his own appearance and personality, and distorted memories of his childhood. And Allen's script keeps going with scenes of stylistic strategies and cinematic techniques that support the fragmented nature of the film, such as the direct addresses to the camera style with voice over commentary, the adult time-travel back to childhood sequence & the sudden production of a real-life character. Added the double-exposed action, and the subtitled that contradict the action, and you got yourself, a very long, but unique film. Honestly, if Woody Allen didn't have editor, Ralph Rosenblum, this film could had gone forever. That seems to be a common problem with most of Allen's films. It just doesn't know how to pace itself. Many shots for this film, had to be eliminated or severely shorted, just to allow the audience enough time to digest it all. As much as I like the backstory of Alvy. In truth, I really came to see Annie Hall. Even Allen admit that he went overboard, saying he would had cut a lot of opening scenes about Alvy in order to introduce Keaton's character, faster. Diane Keaton really does shines in this role. She really does deserve the Best Actress win that year. An understated and subtle performance. I like how great, she was able to show character development, showing that Anne Hall does have confidence and that she can stand on her ownright. It's like a Pygmalion-like story. Just look at the scene where she sing 'Seem like Old Times'. Plus, the way, Keaton's idea to choose to dress Hall with mismatched of conglomeration of men's dress clothes was very influence to fashion. Absolutely gorgeous. Don't get me wrong, while, Allen's persona of playing characters with an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish is a bit tiresome old shtick, there was nothing too annoying about his shrill and nasal character here. I just like Keaton's performance, better. I also just glad, the film didn't kept the original murder mystery. It would feel, out of place from the rest of the story. Allen would indeed, later directed murder mysteries to satisfy that need with 1992's 'Shadows and Fog' and 1993's 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' retooled and taken from this script. Another thing, I'm glad, this movie didn't kept, was the titled, 'Anhedonia'. It truly could had been a state of acute melancholia. 'Annie Hall' makes more sense than any of the alternative titles, they were thinking like 'A Roller Coaster Named Desire', 'Me and My Goy' & 'It had to be Jew'. Overall: While, some critics might hate the movie for having a first world conflict and being a bit self-centered. With only a few flaws, this movie will continue to remind a classic romantic comedy for most, and I have to agree. It's one of the best film ever made. Definitely worth watching.

Green Street Hooligans," Green Street Hooligans had street cred, but then it, Pele kick itself in the head toward the end, resulting in mixed results.
","This movie deserves a yellow card to anybody who watches it. Directed by Lexi Alexander, this movie really had potential to be, really good. However, the film leaves its audience with bitter taste in their mouth. The movie tells the story of an American journalism student, Matt Buckner (Elijah Woods), whom is framed for drug use by his far more socially powerful roommate and thus expelled from Harvard. Fleeing to England to be with his sister, Shannon Dunham (Claire Forlani) and her family. Matt finds himself involved with the local violent football AKA soccer firm when Shannon's husband's brother, Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) came for a visit. Matt quickly builds a reputation within the firm, to the point, that Matt's well-concealed past, started to be a big problem for them. Sooner than later, Matt's involvement within the firm, start to create grudges. Can the firm find a way to keep their reputation intact or will the violence within the firm, spill blood into the street? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this is a nice introduction to the violent underground world of football hooliganism. You really get to learn, a lot about English sport culture with it. Still, the movie had to do, some artistic license when it came to the sport. A good example is the fact that hooliganism doesn't really happen, as much as it used to. While, football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. The United Kingdom has really led a major crackdown on football-related violence. In the year in which, this movie was made, the outbreaks of violence involving fans was far rarer than they were 20 or 30 years ago. Some of the reasons why, is because the higher cost of watching a football game, and the more sophisticated policing. Things, this film rarely mention. Honestly, where in the hell, are the members of the firm, getting their money to watch nearly all these games in the film? The film never explains it. Another is, how in the hell, were these men, not getting caught? They were, clearly seem on security camera. The film makes great use of that, so how is that not possible? Anyways, the movie makes you, had to suspense your disbelief, even more, when some of the football teams, they played against, don't really played. A good example is that match between West Ham & Birmingham City. They weren't even in the same division. It would have been impossible for the two clubs to play league games against each other during that season. Plus, no football team in the world plays two games in two days. At first, the football club of West Ham welcome the film-makers, at their Upton Park ground; as they were under the impression that the film was celebrating the glorious game and its fanatical supporters, but once they realized the film's true take on the subject. The team disassociated themselves from the project. This is why, there weren't anymore, stadium footage, besides the first game. Another problem that the movie has, is how it was full of errors in geography. It really became jarring to see London's locations, being portray as Manchester's locations. I guess, the filmmakers of the film really didn't care, that people can tell the different. Another thing that didn't work was the film's message. The film tries to convey that you need to know when to stand your ground and when to run away. Perhaps it does, but the over glorious of stupid violence is a bit jarring to watch. After all, there were little to no strong reason, why these people should hate each other. It wasn't like, them, were fighting for some type of strong social cause. It was about, their moronic reputation. Honestly, I don't know, what's worse, people endangering themselves, over nothing or the fact, they endangering their own family over something really stupid. While, the action was cool, I really don't get, how that a 'stand your ground' moment. It's even more apparent, that violence is frequently an easy way to solve one's problems, rather than taking the gentleman's route in this film. It really questionable. While, I can never understand, their drive. I have to say, the majority of the characters, here, are somewhat likable, however, some more than others for me. At first, I love Elijah Woods as the naïve outsider, but toward the end, I just couldn't bare; seeing him on screen, when the majority of the problems throughout the film is cause by his own stupidity. I really didn't like the movie gave him, the only happy ending, and everybody else, tragic ones. It was not bittersweet at all. Another actor that seem to shine, was Charlie Hunnam as the enigmatic gang leader. I really do believe, that this role, allow Hunnam to gain the lead role in the critically acclaimed FX TV Series Sons of Anarchy, because how amazing, he was, here. However, some of the English men's highly questionable crockery accent, felt like a serious flaw. I really can't understand what they were saying, most of the time. This movie really needed subtitles at times. This film did received a sequel, but it has little to connection to the original film. In my opinion, it's not a good watch. Overall: While, this sport hooligan culture movie reach its goal in entertaining me. I was really disappointed, in how the movie ends and resulted in mixed messages. I do recommended watching, but if I had, my choice of watching this, over American football. I would had to choose, the latter.",7,0,0,12 November 2015
Men in Black," Don't be kept in the dark. Go see Men in Black. It's gives new meaning to Black Comedy. It's worth seeing!
","You know what the difference, between other sci-fi buddy action-comedies and 'Men in Black'? 'Men in Black' make the genre look good. That was until the 2002 & 2012 sequels came out, but that's that is another story for another day. Yet, in the summer of 1997, this film about two secret organization agents, K (Tommy Lee Jones) & J (Will Smith) having to stop an alien invasion from happening, while hiding their existence from ordinary people, could do little wrong. Even if Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones was playing, fictional versions of themselves. They are still great in their roles. Not only that, but surprisingly, both share, really good chemistry with each other. Smith's laid-back boyish charm does match, well against Jones' grump mentor, straight-man persona. They do make a good team. Nevertheless, the best acting in this movie, has to go to Vincent D'Onofrio as the extraterrestrial roach-like villain, Edgar the bug. He really went beyond the call of duty, with his performance. Not only, did he researched watch a lot of insect documentaries, spent hours in make-up with legendary, special effects artist, Rick Baker, but he also put on, knee braces to get the feel of Edgar's restricted movement. That's commitment. I also have to give mad props to animatronic effects from Baker & the visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic for making the aliens, in the film, seem real, even if some of the CGI hasn't really hold up, that well, over the years. In the end, it's still impressive to look at. Another thing that still works for me, is the music score by composer, Danny Elfman. It's fascinating how Elfman was able to make an orchestra sound like crickets and hornets buzzing and chirping. It really adds to the visuals of the title sequence. As for the other music in the film. The rap tunes from Will Smith are just as catchy & memorable as the day, it first came out. 'Men in Black' song really does stand out on its own, to the point, that many people forget that the beats was a sample of 1982's 'Forget Me Nots' by Patrice Rushen. As for the humor for the film. Most of the jokes, physical, and verbally are still, laugh out loud, funny, even if some of them are often recycle, throughout the film, somewhat dated or even not complex. Don't get me wrong, as much as I would love more, well-though out sophistical jokes that mirrors, author, Douglas Adams's 'the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' novel; the lighter, cartoony, out of this world, simpler tone of 'Men in Black' works better for the general audiences. Plus, it's a lot better than the much darker and dryer bleak tone that authors, Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers had in the comic book series of the same name, in which, this movie is loosely based on. Don't get me wrong, I still like the cynicism & more grounded nature of the comic book, but a boogeyman like version, 'Men in Black' fighting the supernatural & brainwashing people to commit mass-school shooting, might not, be the right amount of family-oriented science fiction comedy, this film really need to be successful. After all, it will be really hard to root for, a selfish organization, wanting to secretly control the world, rather than trying to save it. Thank goodness, director, Barry Sonnenfield went with the right direction, by making them, 'the Men in Black' heroic than self-centered a-holes in the action scenes and the case work. Nevertheless, the movie still has a few problems with some of the judgment calls, the agents do, throughout the film. Without spoiling, most of it, I never truly, understood, why, Agent K would neuralize J after meeting him for the first time if he was just going to recruit him the next day? Even, today, it really does bug me down. Regardless of that, the plot-holes in this movie are mostly pretty minor. They're not too jarring, not to enjoy the rest of the film. After all, I quickly forget, that the giant bug alien somehow, fit with Edgar's body, because how entertaining, this is. That's how, watchable, it is! In the end, No neuralyzer will be powerful enough to make you forget this theatrical experience! It's a movie that's worth travelling millions of lightyears for. It's worth probing, after!",8,4,5,16 December 2017
Midsommar," This movie may become a cult classic. It's a Smörgåsbord of weirdness.
","Originally pitch as a straightforward slasher film about a group of American tourists being killed off by a surreal but vicious pagan cult during their midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village. The film directed by Ari Aster added elements to the concept about deteriorating relationship between the emotional trouble main character college student Dani Arbor (Florence Pugh) and her emotionally distant cultural anthropologist boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor). This was done in order for Aster to cope after he just experienced a difficult breakup. For the most part, this extra subplot was fine for most audience. After all it somewhat works as a semi metaphor for the rapid decline of Abrahamic religions within the western society. The phone calls in the beginning is one such example. Much like a prayer I like how the film is shot set squarely on the character's face implying that she's talking to somebody who isn't fully there to help her. Nobody home. Even with people in her presence, the movie views those discussions through reflections of glass. In spirituality, mirror is said to reflect the act of continual self-evaluation regarding the consequences of thoughts and actions. It shows how detachment she is in this somewhat cold alienating world only wanting to egocentric procreate. That's why it makes sense that Dani would eventually fell seduced by the warmth of Harga community after first rejecting them after the public Ättestupa senicides. She slowly sees that the villagers repeatedly appear to share feeling including pain and pleasure. They're also seem supported and only produced what seem good for the community rather than selfish means. Being more in line with nature's circle of life than it seems. The metaphor of the grass growing on her, represented Dani's rebirth as a seed rooting herself back into the society after burying herself with haunting guilt of a past tragedy. The more she spends in the bright light of the community, the more she becomes willing to pollinated through Harga own means. By the end, she has become the new definition of the flower generation to the point of absurdity. She found free love and peace in an unusual way. As for the other characters, their wiliness to stay after the senicides seem a little more baffling than Dani. Especially when it comes to their very lack of reaction to death. Even with the amounts of drugs in their system, the brainwashing of both Josh (William Jackson Harper) & Christian are really not well established. I get that Josh is an apolitical scholar just looking for fame and Christian is an unsympathetic opportunist what a be savior. Nevertheless, fighting over a thesis is not a great justified for them staying at Harga after witnessing people getting killed. There has to be something more which the film fails to mention. Then there is Mark (Will Poulter) whom impulsive dumb character seems really out of place and not needed as much of his story about wanting to score could had gone to Christian. After all, there was no good exposition dump on why he wasn't around the cliff to witness the senicides. Also, to add onto that, what happen to the rest of the tourists that came to the village on the first day? They all seem to disappear along with the baby. I doubt that the cult killed all of them for no good reason. There is no way the villagers will be able to get away with all that death rituals in the cellular age without a family member finding out. Since we on the topic of the ceremonies. The film is a bit unclear about the rituals and how often they do it. The 90 years exposition seem to be a bit muddled. I didn't know it meant the barn burning until I listen to the director's commentary much later. It's that confusing. Still it does still beg the question how Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren)'s parents died in a house fire if that wasn't it. To add onto that weird mess, it seems like some of the rituals could had cut out as many of them didn't really add much to the main story like the subplot with the cult's inbred oracle. They did truly come across as unrealistic drawn out sensory overload surrealism that was somewhat funny than frightening. Despite that I felt that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski did a great job with most of the shots. While super long, the whole establishment opening was a masterpiece. It was super creepy & disturbing. Very scary. There was also a lot of foreshadowing Easter eggs like the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz' references, bear artwork and the bouquet behind the photo of Dani. Even the very first shot of the film shows a full frame medieval folk pagan mural detailing roughly the entire sequence of events that will unfold. I also like how the film communicates the near constant hallucinogenic induced state by distorting and warping the scenery. For example, seeing Dani's family haunting her & turning the camera view upside-down on the Highway to Halsingland scene. Lots of rewatch value. I would love to one day watch all of the director's cut of the film. It's just over a half hour longer and contains more looks at both the American characters' dynamics, some cut rituals like the drowning kid and overtly supernatural elements like feet levitating off the ground. It might be interesting to look at and listen to, along with the full dark ambient eerie soundtrack composed by musician the Haxan Cloak. Overall: While the costumes might look nothing like Swedish culture & nobody really speaks with the region appropriate accent. I still said it's worth watching despite some people finding the film depiction of an iconic good nature Swedish holiday offensive and racist. It was still well shot, had fine performances even with the goofy memeable faces and downright entertaining for the most part. It's one trippy movie.",6,3,7,20 May 2020
The Graduate," It's Graduation Day! I think this movie is seducing me. You're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?
","The movie has this great 1960's Hollywood New Wave feel to it. This is a coming of age movie that works for me. A lot of coming of age movies seem to try to make their character innocent, but they never actually are. They do a bunch of irresponsible stuff and at the end of the day a lot of people call them 'innocent and lost', but it just feels like an excuse to sympathize for being an idiot. However I do sympathize for this character, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman). It seemed like he was forced into a pool and not allowed to come back up. The theme of an innocent and confused youth who is exploited, misdirected, seduced and betrayed by a corrupt older generation was well understood by film audiences and captured the spirit of the times. One of the film's posters proclaimed the difficult coming-of-age for college graduate. Directed by Mike Nichols, the film is based on the 1963 novel The Graduate by Charles Webb. The movie opens to one of the best songs of the 1960's, Simon & Garfunkel - The Sound of Silence. This is one of the best songs I've ever listened to. I think the soundtrack pretty much made Simon & Garfunkel from nearly unknown folk singers, to legends of the music industry. You can also hear an earlier version of Mrs. Robinson in the movie. The song as it appears in the film is different from the familiar hit single version, as only the chorus of the song appears late in the film and with slightly different lyrics. It was only later on that Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel re-recorded the song by employing additional lyrics to form the hit single. It's kinda funny that the original song was call 'Mrs. Roosevelt'. It would really be funny to see Eleanor Roosevelt have an affair with a younger man. The Sound of Silence song work for the film as it really fit in with the plot regarding the lack of communication between the controlling parents and the young adults. Anyways, Benjamin Braddock has just arrive back home, after years in College. Dustin Hoffman played the part of the awkward post-graduate student perfectly. I can't see Mike Nichols first choice, Robert Redford in this role. Dustin is kind of awkward that works, he isn't to an abnormal extent creep, he more just describes the entire situation to the woman. Unsure of himself, by being uncomfortable and anxious, and force to hear others decide for him what he will do with his future. Benjamin Braddock soon find himself, seduce by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and find himself tempt into an affair. Anne Bancroft is a cougar on the prowl, really to pounce on her prey. She was really pretty in the room. Even though her character is sympathetic, it doesn't change the fact that her character is a vindictive sexual predator. Just the line 'You've known me nearly all your life.' Is just disturbing. Mrs. Robinson wanting to bang a kid she watched grow up? That's gross, and just a step below Woody Allen marrying his stepdaughter. She was marry too, so not only is she wanting to date a younger man, she watch when he was kid, but she's also cheating on her husband. It is pure flesh, but she is nice about it. It is just natural, pragmatic and not that romantic-idealistic. She's still the Queen of all Milfs. Her personal life isn't the only thing she's opening. Some people might hate the fact, that the two main characters are two of the most shallow, childish characters. Mrs. Robinson can be especially hateful without any specific motivation, while Benjamin is bit spineless. I do love Dustin Hoffman in the role, but he was way too old for this part. He was playing a 20 year old, and he himself was 30 at the time. Also Anne Bancroft was only 35 during the time of filming. It also kinda funny that the actress Katharine Ross who played Anne Bancroft's daughter Elaine was only 8 years younger than her 35 and 27, miscasting. Katherine Ross looks lovely as Elaine, but she's barely one-dimensional and looks like a girl who would never go for a guy like Dustin Hoffman in a million years. She only went with him, because of her over controlling parents. Anyways, Benjamin soon fall in love with Elaine, and is in a dilemma. Should be continue to live with people telling what to do with his life like Mrs. Robinson or should he set his own future with a girl like Elaine? Find out, by watching it. The ending is up to question, if these two would work out. It leaves a deep interpretation of risky love. This is a classic film: tightly written, intelligent, funny, wonderfully acted, with a great climax with the church, so to speak. You will get seduce into watching the film by how brilliant it is.",8,0,0,17 June 2013
Elysium," Welcome to the world of Elysium: Heaven, if you're rich, and hell on earth if you're poor. Elysium is a great thinking man Sci-fiction movie.
","From the director of 2009's Distant 9 Neil Blomkamp, comes another controversial sci-fi movie about the different between the have and have not, racism, and overpopulation. The movie is so like Distant 9, it's like watching the future Earth after the aliens left it. It's pretty shocking to see Neil Blomkamp try to strike lightning again with similar plots and themes. It's rare to see a hard Rated R blockbuster nowadays. I give props to them about that. The movie is a thinking man movie because it explores the political and sociological themes such as immigration, health care and class issues. Great world building indeed, as the film takes place in 2154, on both a luxurious space station known as Elysium where the rich people have orbit and ravaged, disease, wasteland Earth with the overpopulation poor. Elysium's Earth, so remind me of Distant 9 with its vast emptiness. Elysium's space station reminds me of an old 1970's NASA Ames drawings of a ring-shaped Torus space station. Those paintings were in a lot of Sci-Fi books and comics at the time and the 1980's. The space station also look like something that came from 1968's Kubrick, 'A Space Odyssey' or Larry Niven's Ringworld novel. The visual effects are amazing. Great use of CGI. The world on display here is imaginative yet utterly convincing. Max DeCosta (Matt Damon), an ex-con lives in this world, manufacturing the means of his own oppression, making security bots. It's weird that he is one of the few white people on Earth. Only when he got into deadly radiation poisoning, he joins the cause of getting people to Elysium so that they can have a chance to survive. I would kinda like to see that he was loyal to that cause beforehand. He is not alone, as he is join by his childhood best friend, Fey (Alice Braga) who daughter has leukemia. Don't get me wrong, free health care to sick dying children is fine, but with a world that is that overpopulation; the hard truth is that depopulation is needed to solve that problem. Overpopulation can destroy a habitat and nature eco-cycle if not watch. In truth, while Max DeCosta and his crew are portray as free-fighters, they are also terrorists to those people who control Elysium, mostly John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster). While, William Fichtner is clearly acting as William Fichtner; Jodie Foster's acting was pretty bad. She had this weird accent that supposed to be South African as if she was playing Lillian Crane. I don't understand why everybody in Elysium was portray as evil business-men. While, I'm more liberal, I would think at less, the movie would have shown that some people at Elysium would be more against the anti-immigration. Why couldn't Elysium build another space station or terra- form another planet or even get this, rebuild Earth? Clearly, they had the technology for it. I forgot, because the plot says so. At less, they could have done is add a few medical pods on Earth for young dying children so they would be so many civil unrest. So Max makes a deal with a local crime lord: He will kidnap John Carlyle in order to download information held in his brain, and in return he'll get a ticket on the next illicit flight to Elysium. To help with the gig, Max even has a powerful exo-skeleton grafted painfully onto his body. This makes the movie, seem more like a video game like Bio Shock Infinite. The movie is full of annoying action scenes with slow bullet time moments and shaking cam. It was a headache to watch. The action fight scenes were so fast, it was blurry. At less, Mad Max had himself, a pretty intense psycho villain mercenary named Kruger. (Sharlto Copley). Wow, this actor is amazing, too bad, he isn't in many films. It's polar opposite of the character, he played in Distant 9. The movie's plot can be a big predictable. The Jesus symbolism was tired when other movies did it, and manages to feel even more derivative in this film's overt delivery. An handful of right-wing news outlets attacked the film for being sci-fi socialism, but in my opinion, there is nothing wrong with open discussion to these issues. I agree the film should be designed to make us think, rather than stuff a predigested agenda down our throats, but sometimes that push is needed for this society. Much of what Republican analysts mistakenly see as Occupy Wall Street support is merely a form of 'mass-ploitation' — Hollywood seizing on angles that appeal to the widest possible audience. There been films like this since the dawn of cinema. Remember, films like 1927's Metropolis. I think, most people would agree with that people should have access to first-rate healthcare and a better standard of living. They just disagree on the means of providing that. The themes of the movie are brilliant, even the title 'Elysium' was a term in ancient times given to a place, like Heaven that was reserved by gods for the favored heroes. We have other literary examples of this through Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, and Philip Dick, to name a few. The movie also have this 1979's Mad Max feel to it. The soundtrack was a bit too loud. It remind me of a copycat of 2010's Inception sound, rather than the moving music instrument that should follow a film like this. That being the case, Elysium is just not the satisfying film it should be to some people, but to me: it work. It was fun to watch. Elysium works in a way, how Elysium in the film works. It's just there to remind people to seek a better life. I could find escape from the harshest of my reality in the film 'Elysium'.",7,3,4,18 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," This movie isn't wonderful at all! It's horrible!
","2010's 'Alice in Wonderland' is a film that, on paper, would seem perfect for director Tim Burton's dark creepy unique skills. After all, the original novel of the same name by author, Lewis Carroll is known for its dark humor, and insane tone, but the main reason why I dislike this movie, so much, is because, the screenwriter of this film, Linda Woolverton try to put logic in a story that needs no logic. 'Alice in Wonderland' isn't about an ancient prophecy about a grown woman, Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) ending the Red Queen's reign (Helena Bonham Carter) and restoring order to the world of Underland, with war and battle. No, it's about a child's journey into the world of the absurd and surreal, and learning that life is not rational. Most adaptations follows these guidelines, but somehow director Tim Burton's version, wanted to be different and verve off, drastically. Sadly, the changes, they made, weren't good at all. First off, when did Wonderland turn into Underland? I get, that the land is supposedly beneath a rabbit hole in the ground, but since the movie share more relates to the novel 'Through the Looking-Glass' than 'Alice: Adventures in Wonderland', shouldn't it, be call 'Mirrorland'? Or better yeah, 'Imagineland' since its coming from the dark side of Alice's mind. Anyways, no matter, how much logic, they try to put into naming this place. Carroll never call, his world, anything else, than Wonderland. It's always been Wonderland. So, why did they add this!? It's so pointless. Also, when did that world had a 'Chosen One' war plot as if it's 'Lord of the Ring' or 'Narnia'?! Isn't it weird that nobody else, step up and kill the queen, already, seeing how the land is full of magical cakes and liquor that change your size? Why hasn't that happen, yet!? Even the villain, doesn't match the source material, as the Red Queen is not the same person as the Queen of Hearts. If anything, it's should be a war against math, since Carroll hatred that. Second off, they insult both the fans of the 1951's Disney animated version and the Carroll's purists, by having deceitful marketing. By having a grown adult, Alice returning back to Wonderland, instead of a kid discovery the world for the first time. It made this film, technically a sequel. Yet, Disney still call the movie with its originally name, leading much confusement. Honestly, a story like this, could had work, if they went with a different title and wrote Alice as a adult who must reclaims her youthful spirit in order to save the world. Similar in the way, 1991's film 'Hook' did with its source material with 'Peter Pan'. Instead, the movie has Alice, still childish in her adult years fighting against the pressures of conforming to 19th century aristocratic society's expectations. This is fine and dandy, if the moral of story is trying to tell the audience to be mature adults and learn to take responsibility, but no that's isn't what, the screenwriter was going for. The film instead, has Alice still going against her Victorian lifestyle straight in the end; even after the fact that she obey Wonderland's rules, with her destiny on killing the dragon-like creature, the Jabberwocky (Voiced by Christopher Lee), leading to little to no character development. I know, Woolverton wanted to make Alice into a stronger will person, that empower women to choose her own path, but this story arch goes nowhere. Couldn't they wrote Alice, a little better!? Mia Waskowska's performance doesn't help as well. She seem very disconnected from everything that is happening on screen. She seem so bland and boring. The worst of this, had to be the scenes, where Alice is supposed to go through a variety of absurd physical changes that are to represent the discomfort of having a period and going through puberty. Hints the metaphors with the food and drinks. Yet, Mia's look so disinterested. We see very little traumatic, frustration, or even sadness, from her. Very bad acting. Made me wish, for a talent child actress instead. The only reason, why I can see why they change this, is because of Lewis Carroll's questionable relationship with little girls. A lot of historians think that he might had been a paedophile, but still had Alice be a kid in this film. After all, this is originally supposed to be, a kid's movie. Despite that, the supporting cast were a little more memorable in their performance, even if they were chewing up the scenery with how over the top, they were. Still, it's a bit tiresome and repetitive, to see actors Johnny Depp and actress, Helena Bonham Carter in yet, another Burton movie doing their shtick. Another problem with this film, is how ugly looking the visuals look. I hate how much time, they spent in Alice's Victorian era life. Everything there is so gloomy. It really sucks the fun out of the film. Wonderland in 3D is not any better. Although, the visuals of that world does have some beautiful moment, for the most part, the faded colors added to the melancholy tone of the world at war theme. It's not that good. Plus, it looks so blurry. I'm sorry, but the CGI also looks very fake-looking. They all have that artificial quality that looks even worse in the 2D version of the film. It's sad, because Burton was once-known for his stunning cool sets and unique realistic character design. Another disappointment in this film was lack of music. Where was the 'happy unbirthday' song? Where is any song from the source material!? Clearly, there wasn't much heart, put into that department as even Danny Elfman's overall score sounds pretty generic and plain as well. Despite these qualms, the film made a lot of money, proving once again that Burton knows how to please the majority of his audience. However, not me. I really hate this film and its 2016 sequel. Can't recommended.",6,5,8,4 November 2016
Toy Story 2," When somebody love this movie, everything is beautiful
","Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart. Woody and the gang are back in one of the best sequels ever made: Pixar's Toy Story 2. Here's something interesting. This film was originally a direct to video movie. But while in the process of making it, they realized how good it was turning out and decided to make it an theatrical movie. Thank Goodness, Pixar saw something in it, rather than continue the Disney's awful sequels cycle. The Pixar folks didn't want 'drop' everything for the direct-to-video version. They make a brand-new story for the theatrical release because they wanted to; there was pressure from Disney to do a direct to video due to save money. The Pixar folks were sensing impending doom because they didn't know what to do, and as a last resort John Lasseter was called in from his long overdue vacation to fix the movie in time for its release. The process was rushed, messy, and nerve-wracking. But by God did it all pay off in the end!! Who knew that Toy Story 2 would partially lead to Disney's fall out with Pixar a few years later. Anyways the idea for the opening of this film was the original idea for the opening of Toy Story, only instead of a video game, it's a TV show. But the makers decided to scrap that idea and open the movie with play action with Andy, because they wanted to establish the bond between Andy and Woody in Toy story. Then when they made Toy story 2, they decided to bring back that idea only make it a video game. Still, that one impression video game for an early 2000's video game. My N64 and Playstation couldn't even be that good. The toys in Andy's room has just witness Woody (Tom Hanks) getting stolen by toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Now Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) must sent a rescue mission to save him. While at the same time at Al's penthouse, Woody finds out how much he is value, and thinks about being display in a toy museum along with Woody's Roundup pals Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar). The reasons is that, he knows deep inside of him that Andy will grow up one day and forget about him. The dilemma that Woody has, is a good dilemma and makes sense. In a way, foreshadowing Toy Story 3 so rather than being forgotten, he along with his new friends can be loved forever if he takes this chance with the museum in Japan. In the movie we get all the old characters of the first movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney in his last movie) as well as new characters such as Bulleye, and Weezy. I don't like how they forced feed us, Weezy. His character really came out of nowhere. Where was he in the original movie? Also check out, the scene was when Woody was being fixed up by the toy repairman, you might notice the toy repairman from the short film, Pixar's Geri's Game. The acting was pretty good, but Joan Cusack can be a bit annoying with her character. The story was well-written. The dramatic and emotional feel of the film has gotten better. The highlight back-story of Jesse just put you into tears, and that whole montage is told by one of the best songs in Disney's history. 'When somebody love me' sung by Sarah McLachlan. I might not be a huge Randy Newman's fan, but the song works here. The humors works and I like how the film mocks old films and TV Shows like Star Wars and Howdy Dowdy. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love and is hence more fun. The visuals are break taking and the action is challenging to the eyes. I actually really liked the 'secret' villain. I certainly didn't see it coming the first time I saw the movie, and I thought his motivation made sense, and kinda made me feel sorry for him. The fact that he never been loved and played with gave him a very different psychology from the other toys. The museum would be the closest thing to love he felt he'd ever have, so of course he's going to do anything for that, and isn't going to have much sympathy for Woody wanting to return to Andy. This movie isn't for toddlers. Let me get that straight for any first time parent. Its better off, when the child has mature enough aged to the point where it's can be deemed right to watch due to the large noises, large yelling and visual effects that can hurt a toddler's eyes. It's PG rating, people, not G. I really can't find much that was wrong with this film. It's just a great watch. So check it out if you haven't watch it already.",8,5,6,25 March 2013
Selma," Let Freedom Ring! Selma is a highly engaging film about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. It's a must-watch.
","Selma, might not be in the running for any 2015 Academy Award categories, but the snubbing, wouldn't stop the film from being a captivating portrayal of the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. Seeing this play out on film was indeed a great watch. With an array of wide shots and gliding camera-work, under gospel and melancholy score, director Ava DuVernay delivers. You really get how the admired leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his followers prompted change. Oyelowo really digs deep in the role of M.L.K. He play King with a wide acting range; from being grand speaker of sermons, to him, playing the quiet defeatism when it come to confronted by his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) about his infidelity or his misjudgment when it comes to how the Civil Rights, should be run. A scene where the lively group sits down for a home-cooked meal even show a charming human side of Martin Luther King Jr, that's rare to see. It was great to see, Oyelowo overcome, years of being typecast as the over the top angry black man in these racial dealing movies. I was really glad, that Oyelowo fought very hard for 7 years to get the role of King, and found a way to get his biggest critic, Lee Daniels, the original director attached, off the project, because, in my opinion, I found Lee Daniels to be a really horrible director. Most of the supporting characters were pretty great in their roles. This movie allows Carmen Ejogo to play Coretta Scott King, a second time and she just as good as her performance in 2001's TV Movie, 'Boycott'. The historical accuracy of the film's story has been the subject of controversy, particularly with regard to Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson and his relationship with King. The film portrayal of Johnson is indeed, less flattering than it should be, accusing the president for being a time-wasting political leader that allow the FBI to monitor and harass King, on his watch. Maybe, there is some truth to that, but I really like how Tom Wilkinson portray him as a very complex character with way too much political problems to handled, at one time. Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace was wonderful. I love the tense scene between him and LBJ. Still, there were some characters that didn't get much of film time. In Depth examine of characters like Viola Liuzzo (Tara Ochs), seem to missing. The movie end credits, makes it seem like she was a big character in the film, but you rarely see that. I like Oprah Winfrey's bit part in the film as Annie Lee Cooper. It seems like she was a big part of the film, but she rarely mention, toward the end. Other mainstream actors like Cuba Gooding Jr. as Fred Gray and Dylan Baker as J. Edgar Hoover should had been cut out of the film, because they couldn't act, even in their short scenes. Even big historical characters like Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), seem lost in the odd pacing of the film. We see him, talking to Coretta, about joining the movement, and its leads to nothing. Later in the film, King mention that he was assassinate, a few weeks early, but there was no scene with him, getting whacked off. There was little to no reason, why he was brought in the story, because his character play so little to the Selma movement success. DuVernay's movie structure is indeed, bit off. The movie make it seem that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing of 1963, happen during King receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. I know, Ava DuVernay did this for a story telling stand-forth, and it kinda works, but for anybody that know history. These small changes can be, a bit jarring. While, the movie isn't a documentary, and I'm willing to take artistic license. I just thought, maybe they could had patch up, some of these gaping holes and make it a lot focus driven film. Racism is difficult to depict on screen. Even at its most realistic, it can seem cartoonish in modern context. At times, the movie seem a bit harsh when portraying White Southerners. I really doubt, that they're all racists. The film makes it seem like the good whites folks came from the North, all to support, the Civil Rights movement, after seeing the brutal attacks at that Bridge. That's hardly the truth. There were a lot of White Southerners followers within MLK's group even before that event. Overall: Some people think this film was just create to stir the already tense race issue, since recent events like the Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant and Michael Brown's shootings have put people already on the edge. Because of movies like this is why there is so much racism in society because animosity never goes away. Certain black groups will be always eyeful and paranoia. White people will feel unwanted, and feel with guilt. We get it already. Racism is bad. Yes, a lot of movies feature black actors, focus way too much on the race card. There are other issues, black people go through. The subject that's never brought up which is more relevant is class. Racism is tied to classism. I think the movie kinda hints at that. So, it get some credit. While, this movie on the surface, seems like throwing fuel in the racial-tensions fire. I glad that films like this exist. Even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. They help people know, about their history and encourage them to more positively impact their future through an attitude of compassion and a reverence for change and progress towards equality in a peaceful matter. This is one of the movie's greatest strengths and why it's a must-watch.",8,11,18,29 January 2015
The Artist," The Artist is silent, but deadly. It's a good watch, but it's not a perfect film.
","If I can say a few words about this film. It's didn't deserve the praise, it got. I know, its sound harsh, since I do kinda like the film, but besides it paying homage to the style of a black and white nostalgia silent film. There is barely anything original. It felt very old. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, but compare to the others movies nominated that year for Best Picture. I was deeply surprising that it won Best Picture in 2011. Directed & written by Michel Hazanavicius, the movie takes place in the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1920s, focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) and a rising young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) during the growth of the 'talkies' films. Like, I said, before, the movie concept isn't anything new. It's been tackle years ago, by 1952's Singing in the Rain, 1954's A Star is Born, and 1950's Sunset BLVD, but unlike them, the Artist received way too much highly positive reviews from critics and won many awards, including Best Picture at the Oscars. It just seems like such a common, classic storyline, almost timeless and yet in 'The Artist', this plot feels extremely stale to me. While, it's not as good as those films that I listed above. While, this might be a controversy decision. I have to say, it's a lot better than a lot of older films during the silent era in entertainment value. It's really funny, and you find yourself, laughing yourself head off. Honestly, besides Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton's films, there are rarely any funny silent era films. Most of them, were very slapstick and didn't have much of any other types of humor. I have to say this film was a lot clever in how to show emotional without speaking than the silent era. The movie does well to establish the limit of the medium, but throughout the film, they do break it at times. I love how clever the film it was to show adult themes like George's leading lady almost giving the finger. Though if you pay attention to her lips, you can see she's also a silent Cluster F-Bomb. The film have a lot of things, you quite don't see in any old silent-movie. The film has way better acting than a lot of those way over the top acting from silent films. Did Jean Dujardin deserve the Best Actor award that year? In my opinion, not really. While, his acting was alright in the medium, he was in. It's cool that he tap dance, have comedy chops and show emotion, but it was indeed limiting. You really don't see, how great; he can become, because he playing this silly likable character than. Still, he's by far the best thing in the film. I didn't like Berenice Bejo or the role, she had. She felt a bit 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl'. Also, Berenice Bejo doesn't really stand out, much. Half of the time, I mistake her for actress, Rachel McAdams. The dog, Uggie remind me a lot of Skippy aka Asta who appeared in dozens of movies during the 1930s like the Thin Man series. While, the film mostly expresses its love for movies by channeling well-known silent-era tropes; the movie has a lot of references to early talkies films, more than silent films. Don't get me wrong, you see some silent film references to Rudolph Valentino's films like 1920's Mask of Zorro, 1921's The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse & 1927's Metropolis, but I wish the movie capture more from that era than it did. I have watch a lot of silent films over the years, and the film is missing telling the story in purely epic visual terms. While, the movie isn't low budget. It feels and look low budget at times. Why have only a few dancers? 1920s films like 1929's Broadway Melody had tons of them. Why have a small set for the Mask of Zorro rip-off scene? Get a huge set for it, like 1916's Intolerance. I was really hoping for a lot of 4:3 shots made to look wide screen with large sets and tons of extras. Films in the 1920s were big and high in production value, back then. I was hoping for something like that. I like how catchy the main tune is, by Ludovic Bource. It was indeed fun to hear, but I surprise to hear a synchronized music recorded for a silent film. Most of the time in silent film terms, the theater would provide the music for the film or sheet music would be sent down with the film. While, it's not a big deal, if the movie really wanted to be, realistic. It wouldn't have any sound effects or background music like older silent films. There has been some controversy about the film music. Actress Kim Novak stated that the film 'rape' portions of Bernard Herrmann's score from Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo for this film. I have to disagree with Novak, here. They did use music from another movie, but they did pay for it. The movie pacing is a hit and miss. At 100 minutes, the movie pacing should be fast pace, considering the simplistic, and silent, narrative, but it tendency drags on. Still, most of the scenes that they linger on, were worth it. Though for those who interpret and analysis the film, believe The Artist serves a metaphor for those who reject new technologies such as this generation, when digital media is becoming more and more the norm. You have to learn how to convert and change with the times. Overall: This movie was alright. I didn't think it was all Oscar worthy like they made it out to be, but definitely worth a look.",8,5,9,13 January 2015
La La Land," La La Land hit the right notes for the most part. Still, I felt a little disjointed, while watching it. It's a good film, but not a perfect film.
","Similar to the way, I felt about 2011's Oscar Best Picture 'The Artist', for its love letter portrayal of old Hollywood black and white silent film styles. 'La La Land' is the same with its homage to the 1950's Golden Age of Hollywood Musicals. Vibrant colors and exquisite cinematography makes this film, perfect eye candy. The opening song and dance sequence to the song 'Another Day in the Sun' sets the tone of the routine of joyful dreams of succeeding in Los Angeles, while stuck in gridlock on the freeway, going nowhere fast, without establishing, any of the characters. Others songs like 'Someone in the Crowd', 'The Fools Who Dream', 'A Lovely Night' and 'City of Stars' by Justin Hurwitz, were beautiful and the dancing was impressive throughout it. Even music without lyrics like 'Mia and Sebastian theme' & 'Planetarium' stood out. However, the music, they chose, didn't have, much of a Jazz feel to it for a film trying to save original jazz. While, these songs makes the movie seem entertaining to new viewers, the dancing and the story felt too old & familiar for me. The story about two struggling artists, one being actress, Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) & the other, being an old school Jazz musician, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) felt a little too generic. After all, I saw similar musicals films like this, before in 1951's 'An American in Paris', 1952's 'Singing in the Rain', 1953's 'The Band Wagon', & 1954's 'A Star is Born'. This film even remind me of non 1950's musical films like 1964's 'Paris, when it sizzles' & 1975's 'the Day of the Locusts' in its style. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some unique things that set it, apart from those films, like, placing it in a weird 1950's fuel, nostalgic present time and using digital effects to make a great musical numbers, however the story of Sebastian and Mia trying to make it in Hollywood, fell a little short in me. Maybe, because, I thought the movie play it, really too safe. It didn't really have, much of an interesting real-life story conflict, compare to the others movies nominated that year for Best Picture. It's pure romanticism escapism for the most part. It doesn't challenge Hollywood in any unconventional terms. No wonder, why Hollywood loves this film. It praise it, without much criticize. I think, that is one of the problems with this film. It's wears its location on its sleeve, with several standard Hollywood house parties, several scenes on movie backlots and discussions on movie history, and a plethora of struggling artists trying to make it, that the other side of Americans or the rest of the world can't really relate to it. After all, the conflict in the film really do, seem a bit 'first world' problems. While, I love that the word 'La La Land' euphemism describing a person out of touch with reality. I wish the movie would had use that, more. I would had love to see the movie dealt more with what Los Angeles life is really like, than what's it's portray in Hollywood. Something similar to the musical 'In the Heights' or 'Rent' did for New York City. After all, modern day Los Angeles population is mostly made out of very normal people of every culture and creed, but rarely any of them is showcase in this film. All of the people feature here, seem a little fake-looking with their rich and beautiful Hollywood lives. Despite that, Stone and Gosling show strength in their performances, even if Gosling character seem out of place as the white guy trying to save Jazz. It probably would have been better, if he was played by a black actor. Despite that Gosling was alright, even if his character was somewhat of a jerk, at times. Though his own character is indeed flawed, Sebastian shows refreshing selflessness towards Mia, putting her dreams and pursuits even above himself and encouraging her all the way. Mia isn't without her positive attributes either. She puts her everything into being a successful, good artist. The audition scene is heart-breaking. Overall: both of the actors made their characters, very likable. Also, their singing was alright, even if they still feel a bit rough around the edges at times. About their chemistry, this is the third time, following 2011's 'Crazy Stupid Love' and 2013's 'Gangster Squad', where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone work together. Both were able to align with each other, once again, on every level in this film. In the end, 'La La Land' serve as the antithesis to 2014's 'Whiplash', writer and director Damien Chazelle's previous film. This is most notable in the two films' tones - where 'Whiplash' was dark and oppressive with the New York settling, this film is a bright, sparkling, old-fashioned Hollywood musical with just a hint of modern cynicism. There's even a counterpart in the characters of actor, J.K. Simmons, going to a mean guy who's a jazz maniac to a mean guy who doesn't want to hear any jazz. Both films deal with the common theme that many dreamers face: how far should people go in pursuing their own passions, while risking their own connection toward friends, family and relationships? In my opinion, 'Whiplash' shows the dangers, a lot better. Why, because I think the five years/dream sequence ending of this film, kinda the message. It felt like a cop-out. Don't get me wrong, I still think this film is worthy of the accolades, it is sure to receive. However, if I had to choose, which movie of Chazelle told the same story, better. I have to say 'Whiplash'. Still, recommended seeing 'La La Land', regardless. It's a fun movie to watch.",8,4,9,8 February 2017
Super 8," Wait a minute, is this movie directed by JJ Abrams or Steven Spielberg?
","Everything about this movie looks and feels like a Steven Spielberg movie rather than a JJ. Abrams. Unlike others movies that Spielberg produces, this one honestly feels like he directed it with most of the movie seem to be influences by a lot of Spielberg earlier works with scenes similar to Jurassic Park, Goonies, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, Jaws, E.T and War of the Worlds to name a few. It's called money and camera shot familiarity. Film directors patent movie grain, angles, and camera recording quality. So you instantly recognize Steven Spielberg DNA on film. Not only that, the movie has the same story clichés as Spielberg earlier works. Noticing these terms, Keeping the Family Together; The Search for the Lost Child; Science vs. Authority; Kids on Their Own. You find it in every early Spielberg film and in here. I wanted to see JJ Abrams spin into it, like 'Lost', but this film was so Spielbergism. Looking past that, the story starts off in 1979. Deputy Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his son Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) are just getting over the death of a love one. Joel Courtney reminds me of a very young Sean Astin from Goonies. Joe's friends decides to produce and make a low-budget zombie movie using a Super 8 camera to enter into an international film competition. Joe's friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) also enlists the help of 14-year-old Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) who is the daughter of the man that Joe's father has a beef with. So in a way, there is a bit of a Romeo and Juliet's house work here as Jack Lamb believes Alice's father had something to do with his wife's death. Elle Fanning who looks way older than her older sister Dakota was pretty good, playing the disturb daughter. Charles decides to film a scene at the local train depot using a passing train to add authenticity to his film. While shooting, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train head-on, causing a massive train derailment as the friends barely escape the resulting chaos and explosions. A alien is sent free and the government comes to find it led by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich), arrive to secure the area and the town. I'm kinda a huge fan of Noel Emmerich after seeing him in Thurman Show, but Colonel Nelec wasn't that impressing. Plus those Air Force uniform were ugly, it's remind me more of the Green Berets than the air force. Nelec discovers an empty box of Super 8 MM film, and assumes the event was captured on camera. Soon, people around town start to disappear, and Alice is one of the them. It's a race against time for the kids, as they try to save Alice from the alien. Most people thought of the movie as prequel of Cloverfield. JJ Abrams said no, but the alien did look like the one in that film. Let me state this out, if you honestly thinking this is going to be 'alien/monster' movie then you will be disappointed. You don't see the monster until near the end of the movie. This was very well written. It's not about the alien, but deals more with coping of a lose of somebody, the tense moments of father/child, and childhood innocents. It's mostly about Joe Lamb dealing with the death of his mother, while falling in love with the daughter of the man who cause his mother's death. I like the movie, all the kid's actors were great in it. The kid that's play Cary in the film, looks and reminds me of that kid from the Bad News Bears. It's really good how they tie in all this, with the sci-fiction. Some scenes were really slow, and the pacing should have really pick up. The ending to the movie was flat in my opinion. Other than that, it was good. Check out, during the credits, the completed Super 8 zombie film, titled The Case, by Charles and his friends is shown. The Case is just awfully funny on how badly it's made. Abrams' original plan was to film all of the sequences for the film-within-a-film, 'The Case', using Super-8 cameras. However, this approach proved unsuccessful, as visual effects house ILM found it impossible to integrate CGI into the footage due to the format's graininess. For sequences involving CGI, cinematographer used Super 16 instead. In a way, the title should have been known as Super 8 & 16. Just don't think it's a alien movie, but more a coming to age movie",7,3,4,9 February 2013
Sinister," Once you see this movie, nothing can save you from asking yourself. What the hell did I watch?
","Sinister is one of those horror movies that some people think is bringing something new to the table of horror movie, but for me, it's just another modern horror movie that looks exactly the same like the others. I have the same feeling to this, as I did with 2010's Insidious or 2013's the Conjuring. I wouldn't hate you, if you really like the movie, but for me, this movie was just another movie, full of the same old tired clichés of red herrings and jump scares. I've waded through enough, truly terrible movies, to know, that this movie is far from the worst, but it's nothing new. I was really looking forward to a horror movie with some depth to it, like 1973's Exorcist & 1990's Jacob Ladder. Sadly, I didn't feel, I got it here. For a haunted house movie, it's no 1980's Shining. The movie really use a lot of old cheap desperate tricks for scares such as creaky floorboards, sudden loud sound effects, and old snuff like footage. Directed by Scott Derrickson, and co-written by ex-film critic, C. Robert Cargill, of spill dot com fame. The movie is about Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) whom, is true-crime writer that can't get a break. Desperate for inspiration and his next big hit, he decides to move his family into a house once own by the victims of a recent murder. Wanting to write about it, he digs clues in the house, only to find out that a strange being is still around, and haunting his family and himself. The antagonist is pretty freaky-looking and the back story is cool enough. Still, it's hard to believe that an ancient pagan Babylonian deity named Bughuul AKA Mr. Boogie (Nick King), would be in rural Pennsylvania wearing a suit and tie. It's like having Hades in Iowa wearing a white tuxedo. It doesn't make sense. The villain kinda made me laugh, cause how similar, he looks like, to heavy metal band Slipknot member Mick Thomson in his mask. In no way, can I see this guy, passing as an evil Babylonian deity. Also, why on earth, would Mr. Boogie have the kicks to allow children to make snuff films with Super-8 film, anyways? Does he keep a projector in the spiritual realm? I can understand, the way he makes them label the 'Home Videos' with ironic titles, due to the variety and creativity of the murders. Hinting at least a touch of sheer sadism and possibly to goad potential victims to watch the movies and unknowingly summon him. Still, he lives in pictures. Wouldn't he use more modern technology to get his message out, more, you know like a DVD or internet or something more modern? Honestly, how many homes, still have projector? He probably be starving himself, by now, if it was the real world. The movie does try to go the uneasy voyeur feel of watching realistic looking 8MM snuff film movie, but for this film, it doesn't look right. The murders shown on tape are not explicitly graphic enough to be taken as a Rated R film. For a low-resolution, shaky Super-8 home videos from decades ago, these film are too edited. It is way too edited, even for the plot to say so. I know the film wants you to think, it's edited, by showing Ellison editing film footage by hand, and for a later plot-twist, but the Super 8 film is just way too clean. It's not like today, film. There are things; you can't do with Super 8 with burning it up, or becoming too chopped. The movie tries really hard to get that 2002's Ring, feel, but it doesn't nail it right. Its stupid gimmicks like these, that make the movie feel unrealistic, and lose its scary tone. The cast are nothing special. I'm not exactly rooting for any of them. The kids are alright, acting wise, but have way too much screen time. The whole hide and go seek series of scenes were just cheesy and go way too long. The death make up was horrible. The pacing is bit long for my taste. There are a lot of music-montages, although I quite enjoyed them, but could be cut a bit. After about half an hour, the film has a great sense of foreboding dread. It continues to carry the doom unto the credits. The film is mostly shot in the dark. I can understand that's a great use for a horror movie, but come on– there are no reason for the majority of the movie, to look that way. If you can't make daylight look scary, than you can't make horror films, very well. Another problem is the exposition. Yes, it's a horror movie, and you don't need to explain everything. Still, the son night terrors are one of the ambiguities - is he having night terrors because of Bughuul, or is it just a coincidence? It felt like lazy writing, not to explain it. He just randomly show up when they need a red herring. I wouldn't recommended watching the trailer for this film. Pretty much, every scary part of the movie is shown in the trailer. Even, the DVD cover even spoils the movie. The movie has a sequel in the works as of this writing, but I don't know, how they will follow it up with something new or flesh. Overall: The movie was alright, but it wasn't what I can call amazing. Demonstration wise, it's still one of the better horror film in recent memory.",6,7,11,25 August 2014
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Home Alone 2 takes a big bite out of the Big Apple and I kinda like it.
","In 1990, Home Alone came out to great success, so it was no surprise that, two years later, in 1992, they would go on and make a sequel. Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, was mainly a rehash of the original, only it was set in New York City, this time. It's generally considered to be respectful to the first movie and was the second biggest box-office hit of 1992. A lot of the original people from the first film, return to work on this project. Directed by Chris Columbus, and written by John Hughes, the movie tells the story of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) whom once again, finds himself frustrated with his family to the point that once again, he finds himself, wishing he can be without them. We as the audience can't blame him, after all, his family didn't learn anything in the first film. There are still selfish jerks who really do mistreat him. Still, Kevin shouldn't be so happy to get rid of them, too. I thought, he learn that family is very important to have. Geesthis sequel really makes the whole first movie, really pointless. Anyways, instead of getting left home again, he loses track of his father at the airport, and mistakenly gets on a plane headed for New York City -- while the rest of his family fly to Miami. Now alone in the Big Apple, Kevin cons his way into a room at the Plaza Hotel and begins his usual antics. It's there, that he finds out that the two bumbling burglars that try to rob his home in the first movie, the Wet Bandits, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) & Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern) that are now trying to rob a famous toy store. Instead, of calling the police, Kevin should had done, he set up his Uncle's abandoned house with booby traps & forced Harry & Marv to follow him. Will the Bandits get the edge or will Kevin once again, outsmart them? Watch it to find out! In my opinion, the Bandits really didn't need to go into that house, as they honestly could had stolen the money and flee. It's not like they need the camera picture. They're already wanted criminals! This movie really doesn't give us, much that's new to work with. Yes, the New York City setting is cool to see, but honestly, it could had be downtown Chicago. Half the time, it was. Most of the film are shot there, while others were shot in California. The movie recycle a lot of the old gags from the first film, but puts in the extremes. The extreme cartoony slapstick violence, the cheesy one liners, the break the fourth wall jokes, the dim-wits minds of the criminals, and Kevin's hijinks are still worth seeing one more time and very surprising, still very funny. I have to disagree with certain critics that says cartoon violence is only funny in cartoons. After all, this film is no differs to the old school stunts of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers. Those films get high marks; why can this film? I wouldn't say, watch this movie on TV, because it might be deeply cut and edited. Instead, try to find the movie on DVD. Yes, this movie is a kid's movie, but parents should judge if this film is worth their kids watching, because the visual violence are very realism and has some dark humor. The movie came out when I was a kid, and even for me. I was like, how are these two criminals, even still alive? Clearly, Harry & Marv would be dead by now. Like I said in my original Home Alone review, Kevin might be a little too sadistic. God help us, when he grows ups. Still, most of the film has a lot of heart. Like the first film, Kevin meets somebody to help him, understand his family and Christmas. This time, it's a homeless bird lover woman played by Brenda Fricker whom is a pretty good actress. Most of the actors were. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern never lose a beat. Catherine O'Hara is great as the mother role. Tim Curry is hilarious as the side villain, Mr. Hector, the Plaza hotel concierge. Still, it makes me wonder, why the real life Plaza Hotel was so willing to portray their employees as idiots. I guess Donald Trump just really wanted that cameo. Oddly enough, the directions, Trump gives Kevin are incorrect. Once again, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear again. I still love the planning song. Overall: the concept was still fresh enough for a sequel and it was very enjoyable. Sadly, Hollywood made a lot of unwanted sequels like 1997's Home Alone 3, 2002's Home Alone 4, and 2012's Home Alone: The Holiday Heist that didn't have any of the original cast and crew. Indeed, they should have learn, you can mess with a lot of things, but you can't mess with kids on Christmas. In the end, those sequels were a mess, but this one still work. So AHHHHHH!!! Hooray for Home Alone 2!",6,4,8,21 December 2014
3 Idiots," All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.
","In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film.",8,4,6,11 August 2015
Up," Lighten Up with UP! It's up there as one of the best animation movies of all-time!
","What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here.",8,3,4,23 September 2015
From Hell," If you dislike this movie. Then, don't know Jack! In my opinion, From Hell is a killer horror movie, even with its flaws!
","During the fall of 1888, a series of five brutal murders shocks Victorian London. The victims, all poor female prostitutes, are murdered and then mutilated, by an unidentified serial killer, only known to the public, as Jack the Ripper. It became known as the White Chapel Murders. Ever since then, the unsolved mystery of the identity of the killer has been intrigue, both historians, scholars, and normal people for over a century now. It seems like everybody has a theory on who is the killer. One of those people, was writer Alan Moore. Taking its name from a letter, supposedly sent by the killer to the White Chapel Vigilance Committee, Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel 'From Hell' from 1989 to 1996 with cartoonist, Eddie Campbell. He wrote that the murders were part of a conspiracy to conceal the birth of an illegitimate royal baby fathered by then-Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (Mark Dexter). While, this plot sound realistic interesting. It's fictional as hell. Also, their 'Royal Conspiracy' theory wasn't that original. In truth, the 'Royal Conspiracy' theory, was taken from author, Stephen Knight's 1976's 'Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution' book. Unfortunately, this book is not a historically accurate one. It's riddled with historical errors, coincidences, and fabrications. Like the book, the film doesn't know that in real life, that the royal scandal was more about the prince's hidden homosexual than his fathering of an illegitimate son. Nor did they knew that the Freemasons at the time was nearly powerless, due to the height of anti-masonry due to mobile economically during the Industrial Revolution, plus the weakening of longstanding family and community ties. It doesn't help, that film directed by the Hughes Brother is only a loose adaptation of the comic, often taking a different approach. While, I did like the building on the mystery & allowing the police inspector, Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) to be the main character. Others things about the film kinda irritate me. I hate that the huge changes, involving the character of painter, Walter Sickert (Max Dexter). The idea that Sickert and the Prince are the same person is a bit much. Very off-putting, seeing how way different, these two men were in real-life. Plus, the killer's depth is reduced and much of the sophistical themes were also lost. Another thing, the idea of mixing the two characters of Inspector Frederick Abberline with fraudulent psychic, Robert James Lees into one, was a bit jarring. It doesn't make sense that he would be the head of the police department with such clairvoyant views. Another thing, the radical changes to Abberline from an older, gritty overweight conservative detective to a young drug addict inspector was just as puzzling. What type of police would allow a known-opium user to be the head of it!? I have to say; while Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and was alright in the role; I thought, his on-screen American Boy Scout good-looks and lack of British accent was a bit distracting. Also, the force love story between him and the lead prostitute, Mary Kelley (Heather Graham) was just as improbably. Heather Graham is alright, but it's nothing to write about. The supporting cast is also great, the women that play the victims, were memorable, however, it's Ian Holms as Sir William Gull & Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley that steals the movie, even if they were a bit hammy. From Hell is also one of the most beautifully atmospheric and visually gruesome period films about that era. In many ways, the film was very true to life, particularly in its recreation of Whitechapel and its portrayal of the everyday lives of its inhabitants. I really did felt like I step back into the haunting, yet wonderful world of Victorian England. It's so authentic. I even like the cameo of the Elephant Man, himself; John Merrick (Anthony Parker). The make-up work is also decent. I like how well, the gore effects look. The music of Trevor Jones was just as haunting. Overall: While, this movie does have some faults, it really didn't hurt the film, too much. I still somewhat enjoy the film. I have to say, the movie wasn't as predictable as some critics think it is. While, the order and names of the victims are well-known, the film still have time to show some twist and turns with the story. Yet, the film should certainly not be viewed as an authentic representation of the Ripper crimes as a whole. Still, the film serves as a good introduction to new viewers to the case and bring a new unique spin to those who know its history. It's fictional as hell, but entertaining.",7,0,0,23 August 2016
Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day is worth repeat viewings. It's just that watchable!
","Seeing how today is Feb 2, a.k.a. the actual in-real-life Groundhog Day holiday. It's the right time to watch this science fiction comedy, written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis. After all, this movie has one of the most fascinating, existentialist premise, ever given for a film; in which, asked, 'What would you do if you were stuck, reliving one day, for the rest of your existence'? This is what happens to cranky, yet smarmy, Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors (Bill Murray), whom awakened, everyday knowing that he has lived the same day, millions of times. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while 'Groundhog Day' isn't the first movie to use the time loop trope, as that would be 1945's British horror movie, 'Dead of the Night', it did massively popularized the time loop trope to the point, that other films like 2011's 'Source Code' & 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow', were greenlit to bring their own spin to the genre. However, none of those films were comedies. So, in the end, 'Groundhog Day' is in a league of its own. It's uniquely funny, well-written and with Bill Murray at his deadpan best. You really get to see Phil's character arch at work, here as he tries to both adjust to and escape from his bizarre dilemma. I like how the movie works from irresponsible, self-centered hedonism to suicidal despair to an insane number of time-consuming distractions, to finally, finding his own unexpected potential for self-growth and redemption, leading to a possibility arises that tomorrow might come for Phil after all. Bill Murray was amazing in the way, he was able to show, all of those range of emotions. Even the supporting cast was, fun to be, with. Andie MacDowell was great as the kind-hearted TV producer, Rita Hanson, while Chris Elliot was hilarious, as the cameraman, Larry. While, Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson was a bit annoying and hammy. He was alright for the short period of time, his character was used. It's was also nice to see future-famous actor, Michael Shannon in one of first films. Not only was the acting, great; but director Harold Ramis also uses sound and music to great comic effect. One of those was the ironically cheery Sonny and Cher song 'I Got You, Babe', which will clearly get stuck in your head, for better or for worse. Another great thing, Ramis and his crew did well, was use repetition to great effect. In a lesson trained, director, this movie could had easily to be boring, but somehow his crew, were able to make, seeing repetitive scenes, seem worthy rewatchable. They did this, by adding so much detail in the background, while also giving us, something new to look at, while using the same footage, by introducing sub-characters and key items, slowly. Another great thing, they added, was a lot of scenes that foreshadows, future events, yet also leave much to the viewer's interpretation, since many of the visuals can be used as a metaphors such as ice sculptures. One such example is the use of the blue opening where Phil describe his ideal home. While, it looks like vast emptiness, if you look deeply into it, the weather scene really does describe, what Phil wants, from life, as it secretly shows his selfishness and lack of concern for others, while also casting a shadow on him, both physically and mentally. In many ways, the main character is no different than the groundhog in a Plato's 'allegory of cave', kinda of a way. Another thing, worth noting is the use of author Joyce Kilmer's 'tree', poem for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery. At first, Phil believes that he is the center of the universe, only to find out after Phil reads this work, that he isn't, and only by better himself and others, can he be happy with his existence. I also glad the movie cut certain scenes, such as the reasons, why the time loop started, as it was originally plan to be started with an ex-girlfriend of Phil's putting a voodoo curse on him in order to get revenge. In my opinion, it could had ruin the film purpose. It's better to leave the reasons, why the time loop, unsolved. In many ways, these examples are why people see the movie as a spiritual transcendence 'Carpe Diem' type of a movie. It's really hard to find any faults of this film's message, because of that. However, after this movie release, several writers emerged, claiming that the story was stolen from their idea such as science fiction authors, Richard Lupoff and Ken Grimwood. In truth, the inspiration for this film was the 1892 story 'Christmas Every Day' by William Dean Howells, along with 1905 novel 'The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin' by P.D. Ouspensky. Overall: I have to say, this is a great movie, even if certain scenes were a bit unpleasant and somewhat disturbing. I can also overlook a few goofs in the time versions where certain people and events shouldn't had happen, but did, because how well-written, well-acted, and very positive and moving, the rest of the movie, was. Because of this, the film is considered a modern classic. It's just sad that, during filming, Ramis and Murray's longtime collaboration and friendship ended abruptly, without public explanation, due to Murray undergoing a divorce at the time of filming. At least, it's good to say, they reconciliation, before Ramis death in 2014. In the end, I'm glad, they did, because along with 1984's 'Ghostbusters', this movie is one of the best works, they ever did well with each other. So, thank you, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray for all the laughs. You two, really do deserve the praise on how good this movie was.",8,3,5,2 February 2017
National Treasure," Despite some flaws, this movie is worth hunting for. What a treasure!
","With 4th of July celebrations, just around the corner, as of this writing. I thought, that this would be, the best time, to dig deep into, one of my favorite films, to watch on Independence Day; 'National Treasure'. Directed by Jon Turteltaub & Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. This Disney movie tells the story of treasure hunter, Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) on his quest to find the hidden Templar treasure of American Freemason, whom he believe, hid cryptography clues on the back of the Declaration of Independence. To prove this conspiracy theory to be true, he must hatch a plan to steal the document, and pull off the heist of the century to find the treasure. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film can be best described as 2006's 'The Da Vinci Code', 2001's 'Ocean 11' & 1981 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', all roll over into one. While, the treasure hunting plot is bit ridiculousness in the reasons, why Gates must steal the document first, in order to protect it, from being stolen. I do have to say, the treasure hunt is still entertaining. This movie truly surprised me in how smart & fun, the problem-solving is, even in how much artistic liberties, it takes with real-life history like locations and historic people. I did not expect it, to be so good, seeing how the last family friendly treasure hunting movie, 2004's TV movie, 'The Librarian: Quest for the Spear', I saw before this, had a dumb down 'call of adventure'. Perhaps the most exciting thing about this movie is the idea that family films can be sophisticated, and still be appropriate for a general audience. This movie is prove that smart, live action, adventure PG films, are still possible. Still, it is necessary to suspend your disbelief, when it comes to idea of the young nation having a secret Templar treasure. The idea of the Founding Fathers hoarding money is truly unrealistic implausible, even for fantasy sakes; seeing how in real-life, the main masonic lodge was in Britain, and the young nation of USA was bankrupted, during the American Revolution and stay poverty-stricken, even long after it, due to trade restricted and war debts. Nevertheless, nobody should take this movie as a legit American History lecture. After all, it is an action adventure. However, the movie does fail in, delivered the action, in the adventure part. While, the treasure hunting and heist parts is fine and dandy, the action involving on foot and high speed car chases through the streets of Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, falls to be memorable. I hardly remember, any of it. While, those parts, wouldn't be, a 'National Treasure', the good production value and star power does work for the film. Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates, has the right amount of craziness and believability to make, the audience take his character, somewhat serious. The film could had, quickly fallen apart, if he over acted, a little bit more. Thank God, he took this role, very seriously. Nice to see him, take some control. This is pretty rare. Also, the chemistry between his character and sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Batha) was somewhat believable, as well. While, some of the jokes between them, fall flat, I really don't mind, hearing each other, argue, how crazy, their ideas, are. Even, the vocal fights with Jon Voight's character, Patrick Gages was fine for the most part. I just wish, Voight didn't chew up all the scenery, as much. That's Cage's job. Cages parrying with Diane Kruger's sexy-intellectual portrayal of Dr. Abigail Chase was also pretty good. However, I doubt, they would be, lovely dovely, so quick, after only a few days, together. Nevertheless, surprisingly, it was the villains that didn't stand out for me. I totally forgot that actor, Sean Bean was in his film as Ian Howe. Maybe, because it's one of the rare films, in which, the character that Bean plays, doesn't die. Fortunately, the cat-and-mouse game between Nicolas Cage and Sean Bean was not even close in suspense, as I couldn't buy into Howe catching up to Gates. In the end, Gates was just in, a league of his own. Nevertheless, while, the movie lacks suspense. The pacing does work, quickly. Even if, the flow seem a little too structure. Despite that, I do have to say, the music that goes with the film, by composer, Trevor Rabin was rather good. It really gets you, into the sense of looking for buried treasure. Overall: National Treasure is an exciting, engrossing adventure flick that needs to be watch. One worthy of watching on Independence Day!",7,0,0,4 July 2017
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," This is one of the most controversial, perverted, and disgusting movie on the face of the planet. It's smart but way too disturbing.
","Honestly, how did this movie get made and got Criterion Blu-Ray release will forever be a mystery for me? Although, this movie remains a controversial film, it has been praised by various film historians and critics for reasons that I do have to agree upon, for the most part. Don't get me wrong, the movie is very intelligent well shot movie, the dialogue pretty clever, but in the end, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is notorious unpleasant to watch, even for an art house film. There is little to no joy to this film. Some people feel that the film is nothing more than extreme exploitation that bordering pedophile. Others think, it's a legitimate piece of art and satire regarding fascism. In my opinion, watching it, it's a little of both. Based on the book, 'The 120 Days of Sodom', by the infamous 18th century author Marquis de Sade, the movie directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, can be describe as torture porn. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante's Inferno: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Sh*t and the Circle of Blood. It focus on four wealthy, corrupt fascist libertines, the Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), the Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), the Magistrate (Umberto P. Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti), whom in 1943, kidnap a group of teens, both boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, and sexual and mental torture. There is little to no arch in the film, as the victims are just pain taken blandly slaughter without any sense of hope or who they really are. No fight back, no escape, no anything. I found this to be a bit too much for certain audience members to take as there is little to no attachment to these characters. The acting from them are pretty alright. The four prostitutes have the most exposition told about them, but lacks character development. For the most part, they play little to no part of the film, besides telling stories. I'm surprises the villains didn't take advance of them, even more. The villains could be describe as over the top sadists even for Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy. The acting is chilling, but goofy at times. It really get tiresome, when the villains don't get what coming for them. I can only hope, off-scene that they did. After all, in the end, even the villains can't escape death. One might say, that the movie is about life, trying to survive under the harsh reality of sex, violence, and mania. Indeed, the infamous scene where the characters eat their excretions can be a metaphor for how people are willing take the pain that comes with life. The coprophilic scenes based on director Pasolini to be an insult to the fast-food industry for feeding people, horrible food. In my opinion, I think he's saying more than that. The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality and fascism. Still, the message of the film isn't very clear. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 book Zur Genealogie der Moral: Eine Streitschrift, Ezra Pound's poem The Cantos, and Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time. Being based off 'Marquis de Sade', there was no surprised what the film was going to be about, as there are just countless scenes depicting intensely graphic nudity with violence, sadism and sexual depravity. Still, the movie doesn't go as dark, as the book, which contains scenes of mutilation, necrophilia, and cannibalism described in the source material. The movie pacing is a bit slow. It's get interrupted way too much, with the random time-outs. There are four alternative endings; one with a red flag, one with the cast and crew dancing a wild dance, another with the four gentlemen talking their conclusions on their sexual experience, and last is the one that was used, with the two soldiers dancing. The movie is still hard to find. There is certain DVDS that update everything. The audio presented a very weak in older copies. The Criterion version clean it up very well. Mono track sounds excellent, and you can listen to it, both with English dubbing or Italian with English sub-titles. Still, the dialogue appears to have been re-recorded post-production so the lip movements don't always seem to match what is being said. The opening score by Ennio Morricone is still haunting, even today. The film was extremely controversial upon its release, and remains banned in several countries. Even the director Pasolini was murdered in still-mysterious circumstances shortly after completing the film. Who knows, if it's related to what happen in the film or not. While not typically considered a horror film, it's one of the most disturbing films, I ever saw. This movie made me vomit. It took me, a few days to get through this film. . Still, why watch a movie like this, when you hear nightmare news like this in real life? The reasons why I saw the film, was to challenge myself, into understanding what drives certain people to do horrible stuff like this. Once in the while, humans have to dip their hand in the dark side, to find the good out of life and find a way to stop things like this from happening. That's the reason, why. If anybody watch this, to find enjoyment. Please, serious help, right away. Overall: Not a good movie at all. I don't recommended it.",5,3,6,21 August 2014
Rocky," What a knockout! This underdog boxing film was amazing! It went the distance!
","Opening with a black screen, following by giant white letters, the word, 'Rocky' scrolls across from right to left, accompanied by the iconic theme song 'Gonna Fly Now' from composer, Bill Conti ; this Bi-Centennial sport film, tells the story of a down on his luck, boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) on his quest to achieve success in the boxing world, by accepting, the role of replacement opponent for world champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in an exhibition match in Philadelphia, PA. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while many of film historians & critics, labelled this, as the 'greatest boxing movie of all time'; in truth, this film directed by John G. Avildsen has little fighting in it. When it did, the punches look a bit fake and hokey, despite Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; with Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose. Nevertheless, the fight scenes are not really, the heart of the movie. Instead, this film written by Sylvester Stallone works best, when focuses mostly on the titular character, trying to seek the love of a mousy pet store employee, Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire), by proving his own self-worth. If anything, this movie should be label as 'one of the greatest love stories of all time'. Because of this, I wouldn't say, this is action-packed film. The love story takes a big part of the movie, making the fight with Apollo, somewhat secondary. I know, that some people might find this choice in direction, a bit slow paced and somewhat boring, but if you can push through that, you would find yourself, loving the dramatic, more, because how awkward, and real, the love scenes, seemed, between the simple-minded, Rocky and the somewhat recluse, Adrian, even if Rocky is a bit, too dumb to taken serious, while Talia Shire's character, can be a bit off-putting, with her close-minded introvert attitude. It's worth it. You get, a lot of iconic unforgettable scenes like the ice skating sequence & the climatic 'Yo Adrian!' call-out. However, the best scenes in the film, had to be, the training montage. The sequence in Rocky uses meat carcasses as punching bags, and jogs through Philadelphia is very memorable. Yet, the best, out of these training sequences is the scene, where Rocky run up the Philadelphia Museum of Art's flight of stairs. It got so famous, that tourists, around the world, often mimic Rocky's famous climb, as a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge. The site also got Rocky statue, situated just northeast of the steps as a memorial. Nevertheless, one of the most common misconceptions about this movie, is that, Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) help Rocky, train for his fight. In truth, most of that training, including the infamous 'catch the chicken' scene was, in 1979's 'Rocky II'. In this film, Mickey barely does anything, but make Rocky's life, a living hell. So, don't bring up, your hope, in, seeing them, connect with each other. As for other supporting characters, like Paulie (Burt Young). He was alright, but his character hasn't yet, became the famous comic relief, that he would become, in later movies. In this, he just a big fat jerk, most of the time, who doesn't know, if he wants to hook up Rocky with his sister or not. It's a bit confusing. As for Apollo Creed, Weathers really has the charisma to pull this role, off. I really don't think, the movie's original choice, real-life boxer, Ken Norton, could do this. As for the main character, Rocky, I really couldn't see, anybody else, playing the role besides Stallone, because how much Rocky mirrors his real-life. However, I do have to say, the original choice, James Caan does look the part of a fighter when, parodying himself, in 1976's 'Silent Movie'. He was very close, in becoming the title character, before the studio took a chance with Stallone in the lead role. Nevertheless, I still think, every actor in this movie, played their roles to the fullest, despite how mean-spirited, their characters, were, even the cameos from real-life, boxer, Joe Frazier. However, I do have to say, some supporting characters were a bit, pointless. A good example is little Marie (Jodi Letizia) who pretty much, disappears for the rest of the life, after Rocky's life talk. Her character doesn't really come back, until, much later, in the sequels. So, what was the point of having her!? It's filler. It's weird, that this movie won, Best Editing & Best Screen writing at the Oscars, that year, but they kept scenes like that. They really could had cut her from the movie. Anyways, I still kinda glad, the film script was somewhat influence by a real-life fight, between journeyman boxer, Chuck Wepner against controversial, charismatic, and overconfident champion Muhammad Ali. I just kinda wish, Wepner didn't take it, so personal. There wasn't no need to file a lawsuit with Stallone for an undisclosed amount. Rocky acts and looks nothing like him. Anyways, with its Cinderella 'feel-good' crowd-pleasing story, 'Rocky' was the highest-grossing film of 1976. The film was nominated for ten Oscars and won three, including best picture; which 'Rocky' became the first sport film to do. The film also spawned six sequels: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990), Rocky Balboa (2006), and Creed (2015), the latter a Spin-Off about Apollo Creed's son, with hit and misses results. Nevertheless, overall: Despite some goofs in production, this low-budget movie was indeed, a huge hit for me. It's a movie, I will watch, time and time, again. I highly recommended seeing it. It's worth going to the distance for.",9,3,4,19 July 2017
Beauty and the Beast," This remake is not quite as beautiful as the original 1991 Disney animation movie. It was a paint by number cash grab
","When I first heard that Walt Disney Pictures was remaking the 1991 Disney animation movie of the same name with director, Bill Condon. I was really looking forward to this. Maybe, this version could breathe new life into the traditional classic fairy tale. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the film, of course, not only simply replicating the original movie content â€”i.e.: its script, and â€“ with this â€“ also its corresponding themes, music, moral framework and 'message', but also its nearly identical 'frame-to-frame' camera shooting, despite not being animation, features a different cast, have a few new songs and some fixing of loose plot line from the first movie. Both movies tells the same tiresome semi-disturbing story of a bibliophilic young woman, Belle (Emma Watson) developing 'Stockholm Syndrome' for her captor, the terrifying beast (Voiced by Dan Stevens), because she sees some humanity within him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the first movie is a generally highly critically respected as a work of art, because how well-delivered and well-written, the songs, script and animation was, this film doesn't really stand out on its own, compare to the other classic live-action versions of classical Disney animation movies like 2016's 'The Jungle Book' & 2016's 'Pete's Dragon'. Even mediocre films like 2014's 'Maleficent' & 2015's 'Cinderella', at least, try to do something innovative with the material, they were given. As much as I kinda like 1991's version, I have to say, I kinda don't want the same story, retold to me, again without something fresh. It's sad, because I was really hoping that this movie would be more of a hybrid of the first movie and the traditional story that was written by author, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. Who knows, maybe this film could had reintroduce us, to the original idea of the fairy tale that full of surrealist romper, metaphor and allegories imagery like the 2014 remake of the Jean Costeau's 1946's version, while keeping some of that Disney magic around. I wanted to see the version where Belle's father, Maurice (Kevin Kline) is a merchant, having adventures at sea, only to find his treasures in ruins; meanwhile, Belle's sisters and brothers trying to tame the beast and steal his loots for their own, but failing, because they don't see the beautiful inside of the creature. I wanted to see the Beast's treasure turn into rags! It's a powerful message. Better yeah, I want to see the version by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve where Belle is not really a merchant's daughter but the offspring of a king and a good fairy; whom a wicked fairy is trying to killed, in order to marry her father the king; with the Beast, the only creature who can protect her. At least, that version would make more sense with the backstory of the two lovers past being brought up. In this movie, it's pretty pointless, as the tragic of their families don't led to anything. Plus, the whole ex Machina 'magic book' twist would had more purpose in Villeneuve's version than this film where it was rarely picked up. Despite that, the mediocre story isn't the only problem, I have, against this film. The movie pacing is a bit off. There is a lot of filler, that wasn't really needed, like the murder plot of Maurice, instead of going straight to the asylum subplot. One of my biggest complains about this film, is how this movie felt too much like an English accent driven West End stage play with most of the cast, being over theatrical in their singing, and dialogue reading than a realistic French movie. Don't get me wrong, Emma Watson and Dan Stevens are fine performers, when given, great direction, but I felt that, the chemistry for these two, just didn't click, even if the Beast was lot nicer in this version and Belle wasn't such a stuck-up. Maybe, it's because how fake looking, the CGI was. The Beast, never really looked like, he was really there. So, I never really got the idea of them, connecting. The same with the walking, talking home furnishings played by great supporting performers like Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson. I found them to be, alright, but a bit disjointed. The same can be said about the locations, like the village of Villeneuve and the Castle. It looks like sets with limited structures, filled with a lots of blue screen that was built in a staged studio than real-life locations in France. It was really jarring. I wish, the movie took advance of filming outside, more. Everything looks too control. Even the controversy idea of the movie, introducing more minority and LGBT friendly characters with LeFou (Josh Gad) & Gaston (Luke Evans) wasn't really a big deal, as there was nothing in this, that seem insulting. In the end, it was alright movie to watch in theaters with your kids. Just note that the movie will feel a bit pointless after watching it. After all, you could had save money and just rewatch the first movie that was nominated for Best Picture at home. At least, that is what I felt like.",7,5,9,23 March 2017
Departures," Before you departed from this earth, go see this movie! It's very interesting and remarkable.
","It's very surprising to see a movie about the taboo practice of encoffinment, become so university praise by critics. You would think, this movie would, fall under the radar of American & Japanese society, because of the dark subject matter; however, this movie became one of the highest-grossing domestic Japanese films of that year. It was even, a bigger hit international abroad; winning many awards from critics like the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2009. However, for me, I saw it as a one-time watch. A good movie worth checking out, but not worth revisiting, time after time, again. Loosely based on 'Coffinman', a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, and originally titled 'Okuribito' means 'the sending away'; Departures follows the story of a young man, Kobayashi Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nōkanshi—a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his family and friends, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he must try to earn their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Can Kobayashi Daigo achieve that or will he be disconnect from his family & friends for the rest of his life? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie by director Takita Yojiro was very informative to how Japanese culture prepare their dead for the afterlife. This is pretty much, the main appeal of the film for me. To see, what steps, it takes for them to prepare their dead is very interesting; and I'm not known for having a morbid curiosity for such things. You really do learn, a lot about Japanese culture, by watching this. However, besides those, the movie doesn't have much, going for itself. Yes, the classical cello music by composer Joe Hisaishi was indeed beautiful to hear and some of the film is very well-shot, but as a main stream appeal; it doesn't really have some. It's morbid curiosity at its best. I really don't know, if American audiences would revisited this film, time after time, again like me. After all, the film moves in a somewhat slow, heavy-handed, and predictable pace. In my opinion, the conventional simple story is a little too-stretch out. The result of this, cause the movie to falls into a pit full of pointless filler scenes in the second act. Even, the third act, break up is very clichés. You can see it, coming from a mile away. However, most of the changes from the novel, in the climax for the film, was well-written and perform. I love the ending with the message stone. It was somewhat redeeming and heart-warming. As much, as it's sounding like, I didn't like the movie, I honestly did love it. The actors in the film are all, well-played. One thing, I'm pretty glad, the movie has, is English subtitles then English dubbing, because I would hate to see the movie suffer from bad lip sync. The subtitles really help a lot, because some of these rituals can seem somewhat confusing. After all, there are not many people that eat live squids, go to bath houses and drink Japanese tea in rituals ceremony, here in the States. It was nice to try to understand, such practices. I also kinda glad, the movie had some lighten moments. A good example is when Kobayashi and his boss, Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) are cleaning a body that they thought was a woman, but they find out, it's a man. However, one thing, worth noticing, about Japanese humor is how that joke and many after that, doesn't have that much of a punch-line, because the film tries too hard to be respectful. I think, this film would work, better, if they allow more leeway in how they were able to portray the dead. Maybe there was a little too much calming, hypnotic grace with this PG-13 film. It mask people's fears, too much that humor and drama can't really shine through. I think this is why, the movie kinda suffers, when it comes to rewatch value. Maybe, it could had work better, as an R-Rated film, but that's just a maybe. Anyways; Overall: Departures is alright movie. Somewhat overpraise, but still a great film worth checking out. After all, it's nice to see films like this, reverse prejudice against a once taboo subject.",8,7,7,7 January 2016
Some Like It Hot," No movie is that perfect.
","Well nobody's perfect. Well, this Billy Wilder's remake of the French 1935's Fanfare d'Amour and the German 1951's Fanfaren der Lieb isn't that perfect. Full of rampant sexual innuendo, and silly gender-bender cross-dressing gags makes this movie ridiculous, but that will always be part of it's charm. I don't know how these men pass as women. A great example of a three act structure that straddles different genres with violence and comedy. The movie was all innocent fun, though it's always on the brink of disastrous double-entendre. In the midst of notorious gangland murders in 1929, Chicago. Two musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) & Jerry (Jack Lemmon), witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre type murder. The desperate musicians have no choice, but to disguise themselves as women and join a all-girl band to escape the gang life, and hide out from pursing gangsters. Now in Miami, Joe falls for the lead singer of the band, the troubled Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). He pursued her, by disguising himself as a millionaire to win her over, while Jerry is being courted by a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), mid while the gangsters out there still looking for them. The cast was great in their roles. Tony Curtis is brilliant, and his Cary Grant voice was amazing. Jack Lemmon is demoniacally funny and more likely to taken for a woman than Tony Curtis. Marilyn Monroe is just Marilyn Monroe. I really doubt it's acting,e ven the opening scene with the boys has her drinking whiskey no less and her playing a dull blonde trying to get marry a millionaire. Not really role model material. Marilyn was hostile, and was marked by refusals to participate in filming and occasional outbursts of profanity. Visibly Monroe was obviously trashed out during the film. It really does show if you look closer and think about it. It's a surprise to find out that Marilyn Monroe was pregnant when filming this movie. You can tell in some scenes, it was a body double. Still, she's as beautiful as any film she does, but that's doesn't make it a great actress. Not many actors enjoyed filming with her, it was too high maintenance with very little acting to make up for it. Tony Curtis wasn't really into kissing her saying it was like 'Kissing Hitler'. Her singing was mediocre as well. Brown was great, and funny and his final line in the film is a master stroke. Wilder wrote many of the most wittiest one-liners on film in one line. That final line sum up the film so well. It's not the best movie, but nobody's perfect, so it's works for what it is. A fun, good, movie.",7,3,7,13 November 2012
"McFarland, USA"," Race over and go see this movie. McFarland, USA is worth-visiting.
","Set in the late 1980s, the film directed by Niko Caro, focus on the life trials of a downward spiraling career of high school football coach Jim White (Kevin Costner), whom has been fired from so many jobs, that he eventually ends up, in the only town that would hire him, McFarland, California. As his wife, Cheryl (Maria Bello) and two kids, Julie (Morgan Saylor) & Jamie (Elsie Fischer) struggles to fit into the majority low-income Hispanic neighborhood; White himself, struggles to reach the students and faculty of his new school. He eventually turns, his attention from football to cross country, because he sees some potential in some of the students; despite having no experience in the sport. Ultimately, White is able to create a team of ragtag of runners, with high school, students: Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), Johnny Sameniego (Hector Duran), Jose Cardenas (Johnny Ortiz), Victor Puentes (Sergio Avelar), Damacio Diaz (Michael Aguero), David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) and last Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez) as they try their hardest in becoming the state champion. Centering on the concept of teamwork and cooperation. McFarland, USA is able to teach viewers on the values of solidarity, very well; not only when it comes to sports, but also when it comes to working together as a community. It also teach people, not to judge others by racial stereotypes. You see, this, with Coach White. While, he might be a little prejudiced at his Hispanic students at first; you really do see some character development from White toward the middle, despite Kevin Costner barely acting. You see him, warm up to them, and later helps the runners, run their best, realizing this is what makes them special. Yet, this movie has also invoked some groans among some critics who recognize its 'white savior' premise as tiresome and clichés. I have to somewhat agree with them, on that. The white savior rescuing people of color from their poor plight, trope has indeed been overdone to death. Still, this movie was still entertaining, even if the film's messianic portrayal of Coach Jim White leading a ragtag group of Latino cross country team from McFarland, California to the state championship is a bit predictable and safe. I just wish, the movie took more chances with the subject matter. The plot didn't seem to stand out, that much, besides the few drama with Jim White's family, but at least, they kinda made cross-country seem somewhat intense. Since the movie isn't a documentary, Hollywood did change a little bit of how the team got to championship. A good example is how Jim White even got to coach at McFarland High School. No, he wasn't fired from a number of teaching jobs prior to teaching at McFarland. Instead, he started teaching in the McFarland school district after graduating from Pepperdine University in 1964. During that time, white taught different subjects at numerous grade levels before starting his coaching career in 1980, not 1987 with cross-country. Another thing, about that, is the fact that White did not create the cross-country team at the school, but instead restarted it after it had been dropped for a year. He also taught the school's girl's cross-country team, despite only the boys' team being featured in the film. Regardless of that, all of the supporting actors playing the team members were very good in their limited role. It just some of them, really don't stand out. I really got confused on, who is who, at parts. I also believe, the movie didn't need to over-exaggerate some of them to do that. A good example is how they portrayed Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez). He wasn't overweight in real life, nor was the slower member on the team. He was in fact, one of the fastest people at McFarland High School. They portray him, a little too cartoony. Another thing, the film fails to notice, is how not all of the runners from the 1987 team were featured in the film. It would be nice to see, original runner, Luis Partida in the team, because he indeed help them, win. Despite that, David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) was a great replacement. Even if, he graduated the year before McFarland's first state title win in real life. The supporting actors that played Jim White's family was also amazing. It's nice to see that the character that Maria Bello plays is given more to do, than being a supporting wife to Costner's character. She gets her own sub-plot, with her, trying to get along with the women in her neighborhood. Even the child actors that play Jim's kids, were fine in their roles. I just wish, they were able to hired another actress to play Jim's other daughter, Tami. Her absence from this film, is a bit jarring. Yet, I can understand, why the filmmakers wanted to combined those two characters (Jamie & Tami) together. It does save time. Overall: This poignant, uplifting tale is very heart-warming and inspirational. While, it might not stand out, much compare to other Disney sport films. It's still worth checking out. I'm in it, for the long run.",8,4,5,8 April 2016
Les Misérables," Less Miserables than the 1996 Les Miserables version, but not as good as the stage.
","Director Tom Hooper is able to turn the film somewhat like stage, by the use of close ups and simple cut takes. Still, I think the stage works better than film. Les Miserables is a musical that is hard to put on film due to a lot of reasons such as group singing where it's hard to make it seems natural or organic. Second off, it's jumps around why too much, scenes and time making it hard to shot. Third is too many characters with sub-plots. Last the film is bit overcoming on its Christian theme that might turn down some viewers. Make no mistake—the film is grimy and ugly in its portrayal of human depravity, but it's out of that ugliness that the filmmakers make God's grace shines even more brightly. It's weird in a way to have Christianity intro-line with revolution thoughts of the time, since most of the 19th century Age of Enlightenment revolutions were so anti-clericalism. The story recounts the parole of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackson) who spent 19 years in hard labor for stealing a piece of bread for his sister's hungry child. The film closely follows the book by Victor Hugo, Valjean is trying to make due to get back into life, but forced by hunger to continue his criminal ways. Hugh Jackson did well to make him look hungry even going so far to lose 15 pounds. His singing voice is great, it's opens up the audience whom forget about his musical background. It all changes when he meets a priest who saves him with a gift of silver to only do good. Grace and forgiveness effect a change of character in Valjean and he becomes a successful, wealthy, and good man, but always in fear of getting capture by Police Chief Javert (Russell Crowe) whom attempts to return him to prison for escaping his parol. Russell Crowe's performance was serious, the facial gestures, formal detective attitude, but lacks in the singing. His singing is rock and roll like, rough in the edges, and so unlike the others cast voices. Russel Crowe was the worst singer in this cast. He might be fine on his own, but he didn't fit the part of Javert well at all and his singing brought down the rest of the cast. 'Stars' the song is a prime example there was zero passion in his version and it made me cringe. What I don't get is how Jean Valjean was able to clench a very livable life with him having to chance his name so much due to Javert chasing him. He escape from the police, a total of 4 times using names like Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre. Wouldn't he one day be running out of money due to that and living in Les Miserables type life like his old self. Well this is where Fantine (Anna Hatchaway) comes in. She in the movie for a short period, but Anna makes good with it. Fantine is a old employee of Jean Valjean whom was fired and force to become a street walker to feed her child Cosette. Her singing of the 'I dream to dream' act with the actions makes the song so real. I was completely convinced of her acting when I heard this song in the movie, it really did look like she was suffering. After hearing of Fantine's demise, he finds the daughter taking her from the crude unmoral corrupt inn-keeper Thenardiers couple (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). If you like the blending of singing 'Master of the House' in a terrible, cod French accent switching to a terrible cod cockney accent, he was great. However, I did enjoy his performance. Helena did her dreadful mockney accent once again, which I've become rather fond of. Too bad, it's too much Mrs. Lovett from Sweeney Todd. Overall, enjoyable, in a thoroughly miserable way. Valjean cares for Cosette, until years later, an young adult Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) falls in love with a young rebel in Marius (Eddie Redmayne). I just don't buy Marius and Cosette falling in love at first sight when they barely knew each other. Honestly in my opinion, Marius is stupid not to fall in love with his friend Eponine (Samanta Barks) Samanta Barks singing is way better than Amanda with 'On My Own', but my only gripe with Barks is that she couldn't hit the lower notes in 'A Little Fall of Rain'. The biggest plus is she's one of the original cast from the stage play. Both Eponine and Marius are tired of being poor, and going to try to hold their own against the French government in the June Rebellion of 1832. Valjean seeing rebellion coming ahead to force to decide if he willing to risk his life to get Marius and Cosette together, or escape with the unhappy Cosette out of the country. My favorite song is 'Look Down' & 'The People's Song' as both explains well what's the real story of the film. The unjust treatment of the poor. When the young people are joining the revolution, it shows us how young people who had a voice were able to change the way the government works. We see that so much in the Occupy Movement and it's a nice piece of film to show how young minds can have an impact on change. Still it's feels out of place with Valjean's story arch. The movie has too much songs, that some of them are a bit mediocre and it hurts the film. The movie plays less than a musical and more like a tragedy opera. The movie is just too depressing but it does a good job of showing mercy triumphs over judgment. If not, the story would be too depressing to watch. Still it's a semi-downer, but you knew it coming in. After all, it's call Les Miserables for a reason. Not Les pour être heureux.",7,3,4,4 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," This Intergalactic Superhero Movie was Marvelous. What a blast!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' was once known, as one of the least recognized Marvel comic books of all time, even with 2008 reboot by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. However, that all change in 2014, when director James Gunn create a cosmic masterpiece of a film, loosely based on this offbeat source. Nobody saw it, coming. It was like, 'Star Wars' for a new generation. A peculiar small popcorn flick that somehow became a successful, because how fun, it was to watch. It really did eclipses everything around it, at the time, even strong Marvel movies like 'the Avengers' series. It was a blockbuster hit that was mostly universally loved. So, it was no surprised to anybody, that a sequel was quickly greenlight, and put out in production. You don't need to see space to know, a shining star. Just like the original movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' shines just as bright. It's equally as fun, as the first movie. Yet, unlike the first movie, this film does suffer from some long pacing issues. I found the movie to be, a bit slow at times. Mostly, toward the beginning of the film, where the story had to brand off, into multiply subplots for each character of the Guardians team. Don't get me wrong, I did like, seeing them, having something to do, while, Star-Lord AKA Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) learn more about his true parentage from Ego, the living planet (Kurt Russell) as we learn, more about them. However, I just felt, that the film could had speed it, up a bit. After all, did we really need long-drawn out scenes with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) dealing with family problems with Nebula (Karen Gillen) or Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) teaming up with Yondu (Michael Rooker) to take on, below-average, traitor, Taserface (Chris Sullivan). Couldn't these two problems, be solved, a lot quicker, than the 136 runtime. I get that, family is a big theme in this movie and serves as its unifying plot thread, but all these individual character arches needed to be better balanced. It doesn't help that the movie kinda waste time on jokes that somewhat fall flat for me. A good example is, most of the scenes with Baby Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel). Yes, he's adorable, but do we really need to see him, dance around in a fight scene for so long. I didn't find it, as funny as I should had. If anything, it just slow the movie, down for me. Honestly, if there was one character that really makes this film, enjoyable to watch. It has to be Drax (Dave Bautista). Most of the jokes with him hit my funny bone, because how quick, they landed. It wasn't drawn out like the ones with Groot or Rocket. It was rapid and on the point. While, the movie is not as funny as the original, at least, the antagonist in this movie is a huge improvement from the last one. Without spoiling too much, he wasn't as one-note evil, as the others Marvel villains. He does seem, a little better-rounded; than the others, however, it does feel, a bit odd, that he would reveal Peter Quill's mother death, seeing how he's secretly trying to work with him. That was a bit, out of the blue. The same, can be said with Yondu suddenly becoming more of a father-figure to Peter, than the first movie. That was weird that he was willing to help Peter, seeing how he was trying to kill him in the previous movie. Still, I did like how the film, had more stakes in its climatic action, than the last film. Seeing important Marvel characters die in the battle really does add to the intensity & emotional impact of the action scenes. I love how Gunn isn't afraid to have this adventure cost the lives of some of his characters. That being said, it does kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how a small group of people can kill a God. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? Another thing, the battle was still a bit too massive and incomprehensible for a realistic action set-piece. Parts of it, was a bit over the top like the leap through space and time. However, the visuals were still impressive. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as beautiful to look at as the first movie, with its bright, almost 1970s's style psychedelic aesthetic. Yet, the movie doesn't have the same amount of awesome with its soundtrack as the predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good songs, but it was just not as impactful. Some of the tunes, really didn't fit with the scenes, its sync with. The same can be said with its cameos. I really have no clue, why the movie would introduce the original members of the comic's 1969's incarnation of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan without establishing their history, first. It's a hard sell for a spin-off film. Nevertheless, I dig the Stan Lee cameo, toward the end. That was nice. Also, if anybody was looking forward to any 'Avengers: Infinity War' teaser in the end credit. They would quickly be disappointed. None of the mid- and post-credit scenes doesn't shows that. Overall: With all that say, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' doesn't really need to tie with any of the other MCU films. It pretty much works as its standalone sequel with everybody, old & new playing their part, well, even if some actors voices is a little bit jarring, like Michael Rooker. For the most part, it delivers on the things you love about the first movie, and improve on it. I highly recommended seeing this movie.",8,3,7,8 May 2017
Titanic," If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!
","When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichÃ©s. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch. This movie like the actual event will always be remember on.",8,4,6,14 June 2014
Rocky III," I pity the fool that hasn't saw Rocky 3 yet. It's a knock-out punch!
","Let's rock! It's time, once again to enter the square circle, and see what happen to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the underdog as he faced his greatest foe, yet in Clubber Lang (Mr. T). My predictions. Pain. Directed and written by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off from the events of 1979's Rocky II, as Rocky Balboa reigns as a World Heavyweight Champion prizefighter. He's on the verge of retiring undefeated when he's taunted by a contender, Clubber Lang. When, Rocky learn that his longtime trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has been lining up easy opponents all along, because Mickey believe the wealthy & comfortable lifestyle has made Rocky gone soft. Rocky must once again, find the eye of the tiger to defeat a man like Lang. If the first two movies were based off the Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, then this film fight remind me of what would happen if Rocky Marciano step on the ring with a Mike Tyson type of a fighter. Since, Tyson was still an unknown boxer at the time. I believe Clubber Lang was based on a combo of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes. He's a one-dimensional bully with no back story or redeeming features. It made him a great antagonist. Still, I was really hoping for more from the character than being menacing. I glad, this film made Mr. T into a celebrity, but it hard to take him, seriously as a threat to Rocky when rewatching this film, due to the star going on to be a kids' action hero on TV's The A-Team and even his own Saturday-morning TV cartoon, after this. Mr. T became more and more of a joke as the 1980s went on. It's clear that the character of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali. You really do see it in Carl Weathers performance here who takes a more supporting role here by helping Rocky trained against Lang. Creed is humanized so well in this film. Supporting returning characters such as Adrian (Talia Shire) & Paulie (Burt Young) also make the film, worthwhile. Adrian is just as beautiful as she was in the first film. Is Paulie, a bit racist in the film? Yes, but it's pretty tame. I like to think, Paulie somewhere in the film, learn to respect black people, but I doubt it, but he's not the main focus on the film. His presence in the film is pretty minor. Sylvester Stallone is once again, great as the main role, Rocky Balboa. Even as view as the top man in his sport, he still the underdog when it comes to challenges. This movie shows what it is like to have everything rather than to start out with nothing like the previous movies. It show, how fame can lost a person, and for you to gather yourself up, you have to start from scratch. The movie has a lot of heart. Without spoiling it, you feel for Rocky, for the person, he lose in the film. You want to see him, bounce back from that lost. You really want him to go the distance even if Rocky is super rich, now. In my opinion, Rocky Balboa is the greatest character, Sylvester Stallone ever played. It doesn't matter, if he's rich, poor, or old, his 'go for it' motto for life is a great role model and Stallone acting shows that. This movie also have some of the best training montage to pump up. This will inspire anybody for anything. You really get what Rocky is going through. The music is once again, uplifting as hell. Not only do you got, the original Rocky theme song, 'Gonna Fly Now' by Bill Conti with lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. The Rocky series got 'Eye of the Tiger' by the band, Survivor. The film nearly got the song 'You're the Best' performed by Joe Esposito. That song was later used for 1984's film, 'the Karate Kid'. It's seem like a nearly perfect film, but this film however, depending on who looks at it, might dislike it for the more cartoony action than realistic drama, approach. Rocky and Clubber Lang take a pounding in their fight scenes, but it look less like boxing and more like pro-wrestling. Rocky getting tossed around by a cameo from a wrestler, Hulk Hogan was interesting. Indeed, this movie helped bring pro wrestling into the mainstream, 3 years later when the film co-stars, Mr. T & Hulk Hogan would team up to fight Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff at Wrestlemania in 1985. That event was a success, and help bring new light to this film. Because of that wrestling event, Rocky IV was greenlight & release later that year. Would this movie have been a box-office hit if Rocky's opponents were better-drawn character instead of just a trash-talking cartoon like bullies? It's hard to tell. Its cheese factor is one of its biggest draws for me. Is the movie, a bit dated? Yes, the awful 1980s fashion trends are throughout the film, but it's a product of the times. Is the writing is sub per? No, I think Stallone deserve more credit for making Rocky into a likable boxer. He could be a little more, clever in some parts. Does the movie glorifies a brutal violent blood-sport? Yes, but for a movie about boxing, it's pretty tame. Not a lot of blood in this film. The camera work in the film are pretty damn good. The movie was beautiful shot, and the movie ends with one of the most iconic way, a film should end: with a Leroy Neiman painting. Overall: It was indeed a change of direction for the Rocky series, but without a doubt, it's one of the better films of the series. Plus, it gave us the Rocky statue in Philly. So- It has to be must-watch. It's an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top.",7,3,5,6 January 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," This movie set in stone, what would be the foundation of the Harry Potter film franchise. It kinda work.
","It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying 'philosopher's' and once with 'sorcerer's'. Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.",7,3,4,16 July 2014
In Time," This movie was a waste of time for me. Great concept, badly executed.
","It's time to review this dystopian sci-fi thriller film. Written & directed by Andrew Niccol, the movie open up in 2169, where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation, when people turn 25 years old, they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year; when it reaches zero that person 'times out' and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into 'time zones' based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) live day-to-day and New Greenwich, the wealthiest time zone, where Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfield) can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). For this favor, Henry gives his time to Will, so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother (Olivia Wilde). Now with plenty of time, he plans to give the people, the freedom of their lives, by making the upper class pay. Too bad, Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this, so that he can spent time, buying nice cars, eating at fancy restaurants, trying to hook up with Sylvia, attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker. It takes forever to get to the 'Robin Hood' plot that the movie trailer promise us. Lots of filling scenes that slow down the pace to a crawl. The movie plot is a thinly-veiled allegory for the Occupy Wall Street movement against the 1%. It's supposed to be social commentary about the growing global divide between the haves and have-nots. It's an intriguing premise, but unfortunately, the movie follows a really predictable formulaic plot, ending with lousy satisfying conclusion. Robbing banks will solve the economy?!? What? This is a good example of Hollywood not understanding economics. Do they think, robbing banks would solve the economy? It would make it worst. 'Is it stealing if it's already stolen?' quotes the movie. Yes, it is. This movie is just a mess; trying to add a Bonnie and Clyde type heist story with political overtones doesn't work. There was no depth to the movie's resolution other than everyone deserves equality. The movie lacks good exposition. It's too heavy-handed, explaining a lot of things that didn't need to. The movie takes a lot of Artistic License in science and economic causing a lot of things to make no sense. Obviously made for a teen demographic, everybody in the film cast is beautiful as hell. It's implied, they are genetically engineered, but still, I didn't know, the really poor, can still look amazing gorgeous, despite only have hours or minutes to live. It's really jarring. I do hope that the film makers know that aging isn't a gene. Even if the rich can live forever, the skin will still be thinner and wrinkled by time manly due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Aging can't be stop. Only postponed. Also, why 25 year old is the cut-off date? Isn't that the age frame where most people do the most work? Why not, use the ones that you selection to be born, longer like until 50 or 60 year old until terminating them? They isn't no point to eliminate them in the first place. You kill a lot of young people, who does the majority of the work? There is no reason why children should even being born, if they're genetically engineered and nobody dies from old age. Another thing, why waste resources waiting for the children to reach 25 in the first place? Just create a fully grown male and female. It doesn't make sense why people still need to eat and drink, when they don't feed on energy. How can you get alcohol poisoning if disease are eradicate in this world? There are so many loose-ends that I can go on, about like what happen to the time, when people die due to mauling to their bodies. If they are genetically engineered, couldn't they just get fix up? The movie even forget sub-plot like what happen to Will's late father. The movie is also very insulting. A lot of over the top rich people have Jewish last names pushing the Greedy Jew stereotypes. The acting is mediocre. Justin Timberlake is pretty lackluster. The best actor in the film, had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfield is just there to be the love-interest, despite Will kidnapping her at gunpoint and almost killing her in a car accident. How romantic, Stockholm Syndrome, Patty Hearst right there. How stupid! The good things about the film is the score, the action, and the set design. It really does look futuristic. I love the time fighting race against the clock tense moments. Still, there were a lot of stupid suicidal disregard of time allowance by characters that makes you wonder. Are these people, stupid? Will himself keeps coming into large quantities of time, then giving it away and leaving himself only a few hours or even minutes instead of a few years. There is a strongly reminiscent of this film to other media works. Due to that reason, the film got often dealt with copyright lawsuits. One is Harlan Ellison whom believe that the film's plot was based on his 1965 short story 'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman'. Another is Lee Falk who believe it was taken from 'Mandrake and the Goldman: Time is Money', a comic issue. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film 'The Price of Life' & the Hannu Rajaniemi's novel 'The Quantum Thief' as well. Overall: There isn't enough time in the world, to get me to re watch this bad movie. You're probably better off just watching 1997 Gattaca than wasting time and money on this movie.",6,15,21,6 November 2014
The Happening," What happen to M. Night Shyamalan? The Happening happen and it was a huge disappointment.
","Director M. Night Shyamalan use to be a really director, but as of late, he has been producing a lot of awful movies. Is he really trying to make us kill ourselves, after watching his films?! I use to love his films, but The Happening is one of the biggest letdowns, I ever witness. The film is about a mysterious event happening all over the East Coast of the United States, where people all over are killing themselves for no reason, and there's no explanation to these mass suicides. Nobody can stop it, and no-one can escape it. It doesn't stop, High school teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) from trying to escape its death grip. With his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sachez), they hope to survive by escaping the cities and try their luck elsewhere. The movie takes mostly a Hitchcockian approach to the horror, in which, the suicides happen without much explanation. You see, the movie even references a lot of Hitchcock's films. M. Night is even famous for the Cameo like Hitchcock. M. Night Shyamalan plays Joey, with whom Alma had an affair. Although his character is never seen only his voice. The movie could be describe as a badly written, 'The Birds' meet 'Psycho'. There is some examples in the film that were very smart writing such as the mood ring symbolism. There is a lot of use of the color, yellow that can represent a lot of things like being positive in life, than self-destruct. Some people think it has this 'Cold War' or 'New Terrorist or it's the Government' hidden message coming out of this film due to the talks of extreme talks about government trying to depopulation their population, but I can't find the bearing to this film. Without spoiling the plot, I think the opening lecture by Elliot Moore gives too much away of the plot too early. The movie is really out there with its Gaia's Vengeance's plot. I like how all the suddenly, these 'things' evolve to emit neurotoxin. All species of it. Simultaneously. The Happening has this post environmentalism theme that seem a bit too preachy. I don't get why people in the park would get attack, because it's seem that the park is helping nature. I don't think M. Night Shymalan knows how science works. Science solves the mystery, not give up explaining it. Science Cannot Comprehend is just a lame excuse for bad writing. Then there is way too much exposition speak throughout the film, as if the audience was too dumb to know what is already happening. I wish, the movie explore more of the conflict between Elliot and his wife, maybe it would help the story better. The whole cheesy power of love will stop the tragedy is not well-played. This movie could had work, if only the deaths weren't so cheesy. For some reason, the film's R rating was a huge marketing ploy because before this movie, most of M. Night's horror films were PG-13. M. Night can see that with an R rating, he was able to get away with a lot of things that he would had to tone down if it was another PG-13 film like extreme violent, gore, or digging into more serious disturbing adult themes. Rather than making a serious, in depth horror film. He made fun of the horror genre, by going with an 1960's sci-fi/ horror cheesy B-film style with over the top's deaths like a man getting eaten by a lion or another man getting run over by a lawnmower. Even the children getting shot is pretty dumb. It was supposed to be shocking, but it wasn't. Anybody can see it, a mile away. M. Night really try to make the wind seem scary, but its fails to be. If anything was scary, it was the crazy doll lady. Mid-through the movie, it seems like we jump into another horror movie with her. It was a bit distracting from the main plot and never really goes anywhere. I felt like it was supposed to symbolism, where Alma and Elliot's relationship was going, but it's never truly explain. Most of the people in the film, give out dull expression when seeing people getting killed. The worst is Alma. Zooey Deschanel's acting is so bad, I just hoping she was going to die in the film. Mark Wahlberg isn't as bad, but his delivery feel like he was neutered. He didn't had any balls in it. I understand why he was so monotone in his underacting because of the plot needed him to be, but gees it was too passive aggressive. Still, he had some of the most quote silly lines ever like 'What? No!' or 'Come on, take an interest in science'. The rest of the characters in the film are just awful cartoony people such as the hot dog guy and the cheese and crackers army dude. The camera work is just bad. I like how the characters don't notice the bodies hanging from the trees until the camera reveals them, even though they had been driving straight towards them for a good 30 seconds. I dislike how in the end, half of Alma's face is missing from the frame. I was redder than roses, redder than poinsettias seeing that. Overall: I would watch it, if you like 'so bad, it's good' type films. It's pretty much laughable. Besides that, we sensed it, we saw the signs, but this movie doesn't have anything good happening.",5,3,5,3 March 2014
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Water is worth fishing out for! It's one hell of a catch!
","Originally pitch as a remake of 1954's 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', in which the gill man whom be portray more sympathetic. Director Guillermo Del Toro hope for the project to be, greenlighted, in order to first capitalize on Universal cinematic 'Dark Universe' concept, as well, as tell & reflect on how he feels to be living in America as an isolate outcast immigrant; in a fish out of water, world, where he doesn't fit, their ideologies. However, the studio wouldn't let it happen, as 2017's 'The Mummy' would be chosen, in its place to lead the pack. Nevertheless, Del Toro was determined, and embark on making a similar movie, mostly on his own, with Fox Searchlight Pictures & TSG Entertainment help, call 'the Shape of Water'. Taking ideas, from many sources, ranging from novels like 1982's novel 'Mrs. Caliban' by author, Rachel Ingall, 1837's 'The Little Mermaid' by Hans Christian Anderson & 1928's 'Amphibian Man' by author, Alexander Belyaev, to video games such as 2007's 'BioShock', to foreign movies like 2001's 'Amelie' to even themes from his previous films like 2004's 'Hell Boy' & 2006's 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Del Toro shape together a number of well-worn genres & turn them into a fantasy romance 'Beauty and the Beast' type story, in which, a mute woman, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) risk everything, in order to free, a captured amphibian creature (Doug Jones) from being killed in government high-security laboratory, for the sake of love. Without spoiling the movie, too much written by him, while the movie follow familiar formulas, and isn't as original as it could had been, the story still stands out, as something that is very entertaining & compelling to watch. To enhance, the film even more, Del Toro made the right decision in having the movie set in 1962, during the height of the Cold War. Seeing characters having to deal with casual and institutionalized racism, sexism, and homophobia throughout the story; really does raise the stakes; as well, give the audience, a sense of nostalgia awe to not only classic B-list horror movies, but yesteryear films in general & how they still very much, relate, to today's world. Much of this come from the dazzling use of music from composer, Alexandre Desplat, wonderful visuals/special effects, florid cinematography from Dan Laustsen, and art designs that range from the Gothic to steampunk style, locations and costumes, the sumptuous-looking film fully transports the viewer to another time and place, even if it's looks & sounds exceedingly silly at times. Nowhere is this more evident than in the film's most heartwarming sequence, a lavishly designed, 1936's 'Follow the Fleet'-style ballroom black & white dance number. Nevertheless, the movie did have some bigger jarring moments than that. One such thing, was the idea, that everybody that works at the lab, would had the security clearance to see the creature, even if they happen to be the help. It was really hard for me to suspense my disbelief, on that. After all, it seem really odd, that there was no 24/7 security surveillance cameras & armed guards watching at post near the room, for something, that is dealt, as a highly sought after, yet dangerous asset by the government agents. It seem too unrealistic. Another problem with the film is the pacing of the action. It really doesn't make any sense for any government agencies be willing to dissect a rare endangered animal, so earlier in arrival, nor does it add up, why Elisa to wait for so long, to release the Sea-God, back into the wild. After all, the Chesapeake Bay is really close by, regardless how deep, the canal, is. The sequences after the heist, felt, like nothing, but filler. Regardless of that, the underwater sequences are particularly elegant, and really shows, how the hardest of barriers can be broken into. Another cool thing, worth seeing is the use of the color: green. The color really does symbolizes the healing, each character has to take, in order to become better people. Nevertheless, some of the others visual sequences were a little kelted, such as the notorious sex scenes. I think, Del Toro could have told this unconventional love story without including the graphic nudity; and most of all, deprived of the clear implication of an interspecies sexual relationship, a lot better with the use of sexual connotation of eggs. Nevertheless, I do understand, those fans who love these sequences, as it does shows love-making of any kind even taboo in a positive, tasteful light. However, I never got the idea, that the amphibian man love Elisa, the same way, she sexually love him. It really felt like Elisa was taking advances on the defenseless creature with a child-like mind, due to her lack of sexual activities. It's almost as predatory & gross, as Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon)'s advances toward her. It was a little off-putting. Look, as much as fans can spin it. It still bestiality, no matter, how they put it. If this film was about adult man screwing a defenseless sea turtle. Then, they would be, singing a different tune. Regardless of that, I like the fact that the lover's perspective never changed; even when face from biblical style threats, saying that what they're doing is sinful. I just wish, the relationship between sea being & Elisa was a little more developed. Nevertheless, Hawkins's portrayal of a mute, lonely, passionate janitor was very convincing. She is the heart of this movie and it simply wouldn't work as well, without her. As for Jones. His pantomime performance breathe life and humanity into this film's amphibian man; making it his most soulful, captivating creation yet. As for Shannon and Octavia Spencer, they gave solid support, along with Richard Jenkins as Giles, but neither performer is exactly covering new ground in their respective roles. In the end, 'Shape of Water' is still an incredible film, even with its many flaws. It's worth dipping into. So check it out!",8,35,65,8 February 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Entering the Matrix yet again. My mind is overloaded by this film.
","It sure is. The visuals, the story, and all of the references are all over my mind. It's a good action flick with a decent dystopia plot, but watching the Matrix film series and its 2nd movie Matrix Reloaded get really, really confusing. I know the first Matrix (1999) movie was just as baffling, but in here in this sequel, it's over complex. To simple down the over complex plot for you, this is how it goes: Neo (Keanu Reeves) must decide on saving Zion and risk killing Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) or allowing Zion to meet its doom by saving Trinity. That's it, everything else in the film, you don't need to understand, unless you want your mind blow by stress trying to figure it out. For the normal mindless popcorn flicker, there are plenty of action in the film. I like the brawl with a hundred Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving), Château fight, and the Highway Battle. In the burly brawl, did they really use a sound of a bowling ball knocking over pins? Yes. Now, that's just silly. The CGI in the film was amazing. There are plenty of slow bullet time for you to sink your teeth into to the point, it's become somewhat a parody of its normal self. There are moments in the film, I kept asking myself, do we really need that 'there'? Talking about things not needing to be there. I always skip the cave-rave scene every time I watch the film. It's so pointless and out of place. It looks like an orgy full of cavemen beach bums rather than a Matrix movie. I adore all the philosophical discussions of free will v foreknowledge, Taoism, the references to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, the levels of realities, and so on, so on, but a lot of this film has so much exposition that never get explain or go anywhere. There always beating around the bush in this film that it leave you mind-boggling. Deliberately ambiguous or unclear in order to mislead or withhold information might be a great plot device, but overwhelming the story dialogue with too much intelligent with little to no result can leave the audience asking themselves, what did they say? Not everybody is as mindful as those of the writers. They even put a theory about werewolves and vampires in the middle, that is confusing and never brought up again in the film. Even some of what they are talking about, isn't totally truth in a certain P.O.V. such as the topics of Control, and understanding choice. There is no bigger epic failure of exposition dialogue than that of the Architect, that supposed to explain everything in the Matrix World. It all sounds reasonable when he explains it to Neo, but it isn't very logical. It's the stupidest world building ever. It leaves a lot more questions, then it does provide answers. While, the 3rd movie in the film series Matrix Revolution (2003) did explain more, it's still a huge headache worth of information yet to be explain. There are whole chapters of books and videos trying to understand the whole Matrix mythos and how it is mediated across both film and games, with all different opinions and so call answers to questions to what the film is trying to say. In my opinion, the writers Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski felt like they were trying too hard to developed a complex plot and it hurt the film a bit as some people found the dialogue to be boring, confusing, or sometimes hard to follow. It isn't an easy subject to wrap your mind around. So to some people, it might be not entertaining. I do like the new characters that they add to the story. I do enjoy Link (Harold Perrineau). He probably the best new character, I like. The role of Zee, Link's wife was originally given to singer/actress Aaliyah, who was killed in a plane crash on August 25, 2001, before she could complete shooting her part for The Matrix Revolutions. Nona Gaye replace her. It sad that happen during film. Overall: Seeing that this is the second movie in the trilogy. I did like it, but the ending was kind of a downer. I wouldn't say, it's better than the 1st movie, but it wasn't a total failure like some critics pan it. In my opinion, it's worth the ticket price when I saw it in 2003 and worth having it as a DVD in my DVD collection.",7,3,4,29 May 2013
The Disaster Artist," Oh Hai, Film Marks! Is 'the Disaster Artist' worth seeing? Yes- it is!
","In 2003, an independent drama, call 'the Room', centering on a melodramatic love triangle between an amiable banker, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) his deceptive fiancée, Lisa (Juliette Danielle) and his conflicted best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) came out in a few theaters to box office failure. The movie was trashed by critics, with some going as far as to call it the worst movie ever made, due to its lousy writing, camera-work and story. However, the film directed, produce, and starring, Tommy Wiseau has gradually gained a cult following, and much like other 'so bad, it's good' movies like 1990's 'Troll 2' & 1991's 'Samurai Cop', it has inspired documentaries, sequels and books about the behind the making of the film. One such tale was, from the director's co-star & real-life friend, actor, Greg Sestero and author, Tom Bissell, call, 'the Disaster Artist' (2013). The book received so much critical acclaim that it was pick up by actor, Seth Rogen's production company, 'Point Grey Pictures' & distributed by Warner Bros with actor, James Franco, directing and acting in the piece. Without spoiling the movie, too much, like 'the Room', this film was also a passion project. Much care went with being as accuracy to the source material as possible, by Franco & his crew. However, there were some inaccuracies, such as how the idea of 'the Room', even got started. In Franco's film, Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) gets the idea for 'the Room' by an offhand remark by Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) about creating their own work, rather than, waiting for Hollywood to come to them. In reality, the basic premise of 'The Room' draws on specific incidents from Wiseau's own life, including past friendship & relationships; including a moment, when an outsider friend of Greg show him, 1999 Psychological thriller film, 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' in a botch attempt to make Wiseau look bad, by making him look like a con-artist to Sestero. In truth, the idea came from not excessively sentimental, sappy, friendship overcoming all, ingenuity, Hollywood bound day-dreaming, but on accident, with a man trying to expose the dangers of codependency & unhealthy obsessive. The film, originally written as a stage-play as director puts it, serve as 'an advisory warning about the perils of having friends'. Because of that, I felt that the tone of Franco's film is little off. Don't get me wrong, while it's somewhat true, that Tommy had a somewhat extreme infatuated for Greg's lifestyle & did go into pretty dark places, by trying to one up him. Nevertheless, the relationship between them, was awkward from Wiseau's end as well, with Sestero being highly depended on Wiseau's income. Still, the movie was a little too fluff, when exploring their off & on friendship, with each other. As for Tommy's relationship with other people, while filming; it was much worse than what we got on film. While, in Franco's movie, most of the performers & the film crew of 'The Room' was willing to stick it out, for the sake of the project. In truth, many of the original actors and crew storm off the set, due to the harsh filming environment; such was the case for the original actor for Mark, who was replace, late in production by Sestero. By the end of shooting, the remaining cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen. So, many of them, never really went to the premiere, nor wanted to go, due to their uneasy relationship with the director. In short, there was little to no support for Wiseau, nor was the movie ever receive, a standing ovation on its first day of release, by audience members. The cult value, didn't really come, until weeks later, during the midnight circuit. It's there, where many of the traditions were born, such as the throwing of spoons/footballs & yelling insulting comments about the quality of 'The Room', as well as speaking out loud lines, from the film itself. It's here, where the film starts to become more enjoyable to the masses not the premiere. Because of that, I found the simplify version of 'The Room' theatrical run in Franco's film, really jarring, and not that realistic. Nor did I like the opening on the movie, with celebs cameos, exploring why 'the Room' is secretly great. That interview sequences in the beginning kinda ruins the ending by spoiling too much on, why certain people enjoy the film. As the humor in Franco's movie, it's really a hit and misses. It really depends on how familiar, you as the audience member is, on, knowing the backstories of 'the Room'. This movie might be, confusing to watch, for some, not expose to such knowledge. Despite that; me, personally, I enjoy the film, even if it didn't share all the information about Tommy Wiseau. I love that it left a little mystery about him. As for the acting, Franco absolutely nail the role, capturing Tommy's eccentric style & accent, regardless, if he seem bit too caricature. However, Dave Franco was a little more disappointing. He sounds and looks, nothing like Greg, nor interesting as the leading man. Regardless of that, the sheer detail that went into the recreations, sequences of the 'The Room', during the credits, are worth the price of admission alone, even if it's a semi off. Nevertheless, stick around after the credits for a special cameo. It's worth it. Highly recommended. Overall: 2017's 'The Disaster Artist' is the 1994's film 'Ed Wood' & 1998's film 'Shakespeare in Love' of this generation. While, 2003's 'The Room' has generally been regarded as one of the worst, entertaining Hollywood film of all time. Let's hope, 'the Disaster Artist' leave an impact, as one of the best. I guess, we will have to see. It's a must watch.",8,6,12,13 December 2017
Zombieland," This movie is a trip! A fun ride across Zombieland.
","Unlike Adventureland, Jesse Eisenberg's previous movie, this movie is a lot better and truly is a fun adventure. Plus, this one is funny as hell. Jesse is another Michael Cera. Call me old fashioned, but the whole mumbling-mono toned-socially awkward-skinny-nerd thing just does absolutely nothing for me, but at less Jesse does make this movie do. Two months have passed since mad cow disease mutated into mad man disease. Unaffected college student 'Columbus' (Jesse Eisenberg) is making his way on the road to Columbus, Ohio to check out if his parents made it. On the way, he meets 'Tallahassee' (Woody Harrelson), another survivor whom looking for purpose, and see it's in his never-ending quest for Twinkies. Twinkie production in the United States ceased in November 2012 in a weird off way. So it's seem realist that Twinkie would be hard to find after the 'zombie' invasion. Before 2012, it might not. It's a funny major part of his character, and it's pretty obvious the tasty cakes supply him with some form of comfort in a land torn to shreds by zombies, as it's also 'hide' something deep, as he seeking something more than that in his mind. Woody Harrison really took this role serious. Shortly after finishing the filming of Zombieland, Harrelson had an altercation with a TMZ photographer. His defense was that he was still in character and thought the cameraman was a zombie. I don't buy it, but who knows. He's smoking something. The pair meet 'Wichita' (Emma Stone) and her younger sister 'Little Rock' (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters, who are masterful con artists, trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons, then steal their car, not once, but twice when the boys try to find them again. I don't know why Tallahassee and Columbus doesn't end up killing them, since the con girls pretty much left them for dead, the first time. That's something you just can't forget, and we suppose to believe Columbus will fall in love with Emma Stone. The con girls were obnoxious and poorly written. I know they have trust issues, but that's pretty crude. The boys were written to be dumb, and stupid. Somehow, all four of them reached a state of Détente. All of them, decide to go to try their chances at Los Angeles. It's odd in a way, that Columbus never really did go to Columbus to check out his parents even with the town being decimated, there still a chance. He gives up way too easily for his love ones. The movie takes the four all throughout Zombie America. The movie is all fun, sadly the scares are non existent, and the good kills are just plain no where to be found. The movie has way too many scene-killing Voice Overs and scenes that makes zero sense. Now for the good of the movie, I love the running gag, and a central theme throughout the film, is the list of rules Columbus comes up with for surviving in the zombie-infested world. It's reminds me of the Max Brook's novel 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. Wish the movie had time to use all the 49 rules, but a few were mentioned in the film. It's makes me wonder what he meant with avoid strip clubs and bowling ball. The Character names are interesting as well, as the movie doesn't use the real names, but identify them using the names that relate to them. The movie also has a great cameo, but it's sadly it's short and underused. Another thing underused is the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' as the movie only mention one, with a character that isn't relate to the plot. I think Director Ruben Fleischer try way too much to fit as much fun into it, and some of them had to left out. The humor is smart mouth, living up to the catchphrase of 'nut up or shut up' style. It's a movie that doesn't take itself so serious, but does when needed. Check out Zombieland and visit the sites.",8,3,5,18 February 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," Director Frank Capra's bittersweet, heartwarming Christmas movie is a wonderful movie!
","'Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings'. That is the quest for the guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) when he was assign to take care of a suicidal man named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart). Clarence must try to show George, the tremendous impact he has had on his community before it's too late. Can Clarence, change George's mind or will this Christmas, be the last for George Baily? To find out, watch the movie! Made just after World War 2, this movie was a favorite for both leading man Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra. It's easy to see why. There's so much things to like, about this film. The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to 'combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism'. While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story 'The Greatest Gift,' by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U.S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it. Thank Goodness, he did! Most of the supporting cast are just as good as Stewart, but one-person stands out. Donna Reed is wonderful, despite her character being a one-dimensional manic pixie dream girl. She was really able to show the character's beautiful, supporting and caring nature. Just say the word, Mary, and I'll lasso you, the moon, indeed! I just don't buy the idea that George and Mary are somehow supposed to be soulmates. It's a bit unrealistic to think that Mary can only love George. Nor, do I believe, without spoiling it, that the ending of this film seen can be seem as 'happy'. After all, George is still in the same position he was before Clarence show up. An investigation is still looming. There are tons of others puzzling questions, still worth debating. So a rewatch, is needed. One thing, when watching it, is not to watch the color version. The black and white works well, to show the symbolic snow of the peaceful Bedford Falls, when compare to the cold and dark sleet of Potterville. It's better to watch that, since Paramount had all the grain removed in 2006. Overall: This well-known sentimental film is a masterpiece. Capra's Magnum Opus. A must-watch. So check it out.",9,7,11,31 December 2015
Enemy at the Gates," This tense WW2 war movie about the Siege at Stalingrad gets High Marx from me. It was amazing, comrade.
","This movie was a bang! A critical hit. If there ever going to be a film that could make the most die-hard of Americans, cheer for a Cold War foreign nation like the Soviet Union. It probably be, this movie, set in World War II. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the film tells the cat & mouse sniper duel between Red Army's Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), and German Nazi - Major Erwin König (Ed Harris), during the backdrop of the Battle of Stalingrad. Without spoiling the movie, too much, for the most part, 'Enemy at the Gates' action scenes were intense, brutal and deadly. It did limited the scape of the battle to these two trying to hunt each other in nearly the same area, each day in somewhat a repetitive motion. So, you never truly get the scale on how large, the battle was. Although, I am glad, that they feature a sniper duel, I was still somewhat disappointed by the fact that the book, that the movie was based on, the non-fiction novel by author, William Craig, chronicling the entire Battle of Stalingrad with hundreds of survivors of the battle-both Russian and German soldiers and civilians like Ernst Von Paulus, Alexander Rado, Emil Metzger, Andrei Ivanoich Yeremenko & others, stitching their incredible experiences together for one giant piece, while this movie only focus on that one story about Vassili Zaitsev. In truth, the urban clash with Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union troops in Stalingrad cost the lives of nearly two million men and women, in a course of 5 months, 1 weeks and 3 days. Yet, you really don't see much of their stories. Because of this, the film represented more like 'War of the Rats' by author, David L. Robbins rather than 'Enemy at the Gate'. Don't get me wrong, the film is still good, but the story could be, a little more epic. Despite that, 'Enemy at the Gates' has other problems that kinda hurt this film. One of them, is the large amount of historic inaccuracies. First off, there is no way that German or Soviet rifles of those calibers would create a small hole in someone's head and nothing more. It would blow their heads off. The film should had been bloodier than what we saw. Another is how they portray coward and spies, acting like there is hope for them, if they get caught, despite what we been told in the beginning of the film. In real-life, the commanders of both nations would kill the family of the spies, but killing the families of those who failed to bring victory. In truth, there was little hope for anybody caught as one. Another problem with the film, is the unnecessary love triangle between, Zaitsev, his lover, Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) and his friend, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes). Yes, I get that, Tania was Zaitsev's real life lover and this relationship, was indeed part of the book, but the audience couldn't get invested in it, while, real-life people were dying on the street, while, they selfish argument with each other, on who f*ck who. 1942's 'Casablanca' tells it best. It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. It did really does take away, from how important, winning the war, was, from the rest of the movie. It wasn't needed, even if all three British actors did wonderfully, in their roles, even if they couldn't pull off a Russian accent. However, I wouldn't mind, Tania being more like the borderline Sociopathic Soldier with a mild infatuation with Zaitsev, rather than the lovesick Damsel in Distress that she is, in the movie. Zaystev is the only character in the movie, whom portrayal matches the more accurate ones documented in the book. The film takes considerable liberties with other characters like Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) was slightly more over the top. It's safe to say, this movie isn't near Bob Hoskins's best role. Another problem of the film is the fact that there is no current available evidence that Zaitsev and König, ever face each other. There is also no evidence that Major Erwin König ever existed, despite the claim made by the Armed Forces Museum of Moscow to be in possession of his telescopic sight. Regardless if its fiction or not, I just glad, this movie isn't surface deep 'flag-waving' communist propaganda. After all, it's hard to market that, to American audiences. I just glad, the film is a little more complex than that. It does show both factions as brutal regimes, which they were. It's a lot better than the book that portray the Germans in a little too controversial, favorable light. The film also show the soul-searching, tragic consequences and inner turmoil of the combatants on both sides, making them, question their superiors and the reasons, on why they must fight. I like how the soldiers are just trying to survive a war or to avenge/protect loved ones, rather than, trying to seek to do bad things. Also, neither Vasily or König ever demonstrate any real conviction in respectively Stalinist or National-Socialist ideology. I also love how the film expose the exploits of propaganda, with Vasily. You see, how brain wash the people can be, with these two nations going at war. Regardless of what they portrayed, the movie bomb at the box office, when it came out in 2001. It does beg the question; why was this movie even made? The Soviet Union is gone, so Russian audiences isn't going to see it. Western culture are so engrained in hating anything Red & Foreign. So it most unlikely, it was made for them. So, who is this movie, for!? Despite that, I still like this movie for what it is. An intense cat & mouse thriller. While, it's not the best WW2 movie out there. It's far from being one of the worst",8,4,6,4 April 2017
Die Hard," Need to recharge life's batteries? Watch Die Hard!
","Die Hard is a Christmas movie directed by John McTiernan that's not traditional at all, but still watched each year during the holidays. Die Hard serves as an alternated holiday movie. Die Hard opens up with off duty New York Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) attend a Christmas Party at Nakatomi Skyscrapper with his wife in downtown LA. Out of nowhere the plot kicks in the door as German terrorist and thieves take the people in the building hostage and start to make demands to the police. The group is led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) a brutal man whom able to have casual persona and an an intimidating one in a few seconds. Hans also had a casual attitude to killing even willing to kill his own men. Alan Rickman is able to show that Han has a curt attitude to people whom he did not know and jokey nature with those he knew. Alan Rickman is able to make him out to be somewhat of a suit. He flaunted his knowledge and boast of his education to anybody, but McClane manage to slip from his grip. The film follows his exploits as he slowly engages the German terrorists one by one barefoot to retake the tower while dealing in depth of personal pain. The broken glass on his barefoot can be seen as his Achilles's heel. McClane lacks heroic virtues and qualities like Achilles. He can be explains to be a Byronic hero or Anti-Hero by having similar traits to those who like being arrogant and cynical. He is also cunning and able to adapt. He has a dis-tasted for social institutions and norms when he was at the party. John McClane works better alone than in a crowd. Die Hard gives their hero, a cutting edge from cookie cut heroes. What Die Hard does well is keeping a small scale budget while exporting a big blockbuster result. Most of the movie takes taking place entirely within a few floors of the Nakatomi Plaza. It was one of the first of the limited-space, small cast action films. This formula of putting characters in limited area spawn great sequels in their own right, but also an entirely new sub-division of the action genre. The movie is condensed in a few scenes and areas that get so well know. It simplified in such a way that lets the characters and the action really develop and shine through. While having a few explosion-filled sequences, the movie allows the audience to care for the characters and not feel like disconnected from the story-arch or the depth of the characters portray. The movie takes light-hearted approach to the genre, incorporating many less-than-serious elements and one-liners keeps the movie fun and enjoyable no matter how many times watched through, but it comes with a cost. Sub-characters in the film seem corny, low-intelligent or bad written. The scenes with the LA police for example drag the movie down and slow it down. The film brings in Reginald Vel Johnson playing a role as a cop which doomed the actor to playing cops for the rest of his life. He continues to be type cast to this day. Reginald Vel Johnson's character has a trouble past where he accidentally shot a kid and now wouldn't be able to shot. While they did give some back-story to Reginald Vel Johnson character, most of his lines were bad and his actions in the movie are nearly useless. All the main characters in this film are fairly complex and well written compared to most of the dumb action hero movies of the 1980s. Still the police chief doesn't serve any purpose except for delaying police intervention which would have wrapped the story up faster. Matters would have been more easily solved had the chief acquired an average intelligence. Since the sub-characters took a backseat, the character of McClane and Gruber makes the movie watchable. The sarcastic nature of McClane's character against the whimsical Gruber makes this hero and villain pairing one of the finest in film history. The movie even makes a famous quote out of its hero's swearing mouth that can be still heard today. The language can be harsh and the violence too much but it's a good movie. The plot might seem rudimentary and unoriginal today, but it still one of the first movie with many of the things action movie need to be a success. It's the blueprint to any action movie today.",8,5,6,6 December 2012
Psycho," I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It's amazing!
","Some critics believe 'Psycho' to be Director Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum opus. In my opinion, it's an masterpiece that set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films. Even before the 1960's, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense and perhaps the best-known film director in the world at the time. This movie just add to it with subliminal themes, subtext and images. The center theme of Psycho is the concept of multiplies identifies where characters are challenge to live through life under multiplies roles. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is just that type of a character. She is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and living in a double life with her affect with strong will Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One day, Marion is given money to be deposited in the bank. Instead of depositing it, Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her love affair Sam. Rather than meeting Sam, she finds a nervous charming innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the Motel, she was staying. He was control by his over demanding mother. Anthony Perkins gives a subtle performance here. She is taken by Norman Bates innocent charm, as she sees him as the fragile alter-ego of Sam. In many ways, Norman Bates and Sam have very similar stories, the only different is that Norman can't live without her mother, while Sam can. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, as the shower scene is probably the film's most famous sequence. In a way, the shower scene was like baptismal waters. Marion had decided to go back, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she cleaning herself of sin. I like the fact that Marion's underwear is white before the theft, and black after. Feeling in rage that Marion might steal Norman away from her when Marion suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a mental hospital, her mother strikes Marion, only for Norman to cover it up. When Marion goes off missing, her personality live on with her double, twin sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles) who finds herself staying at the Bates motel, just like her long-lost sister. I love how Hitchcock utilized and probably was the first to establish the writing technique of the false protagonist. The false protagonist is when the viewers are introduced to a character that supposed to be the main character, only to be removed from the story either by death or other means early in the film. By removing Marion Crane from the story, early on. It might offend Janet Leigh's fans, but Alfred Hitchcock's know what's for the best. One of the best image scenes are the mirrors in why show that the characters have multiply personality. Another running theme is the money. The stolen money that Marion carries about with her represents her dirty little secrets. Hitchcock goes so far as to symbolically link this pile of money to a pile of feces. Every talk about money is weaved into dialogue about how filthy it is. While the showing scene can be seen as erotica for Norman Bates; Norman Bates mother sees it as filth. Contrary to a widely told tale, Hitchcock did not arrange for the water to suddenly go ice-cold during the shower scene to elicit an effective scream from Leigh. But Hitchcock did tested the shock value of Mother's corpse by placing it in Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when she notice it there. Compare to Modern Day Slasher films, this film is really tame of violence. The film was known to be nauseating for some viewers at the time, even with it being shot in black and white. The novel is more brutal than the film version. It had a beheading no less in it. Alfred Hitchcock cut it out, and did stabbing instead. Even with its graphic nature, the 'shower scene' never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. Alfred Hitchcock desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory so he film the movie in black and white, while also trying to cut cost down. I think, the biggest reason why it is in black and white is because it's better for horror films with the use of shadows. While it is tame, the movie is still disturbing. Hints why the film still have the Rated R label. What might bizarre is how often the film talks about eating. Considering that the writer of the original book, Robert Bloch based his story loosely upon the activities of serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein, some of these constant references to eating could simply be a sly reference to cannibalism. One subliminal theme of Psycho is when Norman chats to Marion about his hobby of taxidermy. It's remind us another Hitchcock classic movie 1963's The Birds. By having Marion eat like a bird, and having a last name like a bird. No wonder why Norman wants to eat her all up, but Norman couldn't hurt a fly or could he. That's actually a form of symbolism. The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled 'The Murder' is amazing. It works for the film so well. This film sequels that followed in 1983 are just mediocre at best. There was also a 1998's remake of the film with Director Gus Van Sant that was God awful. 2012 and 2013 was a big high for Psycho fans as Bates Motel started to aired on A&E. Anthony Hopkins star in 2012 film Hitchcock about filming the movie, and also a HBO telefilm call 'The Girl' with Toby Jones as Hitchcock during the filming of this movie, Psycho.",9,4,5,26 June 2013
Jersey Boys," Hey Sherry! Jersey Boys is not as fun as the Broadway version. Ain't that a shame! Still, it's not a bad movie. It's music to my ears.
","Big Girls don't cry, and you shouldn't cry, too. While, it's not the best musical movie out there. It's far from the worst musical ever. Director Clint Eastwood really takes the story of musical biography of the Four Seasons from a more playful and brighter entertaining tone of a musical, and made the film much darker like a biographic melodrama. Clint Eastwood really went a different path, digging more into the conflict, leaving audiences were impatiently waiting for the familiar songs. When the songs finally comes, it's really short, or oddly place. While, the movie had a lot of their hit songs; some of the major songs were missing from the film. Good examples are the cover song 'I've Got You under My Skin' from Cole Porter, 'Candy Girl', 'Marlena' and others. They also forgot to add a few novelty songs that the Four Seasons did under the band name 'The Wonder Who'. Then there were the hits, they had as the Four Lovers. Where is 'Beggin' and 'Fallen Angel'? I do like that, the movie has cameos songs from other bands such as the Angels, such as 'My Boyfriend's Back'. I do like how the camera crew filmed the music in real-life takes, rather than using pre-recorded synched songs. Still, some of the synching, they did use seen a bit off. Like the musical, the movie is separate by four acts: (In this case, four seasons). The movie focus on the rise, AKA Spring, told by Tommy Devito (Vincent Piazza), the success, AKA Summer, told by Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), the tough times, AKA Fall, told by Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and last, life after the group AKA Winter as told by Frontman, Frankie Valli. (John Lloyd Young). Far from a mediocre tribute band, the actors were pretty good in their roles. I just wish that John Lloyd Young wasn't the only main cast returning from the Broadway play. It's sad that there isn't any Christian Hoff, Daniel Reichard or J. Robert Spencer. That was kinda disappointed. I kinda wanted the same cast of the Tony Award-winning musical of the same name in this film. The story telling is pretty good, and had an alright pace. It can be a bit choppy at times. I do like the 1950's Rashomon style of story-telling, as you don't know whom narration is lying or not. Some critics might hate the film due to the Italian American stereotyping, and overused of language. In fact, the argument could be made that taming the language could have resulted in a PG-13 rating, making it more accessible to families. It seem odd for this movie to be Rated R, when the Broadway musical isn't. Some people, might see this film trying too hard to be a carbon copy of Martin Scorsese's mafia movie style. It doesn't feel like a Clint Eastwood's film, at all. It can easily be mistaken for a Scorsese's film. The movie is pretty accurate to what really happen to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons in real life. Still, there were some historic inaccurate and factual errors on the dates. The film also, take some liberties on the story, like Tommy DeVito being a really bad uncleanly roommate. What isn't depicted in the film wasn't needed like Valli's other daughter, dying at the same time as the one with the drug overdose. I guess for dramatic purposes, Frankie records 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You,' his first single as a solo artist, months after the death of his daughter in the film rather than years earlier of those two events. I think if they added those events, the movie would had been a little too grim. The movie isn't all depressing. The movie does have some humor. The jokes were mostly hits than misses to the funny bone for me. I do like, how the movie has an inside 'Goodfellas' joke for Joe Pesci (Joey Russo) talking to Tommy Devito. It's really ironic that Joe Pesci end up playing a character named Tommy DeVito, later on his life. It's also nice to see Clint Eastwood appears briefly in the film when a scene from Rawhide (1959-1965) is shown being watched on TV. Christopher Walken was given some really good one liners that only Walken can make it sound funny. Overall: While, it's doesn't feel like a musical. It was a good movie. So, walk like a man, and go see this movie for yourself. It's a movie for all seasons.",7,3,4,15 September 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," The story of the hunt for the most wanted man in the world
","The film is chronicle of the decade long hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in the eyes of young, intellectual, brazen CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) In the book, 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' written by the account of the Seal Operator and his book is based on the perspective of the female CIA Operator. She is referred to as 'Jen', but her name matters not. What's important is her tough-minded, monomaniacal focus for almost 10 years, despite the numerous attempts by her superiors to ignore her theories. The movie would love to make it seems like she did all the work, but in my opinion, I think 'Jen' reference to a number of working agents. Maya is a pretty bland character as she sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden losing more and more of herself like Ahab searching for the White Whale. Having no life and being passive-aggressive does not make for an interesting character. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her, except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school. We're never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. Rather than reality, we are presented with a view of the world through the eyes of an angry childlike being. The film directed by Katherine Bigelow was at first was going to portray the long and unsuccessful hunt for bin Laden. Katherine was about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed and the story clearly had to rewritten. The movie opens up with emotional black screen that had 9/11 dialogue. It was very respectable to not to show those events in a Hollywood movie deem as entertainment. Still, hearing those real voices of the victims are chilling. We are follow with a scene of torture to terrorists in George W. Bush's America. Some people were mortified by the torture scenes but I'm sure the reality is much worse. I was very confused by what was the point of the movie's portrayal of torture. It was torture to see in the film, seeing people sitting around complaining that they have no intelligence because can't torture anyone once the Obama administration comes to power. The fact is that torture did not play any role in bringing Bin Laden to justice. It was very clear that torture is counterproductive and was a hindrance to our attempts to find Bin Laden. So why was the movie always showing torture help find him. Then there is the raid. The scene was so dark you could hardly see what anyone was doing. When the Seal Teams enter the compound of UBL it is very accurate according to the book; down to the 4 scope night inferred vision the operators where wearing. I believe the capturing of Bin Laden in the movie at the compound is based solely on Mr. Owens account. As far as the various forms of sleuthing the CIA used to find UBL can be debated, as in the book, the female CIA Operator does play an important role, she is the only operator that stayed on the UBL whereabouts as others were transferred in and out. I can't even fathom how the SEAL or the Agent felt during the mission. I do hope that the actual shooter wasn't one of the SEALs from the raid that were killed a few months later on that CH-47 that crashed. Loved the Weinstein Company Seal Team Six film for National Geographic Channel about the taking of Osama bin Laden. Now after watching Zero Dark Thirty, I have to say this is better. I love the fact that women are given prominent roles in the movie. It's rare to see women in government type roles. The supporting acting was great. I like James Gandolfini does such a great job of portraying the CIA direct, I almost thought he was Leon Panneta. Still there are some faults. Kathryn Bigelow's film is driven more by plot than by characters but it's a strong plot, clearly well-researched and told realistically while shrugging off any glamorizing or hero-making ambitions. None of the main characters are that likable, as they call portray using torture to gain information. Scenes also changed too many times so I couldn't figure out if the scene was in CIA headquarters in Virginia or in another country. Later in the movie after the bombing at the Marriott, Maya is invited out to eat and says 'I don't eat out, too dangerous.' Later, she is seen half intoxicated at a bar when a colleague delivers a rather important piece of intelligence equipment to her. Some people will think, the movie has this American propaganda and jingoism to it. I can see it, a bit. Plus, certain people will have their opinion on how the movie might be a bit partisanship due to the release. Some people will think makes Obama look good. It's greatest conspiracy ever, they might say. It didn't help that throwing Osama in the ocean was pretty stupid considering the conspiracy theories it has created. This movie needs closed captions as there is a lot of lingo talking and it is hard to understand what the actors talk because of the background noise. I kinda wish they research that Pakistan speaks Urdu, not Arabic. Bigelow and her writer Mark Boal went even deeper into research mode and now the film has instigated Congressional hearings in regards to some of the scenes due to allegations improper access to classified information. No matter what's happens. Zero Dark Thirty as Bigelow explained it, 'is a military term for 30 minutes after midnight, and it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire decade-long mission.' In the end, this movie brings light to that.",7,3,7,14 April 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," All Quiet in the Western Front is a haunting look into a life of a soldier in the trenches of World War 1.
","Unlike other war films at the time, that seem more romanticize. This film shows the tragedy of the 'Great War' in detail. This detailed thought-provoking war film is a great watch. It's a must watch to anybody over patriotic or looking for heroism, because in its depiction of the horror of war, All Quiet on the Western Front presents a scathing critique of the idea of nationalism, showing it to be a hollow, hypocritical ideology, a tool used by those in power to control a nation's people. Directed by Lewis Milestone, and based on the Erich Maria Remarque novel of the same name. The movie tells the story of six German soldiers who volunteered to fight in World War I, and it chronicles their demise intellectually, spiritually, and physically as the war drags on and on. All Quiet on the Western Front is considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare. Without spoiling too much of the film, it's seem so real. The movie is an intense watch, even with today's standards. The movie is pretty gory, and graphic for a film of the 1930s with scenes with machine guns and poison gas. Lots of unromantic visions of fear, meaninglessness, and butchery. It's a hard watch to certain people. Due to its anti-war message, a lot of countries banned it, like Australia, Italy and Austria. The worst had to be, Nazi Germany. Since the movie perceived anti-German messages, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party banned the film in their country in the 1930s and early 1940s. During its brief run in German cinemas in the early 1930s, the Nazis led by Joseph Goebbels disrupted the viewings by setting off stink bombs and releasing white mice in the theaters. It wasn't until 1952, when West Germany re-released the film in theaters without much protest. It's weird that Universal Studios would product the film like this, at the time because it's tell the war in German perspective, the enemy. This was indeed, rare to do in film, even in today's open world. Show the war in the eyes of the enemy. While, the movie is set in Germany, the movie is pretty English in speaking for the mostly English speaking audience. The movie is worth watching in German dubbing. It's a must-do. If you can't speak German, the film has a lot of visual symbolism to tell the story of the war. A good example of this is, Kemmerich's boots (Ben Alexander). You really see the emotional disconnection that war cause, because when Kemmerich is on his deathbed, the most pressing question among his friends is who will inherit his boots. It's disturbing. In Remarque's view, this pragmatism has a hugely destructive impact on a soldier's humanity; main character, Paul Bäumer (Lew Ayres), for instance, becomes unable to imagine a future without the war and unable to remember how he felt in the past. Another great scene with Paul is that with the dying French soldier. You really see, how Paul is trying to keep his humanity alive, while also keeping himself alive. Great acting from him and all the actors. Another symbol in the film is butterflies. You see it, throughout the film. It derives in part from Remarque's childhood hobby of collecting insects and mounting them in a case. In the film, it seems to represent the innocence and joy of nature. In the film final iconic scene, where a soldier is shot while trying to grab a butterfly. This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an early scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand, instead of the main actor. Some of the faults of the film could be the film's opening prologue. It felt a little detracting, as if they were trying to appeal to everybody, without trying so hard, not to offend people. Another is the mid-scene with the French women. Yes, I guess, it was there, so the movie wasn't too depressing, but it slow the movie, way down. For the most part, the movie is very accurate to the war. Overall: Does an all time, classic stand the test of time? Yes. I think it's better than the 1979 remake. The black and white film footage really makes the war very eerily to watch. In 1930, it really deserve to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing and others. In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being deemed 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.' Since the movie is still own by Universal Studios, most copies of the film are well preserved. Watching in HD Blu-Ray DVD is in the way, to go, when watching this film. If you really like this movie, read its sequel, 'The Road Back', which shows members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war. It's a must read. Anyways, All Quiet in the Western Front is one of, if not the, most effective war films ever made and it works.",9,8,8,25 January 2015
12 Years a Slave," A powerful movie that brings in new light to the dark topic of slavery.
","12 Years a Slave is indeed a very powerful movie. Directed by Steve McQueen, and written by John Ridley, the movie is an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a New York State-born free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great job, acting as Solomon Northup, and it wouldn't surprise me, if he wins a couple of awards for it. The supporting cast is just as amazing. I give mad props to both Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender for their performance as plantation owner, beloved William Ford and crude Edwin Epps. There are too many powerful performances scenes to count, but I had to choice some, it would be, the scene where Solomon is nearly lynch by John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and he is just hanging out there, while the other slaves couldn't do anything about it. Last is the trials and misfortune of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) with her being abuse by both Epps and his evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen. The movie doesn't have too much over the top moments, and seem very accurate. The movie puts a lot of insight, you wouldn't see in much modern movies today. First off, there is the good heart, slave owner William Ford. You would never see that in any other movie, as movies about slavery have all slave owners as a crude one-dimension evil human beings. Second off, you wouldn't see a white field hand (Garret Dillahunt) working besides the slaves in other films. To accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers did a great job capturing the language, the look, and locations of the time. Still, the film did take artistic license, and create some new drama like the scene where a sailor kill a slave. One thing, I didn't like about the film is some of the music. Don't get me wrong, I found the songs, Roll Jordan Roll, and the classical American folk music great, but the soundtrack by Han Zimmer is kinda sound not new. Most of the emotional music being play in the background, remind me too much of 'Time' from Han Zimmer's 2010 soundtrack for the film, 'Inception'. It's seem recycled. Another thing that is bothering people is the flow of the film over the 12 years. It seems to go, really quick over the years. When he was kidnapped in the beginning, his children were kids and he looked about mid 30's. Throughout the movie he doesn't look any older at all or aged. The point is, they could have done was to add the age look for the characters because you can't tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by. But it didn't feel like 12 years for me. It more felt like a matter of about 4 months. Maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup on the actors to show them getting older it would have been better. About the brutality of the film, it was there, it wasn't too gruesome in my opinion. It was a lot harder to watch 1997's Amistad than this. I wouldn't say, this movie is for all audience, but I do agree, young mature adults should watch it. I don't find the movie, putting a white guilt to anybody, nor do I say, this is a movie trying to start hatred against whites for their ancestor mistakes. If anything, it is part of the healing process, for the most part, I found myself, not anger, but understanding what people went through back then. Most black audiences would agree with me. I have to say, all people of every race need to see this film, even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. The reason why people should see this film is indeed, while slavery seems like old practice, it still acts upon the modern world through sex trade, and the misused of illegal workers. Such modern sense of slavery need to quickly end. Indeed, if you like this movie, do check out, 1984's TV movie, Solomon Northup's Odyssey starting Avery Brooks. It's well done as well. Overall: While it did had a limited release, it is a must watch.",9,10,17,11 January 2014
Sausage Party," Hot Dog! Wieners never quit. This movie was entertaining.
","It may not be an Oscar wiener, but you'll relish this raunchy yet smart film about one sausage, Frank (Voiced by Seth Rogen) quest on discovering the truth about his existence and what really happens when the food are chosen to leave the grocery store. Without spoiling the movie, too much; I have to say, I kinda glad, this movie came out. After all, it's seem like 2012's botch animation film, 'Food Fight' ruin the whole cool concept. This movie directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon went through a lot of development hell, in its way to being product. Pitch eight years ago by creator/writers Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg, it seem like nobody in Hollywood was open to the idea until producer, Megan Ellison and eventually Sony came along. However, the early draft of the script was leaked in the Sony hack in November 2014, further stalling progress of the movie. Still, even with that. The movie got made, because of two factors. One is the success of 2014's runaway hit, 'The Interview' and the second, being that it's been many years since the last good profanity fill Rated R completely-CGI animation comedy came to theaters with 1999's 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'. People were really looking forward to this film; as so was I. I like the blended of low brow gross humor, violent food deaths, silly food puns, with theologically religious dogma style debate that the movie is going for. It made for a unique watch. Parents whom accidentally take their kids to see the movie and complain afterwards are idiots. This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; as its trailers, rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. It also got NC-17, before being tone down. Nothing is sacred, here. Yet, there is only a few things that I didn't like, about the film. Some of the profanity in the film seem a little forced. Some of the curse words don't really match, the tone of the sentences. It somewhat lose its emphasis. The film rely way too much on the overabundance of foul language, and sexual innuendos to carry the film. Some of the language is creative, however, others are so groan-worthy. And while some jokes not exactly funny, it's at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. Also, the story is a bit off-putting when it's introduce other supermarket items ranging from feminine hygiene products to bathroom tissue into the mix. It's not, because the item come across as gross, but the fact that it's makes the story, somewhat jarring. It's weird that they can come alive, yet others items like knifes, cigars, plates, and cups do not. Honestly, it could be better, if they stick to the whole 'living food' concept. It's already a bit confusing. Throughout the whole movie, I was wondering if any of the previous ingredients to make such complex food, were sentient before being killed off. Is a fusion or reincarnation thing? Also, how in the hell does, the food, not know that they will be killed off? By the look at the place, this supermarket does have a deli and butcher. They would have to notice, something odd. I guess the limited intelligence sense is given, since many of perishable products can't be more than a few days old. Plus, I get the whole 'portal' idea toward the end as something to laugh at, for being ridiculous, but it really comes out of nothing. At less, the infamous 'orgy' scene made a little more sense to the story. Anyways, thinking too much of the logically of the plot will hurt your head. It's better off, just to turn your brain, off and enjoy the ride. Despite the confusing plot, I did like all the film references, this film got, ranging from 1998's 'Saving Private Ryan', 1991's 'Terminator 2' and 1961's 'West Side Story', even if some of the shouts out, were a little too out there like 1962's Twilight Zone's episode 'To Serve Man'. Despite that, the voice actors including Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Salma Hayek, and others are very lively in their performances, even if their characters are shallow, somewhat racist stereotypes. I have to give props to some of the actors as some of them, were playing multiply characters like Bill Hader and Harland Williams. However, I have to say, actor Edward Norton does the best, out of all of them. His impression of director/comedian Woody Allen was amazing with his Jewish character, Sammy Bagel Jr. You really didn't see that, coming at all from him. The celebs cameos were also fun to see. Singer, Meat Loaf playing Meat Loaf has to be, my favorite. The first-class computer animation from Nitrogen Studio is also clear and colorful. It just as good as the animation from big time studios like Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks, and Illumination Entertainment in the last decade. It just suck that many of the animators at Nitrogen Studios worked under poor conditions and were forced by Greg Tiernan to work overtime without pay; with results of many of the animators going uncredited if complaining. While that part of the production might not be cool; the work, they put out, were astounding, no matter what. The music by long ex-Disney composer Alan Menken was also terrifying. The opening number was very well-done and will get critical from some religious fundamentalism. Overall: It's a party worth attending more than once. The comedy about grocery store foods and products facing an existential crisis, is a must-watch for anybody looking for a good time laugh. That's if you can stomach, its menu style of humor. Highly recommended.",7,12,23,19 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," Sit on down & drink your milkshake! 'There will be blood' is a film worth watching!
","2007's 'There will be Blood' is truly the 'Citizen Kane' for the modern age. While, both movies are similar in many ways when it comes to, the negative dealing of capitalism and its inherent trouble of greed. 'There will be Blood' takes the concept into a darker shade of black with its main character, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), loosely based on historic oil tycoon, Edward L. Doheny, on his ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Without spoiling the film, too much, all I'm going to say, is Plainview does nearly everything horrible to gain success, throughout the movie; yet, surprising, there is something that about Plainview, audiences and critics find him, sympatric. Much of that, comes from the fact, that he is hard-working, determine, and down-right charisma. Because of that, while, most people don't condone his brutal misanthropic action, we still admired his ambition of the American Dream, even if it's bit morally dirty. Another reason, why people tend to like, Plainview, is the fact, that Daniel Day Lewis's acting is astonishing good, with his use of his tone and body language. He impresses us a lot, on how well, Plainview is, in being a master debonair con artist, when it comes to portraying himself as a family man, when it's outright not true. Also, while, the movie doesn't have much of the offbeat humor that Anderson's previous movies, is know for; the way, Plainview coolly lay down brutal mean-spirited insults and threats to weaker, secondary characters was bit humorous, even if it's technically, highly considered as highly offensive bullying. Sometimes, we just happen to like the villain, because in a way, deep inside us. We, too, have a dark side, wanting a bit of power over others. As a result, we, the audience end up having conflicting feelings towards Lewis's character, rather than hating Plainview, downright. No wonder, why he won the Oscar that year. Regardless, I have nothing, against people who think Plainview is just too unlikeable to watch. Like I said before, he does nearly everything sinister on his rags to riches story. Nevertheless, it's still weird that the film was inspired by author, Upton Sinclair's 1926's novel, 'Oil!' Yet, the novel has nothing really to do with the self-made millionaire. Instead, the book focus on the only son of that man. While, most of the changes were, for the greater good. I still wonder, what if, they kept all the socialists provoke arguments throughout the story. The movie might had been a little bit better. Nevertheless, that wasn't the problem with this movie directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The delinquent about this historical drama is the pacing. It's a very slow built. Certain scenes seem to drag on, a little too long for my taste, such as the chat with his, 'supposedly' brother, Henry (Kevin J. O' Connor). Honestly, the director could had cut it, and we would still end up, with the same results. The scene wasn't really needed, but I guess, they really wanted to do the Cain Vs Abel comparison. Don't get me wrong, those sequences weren't bad. It just that the baptizing and confession scenes between biblical-like holy spiritualism vs devilish materialism conflict between Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) and David Plainview sermons was a little bit, better. I like, how both men are fighting for the rights for the town and each other's souls using their industrial and religious powers as tools. It's cool to see that Daniel's business was his religion, and Eli's religion was his business. While, some of their monologue can be, a bit wordy. Most of the dialogue & speeches, they perform, adds to already otherwise meaningful story. The baptizing and confession scenes are perfect examples. Even, the speech at the bowling alley, toward the end was powerful. Kel O'Neill, the original actor for Eli, left halfway through production due to being intimidated by Daniel Day-Lewis during the original filming of the bowling alley scene. Hearing that, proves that those scenes weren't a gutter. It was an authoritative strike. Another great thing, about this film is the camera work. The cinematography that, Paul Thomas Anderson & Robert Elswit did with their crew, was amazing. The film use of bleak desaturated colors was also profound. It made the film's gritty historic account of the time period, seem a little more real. It was dirty looking, but not too ugly. It had the right balance. Even the film score that went along with the visuals from composer Jonny Greenwood, work for the most part. It gave off, an astonishing eerily, creepy vibe that mirror, what's happening on screen. I just wish, he didn't use so much of his own recycled music, from a previous score from the 2003's 'Bodysong' documentary. It made the film, less unique & more generic. It's music, you likely to hear, in hundreds of old-school Gothic horror movies. Nevertheless, some of the recycled music that Greenwood, use, wasn't that bad; such as the case of classical cues. This film gave new life to composer Johannes Brahms's 'Violin Concerto' music. It was epic composition to end an epic film. Overall: All of this, parts was indeed a risky move for Anderson, as 'There will be Blood' was a dramatic shift in both tone and visual style from his previous works such as 1997's 'Boogie Nights' & 1999's 'Magnolia'. Away was the bright vibrant colors with catching uplifting tunes. Now, it was astonishing down to earth ground with a hellish tone that is also deep. For the most part, it kinda work. While, 2007's Coen Brothers crime masterpiece, 'No Country for Old Men' won Best Picture that year at the Academy Award. 'There will be Blood' proves that it was a fighting contender, and that Oil is indeed thinner than water. It's a must watch for anybody that loves movies.",8,0,0,23 November 2017
Joker," No joke here. The phoenix has truly risen. Joaquin really deserve his Oscar.
","Todd Phillips has a very unique approach to writing and directing a comic book flick. Instead of having a lot of typical fantasy like tropes. This motion picture went for the more ground crime drama character study story with DC Comics Batman's arch nemesis 'The Joker'. Something that a lot of fans kinda wanted. After all, while a number of backstories have been given in the comics, a definitive one has not yet been established for the clown prince of crime. However, fans of the psychopath criminal mastermind version of him will probably not like this movie. This form has him as a somewhat mentally disable impoverished depress comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) whose descent closer into insanity and nihilism when disregarded by society in a decaying Gotham City during 1981. Let's face it. The character is far cry departure from the versions we got in previous movies. He's less a villain and more like an antihero in this film. Arthur just wants people to be happy. Losing 52 pounds, Joaquin does portray the naïve starving artist well. The scenes where his rib cage is visual are quite upsetting. The way Phoenix walks up the stairs with his shoulder slumped down show how downtrodden Arthur really is. Great use of body language. The facial expressions including the makeup run offs that Joaquin does are also well perform. Whenever Arthur's condition caused him to uncontrollably laugh. His mouth opens way too wide that it looks distressing. On several occasions they are indistinguishable from his sobbing. It really illustrated Arthur's declining mental state. However, the film is so heavily influence by Martin Scorsese's 1976 movie 'Taxi Driver' & 1982 'King of Comedy' that many of this film scenes felt like clichés reenactments like the fake out shot me sign moment involving love interest Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz). Another bothersome I got was due to the character's chronic daydreaming, it makes the audience question just how much of the film, we see is happening in real time and how much of it is Arthur's fantasizing. Because of that the movie has a lot of deliberately somewhat annoying open-ended plot holes. For example, how he was able to get away with so many murders. Killing a patient at the hospital without setting off the alarm on the heart monitor machine and even being allowed in the building after an infamous previous gun accident seem unlikely. That or the cops really slow to arrested people. After all Arthur has plenty of time to sleep, get dress, eat and murder a coworker after breaking in a neighbor's room. The logic in these scenes are a bit annoying as the entire ending plays like a deranged hallucination rather than a genuine series of events. The whole idea of the Wayne family seeing a movie during the riots seem a bit forced. In truth I don't think the film never really figured out a true decent climax. That's why I believe when Arthur told the psychiatrist that she wouldn't get the joke. I think the whole story might have been made up, in order to troll the whole audience to feel sympathy for him and his crimes. Whether Arthur becomes the actual Joker as seen in traditional Batman lore or inspires a separate character is ambiguous. Either way, Arthur will be an old man by the time Batman is established. Regardless the film is a little too heavy handed and preachy when it comes to dealing with people with mental health. After all, none of the supporting characters Arthur hurts really deserve their punishment besides the three oddly seem out of place rich guys on the train. None of them are fully evil to be sympathetic. Some of them honestly are friendly and help Arthur more than they harm such as giving him protection and a chance to redeem himself on television when they could had run away. As of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) he gave Arthur the truth about his origin even after what the unstable man did to him. Although how much of a jerk he is left up to the viewer's interpretation of what Arthur's origins truly was. With that it's really hard to believe that Fleck would repress the abusive memories of his past for that long. Still I do dig the theories involving that. I just wish the film had more comic book references rather than the small mentions. As for shouts out to other media. The best use has to be Charlie Chaplin's 1936's film 'Modern Times'. Not only is the movie's footage visual in the movie, but the cover of 'Smile' is haunting along with Stephen Sondheim's 'Send in the Clowns' song. I like that the music is generally discordant, unsettling and tonally dissonant. It reflects Arthur's feverish mental state so well. The sequence involving dancing on the stairs is so iconic. I really like how the sets & locations looks. It's an urban nightmare. No wonder why Arthur went crazy. As for the controversy surrounding the film revolves around being sympathetic towards killers & this movie might inspiring copycats. I understand why. It wasn't even shown in certain parts of Colorado due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Many police forces and even the US Army were also put on alert when this flick was released in theaters. In the end, the film still got the last laugh as it made a ton of money. However, Warner Bros did make a movie that push buttons with its themes in class warfare and gun control that I doubt a sequel would be made. They don't even considered part of the DC Extended Universe. Instead, it is an Else worlds story. In the end, while entertaining & thought provoking at certain parts. It's still a disturbing film. The film presents no solutions, promotes despair and really is a glorification of violence. Just know that when seeing this movie. It's one film that certainly not to have a happy ending.",8,1,2,29 April 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," Atticus Finch will be there all night, and he would still be there when Jem waked up in the morning. To kill a Mockingbird is a masterpiece.
","I remember reading the source material for the movie, the Putizer Reward book of the same name by Harper Ferry when in middle school. The film removes a few sub-plots, but still, very faithful to the book. It's still long with a few boring moments, but whenever, the character of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) got on screen, it was a joy to watch. This is Peck's best role. A lot of people might remember, this film for the court-room drama, as Atticus Finch find himself defending a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) accused of rape, but the movie directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote; is also a coming to age story, teaching tolerance and decry prejudice. Without spoiling too much, the story covers three years of the 1930s, showing Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford), undergo big changes in their young lives. I like how Atticus Finch help them on the way, being a good father figure. As a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. You also see the movie dig deep into the issues of class, just/unjust laws, and Southern morals. A lot of woman believe it, touch on women's rights. I can see it. The patriarchal South does have a history that kinda made white men the dominant group, and women and blacks deemed in more subordinate roles. A lot of LGBT supporters believe that the book is gay or lesbian 'coming-of-age' tale. Indeed, the movie dealt with gender roles in the American Deep South. Scout does acts more like a tom boy and show more a masculine side that feminine. She does not respond positively to anything girly, but it's really hard to prove that she is a closed lesbian or not due to the age. Scout hasn't reach adolescence yet. If Scout was based on Harper Lee's childhood, we still wouldn't know because Lee was an extremely private person and there is little information on her even in major biography databases. It's hard to prove, if Harper Lee is gay or not. Others people have look at this theory, by using Dill as an example, because Dill was supposed based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, the openly gay Truman Capote. While, there is no clear evidence supporting this, other than the fact that Capote was a childhood friend of Harper Lee. I really don't really know. After all, Lee, in turn, is the model for the Idabel character in Capote's first novel, 'Other Voices, Other Rooms,' which seem more like a heterosexual heroine. While, Dill and Scout seem to have a somewhat romantic relationship during childhood, who knows where their sexuality lies. A lot could change if a sequel to the book was ever written, which Harper Lee most likely, will not do. She hasn't wrote a book in years. This issue also brings the rumors of authorship. Some people believe it was written by Truman Capote; while others believe Harper Lee wrote Capote's best novel, In Cold Blood. Who knows? One thing for sure, is the plot is based on the unsuccessful legal defense by Harper Lee's attorney father, during the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case. The movie has a lot of heart & humor, despite dealing with dark themes. The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Peck. In 1995, To Kill a Mockingbird was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Still, some people might hate this film. After all, it has a scene where Atticus shoots a mad dog. Some people see that scene, as he basically is a hypocrite, because he just killed a mockingbird; because Tim Johnson wasn't doing anything it was literally standing there. It wasn't charging at him or the kids. I can see where they are coming from, but the dog was suffering. I know PETA wouldn't like that, but it had a lot of symbolism with the dog scene. Perhaps, it's just one of examples of Atticus doing tough things he doesn't want to do. Is rabies supposed to represented racism? Atticus does refer to racism as 'Maycomb's usual disease.' In addition, while Atticus does not protect the children against racism, he does shoot down racism. Is the dog shooting, an allegory? Is it saying black people are dogs? Is the film saying it's alright to kill black people if they're suffering? Who knows? Maybe, I'm oversimplification it. Perhaps it's just the feeling Scout has. The sick horror at what's happening in front of her and how over complex, violent can be. Was this scene, needed? Maybe- not. Despite its good themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. The film does stereotyped blacks as superstitious, poor, and poorly education blacks who to some critics believe were 'contented slaves'. Some criticized the movie for focusing less on the blacks, and more on the story how honest, white man save them for racism. Surprising, there is some truth to that in the film, but the white savior narrative in film since this movie had indeed, went a little overboard. I didn't mind it, too much in this film. In recent years this idealization of Atticus Finch has been challenged. He is accused of having an élitist and paternalistic attitude towards his client and women, while some have asked how this 'father-knows-best' could have so casually overlooked the Depression South's appalling record of racism, sexism and class exploitation. Still, there is no greater good guy than Atticus Finch in my opinion. Atticus Finch served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Overall: It's a must watch.",9,4,6,14 December 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," You have to be crazy to hate this movie! This movie is a masterpiece
","Put a straightjacket on me, because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.",9,13,15,8 March 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," This movie was edge of your seat, entertaining. Cheesy, but fun!
","Directed by Doug Liman, Edge of Tomorrow is an interesting movie to say the least. Based on the Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The movie took the manga and rewrote it for American audiences. In the near future, an alien race nicknamed 'Mimic' has invaded Earth, nearly overtaken most of Western Europe. The mimics have the ability to mimic and counter Earth military combat strategies with efficiency, thus making them nearly unbeatable. A final surprise assault is planned on the beaches of France, as a last depth attempt to stop the alien invasion of England. The assault goes horrible wrong, as Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to relive the day, time after time, after being expose to the alien time loop, DNA. With each day, he gains the combat experience needed to find a way to defeat the alien beings. You can clearly see, a lot of things from previous films, influencing this movie's direction. Films like the Matrix trilogy, 2011's Sourcecode, and even 1993's comedy, Groundhog Day. It really felt like the movie was paying homage to them, but as well, trying to create something new, out of their concepts. I wouldn't say, this movie is cutting edge, as it does follows a lot of establish tropes from both video games and Sci-fiction novels. The time loop thing is a pretty interested concept that isn't really explore or explain much in the film. The movie opens more plot-holes paradoxes, than solutions. Movies like that, are not worth, getting a headache, trying find logic. It's better to just ignored it, and watch it simple-minded. Still, I can't help, wanting the film to establish the concept more. I wish they had kept the original explanation of Servers, backups, and antennae from the novel, 'All You Need is Kill' for the time loop idea rather than change it to the whole Alpha and Omega thing. It makes more sense, because antennae (Alpha) broadcasting memories back in time to a server (the Omega). It really do helped explain what was going on with William Cage. He wasn't actually teleporting through time. It was just his collected memories. The movie never show the aliens honestly using the time loop. Makes me wonder, how Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) could had a victory at the Battle of Verdun. I would have thought, the aliens would find a way to reset that day. Also, how is the ending of this movie even possible? You would think that the aliens would only sent Alphas to try to take his reset powers. It's not like, he being expose every time, he loops. Wouldn't the aliens figure a way to stop him by giving him a blood transfusion or something? I mean, they all connected through the same mind. Are they really that clueless of the human's plans and how their power truly works? The movie make it seem like they are able to adapt quickly, but rarely show it. Another thing about the film that sucks is the lack of suspense. When you think about it, there is nothing for stalk, here. What made 2011's Source Code, a superior film to this, was because the protagonist had a time limited, to find the enemy's identify, because if not, another bomb would go off. In this film, the protagonist has unlimited times to try to get something right. It felt like it pretty much guaranteed that he find a way to defeat the aliens. The film was bit predictable and repetition, but at less, the movie gave us a number of entertaining different scenarios, so it didn't get too boring. The only time, there were any suspense, was the last couple of minutes, due to him, not having his alien blood, anymore. It was only time, I felt invested in what the results. The movie felt more like a comedy, than a thriller. The way, the combat jackets perform are just over the top ridiculousness. The multiply ways, characters dies, are just hilarious to watch. The film truly felt like it was better off, being animation as an anime or a video game than live action film. The movie felt so cartoony and over the top with the acting. Tom Cruise comes across as a pretty good action star, who grow more mature and combat ready throughout the film. Still, I do find him, playing a younger character, a bit odd and out of place. It kinda hurts that his character wasn't play by an Asian-American actor. The whole Asian concept in the novel is nearly gone in this film. Emily Blunt really shines in this film. She really came across as one tough girl, not to mess with. The backstory of Rita's character is also missing in the film which the book established. The supporting cast are just one-dimensional stereotypes that giving little to care about. Jeremy Piven is in the film, but most of his scenes were cut out. The title was changed from All You Need Is Kill to Edge of Tomorrow because the 'negative chatter' about the word 'kill' in the title. Despite the movie being PG-13, with a lot of violent and characters dying. In my opinion, Edge of Tomorrow works better, as it gives the movie, a more Sci-Fi feel. The movie had this eerily metaphor of World War 1 & 2 in it, as if, telling us that history repeating itself, if nothing new is done. The whole idea of the aliens taking over Germany, like the Nazis. Then taking over Europe. The whole idea of coastal battles scenes remind me of the Invasion of Normandy. Even the date of release, June 6, 2014 is 70 years since D-Day landings is chilling. Overall: The movie is repeat watch. I doubt, I ever get bored, watching it. It's not a smart Sci-Fi movie. It's just popcorn fun.",7,4,9,7 June 2014
Downfall," This movie has great insight on the final few days of Adolf Hitler's reign over Nazi Germany in 1945. It's a watch must for anybody, curious about WWII.
","Downfall is an early 2000's foreign language movie with English subtitles, probably best known for most people, as the movie where the Angry Hitler internet parody meme came from, where Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) rants about modern, often trivial topics. For me, I saw the movie, as more than that; it's a haunting masterpiece of a historical World War 2 reenactment of a very important date in world history. Based upon the books: 'Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich', by historian Joachim Fest; 'Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary', the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge; 'Inside the Third Reich', the memoirs of Albert Speer, one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye–Witness Account by Gerhard Boldt; Das Notlazarett unter der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin by Doctor Ernst-Günther Schenck; and Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949 (1992), Siegfried Knappe's memoir. The mixer of all these source materials, was good enough to nominate for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004. While, the film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel takes some liberties on the source materials, by changing Traudl Junge's (Alexandra Maria Lara) escape, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) meeting with Goebbels family, and how Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) met his end. Despite these dramatic licenses, the film generally shows an accurate view of events. Much of the framing is taken from contemporary photographs and newsreels—one of the movie posters is basically a staged version of the very last picture ever taken of Adolf Hitler. It show, how well-shot, this film is. I just wish, director Oliver Hirschbeigel had more passion for this film. I get that, he wanted to direct 2004's 'Blade: Trinity', instead. However, I don't think, that film would had works well, with his style. Plus, his contract stated that he couldn't leave the project and had to direct 'Downfall'. Despite that, the accuracy and details that Olivier Hirschbiegel put in the film really helped viewers get into Hitler's frame of mind and what it must have been like living with him for his last few days. This also helps by one of the best acting, I ever saw in a World War 2 film. Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, was amazing. It's really shows that he takes his role, very serious by preparing four months of research on Hitler such as showing the effects of the Parkinson's disease and listening to Hitler's secret recording in Finland. It's superb how well, he imitate Hitler's mannerisms and speech patterns. It's no wonder, why his performance was almost universally critically acclaimed by everybody. He was at his best, during the scene where he talks about his dream for Germania (The Nazi New Capital). This scene in the film helps the viewer get a sense of how Hitler lost touch with reality towards the end of the war. Glad, they didn't make Hitler or his followers into a sympathetic figure, at all! The film also powerful in the way, they show the blind devotion of the Nazis, even during Hitler's insanity, by capturing, their violence acts, through many disturbing suicides, commitments, and fighting scenes even knowing they had lost the war. These events become very somber, when children are involve in the fight. It's really shocking to hear, how many of these mad men deprive their little kids of their lives. Because of that, this movie is hard to watch for some people. Another thing, I felt was a little jarring is the overtype supporting cast, actors such as Thomas Kretschmann and Ulrich Noethern. Not only does they play Hermann Fegelein & Heinrich Himmler in this film, but they are no strangers in playing roles concerning Nazis. Most of their filmography are roles like this. While, it's no fault of the film, it just something that hard, not to notice. Another is the interview samples of real Traudl Junge toward the end. I don't like it was taken from the 2001's documentary 'Blind Spot'. It felt out of place, from the majority of reenactment scenes, however it was short enough to care, too much about it. So you can call that, a nitpick from me. Overall: This provocative look at Hitler's last days barely has any faults, besides being grim and somber. While, this film isn't for everybody, due to the graphic violence and language, it's best viewed by very mature people who've had studied World War 2, and are prepared to ponder complex questions about what makes, the darkest, most brutal men in human history into the monsters, that they would soon would become. It's a character study movie, for anybody curious about how the Holocaust, and the War in Europe was able to end.",9,4,6,1 April 2016
Whiplash," This is one compelling drama about the relentless pursuit of perfection. You can't beat that!
","Do you know why I just hurled a chair at you? It's because you haven't, saw this movie, yet! Watch it, and then come back here. Written & directed by Damien Chazelle, and based on his 2013 short film, 'Whiplash', which in return based off, Damien's experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band. The movie tells the story between an ambitious jazz student, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and his abusive, yet driven- instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), as both work together, to see if Andrew, has the guts to be the next big drummer. Without spoiling too much of the film, I found it to be, a very gripping competitive movie. The theme dealing surrounding the cost of perfection is extensive and relatable. I never knew that, trying to be in a top Jazz orchestra was going to be so tough! Both, Miles Teller & J.K Simmons's acting, was top of their game. I'm pretty glad, that both, got a lot of praise from critics. I know, a lot of people would love to see Johnny Simmons reprise his role, from the short film, Whiplash, but Miles Teller does a good job, showing how driven, the character is. Some of the bloody hands scenes were really his own blood, due to him, playing too fast. I'm also, pretty happy to see that J.K Simmons got awarded, for his work in this film. He wasn't injury, free, too. He got two cracked ribs when Miles Teller tackled him during the last two days of shooting. Simmons managed to continue working despite his injury. He deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars in 2014, just for that. Fletcher saying 'Not my tempo.' very frequently, was very sinister. The only criticize, that I can find, about J.K Simmons's performance is how basic, it was. In, a way, it felt like, any other J.K Simmons's performance, just more grounded, and not, over the top angry in a cartoony way, like his role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman films (2002-2007). Other than that, it's hard to pinpoint, anything wrong with their performances. I know, a lot of people have accused the film of distorting jazz history and promoting a misleading idea of wunderkind. I found, those critics to be a bit nitpicking. I do, agree with them, that the movie doesn't put Jazz in a good light. None of the music, they used, didn't stand out. I was hoping for more. One thing that the movie could have, work on, is, getting a better supporting cast. I found, both Paul Reiser & Melissa Benoist co-starring as the student's father and love interest respectively kinda disappointing and forgettable. I know, the movie doesn't give, them, too much time and focus, but they should have, stood out, more, with the little time, they got. I really found both of them, jarring in how overacting, they were, in the small amount of scenes with Andrew. I guess, it was there to flesh out Andrew's character, but was any of their scenes, really that necessary? I found it, a bit unbelievable for Melissa Benoist's character to be, that upset with Miles Teller's character, after only one date. Both, didn't have that much of a connection, in the first place and Andrew didn't really treat her, right. Despite that shortcoming, the movie pacing is pretty well-rounded. I really didn't get bored with any of the sequences. It had really good film editing. I know that no words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job, but I think, Damien Chazelle did a good job. I found it, very interesting, that Chazelle continue to work, after being involved in a serious car accident in the third week of film shooting. I give him, mad props on completing this film. I love the close shots of the blood, sweat and tears of the drummers. It makes the movie so much, more intense, than it should be. Very memorable scenes. The language is harsh and offensive. Lots of gay bashing and racist quotes. I don't recommended, watching this film, if you are a person that easily gets offended. It's remind me of two films, 1987's Full Metal Jacket mixed with 2010's Black Swan, in the way, Whiplash's story delivers. Whiplash challenges it's viewers to think, with its social commentary. Whiplash criticize, the soften approach to education, where the beliefs states that students deserve acknowledgement. It doesn't want that fantasy cult of mediocrity. It wants to bring back the harsh realistic of competitive, where one success, and the others, don't. The argument that the movie brings about coddling several generations of young people, to the point, that they're ill-prepared for the harsh workplace has its merit. In a way, while, Terence Fletcher might seem like the villain. It's very unclear if Fletcher, truly is. Many of his scenes are very inspiring, and many of his other scenes are just borderline, bullying. He's not clear-cut, and that's what I love, about this movie. The conclusion of the film, might be a bit, bittersweet. Some people might hate it, because it's seem like the Fletcher's extreme effective won out in the end and the glorification of Bullying seem right; while other might believe that Andrew out-best him out and challenge himself to fight against bullying. It's really very much open debate. Overall: Whiplash is a refreshing, heart-pounding, highly engaging film of obsession and art. I do recommended watching. It's in my tempo.",9,10,18,22 April 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not, only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.
","If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion, should had been call, 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs, true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese, is pretty well-made. Still, it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle, than a moral tale, in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours, and then in the last few minutes, show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic, with how many crude things, these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes, rather than teach them, not to do what Belfort did. After all, the real Belfort got paid for this movie, a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013, the opening of this movie, Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments, but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much, got Scot free in his case, and that really sucks to hear, if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling, that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still, this role wasn't anything new for him. After all, he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight, he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly, with all the drug use, Jordan portray in the film doing, how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime, Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say, while his premise on film is short, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Jordan's mentor, was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives, money hungry girlfriends, or eye candy hookers, who mostly go around, full frontal nudity, or having sex. If they're not, doing that, they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face, but gees, she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence, she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Then,out of the blue, you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character, if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for, was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), but she ain't no angel. I have to say, for men, at less, we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher, Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father, Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life, the right way, but always his son to make the mistakes, needed to grow. I love the idea, how Martin Scorsese film it, with the use of wide ends, slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see, how bad, it was in the storm scenes, but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic, sexism and racism comments. While, others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick, Gordon Gekko, Freaks, James Bond, Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell, with the pacing, due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still, there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes, and get the same results. I was deeply surprised, that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended, but still watchable.",7,4,5,18 June 2014
It Chapter Two," This movie did clown around a little too much in the gutter. Regardless, it was amusing enough to overlook most of the flaws even if the story didn't quite flow right.
","Considering the source material of the same name from author Stephen King is a muddled, excessive and highly gimmicky 1000+ page novel about a shadowy extraterrestrial being that exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims, by disguising itself with the form of Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgard) to devour them. It makes sense for director Andy Muschietti to try to split the work into two films 2017s 'It' & 2019s 'It: Chapter Two' with the first one focusing on a group of kids known as the Loser Club standing up against Pennywise with the other with them as adults returning to finish the job of trying to kill it. For the most part, the first part kinda work, as it wisely cut off nearly all the outrageous dated or highly offensive stuff like the under aged gangbang, cosmic turtles and the Universal Monsters cameos. Instead they smarter use unique newer scares, swim in a quarry as symbolic baptism and working as a team as the main reason they achieve defeating the creature. However in the sequel, it brought back certain parts really didn't work & wrote new stuff that seem really jarring. One of them was the whole date clichÃ©s stereotypical homophobic attack with a plucky individual has nothing to do with the main plot. It felt unrelated. Also, what is with all the focus on sexuality orientation? That was never the main focus in the novel. It felt a little tack on especially with Richie Tozier (Bill Hader). To add on that, why is Pennywise targeting fearless adults in the first place!? The film could do better if it start with the naive girl gone missing. It would keep true to the lore. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem. Another was the Ritual of ChÃ¼d which like the novel doesn't really go anywhere. As an excuse for Losers to help gain their childhood memories back, it's pretty weak & lame. They seem pretty well knowledge for the most part of the gang's own history before trying to seek their tokens. To add on that, the awkward flashbacks to their younger selves was somewhat annoying & highly repetitive. The callbacks to the previous film just add to the sequel's bloat and erratic pacing. Muschietti has over 4 hours of footage because of that. He states that he plans to use the unused footage for a possible future film or a super cut. Either way, the child performances in this movie didn't stand out as much as the last flick. Also the young thespians grew tremendously in the 2 years following filming. Because of that, they had to be digitally de-aged in some scenes. The final effect came across as uncanny valley bizarre for some audiences. In short, it's probably best that all the kid's scenes should had been cut to focus more on the adults for a tighter film. After all, I miss the catatonia kidnapping subplot involving actress Audra Phillips (Jess Weixler) than the group clumsily running around. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy much of their undertakings across town even if some of the clichÃ©s loud jump scares involving the creatures were pretty hokey and fake-looking like the CGI Paul Bunyan statue coming to life or like the leper attack with the oddly place random Juice Newton's pop song 'Angel in the Morning' playing in the background. Some of them had potential of being really scary like the witch. That's only if the filmmakers went 1980 'the Shining' room 237 route of showing a more realistic dead old woman rather than a silly wacky troll doll. Nevertheless I did had the most fun with the fear doors and the Pomeranian in spite of it not being that scary. It was funny. Even the bloodbath and being buried alive sequences were somewhat well done. However, there was still a tone problem. The way, the film intermixed comedy with the disturbing imagery aspect was a bit odd. Despite that, one thing the film should had drop was Henry Bowers (Teach Grant)'s subplot. Unlike the book, his presence here doesn't really add anything to the film. Plus it's really hard to believe that the character survived his giant fall from the last movie. At least, the film made the right decision by not adding abusive husband Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink) to the mix. The movie only needed one villain: Pennywise. Once again Bill does a great job. Nevertheless the climactic battle between him and the Losers felt a little bit recycled from the last movie with the individuals overcoming their fears again. I would rather have the flood scene from the book. To top it off, I hate the film for making suicide seem like a good thing like some sort of noble sacrifice. Suicide is an incredibly tragic act and to frame it here as a calculated, heroic move is not only irresponsible, but dangerous. In truth, it doesn't make the group durable, it only passes the pain onto them, making it harder. To romanticize suicide, is going against the previous film's core message that working together make them all strong. As for performers playing the Losers. All of them individually were great in their roles with Isaiah Mustafa's performance being the weakest as he is given all the exposition dumps lines when it should had been Jay Ryan's character. Regardless all were great with their on screen chemistry with each other especially Hader, James Ransome, Ryan and Jessica Chastain with James McAvoy being the weakest due to his character not interacting much with the others. As for the cameos. I love Stephen King the best, but in the end, there's a recurring joke in this movie about a writer who cannot write a satisfactory ending to any of his novels. This is what I felt about this movie. Overall: While, watchable & lightyears better than the 1990 miniseries of the same name. This sequel didn't can't quite find the It-factor. It was mediocre.",6,0,0,13 November 2019
The Green Mile," Frank Darabont's Green Mile goes the extra mile and delivers a great movie.
","I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus 'Brutal' Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the 'Christ' like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor.",9,4,6,5 August 2013
The Reader," Do not judge a book based off its cover. Read deeper. The Reader was indeed a pretty good read. The movie was even better.
","Having both readt the book by Bernhard Schlink and then saw the movie directed by Stephen Daldry. I have to say, both were very sophisticated stories. I found that movie is very close to the source material. Without spoiling too much, it tells the story of Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) a German lawyer who finds out, that the woman, who he had an affair with as a mid-teenager in 1958 is being trialled for war-crimes. He's in conflict with himself over morals, as he doesn't know if he should help the woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) or not. Michael realizes that he know a personal secret of Hanna that if revealed, could help her at the trial. He has to make a choice, play Devil's Advocate, and help Hanna due to his blind love for the woman, ignoring the crude facts about her time as a Nazi Guard at Auschwitz concentration camps or allow justice to be served for the benefits of the Holocaust victims involved. While, Ralph Fiennes isn't in the film, much. He does bring his A-game to the part. Most of the film has Michael Berg being played by David Kross, who plays the young Michael in all the flashbacks, who received much praise for his performance. The one person who really deserve praise, is Kate Winslet as Hanna. You can see her deliver lines with such stubbornness, and pride. She also can be charming, but a bit crude, at moments. She really pulls off the complex character, well. She really did deserve the Academy Award for Best Actress that year. I didn't mind the German accents. It wasn't that bad. The movie mood is a bit dark, and gloomy for the casual viewers. There is a double standard here with the sympathy the movie put on Hanna. I doubt if the film had a male SS guard who committed wartime atrocities, escaped justice for more than 20 years afterwards, and engaged in a borderline-abusive relationship with an underaged girl. It would be hard to pull off. Honestly, it's hard to feel sympathy for Hanna. I really doubt a lot of people wanted to feel sorry about a cold and unsympathetic Nazi. The ending was a bit awkward. I thought it would ended better if Michael didn't do to New York. Honestly, it's not one of those entertaining type movies. I think the sex scenes were alright. It portray sex as what it is. Romantic at times, awkward sometimes, and brutal at others. One thing, it fail to portray is the age different. It supposed to feel disturbing due to the fact that he's underage, but it doesn't. You never see that, as David Cross looks way older than 15 year old, and Hanna is somewhat of an attraction age. It was too tastefully done. Another fault is that the novel portrayed Hanna's illiteracy as a metaphor for generational illiteracy about the Holocaust, the film failed to convey those thematic overtones. Germany was a rather literate country in the 1930s and 1940s - and I don't think it explains very well people's willingness to join a group to slaughter people. After all, the Nazism weren't all un-education bigots. Many of them were doctors, scientist, teachers, and scholars. Most join because of self-worth and survivable. Many of them felt that they got wrong, over the loss of WWI and looking for revenge. I don't see why the Germans born after World War 2 have to feel guilty for their fore-fathers mistakes. It's like saying all Modern Americans should feel guilty for allowing slavery to happen in the past. Yes, its sucks that it happen, but they weren't even alive, during those events. The only person that should feel guilty for it, is those who live during the World War 2 timeline and knew about it, and didn't do anything to stop it. The movie feels like one big Vergangenheitsbewältigung guilt trip, anyways. Also the movie fails to portray the 1980s in the film. It felt like it was present day. There were some different in the film from the book. In the book, Michael contracts hepatitis and misses 3 months of school. In the movie he has scarlet fever. I guess, the sex scenes wouldn't be appealing to watch if he know that he has hepatitis. Another thing, missing is young Michael getting advice from his father. It really was needed to tie in the story of life with his normal family, and his life with Hanna. Overall: it was the complexity of human morality that made this watchable. Other than that, it wouldn't be that good.",8,0,0,3 May 2014
Jaws," A great watershed moment in the history of film. Jaws is prototypical summer blockbuster. Get out of the water and watch this film! It will take a bite out of you!
","Based on Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, Director Steven Spielberg's 1975 shark saga set the standard for the New Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water. Jaws was a mega blockbuster at the time, becoming the highest grossing film at that point and changed the way Hollywood release and marketed movie. Both the film and the novel was inspired by the historic event of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. The movie starts out with the infamous scene of a moonlight skinner dipper getting drag under the ocean. In the morning, the town of Amity Island finds out that she was attacked by a shark attack. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) orders Amity's beaches closed, but is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton), fearing it would hurt the summer tourism on which the town's economy is heavily dependent on. When the deaths continue to pile up, Brody brings in ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the killer Great White Shark once and for all. Quint is larger than life and even cartoonish because the story needs this character. Quint is the ring leader for the great 'Boys' adventure which is the turn this movie takes in the last third act of the movie and the best part. Quint, Brody, and Hooper. They laugh, they argue, they are tested, they bond, and it work. Robert Shaw does a great job in the role, and the whole USS Indianapolis speech was amazing. His overt bravado and Machismo was greatly needed to play counterpoint to Hooper's nebbishes. He is the story's Captain Ahab. It was one of the things they change from the novel. Another is cutting most of Benchley's many subplots, like Hooper having an affair with Brody's wife, which is great in my opinion. In my opinion, Richard Dreyfuss was the weakest of the three main characters. It was so unlike the character from the book. Still, Hooper should had the same ending as the novel. It was disappointing. I do like Roy Scheider as Brody. I love Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat.'. I just wish his fear of the open water was explain. It was generalized and non-specific to fit the expected fears of most of the audience. Brody is the everyman character so he must be most generalized, least brave throughout, least in control throughout. He does not become 'heroic' until he is finally all alone and must do whatever he can to kill the beast, which he does the vicarious triumph of the audience through him. The film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. Due to that, Spielberg rarely show the shark, until the third act. The shark instead is shown by camera point of view of the creature looming in the ocean or close shots of its fin. John Williams's orchestral theme, the creepiest since Herrmann's Psycho also plays a part. Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. The music gives it a pulsing heartbeat. It ramps up the tension from point to point and brings the film to higher and higher plateaus. Due to the lack of shark presence, so critics might say, this is the greatest B movie ever. I disagree. It's not a B movie. It's a movie that follows the same structure as B movies. B movies are not necessarily bad. They're cheap and they put the premise before character and plot development. The two things that separate Jaws from B movies are the deep characters and the insane budget. The writers cared so much for who the characters were that it could not be a B movie. I just recently saw the movie again and I am amazed how well it holds up. Spielberg was a master at showing his skill and awareness to story, setting and character. Then the art! There is a shot of Brody looking out the boat window while reflected in the glass is the yellow barrel being dragged out to sea by the monster shark. Brilliant! It is sublime in illustrating the magic and exhilaration of this great 'Boys' adventure! The reason why Jaws works as a good horror movie is because who can deny it? Great White Sharks have killed people in the past, and aren't creatures of morality. Great white sharks are apex predators. Their physiology and whole lives even are centered around killing. Nature can be scary and brutal; why not show it as it really is? Great White Sharks, although they are indeed misunderstood creatures who don't outrightly kill people for pleasure or even sport like humans do. They have been known to kill people under the perception that they have mistaken swimmers as wounded prey. Hence their attraction to loud noise and splashing. They are indeed a force of nature, but as humanity has learned time and time again, nature is a dangerous thing, and great white sharks are some of the most deadly the ocean has to offer. Some people got offended because it portray sharks in a bad light and help cause some species of sharks to be nearly extinct due to hunting. New studies have shown that the danger great white sharks pose to humans is greatly exaggerated and I agree, they are dangerous, but it's rare to have shark attacks. What isn't exaggerated is how popular the movie got after the released. Its spawn horrible sequels, and a few Universal Studios rides. In the end, Jaws is a pretty good horror movie. Filled with terror and adventure, Jaws continues to make new generations of fans afraid to go swimming. Let Jaws take a bite out of you!",9,7,13,7 July 2013
The Wrestler," If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen this movie. It's a great film.
","I've been a wrestling fan since the 1980's, so this movie came out. I was happy to see main stream America getting into it. Main Stream America still couldn't believe that these guys would, for example, mutilate themselves by 'blading' to have blood in matches or take dangerous 'bumps' stunts just to illusion violence in the ring. All these acts takes a ton on the body over the years, and 'the Wrestler' is a story of life imitates art. Mickey Rourke's character of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson mirrors the actor's life in many ways. Both were former stars who pushed their bodies to the limits in brutal fighting. Mickey Rourke quit acting for a while to try his hand in boxing. Randy 'The Ram' Robinson tries to quit wrestling, to try his luck with life. He befriends an aging stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and try to get back with his estranged adult daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Woods), but the proposing chance of a comeback 20th anniversary rematch against his most notable opponent, 'The Ayatollah' (Ernest Miller) is calling him back to the ring. Soon, Randy must choice the life of the ring or life outside of it. Randy the Ram, seems to be based on a combination of former wrestlers. Wrestlers Bret Hart and Chris Jericho's books both described the appeal of hanging out with strippers because of the similar lifestyle. Both careers are fantasy based as men are used to portray violence and strippers as sex for their clients. The movie also tackle the dark side of steroid abuse that has caused a laundry list of wrestler deaths in just the past 10 years as Randy use steroids. He use it to tries to fight against age and still look strong and young. Randy's visual look: A tanned bleached blond whom body went to hell might be wrestlers like Lex Luger or better yet Superstar Billy Graham. Lex Luger has both the ailing body and rock bottom financial situation. Randy's volatile relationship with his daughter were definite inspirations for screenwriter Robert Siegel by Jake 'The Snake' Robert's relationship with his daughter as shown in the documentary 'Beyond the Mat'. The speech by Randy to his fans borderlines Terry Funk's 1997 'retirement' in the documentary. Mickey takes the experiences of the wrestlers, along with his own and shapes a character that he was born to play. The part was originally written for Nicholas Cage, but I can't imagine anyone but Mickey Rourke playing this part. Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan claimed that the role was for him. Thank God, that was a lie. Mickey Rourke was always Darren Aronofsky's choice for the film. Mickey Rourke was brilliant in the role. I can believe that the character was lonely. We feel his pain, we relate to his shortcomings and we cheer him on to find love with Cassidy and rebuild the relationship with his daughter. 'The piece of meat' speech at the empty New Jersey boardwalk was just emotionally. The ending to this film is just as powerful. Not only did it save Mickey Rourke's career, but also as well the Director Darren Aronofsky after taking a body slam for his previous film 'The Fountain'. The music in the film was amazing to listen to. The Bruce Springsteen 'Wrestler' song is just boss. The movie and the song goes right to the heart. It's spot on beautiful. Now to the faults of the film. The film can be a bit of a downer and paint wrestling in a bad light. Randy's wrong doing is all his fault. You can't help asking yourself, is he that stupid? He can't help but self-destruct in a series of acts that would better his life. The editing is very choppy in parts, hand-held camera was bit shaky and some of the writing is almost unbearably cliché. I like the fact, the story arch has three acts process. I also like that a number of real life pro-wrestlers were feature in the film, as a fan boy, I found it very interesting. Some critics might hate this movie cause they were kinda hoping for a type of Rocky movie set in the world of wrestling, but the movie gave up to question kind of ending that makes you wonder what happen. I don't mind the drama with dark realism. Check it out, you will definitely find this movie worth it.",9,0,0,2 April 2013
Dark Shadows," Without a shadow of a doubt, this movie is a big pile of vampire bat guano
","I have sort of lost interest in Tim Burton's movie's as of late, as it's seems to follow the same patterns. It's a creepy adaptation that starts the same two actors. The problem with Tim Burton's adaptations is that he tries to force so much of his schtick onto something that's already proved capable of functioning without it. I love his earlier stuff, but this was the death nail to the coffin needed for Tim Burton to change his act such it's getting old. I think it's time to reassess how the director should make movies. First off, the Original 1966's Dark Shadows TV Show Series didn't have the biggest fan base in the world. It have its share of fans, but in no way does it have the same numbers of fans as other supernatural shows at the time, such as Dr. Who or Twilight Zone. Second off, this movie is so unlike the Original Dark Shadows, that fans of the original will probably not like it. The Dark Shadows TV show was a Soap Opera that had very few supernatural elements. For the most parts, the show dealt with normal soap plots. The show is pretty awful in my opinion. The only good thing from that show was actor Johnathan Frid as Barnabas Collins. He pretty much help save the show. His character wasn't supposed to be the hero, as he was pretty much the villainous character just like Angelique who cheats, lies, kidnaps, and torment people. It's not until later episode, does he become more human. In this modern version, Barnabas Collin is the brooding protagonist play by Johnny Depp who must protect his dysfunctional descendants from the evil curses of the witch known as Angelique (Eva Green) who killed his lover and turn him into a vampire. In no way, does Johnny Depp act like the callous, canny, somewhat unlikable man Jonathan Frid's version, but more like a goofball, charming, and pretty likable character who can't lie worth a dime. In the Jonathan Frid's version, he would probably kill Angelique if he ever finds a way. In this version, Johnny Depp spent most of the movie trying to get his family name back into business, wasting screen time with multiply sub-plots that go nowhere like turning himself back into human, or starting a canning company. There is no character development in him. It wasn't until toward the end, he get back to the main plot, with him finally fighting Angelique. There are scenes with other characters that isn't explain, misused or not well flesh out like David (Gulliver McGrath) seeing ghosts and never treated by the doctor or take care of the babysitter that supposes to be watching him. Another is how Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) a psychiatrist is able also to be a Hematologist as well. Yet again, Roger (Johnny Lee Miller) exile from the family has nothing to do with the plot. Last, Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz) twist was totally out-of-nowhere. How did nobody notice that when she was a baby. I would think baby would be care 24/7 so somebody would have notice. The movie does an horrible job of exposition, by having everything too rushed in the end. I didn't feel that much strong in building the love relationship between Victoria (Bella Heathcote) and the main character when Victoria was missing out in most of the film and the love interest seem forced in the end. The problem with Burton's film is it couldn't stick with a tone of the film. You either go full-on camp, or you go full-on comedy. The movie is supposed to be funny, then they threw seriously WTF dramatic moment into it, such in the case, like a girl getting electroshock therapy that more shocking than funny and women dying. It takes them out of the film. Dark Shadows also has too good of acting. If it had been like a parody, playing up the shot-live aspect or the terrible acting, then it could have worked. Remember this was written by Seth Grahame-Smith who wrote the screenplay for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and we all know how that film went. It felt like a fanboy film that try to stuff years and years of show materials into a 2 hour film. I do like some things. I loved the set designs. Interior of that manor was beautiful. The music choice was great. Danny Elfman is once again, great. The acting is great, even if wasted. I should mention Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother as she had the glue to the film. The production and make up is brilliant. Overall: this movie is worst than the 1970's House of Dark Shadows and the 1991's Dark Shadows TV Show. I would say, watch those first, before trying to watch this mess of a film. In the end, this movie is like the Twilight films. It's a big pile of vampire bat guano",5,7,11,13 June 2013
Kong: Skull Island," This Viet-Kong Monster Movie is not quite king, but it was entertaining. It could be, a little bit better.
","Sadly, this movie is not as iconic as the first movie. When first released in 1933, 'King Kong' broke all previous box-office records, becoming one of the very first blockbuster in film history. It was a phenomenal, influential landmark film that raised the bar for special effects for many decades. It was so good, that the film was remade, multiply times; most famous in 1976 and 2005, in lesser favor. In 2017, Merian C. Cooper's work was reboot, yet again, this time, very loosely with 'Kong: Skull Island'. While, both movies have the basic plot of a group of explorers going to a remote and exotic location, only to find out that, the island is home to many gigantic beasts, in which they must escape from. The movie directed by Jordan Vogt Roberts goes with a different vibe than the traditional plot of Hollywood filmmakers trying to film a movie. Instead, this film set in 1973, has a group of helicopter squadron pilots and group of scientists going to the island for a survey mission, only to find hell on world. In many ways, Skull Island serves as social commentary about the morals of the Vietnam War, with the American soldiers not quite understanding, who or what they're fighting for or with. Like the war in Vietnam, it's a world of hurt; with dragons like creatures acting like Communist 'Tunnel Rats', and King Kong as giant gorilla moral burden on their backs. Because of this, I felt that this movie is trying to be smarter than it looks, but it's trying too hard to appease to the general audiences with it's over the top, somewhat cartoony action that it lost some viewers, looking for something more sophistical in their B-Movie experience. Nevertheless, the movie still has many subtle sequences of this film, that still kinda work, but it just didn't click for me with, the sillier parts of the movie. Although, some comedy scenes are patch, awkwardly to horror & action. I do have to say, the movie does flow in an enjoyable paced. However, I just wish, the movie had a little more suspense with how they dealt with Kong, as I felt that they were delivering all their cards, way too early. Unlike director Gareth Edwards' 2014's film, 'Godzilla', Vogt-Roberts wastes little time introducing Kong. Much like the last remake, Kong was portrayed via motion capture, specifically by Terry Notary, whom previously did motion cap work on many various movies, including the Planet of the Apes rebooted films, with some assistance from Toby Kebbell whom is also part of the human cast as the character, Jack Chapman. However, Kong was missing a lot of elements that make Kong into a sympathetic tragic character. While, I'm glad, they didn't add the weird awkward love affair, Kong has for human females; I think the movie should had explain more, why a giant gorilla is protecting the tribe from the skull crawlers in the first place. As much, as I hate the originals for its savage portrayal of the island people; at least, those primitive versions have the tribe, do something for Kong; here not so much. Why is Kong allowing these freeloaders to live!? Also, how does an island have a self-containing storm, surrounding it, years long, yet the island hasn't caved in, due to having a hollow earth!? It doesn't add up. Film would, had work, better, without all of the BS science, mucho jumbo. Despite that, the movie was still beautiful shot and the CGI was great. Many of the sequences remind me of 1979's film 'Apocalypse Now', ranging from a psychedelic, napalm-scented, Helicopter carpet bombing to the 'Heart of Darkness' boat ride from hell. It's clear that the three screenwriters for this film, Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein & Derek Connolly were indeed fans of author Joseph Conrad & director Francis Ford Coppola's works. However, some parts of it, did go a little overboard with the writing, like how they portrayal Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). I get that, he's sees the fight with Kong as a way to justified his service for his country, due to the failure of the Vietnam War, but by 2017, the 'Crazy Vietnam Veteran', who was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder is way too much of a common stock character. It felt like Samuel L. Jackson playing as insane Samuel L. Jackson. Still, I had to give him, some credit, he stood out, more than the other characters in the film, like James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) & Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) whom I found forgettable. They weren't even acting right. There was no sense of fear, between these two actors. They encounter several dangerous exotic giant creatures, and they act like they were only minoring annoyed. It was crappy. The rest of the soldiers were a little more developed, but there was a little too many to remember, plus, they were quickly getting eliminated like a bunch of red suits. The only other character that kinda stood out, besides Colonel Packard, was John C. Reilly's character, Hank Marlow, an eccentric but wise and virtuous WWII pilot who spent 28 years stranded on Skull Island. He gave the movie, some of its greatest moments, besides the sound editing and the blood-pumping 1970s rock soundtrack. Even though the movie has no shortage of scary or violent moments, that borderline what PG-13 can show; I was a bit disappointed that there was no scenes in New York City in the second half. It was a bit strange. However, I did like the hints on the future movies, at the end of the post-credits. I can't wait for other Monsterverse, (Kaiju-based Shared Universe) to come out. Overall: Although, it was cheesy, clichés and absolutely terrible at parts. Warner Bros.' newest attempt at bringing back the King was alright. Worth seeing it in IMAX and 3D.",7,4,7,17 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," I know, I have no right to ask you this. But will you follow me, one last time? Sure- Thorin Oakenshield. It's worth checking out, one last time.
","I have mixed feelings about the final installment of the three part film adaptation of the Hobbit novel. I didn't think, it was a wise decision, to make the Hobbit novel into three separate films. 2012's The Hobbit: Unexpected Journey was a slow start, 2013's the Desolation of Smaug was a long drawn movie with lackluster cliffhanger, and this movie, Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was a bit anti-climax. Without spoiling too much, it's still probably the best film of the Hobbit film adaptation. Directed by Peter Jackson, the movie tells the story of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the Company of Dwarfs being forced to engage in a battle against an array of enemies trying to take away their gold. Now the Dwarfs must try keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the wrong hands, while also not losing themselves to selfish greed. Indeed, greed plays a big part of the film and it's kinda the film, downfall. Seeing a lot of armies fight over money, isn't the same as seeing lot of armies fighting for the fate of Middle Earth in 2003's Lord of the Ring: Return of the King. It's somewhat a shallow story about gold. The movie doesn't felt like there is much in stake. I really can't into the long repetitive battle scenes, because there is too little story to support it. It felt so endless and disconnect. It didn't even felt grand in scale, because the director put himself into a dilemma. He didn't want to make the battle seem as good as Lord of the Ring: Return of the King or 2002's Two Towers, because it would make his Lord of the Ring films look weaker to the Hobbit films. While, he did a lot of hard work, it just seems like he really didn't as much of a passion for these films as his Lord of the Ring films. He did these Hobbits films in sense of duty, since director Guillermo Del Toro drop out during pre-production. Somewhere in production; he lost his magic. It became more a call back to old Lord of the Rings films than its own movie. It's a huge problem that the LOTR films were made first, because anything not in that epic scale would look mediocre, compared to it. In many ways, this film looks that way. It's seem very cliché. While, he did add a few new things that kinda help the adaptation. A lots of it was just recycle sub-plots. Example are like King Thorin (Richard Armitage) going crazy AKA 'dragon sickness', over the gold. It's very similar to Gollum (Andy Serkis) downfall in the Lord of the Rings films. Then, you got the unneeded love affair between dwarf, Kíli (Aidan Turner) and elevan, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). It was very similar to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Arwen (Liv Tyler), love story arch. The White Council's role in saving Gandalf at Dol Guldur is also a Jackson invention. Wasn't needed, but it's a great foreshadowing to the Lord of the Rings films. One pointless scene was that of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) & Tauriel visiting Gundabad. It wasn't needed. I kinda wish the 144-minute running time pacing structure of the film was little more solid. The whole opening with Smaug (Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) should had been in the finale of the last movie. It felt odd to have it, here. Second, the battle timeframe. It's seem that it last for hours. How are these people able to do long speeches about fighting during the battles? You would think, all the people would be dead, already. It's also a bit odd, that the hundreds of Dwarfs, human and Elves were losing the battle, before 12 dwarfs came to the rescue. Are they really that weak? Third, the movie doesn't really show anything or anybody after the Battle of the Five Armies like the novel. Who control the Lonely Mountain? Who is the King of the Dwarfs, now? It's never resolved. Fourth- The Hobbit timeframe doesn't match well with Lord of the Rings. It's so confusing. Fifth- for a movie call the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins barely in this film. Most of the time, he just staring into space. He's get very lost in the many sub-plots. There are too many stories with not so memorable characters. The acting for the most part was pretty good, despite that. The special effects is a hit and miss. It gets a little CGI-heavy, with the film at times looking less like live-action and more like animation. The locations are beautiful, but it's lacking compare to the other films. Howard Shore's music is so-so. Not much, noting. Overall: I enjoy the film to a certain extent. I'm went there and back again. As the last Hobbit movie of the series. It kinda works. I enjoyed the film, and you might, too.",8,6,11,22 January 2015
Bring It On," Bring it on! I will defend this semi-dumb comedy film about the world of competitive cheerleading, any-day. It's a guilty pleasure of mine. It's pretty good for what it is.
","Yes, I know, a lot of critics might dislike this movie for its conventional and formulaic mid/late 1990s comedy sport film's plot of two rival school teams going head to head in the national championship, but I found this movie directed by Peyton Reed & written by Jessica Bendinger to be, unique enough to stand out on its own. One of the big changes, they did, was, not make the rival team, into stereotypical ruthless bully jocks. No, the team led by the Isis (Gabrielle Union), are mostly kind to their competitors, and don't really take, any short-cuts, in ruining the protagonist's chances of winning, even after they find out, that Torrance Shipman (Kristen Durst)'s team, stole their routine. It's kinda of a relief, because this movie could had gone badly, with the generic, 'good vs evil' clichÃ©s sport flick route. Nevertheless, I could do, without the rich vs poor class warfare, this movie was going for. In truth, San Diego & Los Angeles are surprising, not that far apart, both in numbers of the wealthy and the poor. Another thing, I would love to see, more diversity in both teams. Yes, there was a number of Hispanics & Asian-American in the Toro team, but the Clovers should had been more diverse than what we got. After all, East Compton has a surprising number of white people & plus, Hispanics make up, the majority of that city, based off the 2000 United States Census. Making the team, all African-Americans seem a bit stereotypical. Despite that, another thing, this film does so well, is have, all the actresses really trained for cheering, in order to avoid, the use of stunt doubles. They really do take, lot of difficult and risky move sets, so mad props to them, even if 80% of the dangerous dance/choreography, pyramids, stunting, and tumbling moves in this film are technically illegal & would end in disqualification, due to safety issues. I also love, how the filmmakers even involve physically mistakes in the film performance. It made the film kinda genuine, to see, our heroes still do mistakes, even in their greatest. I also like how charisma, humor, and personality shine through, with all the actresses. All of them, does a great job, both in acting and comedy chops. Lots of funny moments, throughout the film, such as 'Spirit Fingers' sequence & blooper reel, with actresses dancing and lip-sync to B*Witched's cover version of Toni Basil's 'Mickey'. Nevertheless, one thing, I had concern with this film, was the way, the filmmakers push the sexual aspects of cheerleading over the competition nature, a little too much. They should had ease up on the fanservice, a little bit. After all, they are still, underaged high school girls, and the high flying dance sequences should be compelling, enough. No need to make them, into sex symbols with the way too revealing outfits & men in horny little bastards. While, I didn't mind, the romantic subplot of Torrance getting co-captain, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku)'s brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford). It wasn't really needed for a film, like this. Still, it's surprising, a sport film like this, was even made. It really could had turn into a really bad in sexual objectification to the point, 'Bring it on' could be, like R-rated sex comedy like 1984's 'Gimme an 'F', or worst, adult film driven film like 1978's 'Debbie Does Dallas'. Far below, what I call, entertaining films. Nevertheless, the popularity of the first film, did allow sequels to be made, none of which contain any of the original cast members, nor any good with 2004's 'Bring It On Again', 2006's 'Bring It On: All or Nothing', 2007's 'Bring It On: In It to Win It', 2009's 'Bring It On: Fight to the Finish' and 2017's 'Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack'. For better or for worst, another thing, worth highlighting about 'Bring It On', is the exposure, it had, into bringing back street dance to the mainstream, after being, nearly forgotten, after flops like 1984's 'Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo' & 1985's 'Fast Forward'. It seems like, everybody in Hollywood was producing urban dance movies after this film. Not only that, but this film help inspire, other in-field, sport movie like- music competition such as 2002's 'Drumline' & 2006's 'Stick it'. If that isn't enough to lay claim, why this PG-13 movie is good. To a certain extent, 'Bring it on', also help increase the popularity in recent years to the point, that there is now an estimated 100,000 school team participants in cheerleading national competitions, throughout worldwide. That's really crazy! That's not counting the number of junior varsity teams, which some school has. Overall: 'Bring it on' deserve more credit than it got. It's a wonderful film. While, it's not the best sport comedy, out there. It's one worth cheering for!",6,3,6,26 October 2017
Inception," Inception will incepted you! You will thank it! It's one of the best movies ever!
","Inception is an intellectually stimulating and engaging sci-fi corporate espionage action movie. A great introspective drama about guilt, loss, and reconciliation. What's the most resilient parasite? It's an idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold in the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate -quotes the script. Inception directed by Christopher Nolan is a heist film in reverse; instead of taking something, one must extract and plant ideas in the subconscious through dreams. A great original concept movie. The movie seemed to invite the audience into its multi-layered dream and keep us there until the very end. Without spoiling too much, the movie felt like a dream, watching it. Like a dream, it's confusing and each one of us will draw individual conclusions and interpretations in order to try to make sense of it. The ending alone is up to debate, and there is no real, wrong answer there. We see the movie through the eyes of a team assembled by extractor Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his employer, Saito (Ken Watanabe). Their job is to perform an inception on Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). Many people believe that the main theme of the movie is the art of filmmaking, and create a new idea into somebody else's mind. It was no surprise that main character Leonardo DiCaprio does look a bit like Christopher Nolen. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the architect/screenwriter because she design the dreams. Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the producer/point man, the guy who knows how it all works, hints why he speaks almost exclusively in expository dialogue. Then there is actor/forger Eames (Tom Hardy) who can physically impersonate anyone. Then, last is Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is the special effects/chemist, who allows the dreams to happen. Without too much, nitpicking, the plot is the weakest, in the film. It's a bit too complex and make little to no sense. The main reason why Cobb is doing this inception is kinda drawn out in face value. His job has turned him into an international fugitive who can't return home to his family in the United States and Cobb see this as the only way to see his family. I know, he loves his children, but honestly, if only he just buy a plane ticket for them to visit him, overseas. The movie would be over, quicker. It doesn't help that he keeps an evil version of his ex-wife Mal (Marion Contillard), alive in his dreams, that tend to torture Cobb's mind and sabotages his work. Honestly, how is Cobb the best extractor? He seem to fail a lot at it. It's seem odd for Saito to hire a man that keeps failing. One thing, the movie couldn't get right is the dream mechanism, they set up. The movie spent the first half, explaining the dream mechanisms, and the second half, ignoring it: Such good example are like people showing other people's totems, architect showing the dream mazes, even when they mention, not to show the layout. Also, what is with the kicks in the movie!? Some motions are kicks, and others are not. Wouldn't an airplane be a bit too bumpy for Inception? Why not use the timers for such an importation job like this. Why doesn't water kicks work and don't work? The time within the dreams, doesn't make any sense as well, as people dream in different speeds. I think the movie would work better, if they told less about it. The movie doesn't need logic. It told too much, not enough show. Another big question is the movie's message. Honestly, the movie is about deceptive and manipulative methods. They are morally questionable, to say the least. The things, I love about the movie are the special and visual effects. The action is well-done. The awesome soundtrack by Han Zimmler is great to hear. 'Time' is my favorite song on there. I love how movie trailers now use the same BWOONG sound effect ever time. This movie really did influence a lot of filmmakers. The acting was amazing. It made stars out of Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The symbolism are great. Like how Yusuf is the Arabic form of 'Joseph', the Biblical figure from Genesis 37-50, who had the gift of interpreting dreams. Ariadne is from Greek mythology that help the hero get out of a maze. Fischer and Arthur might came from the Fisher's King myth. Great use of Penrose stairs indeed. Overall: Like, I said, the movie will not be able to answer all the questions, so interpretations are common here. I like how it makes you think, but still, entertaining enough for you to enjoy it.",9,3,6,29 May 2014
Lord of War," Nicolas Cage dodge a bullet here and made a really good important film.
","The movie is so deep and really talks about a relevant issue in today's world. It's not like other brainless action movies out there that has the good guys that use guns blasting away bad guys. Director Andrew Nicol is a genius indeed. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is not the hero nor the villain in this movie, he sell guns both to the good guys and the bad guys because it's good for business. It's a balancing act for the film, trying not to be too preaching, but also to be entertaining enough to be a really informative groundbreaking movie about the morality issues of having guns. The whole movie borderlines the saying 's It True That A Man Who Has Everything Has Nothing' with it's main character, Yuri. Nicolas Cage was great as always but his character was a little bit selfish & arrogant. Some people may hate his character too much to care about his story. Throughout the movie, everyone he loves is either dead by guns or he is dead to them. The only 'friends' he has now are his vile customers and his shadowy benefactors from the bigger more vulnerable merchants of death. Like the amazing life of the bullet opening of the movie, we see Yuri as a fast bullet type businessman going through piercing the heart of both his love ones such as his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) and wife (Bridget Moynahan) and those trying to destroy him like rival arm dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) and Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke). Jared Leto is great as Vitaly, a Jimmy Cricket's like character who serves as Yuri's conscience while suffering from yet another social issue: drugs. Bridget Moynahan gives her own, and delivers in what key scene in the buff no less. Ian Holm is chilling as the rival willing to do anything to be the top dog. Ethan Hawke is great as the pursuing boy scout with a code of honor to eliminate guns being sold. It was also funny how Yuri finds more elaborate ways of outwitting Jack Valentine throughout the film. The interrogation scene is one of the best. Key a eye on it, when watching. Still the image of the Interpol as an acting security agency is entirely fictional. Inspired by a true story, the movie go into great insight of world history with facts, by allow us the audiences to learn the in and outs of back-rooming arm-dealing during war conflicts. The locations were breath taking, and the strength of this film is the message its not just about guns, but also the fact we are a sad planet full of greedy homicidal people and if we don't change were going to become extinct. The ending is shocking, and I think it's importation for people to at less 'know that'. You might not like it, but the statement is true. Harsh critics of the movie will come to this point and find a way to ignored that fact due to feeling insulted. I find this habit of denial perhaps the most disturbing of humanity's flaws. It gets even scarier when you realize that you, yourself are guilty of it as a audience member cause you like watching violence movies. Humans are controlled by either greed or fear, and the movie shows that having firearms as inherently 'evil'. They have both given rise to oppression and birth to freedom. I guarantee you that people would still kill each other regardless if firearms exist or not. With that logic, sadly peace is really impossible. There will always be war and conflict as long as there is greed. Throughout the history of mankind its been this way. It's in man's nature to attempt to rule over one another, and by the end of Nicolas Cage little speech in the end. You would have to agree.",8,7,12,17 February 2013
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Great Insight of Life during the Korean War
","The film's title is the name of the pre-war flag of the People's Republic of Korea, the flag of the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea as well as the current flag of South Korea. Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War is one of those war films that no matter what's the ideology or cause, these soldiers are fighting to keep their love ones alive. The movie is the story of two brothers, shoe shiner Jin-Tae Lee (Jang Dong-gun) and his 18 year old student brother, Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) forced to fight in a war that both don't want to be in, when North Korea invades the South. Now the brothers are forced to fight along with each other, and later against each other as both men are tested by the horrors of war, and the deadly effects of it. The movie is very powerful and well done. Like other modern war drama, it's also reached a dramatic and tragic end. Its shows the true message about war. There are no winners in war, all that are forced to fight lead to nowhere, but self-destruction. The movie is a bit brutal, as there is no rest between the never ending violence and battle scenes in the film. When there are some rest, the movie turns the dramatic up to the point that the audiences watching this film still feels on edge. The movie is very gory, and there were some scenes that makes you want to look away due to its harsh realism of war. There were a bit of bad CGI, with the American Airplanes, but most of the action scene felt real. I feel it's a little too unrealistic when the brothers keep switching sides throughout the entire war from fighting with North Korea to South Korea and so for. I doubt that happened too often. Like I said before, there is no clear picture of whom good and who's evil. The movie is little about patriotism, as it is more about taking care of your family. Both nations are portray in gray with both armies doing many cruelty acts, that makes you wonder whom are we rooting for. The brothers characters are both equality flaw are both sink more and more into the madness of war. Still, the movie makes Jin-Tae Lee seek a little bit unstoppable. His bravery actions were kinda over the top, Rambo at times to the point, it lost it's realistic. He get a bit lost in the war. The other brother, Jin-Seok Lee developed from a young teenager into a harden soldier by the end of the film, but throughout the film, when something bad happens to him or his friends, he takes it out on his brother Jin-Tae Lee to the point where he can be a bit annoying. The supporting characters are introduce and kill off so quickly that they barely had any back story or development throughout the film. Honestly, I couldn't tell the different between them and the other background soldiers getting blown up, or killed off. Still, the movie has a good soundtrack and its opening and ending scenes reminds me of both, the films Saving Private Ryan and Letters of Iwo Jima. If you going to watch this film. I would choice to watch it with sub-titles rather than the English dub. My heart goes out to those anybody forced to fight in a war. This movie made me think a lot about war. Is war really necessary? So many blood-sheds and deaths of the innocent. When a war movie makes thinks about that. Then it's doing something right.",9,0,0,5 April 2013
Finding Dory," This fish-in-and-out of water tale is worth finding. It's quite the catch.
","The long-awaited sequel to Pixar's 2003 classic, 'Finding Nemo' has finally arrived. Did Finding Nemo really need a sequel? Probably not. But 'Finding Dory' deftly manages to breathe new life to a few recurring characters, while also introducing a school of lively newcomers as well. Directed by Andrew Stanton, once again. The film centers around, everyone's favorite forgetful blue tang, Dory (Voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) on her quest to find her parents. This film, in many ways, is about Dory trying to figure out who she is and restore her memory. So, the title does still fit in that finding her is the plot of the film, just not physically like the previous film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the first few sequences in the movie was a little bit boring, and somewhat repetitive. It really didn't get good, until Dory starts to recall memories of her long-lost family, being in the 'the jewel of Morro Bay, California'. It's here, where the movie become somewhat, funny, new and memorable, when the tone of the film, change from 'hero journey' ocean life edition, similar to 1995's 'Toy Story' to action pack, aquatic search and rescue, escape mission at a local aquarium, similar to 1999 & 2010's 'Toy Story 2 & 3'. I get how the movie was trying to say, with this. When the first movie was released, there was a spike in demand for tropical aquarium fish. This not only harmed wild populations, but many of the fish purchased died quickly due to improper care. This time around, Pixar may directly tell audiences that capturing wild fishes is wrong, and should, only be caught, if they require a lot of care, and they should be, released, as soon as they get better. In many ways, the filmmakers were following, the movement that 2013's documentary, 'Blackfish', set up for the care of aquatic life. The only problem with this plot, is how the fishes were going to get around. It's not, like they can jump from tank to tank. Plus, some of that water is not warm water or saltwater. It would literally, kill, the tropical fishes. Like the first movie, a number of unforgettable quirky side characters serves as tools or 'Ex Machina' to help them, on their way through some excessive obstacles. This includes, fun supporting characters, such as escape-artist, Hank the Octopus (Voiced by Ed O'Neill), Destiny the near-sighted, whale shark (Voiced by Kaitlin Olson), a bunch of laidback sea lions, Fluke & Rudder (Voiced by Idris Elba & Dominic West) and Bailey, the beluga whale (Voiced by Ty Burrell). This might be call, nitpicking, but, I surprise, how helpful, these creatures, are, to the fishes, they barely know. Wouldn't you think, that the seals, whales, and sharks would eat the fishes? Did they really had nothing else to do, than to help Dory get home? Also, like many octopi, Hank can survive for a short time outside of water, so long as he remains moist, but not for the extended periods shown in the film. That said, it's O'Neill's character who really steals the show. In a lot of ways, he fills for Albert Brooks's Marlin's role as the straight man, in service of Dory's comic. In many ways, I really didn't think, the original recurring characters of Nemo (Voiced by Hayden Rolence) and Marlin was even needed, as they really didn't add, much to the plot. Still, it was kinda cool to find out, that Alexander Gould (Nemo's original voice actor) provides the voice of the truck driver. Anyways, the new voice-actors here, really did their jobs, very well. As much, as I love them; my favorite has to be Sigourney Weaver, playing as herself. Whenever, you hear, her voice. It's like, hearing the voice of God. About the main lead, Ellen Degeneres, she's OK. However, her character comes across, a little more annoying, here than the original movie. Not only that, but her short-term memory loss in this film, is a little bit, too selection and random. I really don't believe, that's how anterograde amnesia, works, writers. It come across as fake and too unrealistic. It's like, Dory is being a huge malinger. Keep in mind, that all of those flashbacks, were a little distracting as well. As much, as I love Baby Dory, I really didn't like, how it cut back to the past, from the present, so much. It really disrupt the flow of the film and grew tedious as the movie went on. It also took away, so much of the mystery. In my opinion, I think the movie would had been, more emotional, if we didn't know, what happen to her parents. It might sound wrong, but I was really hoping, they were indeed gone like Marlin, said. It would be tragic, but sometimes, a message like that, need to be, said. Anyways, I though the whole car chase and reunited scene was a bit of a cop out, and little too over the top. Also, I did like the post-credit after scene. Still, this begs a Fridge Logic, though. How did they survive so long inside bags without food or a renewable source of oxygen? Despite that, of course, it goes without saying that Finding Dory is visually spectacular. Just when you thought the CGI couldn't look any better, Pixar's team went and raised the bar again with their latest offering. Plus, like the first movie, it has a great message about having to take chances and do something that we never thought we would be able to do. Also, just because someone has a disability doesn't mean they are a liability, and we should give them a chance and support them in their attempts to overcome their obstacles, not hold them back from doing so. In other words: keep on swimming. Overall: Finding Dory has big laughs and an even bigger heart. Very touching. A must watch. Highly recommended.",8,5,14,26 June 2016
Arrival," I finally arrive to my conclusion. This movie is thought-provoking, however parts of it was indeed lifeless and slow. It was a good movie, but not great.
","If we ever meet an advance race of aliens, we're going to have to explain why we've made thousands of movies of us fighting and killing them. Hopefully, they could see films like this, instead. It presents battle and war as last resorts, with only frightened, desperate people looking to violence as a solution. Directed by Denis Villenuve and written by Eric Heisserer, based on the short story 'Story of Your Life' by author Ted Chiang. The film tells the story of a linguistics expert, Louise Banks (Amy Adams) struggles to make first contact with extraterrestrial who arrive on earth, while as well, dealing with the death of her child. Without spoiling the movie, too much, like 1997's 'Contact' & 1977's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', this film is a deeply thoughtful sci-fi thriller about trying to communicate & understand with aliens rather than trying to fight them. Because of that, it teaches the message of being compassion and discovery, very well. There's also a message about time and choices that's better shown in the movie rather than ever explained here. Nevertheless, I will try to give you some scoop of some exposition. The film deals with Sapir–Whorf hypothesis or Whorfianism, a concept that linguistics and cognitive science believe in that states people perceive things differently depending on the language, we chose to learn and the culture in which, it is spoken. Sadly, the movie doesn't provide, many scenes of that, besides the 'use weapon' part. Also the film linguistics lecture exposition is not that compelling compare to the other previous films dealing with this, because it doesn't allow the learning scenes to be somewhat fun to watch. Every character's mood was dreary and morose. Every line delivered was monotone and monotonous. Don't get me wrong, I get that if aliens arrived, everybody on Earth would be scare of the unknown, but after a month or two of the aliens, not attacking you; you would think these people would lighten up. After all, the creatures are allowing you to speak to them, and you're learning more about them. One of the few things that I did not like about this film was the forced catalyst of xenophobia that was only there to move the plot along. I really hate how the film portray the Chinese as the unstable country, willing to go to war, because of a misunderstanding, with the aliens; when in reality, it's most likely us, Americans, because English is far more complex language to commutate with the aliens than Chinese. The reason, why I say this, is because China uses more ideographic and/or early mnemonic symbols to convey information yet were probably devoid of direct linguistic content. In theory, China should be more advance with their language, than us. Plus, if anything, alien arrival, would probably make human beings would probably be more unite than divide. While, Amy Adams plays a very strong, smart and intelligent female lead character. I found her to be, somewhat boring and too emotionless at times. Even the supporting characters like theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) & Colonel Weber (Forest Whittaker) were somewhat dull. All Ian really does, is exist to be a love-interest. His theoretical physics barely helps the plot, along, when it should. I would had tune out from the film, if it wasn't for, the curiosity of alien language. However, the film's alien language just doesn't add up, no matter how you put it. Being able to tell and work with time is a very valuable skill, but order to tell time, there are several key points to remember. Math is the universal language. The idea that the 'heptapods' don't know basic math, is hard to believe. It's not that possible to have advance society without such systems. In the short story, it's physics, instead of mathematics that the 'heptapods' don't get. It makes more sense, there, because they live in a world of Fermat's principle. Yet, in the film version, the language acts more like spiritualism than science. Despite that, I do have to say, I like the look of the creature. After all, the 'heptapods' species remind me of something out of 2003's animal documentary 'the Future is Wild', which states out that squids are the next sapient life on the planet Earth after human beings leave. I'm hoping that it is, where the filmmakers got the idea. I also like the look of their spaceships. Remind me of the Monolith from Arthur C. Clarke's 'Space Odyssey' series of novels and films. Even the way, the craft is curve, appears to look like a giant hematite birthstone. Terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments or by aqueous alteration, hints my squid theory. I like that is, drawing from the 1970s trippy smart sci-fi tradition, both in cinematography and music. However, I don't like that the film is drawing the plot out. Because of that, it made the movie feel very slow paced. It takes forever, to get anywhere. I think the reason, why this movie is so successful is because of the emotional parental guilt twist. It's actually really impressive, even if it's somewhat confusing with all the time paradoxes. Overall: It is a cerebral movie that will challenge your thinking. I would say it's a good movie, but maybe falls a little short from great.",8,3,11,20 November 2016
The Terminal," I finally watch it. Yes, this movie was worth the wait.
","Terminal: dying: affected by a fatal illness or condition that is approaching its final stages. This movie isn't that. The Terminal, to me, was a comical representation, presented with a serious almost adventurousness, of the Airline system. A foreign man play by Tom Hanks to come to America *for reasons known later*, was held up at an airport, as his small almost unknown made up country goes into a revolution which no one will acknowledge the country. This presents a problem for the foreigner. Since now that his country is gone, he can't be taken into America, for some odd paper work reasons forcing him to wait at the airport which really does seem realism at all. It's doesn't in any source. If you understand that silly odd plot line, you will find Tom Hanks's being told by those in charge tell him to wait, expecting him to leave. They want him to leave, where he will be someone else problem likely to pick up as an illegal alien. He doesn't, and proceeds to carry out his life in an airport. At first, he has a hard time surviving in the terminal leading him to risk going outside. The Terminal actually address some language issues between those who work at the airport and those traveling over seas as Viktor has a hard time speaking English. Then he gets an 'Under the Table' job at the terminal, makes some money, and feeds himself and makes the terminal his community. This makes it, a little bit more weird, and he falls in love with a flight attendant play Catherine Zeta Jones who is having an affair with a married man, (a complete DO NOT EVER DO) scenario, and that never works out in the end. I think this is the downside of the plot. The named situation of this is the girl the foreigner meets in the terminal. She is admitting causing an affair with a married man, and doesn't seems to want to stop. This is Hollywood writing all the way, and it very much disturbing. It really doesn't have anything to do with the other plot. On the good side, the Terminal has that rich blend of humor, emotion, and anticipation. The movie isn't much of an action thriller, but it has the attributes of an overall terrific movie. The humor of this movie was superb. A good laugh here and there, and the movie definitely does not overuse humor like a lot of movies do. Emotional twists are another strong point of this movie. Anticipation of the unknown created by these twists will keep you on your toes too. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, (9 to be exact) and Viktor finally gets out of the airport when the revolt is over and the last part of the movie is one of those emotional twist turns. In conclusion, the Terminal is an excellent movie just not as good as the other Spielberg's films.",7,3,5,1 October 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," I love The Shawshank Redemption. It's Awesome. Brooks was here. So was Andy and Red. I guess I just miss my friends.
","It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme ('End Titles' on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as 'fresh fish.' There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape' references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, 'I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie'. Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying.",9,0,0,30 June 2013
Rango," This isn't your average animated movie! Go Rango Go!
","Director Gore Verbinski once again teams up with his main star from Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) Johnny Depp, this time on his Animation Feature 'Rango'. Rango isn't your average animated film. It's nearly borderlines being an adult film with several mature themes that may go over kids' head. There is a lot of cursing, plenty of violence & killing, drinking and smoking. Somewhat racist jokes about the natives. So there is a lot that not for younger viewers. There are also positive messages about living up to your potential, defending those who are defenseless, and the importance of authority figures who do what's in their community's best interest instead of their own. The movie stars a lonely pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) seeking adventure suffering from an identity crisis whom becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert after his glass world crashed around him. While wandering the desert, he meets a desert iguana name Beans (Isla Fisher), a rancher's daughter, who takes him to Dirt, an Old West town populated by desert animals. Using swagger and creativeness to fit in, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named Rango. Sooner than later, the town mayor (Ned Beatty) ask Rango to become its sheriff, to help solve the drought crisis. What Rango finds is more complex than it seems. Now if you really want to make a comparison to other movies, watch Chinatown by Roman Polanski (1974). You'll see the similarities jump out at you, down to water being the pivotal part of the plot. The mayor may as well also be lifted directly from that movie. It's seems like Rango had some very interesting movie influences to its production. Not only Chinatown, but the name 'Rango' is similar to the name Francis Nero's 'Django' (1966). Other influences are Sergio Leone's The Dollars Trilogy like supporting characters such as Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) that looks and acts like Lee Van Cleef from the Good, Bad, and the Ugly (1966). I really loved Rattlesnake Jake. He had quite a bit of build-up, and when he appears. He was very intimidating. How many of you shivered when you saw him? But at the same time, he had a strong code of honor that I feel really sets it apart from other villains in animated films today. The Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant) was interesting, in the fact that looks like Clint Eastwood and sounds like him. My favorite movie influence was the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) references. Love the Hunter S. Thompson cameo. It was pretty trippy. The visuals outdo anything Pixar has done so far, and trust me I'm a big fan of Pixar. This movie is the first animated feature produced by Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects company that George Lucas create for Star Wars (1977) hints why you can see their logos in Easter eggs form. It's amazingly detailed. The CGI was breath taking, such examples are the way the light shines on the animal skins, the landscape, how the dirt was all over their clothes. Great voice cast from everybody, and a lot of funny moments. The humor is a hit or miss, for me. There were a few jokes that did fall flat on their faces, but for the most part, I thought it was just hilarious. I thought it was a nice blend of dark humor and drama, especially for a kid's flick. Sometimes, there are these moments when I wish for a Mariachi-band to follow my every step and accompany it with their music. The music by Hans Zimmer was awesome. Welcome Amigo by Rick Garcia and 'We ride' by Hans Zimmer are my favorites. Here is some of the faults of the film. The basically revolves around death, so it can be a bit, depressing. It's true, they were building up to a death. They said in the beginning, 'We're here to celebrate the life and untimely death of a hero.' In the end, you find out, something that isn't right with that statement. Still overall, would gladly pay to see this movie again. It's just one of kids movie, both children and adults can love.",8,0,0,28 April 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The plot of Birdman will flew over, most audience member's head, but the stunning visuals, great acting and clever dialogue, will kept some viewers, grounded.
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a really hard movie to define, but I'll do my best. Best way to describe it, would be: Judy Funnie. It's a very weird movie. It's a 'beat' generation film movie trying to survive, in a world of action special effects blockbusters and social media. The movie has everything that a beatnik would love. The rejection of received standards, innovations in style, use of illegal drugs, alternative sexualities, an interest in religion, a rejection of materialism, and explicit portrayals of the human condition under the background of cool Jazz. Directed, produce, and written by Alejandro González Iñárritu of 2006's Babel, fame. The movie tells the story of Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), has-been actor, trying to recapture fame by staging a new retelling of a classic Broadway dramatic play called 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' by author Raymond Carver. For him to triumph, he has to overcome all of his challenges; like a method Broadway actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who takes his acting craft way too seriously, family issues with his daughter, Samantha (Emma Stone) and his own personal demons. Will Riggan have a hit on his hands or will the play bombed? Watch the movie to find out! Anyways, without spoiling the movie, too much. The movie concept isn't anything new as it tells the story of comeback talent trying to resurgence his career. We seem movies like this before, in films like 2010's Black Swan & 2008's the Wrestler. The different between those and this, is the humor. This movie was indeed funny. Much of the charm for the film, comes from that. If it didn't had, that, this movie might not had work. Michael Keaton is great in the lead film. You really see, how much risk, Riggan's entire future rests on the success of this play. You really see Keaton synonymous of Riggans, because how much it mirrors Michael Keaton's real life drama. Like Riggan, Keaton was known best for playing superheroes like the Batman in the 1990s. Ever since then, he hasn't reach the success that he had, with those films. Like how Birdman haunt Riggan's mind; Batman somewhat does the same to Keaton. I can't see, anybody else for this role. For a movie call the Birdman, the movie focus way too much on supporting characters, like Samantha's love/hate relationship with Mike Shiner. I can do without that as it hurts the film structure. Its felt directionless at parts. Don't get me wrong, all the supporting cast is great. I love how much, a dick that Mike Shiner could be and Edward Norton is great in that role; but I really came to see this movie for Michael Keaton's role. I wish, the movie focus all of it, on him. The movie is also worth noting for its non-stop editing so as the movie appear to be, a single continuous shot through the use of long takes. It was pretty cool to see that. Remind me of 1948's Rope. The movie in many ways, was made for a Broadway play. I felt that, this movie would had work better in a theater settling, than a film. I'll tell you why. They are two different forms of entertainment, and both communicate differently, so when you forge one into the other, something is going to get lost in the translation. The movie was way too wordy. I was wishing for a more 'show' don't tell approach to the film. It doesn't allow the visuals to sink in. Even if it did, most of the visuals were too surreal to dream-like to make any sense. What does a comet, have to do with Riggan's career? Its random juxtaposition of dissociated image cinematography was a bit much and felt like jargon. The film's theme of illusion and reality, doesn't blend, well. Its message seem to fall apart, more and more, when the movie reach its final climax. In other films, this might be alright, but for a movie that has a Broadway play, feel. It needs a little more structure. At less, the movie didn't go, overboard with its special effects. Coming in, I thought, this film was a hollow superhero film about the cartoon series from the 1960s when I first heard of the title, but I was deeply surprise, how challenging, its examination of artistic integrity was. The movie dealt with ignorance for most of its run time. It has a strong satirical assault on what viewers should think of what is art, and what is entertainment. 'Look at how their eyes light up. People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullsh*t.' quote Birdman. I guess you can say that the movie serves as a critique of modern entertainment. I'll give the movie, credit, for that. Is this a smart art house film or dada like film? Does it purposely tricks the audience into thinking it is very intellect, when it's not. Is the movie very shallow, despite its symbolism like the drummer and the title superhero? It's really up to you. The movie bad mouths 'critics', because it wants people to be, more critical thinkers and think for themselves, than allowing the general masses to make the decision for them. Don't get me wrong, I will still state my opinion, but I give the movie, credit for showing that what critics say, shouldn't stop you from seeing or not seeing a movie. Overall: I didn't think this film was that great of a film, but the movie will indeed, win a few Academy Awards, when the time comes. The movie was a fantastic piece of acting and cinematography that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Story wise. I just wish, it was a little more tighten. It need a little more work. Still, worth checking out.",8,7,20,2 February 2015
The Big Short," The Big Short is a bit short of being a masterpiece for me. I felt like it was just alright.
","I have mixed feelings about this movie based on author Michael Lewis' non-fiction book of the same name. The reason why, is because it's might be, a little too loosely based on true events. While, the Big Short, definitely shows that the U.S housing market, was built on a house of cards. I felt like the movie directed by Adam McKay really doesn't go deep enough into the 2007 financial crisis, as it should. It puts all the financial blame on the evil bankers. Yes, bankers at the time, are too blame, and they are greedy, but the government at the time is just as bad. After all, it's the past, 3 presidential administrations that pressured banks to help poor people become homeowners. If anything, blame them, as well, movie. I also didn't like, how the movie doesn't even, address Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac, much. You would think, those two, would play a big factor in this film. Then, you got no mention of corruption in the Federal Reserve. Where was that? I was really hoping for this movie, to spill the beans. Sadly, it only scan the surface of the financial issue. Another thing that bug me, about this film, is the movie pacing. The pacing somewhat lose directions, at parts. I really don't get why the film love venturing into bizarre sub-stories, about having a fake eye, or a brother that commit suicide. It felt like filler. Don't get me wrong, it's nice that they're trying to build, character's backstory, here, but it wasn't really needed. All that fast cutting editing for these scenes, just made the film, more annoying, disorienting and frantic for me. I really didn't care about them. All, I wanted is the movie to examine the housing problem. That's all. I do like the how the movie have sequences in which, famous celebrities cameos like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain explain, more of the complex economic terms with more, flashy, quick-witted layman's terms. Just think, how more awesome, it could had been, if the movie got its original celebrity cameos in, like Scarlett Johansson, Beyonce, and rapper Jay Z. No matter what, some of the other humorous way of story-telling sequences, seem not to work as much as it should. I really didn't like how the artist, 'Ludicrous' rap music video was being mixed with scenes of Wall Streets. I'm sorry, I find his music, to be very awful. Another thing, I really don't understand, why there was a laugh-track, during the whole discussion about synthetic CDOs. Are we, supposed to find it, funny? I really don't get, what the message, was supposed to be, there. Another thing, I don't get, is the whole 'break the fourth wall' gags. It's a bit funny, at times, but I found them to be, somewhat distracting and jarring. While, are these people repeating lines!? It's too confusing. Another thing, that made me, dislike the film, a bit, is how, they made these investors seem like the heroes. Honestly, as much as the movie wants us, believe that these hedge fund investors have a moral code. In truth, these men, are not somebody to root for. After all, all the characters profit hugely as the housing economy crumbles in 2008 and really didn't do anything to stop it. They are just as much to blame, as the stockbrokers in Wall Street. These are not modern day 'Robin Hood and his merry men' fighting against the corrupt banks. They were in the scheme as much as the banks were. Just note, that Saints don't live in Park Ave, when watching this film. Despite that, the All-Star Cast did an alright performance. I found the characters in which they play; Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Charlie Geller (John Magaro), Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) & Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) all very interesting characters. What I don't like, about the characters, is how many of the real-life names were changed for this movie. It gives me, the impression that they're trying to hide something. Out of the four main characters, Michael Burry is the only character whose name wasn't changed for the movie and whom character seem like the real-life couther-part. The real Michael Burry spent a total of roughly 12 hours talking with actor Christian Bale for this role. For the most part, having seem real interviews with real Michael Burry; I believe Christian Bale master his behavioral traits, very well. As for the others, Steve Carell did met with Steve Eisman, the real-life person in which, his character was based on, however, his version of him, was a bit over the top preachy. The movie made him, seem like too-much like an activist for the righteous, when in truth, Eisman was once, indicted with allegations of inside trading, within his own company. It got so bad, that Eisman had left FrontPoint Partners in 2011 amid investor withdrawals. Another thing, it does not appear that Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt were in touch with Greg Lippmann and Ben Hockett, the real-life counterparts to their Big Short characters. If anything, I have a strong feeling that, these performances are not that accuracy to the real-life characters, as well. Also, where was the character of Meredith Whitney in this film? She predicted the demise of Citigroup and Bear Stearns, and was mention in the book, but she's nowhere to be found in this film. How come, they cut out her story? Another problem, is how, of the central supporting characters; only Michael Burry and Baum's employees are the ones that kept their real names. Why do they so differ from the source material? I have to say, after doing research for this film, I found the movie to only be 2/4 accuracy. That's not good. Overall: It's a fine movie. Just, a little flaw. Not a classic, but watchable.",7,3,4,30 January 2016
Halloween," Watching Halloween on Halloween- this movie is a sweet trick and treat flick for that day.
","Glad, this movie was call 'Halloween' then the original script title 'The Babysitter Murders'. 1978's Halloween is a pretty good low budget independent slasher horror film directed/scored by John Carpenter. It might be a little dated, but it's still pretty scary. Pretty realistic that something like this could happen. The film was very popular, and was the first installment in what became the Halloween franchise of sequels and reboots. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends. Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasanton) follows him to prevent him from killing. Like, I say before, Halloween is really low-budget. It was so low budget, it didn't bother even showing us the hospital, or much locations. When the film aired on television, Carpenter filmed 20 minutes of additional material scenes for the film mostly of the hospital where Myers was staying. Those scenes does that help plug a lot of plot-holes between the first movie and the second movie 1983's Halloween 2 like why he was stalking Laurie. Halloween would end up being one of the most profitable independent films to ever come out, and in my opinion, pretty much help the independent film movement getting established. Another thing, Halloween did inspired a long line of 1980's slasher films to follow it. While, it's not the first movie to use the POV camera angle of the perspective of the killer nor the first slasher film as 1974's Black Christmas, 1960's Peeping Tom and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) came before it. It did had some scary sadistic voyeurism moments. The opening shot was pretty intense, and well done in my opinion, but it did get carry away later in the film. Halloween did create the many several horror clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s. The movie help create the idea of the 'final girl' trope concept that specifically refers the final girl alive who is face to confront the killer. According to term, the final girl shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or virginal, or mostly avoids the vices of the victims (sex, illegal drug use, hedonistic lifestyle, etc.). There is a bit of misogyny and misandry sexual psychology terms in these types of films. If a woman shows any interested in sex. She will happen to die. If a man happens to be interested in women, he must be a serial killer, pervert or deranged. Men are always represented as deadly creatures in these films, hints why there is few final guys in horror films. Men can survive any threat, tossed at them, while women tend to be more violable. Only by becoming masculinized by the end of the film, the final girl is able to survive. By picking up a weapon, it shows that she has become a man as the weapon represent the male penis. In this film, I wouldn't call Laurie a saint. She wants to get with Ben Tramer, and also she did smoke weed, earlier in the film. She did had some girly damsel in distress confrontation moments and had some help against the killer with Dr. Samuel Loomis. So, I wouldn't say, she fit the final girl concept too well. This was Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, but I wouldn't call her a 'Scream Queen' because I felt that didn't express the fear that great in my opinion. While she can come off as a bit bland, she's still a good person who isn't a complete moron or tool, and that goes a long way with me. There seem to a bit of a strong connection to Halloween and Psycho. Both have characters in the film, name Samuel Loomis, the two killers happen to murder with knifes, and lastly, Jamie Lee Curtis happens to be the daughter of Janet Leigh, the main star of the Alfred Hitchcock film. Surprising, the film contains little graphic violence and gore. Still, there is a bit too much nudity that is a bit laughable as the writers had to find a way to get the supporting female characters to take their clothes off. The whole ghost scene was just awful and cheesy. Also, what type of babysitter allow her friends to have sex at her employer's house with children around? I also found it, disturbing that Lynda (P. J. Soles) wanted to rip the child's clothes off. The critics were kinda right, it felt a bit like hardcore porn. The children actors were OK, but they were never in any real danger. I thought it was a miss chance as Laurie could had find her bravery by trying to protect the children like any mother figure. The Shape was the best thing in the film. While, the original mask Don Post Emmett Kelly looks scary. The mask, they pick was creepy. I had to say, the pale white- William Shatner mask really does look scary when the actor playing the 'shape' tilt his head a couple of times as he was observing a corpse. The scene where The Shape seems to appear out of the darkness behind Laurie was amazing done. The score by Carpenter is pretty good, but it used way too much in the film, that it wear down its welcome, and became a bit annoying. The suspense was pretty long as most of the film has nearly nothing going on. The whole stalking thing in the beginning is intense, but a bit boring. Even the opening title credits went a bit too long. The ending cliff hanger was pretty perfect. It's like the saying, you can't kill evil; you can only survive it. Evil is ever presented and that's how every horror movie should end. That's why this film works.",8,9,14,31 October 2013
Wonder Woman," I kinda like this film. For the most part, this movie was mostly wonderful.
","The world's most famous female superhero has finally made it to the big screen & surprising, it was pretty good. It was sensational. Directed by Patty Jenkins & based on the DC Comics character of the same name by Dr. William Moulton Marston, the Warner Bros film exceeded all expectations with its well-made visual storytelling. Proving, once and for all, that a super-heroine film could work, with the right crew to bring it to life. Some critics goes as far, as calling it, the best DC Extended Universe film to date. Does this movie deserve all this praise? In my opinion, I believe, yes. The thought provoking themes that this movie, showed, with the moral dilemma of doing the greater good was very compelling. However, it's without a few nit picky flaws. While, for the most part, I found the idea of an ancient, warrior princess, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) fighting, against the Kaiser and his troops in the trenches of World War 1, interesting and unique. I do have to say, it does sounds like screenwriter, Allen Heinberg is trying to copy other comic studio's ideas, by having a story that combine the best things about Marvel's 2011's films, 'Thor' & 'Captain America: The First Avenger', together. Still, it does pull away, just enough to make this story seem like its own. However, the ending to that story, was a bit muddled, due to the fact, that DC felt that the presence of Ares, the god of war, was indeed needed and his corruption on humankind was truly taking place, during the course of the film. Without spoiling, too much, about it. I thought, the movie would have work, better, if Ares was truly gone & it was indeed, human beings that selfishly causing the war and violence, amount each other. It would be so much, more powerful message, than an ancient God subtly giving humans ideas and inspirations to kill each other. After all, it doesn't make sense, within the means of the story. In this film, they stated out, that the villain corrupted men, in order to help him, slew all his fellow gods and their human follows. If we're to believe, that all the ancient Gods are dead and the Amazons that were sworn to protect humankind is in hiding, then, why would Ares, have his armies, fight upon, each other, rather than invading the Amazons kingdom of Themyscira? The only clue, I have is, the fact, that he might do this, in hope, of finally wiping them out, of existence, but it does leave, the question, why. In the comics, Ares want to keep war, eternal, because he lives off, that. So, why in the film, is he whispering doomsday levels of destroyed ideas to Dr. Isabella Maru AKA Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) that would wipe the human race out and pave way to a new paradise? Also, deceptive master plan of keeping the peace, also doesn't add up, because it would killed, what makes him, 'him'. To add more wood on the fire, the whole temptation of Diana to kill humans, also doesn't make sense, too, seeing that she killed a large amount of them, before, meeting him. That whole clichés exchange of showing mercy felt a little to 1983's 'Return of the Jedi', for me. Despite that, I have little to no problem with the other story telling clichés, because they work so well. Still, if I have to nitpick, I believe the movie's opening, had a little too much of exposition dump. Starting your film, with a recurrence, only go back to an earlier memorable that include a history Greek mythology lesson, and a further flashback of stealing a diary might be, pushing it. However, I did find, other things, a bit annoying. The slow motion, unrealistic jumps and flips stunts from the Amazons, were a bit infuriating. Plus, the German villains, a bit too cartoony evil for my taste. Also, as a history buff. I found the fictionalized version of General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his fondness of steroid gas, kinda jarring, due to the lack of clarified to his character. I would had, like the film to explore, more of him and likewise, Scottish sharpshooter, Charlie (Ewen Bremner), because it seem like their subplot, during the action scenes seem a bit abandoned. Nevertheless, most of the action sequence, using CGI and practical, traditional special effects work out for me, even some parts of the film might be too gruesome for a PG-13 film. It's nice to see, a DC movie have action moments that, weren't all pitch dark. There were some color in this somewhat desaturated gritty film. The acting that came with this movie, for the most part, was also amazing, with Gal Galot and actor, Chris Pine standing out. These two, really have great chemistry with each other. It really did seem like the romantic elements, between their characters, could had happen. It also got emotional at times. The heartbreaking moments really did mean something. Still, the movie does have some light humor. I found the fish out of water jokes, funny. Even charming. Also, the music by composer, Rupert Gregson-Williams & Hans Zimmer was beautiful and intense to listen to. Overall: I have to say, this movie shows that Wonder Woman has come from a long way, from the days of being over sexual objectification and underused. I also love how the movie doesn't go too extreme on the other side, with it, coming off as misandristic. It really did find a balance with both the viewpoints of men & women. Because of that, I found myself, liking the movie for entertainment values, rather than hating it, because it takes one side. In the end, its shows in the box office, as both sexes are able to enjoy this movie. That's pretty swell. This movie will paved the way for more lead super-heroine projects for sure. Because of that, I highly recommended seeing this movie.",8,5,11,9 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film 'Paths of Glory' was indeed on the right path. It was a masterpiece.
","Like the tagline for this classic says, 'it explode in the no-man's land, where no picture ever dare crossed'. No wonder, why Kubrick's film was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry in 1992. It was a very memorable movie. Filmed in black and white and shot on location in Germany, the movie was based on the novel of the same name by author Humphrey Cobb tells the story of a French military lawyer and colonel, Dax (Kirk Douglas), having to defend a group of soldiers charge of cowardice in a life or death court martial case during the Great War. Without spoiling the motion picture too much, while the book is graphic and gory, told from multiple points of view, the film is indeed as bleak as it can be as well with its titular main character. Unlike 1930 'All Quiet on the Western Front' & 1937 war movies 'La Grand Illusion' which critique of the romantic idealization of duty only to show the violent battle scenes where countless waves of men are slaughter like cattle. This picture doesn't even bother painting any part of the war in a positive light. There is little to no camaraderie between soldiers and the officers see them as nothing, but cannon fodder. I kinda like that approach to the material, because having brotherhood within the military does undermine the whole anti-war message. Besides the mise-en-scene ending with soon to be Kubrick's wife, Susanne Christian singing 'The Faithful Hussar' & the snare drum in the beginning, the film has little to no music to force emotional feelings. You rarely see that in these types of movies at the time as everything has to sound epic & patriotic. Another great thing about this motion picture is the way, it was filmed. Kubrick's vision allows the audience to feel stuck and trapped along with the troops in the ever-so dangerous confined trenches with tight pov and close ups. We see the dirt, the mud and blood in detail. Also we don't see the enemy visual at all; making every scene on the front seem more haunting and suspenseful, because any minute, a soldier might get picked off by a sniper or artillery. As for scenes for high ranking officers like Major General Georges Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), we witness the opulently from both exterior and interior wide shots of the huge mansions in which they're living in. You see all the riches & grandeur. While this approach makes all the officers seem stereotypical like greedy elite aristocrats born into privilege with no knowledge of hardship. In truth, some of them were from the working class whom stumble upon power within the ranks through tough service like Brigadier General Paul Mireau (George Macready). They just lost their moral way while getting there. A heartless shallow of a man that war brewed and needs. A type of a person that Colonel Dax hopes not to turn out to become by the end of the film. Douglas acting in this, is astounding as his facial features show the dilemma, his character has to go with. You really do feel the struggle that he has to do his duty for his country, but also his wiliness to protect his men from unreasonable harm. Honestly, all the performers did a hell of a job. I think the director was a little too harsh on veteran actor Adolphe Menjou. He was fine. I doubt he needed to redo the same scene 17 times. The same can be same with the doomed men 'last meal' scene. It didn't need 68 takes. Stanley Kubrick was just being a semi jerk perfectionist. However, he did made the right choice with firing actor Timothy Carey. He was indeed disruptive as Pvt. Maurice Ferol. The whole faking his own kidnapping for personal publicity was outrageous uncalled for. Anyways, due to the movie's offensive critical assessment within the hierarchical military. The government from France & Switzerland banned the movie for almost twenty years following its release. The film was also withdrawn for many years within countries like Germany and Spain. Even in the United States, the motion picture was banned in military establishments, both at home and overseas, due to its content for some time. It was also denied an Academy Award nomination. Regardless, the fact that the movie has alienated a lot of audience members at the time. In the long run, the film loosely based on the true story of the Souain corporals affair during World War 1 has gain a strong following after Vietnam War era when together with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence within the post-war militarism lifestyle. It's now considered as one of Kubrick's best. I just glad that the director took the risk with making the film and didn't make it more commercial to the general public. The altered happy ending, they filmed could had ruin the message. The same with Paramount Pictures who proposed changing the army to that of Czarist Russia, due to being afraid of offending the French government. Thank goodness, the changes were reversed back more closely to the original novel at the demand of actor Kirk Douglas. In the end, he saw this movie for me. Despite some heavy handed moments, the film is a bombshell of a movie that needs to be seen. It's one path worth taken.",9,4,6,3 October 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Welcome to the Future-Oct. 21th, 2015. The time is now to watch, this sequel to the Back to the Future. This watch will indeed, be heavy, but also awesome!
","Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Bob Gale; 'Back to the Future Part 2' has everything to make this time travel trip, really fun to watch. However, its mediocre excuse of a monomyth journey feels a bit less intense than the first movie. In my opinion, trying to save yourself, from disappearing, seem like, a bigger conflict, than trying to save your children from jail time. Adding this lame reason for them, to travel in time, once again, seem, like the studios wanting the creators to capitalizing on the once stand-alone film, even if they didn't want to. Honestly, did, Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really need to take Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker (Elizabeth Shue) to the future, in an attempt to save his identical son from trouble? It seems like it would be, more troublesome, than helpful, because if Marty and Jennifer disappear, even temporarily from 1985, then events in the future would change until they return. As such, the future Marty and Jennifer shouldn't be there, and nor should their Michael J Fox-alike offspring. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, most of their most pivotal story has clearly been done in the first movie. So, there wasn't much to work with, to launch this new adventure. However, the series a complications involving a sports almanac is by far, the best part of the film, but also the most stressful to understand. It's time-travel paradoxes like these that make the film, so-so confusing, compare to the first movie's story. Trying to understand the logical of all the time travel plot-holes, surrounding this, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Trust me. However, it's so thought-provoking in its science, that it's fun to debate, all the mind-blowing actions, later on. Just, not, when you're watching the movie, for the first time. Filmed back-to-back with its sequel, 1990's 'Back to the Future Part III'. The movie visuals effects are breath-taking. I love, how the film's version of 2015, looks like, something like World Fair 'visions of the future', exhibit. It has the right amount of 1980s nostalgia cheese mixed with Sci-Fiction elements to make it, fun to look at. On the other hand, the Hill Valley of alternative 1985 with its punk-rock dystopia look, wasn't much, different from the Hill Valley of the 1985. Maybe, more work, could had been done to make it, look so much wore-down. I do like, how the movie recall 1955, back into the plot as well. It's nice to see, the characters trying to avoid, their previous selves. For the most part, all the actors that return from the first movie, were great in their roles. Still, it's really hard to take, some of the actors, seriously, when they playing multi-roles. Honestly, are we supposed to believe that Michael J. Fox is also playing Marty's future daughter!? Come on! That's stretching the uncanny gene pool too much. Still, I like the chemistry between Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd in this. Both show, this father/son relationship that I love from these films. Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is amazing. He's one of my favorite villains of all-time. I like that Lea Thompson is back in this, but I wish, she had more to do, then wear- old make up. However, two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, did not return. Claudia Wells didn't return as Jennifer, due to family issues. Glover didn't return, due to conflicts with the studios and the creators. His character, George McFly, was not only minimized in the plot, but was obscured and recreated with another actor. Another actors worth checking out in the film, are Elijah Woods, Flea, Jason Scott Lee, and Billy Zane. So look out for them. One thing that bother some people about this film is the Hoverboard hoax. Zemeckis once said that the hoverboards were real, yet not released to the public, due to parental complaints regarding safety. A number of people thought Zemeckis was telling the truth and requested them at toy stores at the time. While, as of this writing, hoverboards has yet to be invented. It's still, possible for it to come, within the next 10 years. Other aspects of the depiction of the future had not come to pass by 2015, but efforts were made to replicate the technology advances such as flying cars, and self-typing shoes. However, the film did correctly predict a number of technological and sociological changes that occurred by 2015, including: the rise of ubiquitous cameras; unmanned drones for mundane tasks; flat panel, widescreen television sets mounted on walls with multiple channel viewing; video chat systems; hands-free video game systems; wearable technology; and head-mounted displays. Anyways, still synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. While, this movie had great action scenes. The movie isn't my favorite, when it comes to that. The ending was a bit, anti-climax. However, one thing, I wish, the movie didn't show, at the first showings are previews of Back to the Future Part 3, coming soon at theaters. Thanks for no spoiler warning, Robert Zemeckis. Still, there is one thing that people can agree on, is the music by Alan Silvestri. It's emotional, epic and intense music. While, it's a recall music from the 1st movie. I do love, the little bits, they add, to make it sound new. I like how this movie create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. Overall: Back to the Future 2, has stood the test of time. It's worth your time watching!",8,5,8,21 October 2015
The Queen," God saved the Queen. No, God save me from this movie! This movie is so boring.
","I know a lot of people and critics like this film; after all, The Queen was the most critically acclaimed film of 2006. Good for them, but in my opinion, this movie was no crown jewel. It was indeed well-production, and well-acted, but I have to go against the masses for this and prove to its fan base, that it's not as good as they say, it is. Directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, the movie felt very lackluster. First off, this movie wasn't really about the queen, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren). It was a story about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and how the British Royal family's response to her death. From all the captivating things, that the movie could had gone with, like showcasing Queen Elizabeth II's life, from her time serving in World War 2, to her rise as queen in the 1950s, the end of the British Empire, the Falklands conflict, and others. They choose the more popular Princess Diana over most of her life story. Honestly, you would think a movie, depicting the death of Diana, would be interesting story, but this movie was a huge disappointment. It felt like very British soap opera without much going on, except people talking and talking. It couldn't be a problem, if the movie dialogue wasn't so dull. I know, a lot of people says that the movie has some witty humorous jokes, but I don't see any of it, and if I did, I didn't find myself, laughing at all. The movie only charm, comes from Michael Sheen as British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It's nice to see him in the role, once again, after playing him in 2003's TV movie, The Deal. He did so well, that once again in 2010, he played Tony Blair in the TV film: The Special Relationship. I think the movie did, kinda focus way too much of him. After all, the movie is supposed to be, about Queen Elizabeth II. Like Michael Sheen, Helen Mirren play Queen Elizabeth II in previous roles as well. She has a long history of playing major royal figures, and with this role, she made it seem majestic and regal. Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II is well-acted. She deserve the Oscar Award for Best Actress. My problem with the film is how unlikeable, they make the Queen, seem. Mirren played the Queen as the same stereotypical, dowdy, dry monarch that many perceive. The Queen might seem stuffy, but so are millions of other people her age, but Queen Elizabeth II is actually very much in touch with her people than what it seem. She does have a sense of humor. Let's remember she was cool about being portray, jumping off an airplane with James Bond in 2012's Olympic Games opening. She's not hiding in some castle, somewhere, most of the time. She was a pretty active leader and more into the times than it seem. She simply made a mistake in 1997 that she didn't understand, what to expect. I think the movie paint Princess Diana, too much as saint-like, making it harder to understand why Queen Elizabeth was so against her. Maybe, if they explore, more of Diana's wild faults and how her actions hurt the Royal family, maybe the audience would feel more about the Queen's tough decision. Since, they don't, it makes it seem like the Queen, was just cold hearted and stubborn to everything about Princess Diana, because she wanted to be, and cowardly hypocrisy caved in, when her power seem like it was going to be taken away. These actions doesn't make a great watch. The movie conflict is very weak. I like how the movie makes it seem, like Queen Elizabeth was going to lose her crown, if she didn't give Diana a public funeral. I really doubt that. It's not like the Royal Family was that arrogant as they were portray in the film! People getting mad, because the royal family chose to grief in private, rather than public seem overdramatic. It was a minor problem that people took too serious. Wasn't there deeper and bigger issues that most Englishmen had to worry about, in 1997, like 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland?! Why couldn't the movie be about that? How the Good Friday Agreement stop the conflict and the killings! Anyways, the movie pacing is really slow for a short movie. It takes forever to get anywhere. It didn't help that the shots of the film were nearly the same. Same locations after another. It felt like nothing is moving. The cinematography was nothing special. I know the movie was trying to go, somewhere with the stag symbolism, but its message seem lost. It could represented how capitalism is shooting down 'monarchy', but who knows. For a 'monarchy' movie, it needed to be grand, and sadly, it didn't felt that way. It felt very low-budget. As for the movie's content and production value, it felt more like a TV movie. It felt like something that the BBC would aired, one night. After all, the funeral was very theatre like staged, with people showcasing their grief to the public. Maybe, the movie could had told the different between the real life heartache to death behind closed doors, compare to those acted upon of the public eyes. The film could had taken on the issue of media coverage of tragedy, and show how, a real public victims really has no privately, anymore. Sadly, it's not there. The movie really tries hard to connect the real life television news footage, with the actors, but it comes across as messy and not smooth. I hardly remember, the score of the film. Overall: Not a great-watch. The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided and boring. Wish I enjoyed it as much as others, but that didn't happen.",6,4,6,5 February 2015
Raging Bull," Rage on! Raging Bull is a masterpiece. A very unique and entertaining watch.
","After finishing reading boxer, Jake LaMotta's memoir, 'Raging Bull: My Story', I have to say the movie adaptation of this emotionally story of a self-destructive boxer, Jake LaMotta's (Robert De Niro) journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, and but also hurt his private life outside it, is a brilliant black and white bio-pic. It's crude, harsh, and shocking – with its use of violence and adult-driven profanity though not as shocking as in an earlier draft of the screenplay by screenwriters, Paul Schrader & Mardik Martin, which show a lot more of Jake's bad side. Some good examples are when Jake is seen kicking and punching, a pregnant woman. Another one, not explained in the film, is the fact that La Motta had been a petty criminal, during his teen years, and he only learned boxing while in reform school. During much of his boxing career, Jake often feared that the law enforcement would be found out that he killed a local bookie during a failed robbery attempt, and he believed that he would 'pay for' what he did, one way or another. La Motta would later, find out later in his boxing career, he had badly hurt the bookie, but didn't killed him. Nevertheless, I think the part of his story would had made the film, so much better. Despite that, most of the film changes does work, such as La Motta's fights, removal of La Motta's father, and the reduction of organized crime's role in the story. One of the better changes, was the merger of the characters of La Motta's friend, Pete Savage with that of his brother, Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci). Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is also well-shot. I love the use of slow moment in the black and white principal photography. I like how each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style. The fight scenes are very impressionistic. Even the color scenes were fine. I love how La Motta's color family home movies, really look real & personally. Just the fact, that these sequences were personally scraped by Martin Scorsese with a coat-hanger to ensure a rough, naturalistic feeling, made the film, so much better. I love how Scorsese seems to have lifted the film's distinctive look and feel directly from La Motta's autobiography. However, I glad Martin didn't follow with La Motta's style in which this movie was to be played for him. After all, La Motta's idea of jerky movements, with huge gaps. A string of poorly lit sequences, some of them with no beginning and some with no end with no musical score would be a little too unwatchable. Instead, the movie is well-paced, well shot, and has tons of beautiful classical music from 19th century, composer Pietro Mascagni and 1940/1950s jukebox. In my opinion, I think, it's one of Martin Scorsese's greatest movies. It's surprising to hear today, that this movie was almost the director's last movie. After nearly dying from a drug overdose in the 1970s, Scorsese agreed to make the film for Robert De Niro's sake. Not only did, this movie save Martin's own life but also to save what remained of his career. It really did redeem the director's life. Talking about career changing. This film almost made Robert De Niro into a bigger star. Preparation for his boxing role, Robert De Niro went through extensive physical training, then entered in three genuine Brooklyn boxing matches, just show how well-trained, he got. Surprising, De Niro won two of the bouts. If that wasn't enough, Robert De Niro is infamous for this film, for gained a record 60 pounds to play the older Jake LaMotta. What a remarkable performance from him. Even supporting actors like Joe Pesci did well. This was a breakout role for Pesci, a singer, comedian, and former child-actor. He had been in only one film before this, and nearly decided to quit acting before he was asked to play Joey. It pretty much, save Joe Pesci's career. Overall: Raging Bull had cemented its reputation as a modern classic, both with the critics and with general audiences. The use of gorgeous black-and-white photography mixed with great acting continue to evoke viewers even today's world. It's a must-watch for anybody who loves movies.",9,5,8,13 March 2016
The Iron Giant," This animation movie deserves a giant applause! It was a great film, with hardly any sign of rust!
","It's sad, that this animated movie was not a huge hit, when it came out in 1999, due to poor-marketing. Nevertheless, as time, with on, 'The Iron Giant' has grown widespread critical acclaim from both critics and audiences for its out of this world story about an friendship between, a 50-feet alien robot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & a young boy, Hogarth Hughes (Voiced by Eli Mariethal) in a rural part of Maine; while, an over paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley (Voiced by Christopher McDonald) tries to hunt them, down, fearing that the giant could be dangerous. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while some of the plot-points does sound a little too familiar, as if it's ripping off, 1982's 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the first half. I have to say, the story in the second half, is still unique enough to stand out on its own. The movie has a lot of strong themes that films like 'E.T' doesn't deal with, such as an anti-nuclear war message. I like how the Giant has to deal with his inner conflict as a doomsday weapon; similar to how humans have to deal with the destructiveness nature of themselves, during the Cold War. Somber scenes like when, Iron Giant & Hogarth greets the deer, really does show, the good of humanity, and how, losing our humanity, makes us, into cold-blooded machine, like the hunters, later in that moment. However, it's not, all gloom and doom, as there is also an equally satire funny side to the film's anti-war message, with Agent Mansley, acting upon violence, without thinking or getting to know, the other side. It gave us, some of the best moments like the mitt phone call to general, Shannon Rogard (Voiced by John Mahoney) or landside ice cream scenes. Also, the child-like, interaction, between Hogarth & the Iron Giant was equally as fun to watch. The diving scene, alone, makes this film, worth seeing. Regardless, of the tone of the film, the movie really does capture the era, full of panic, fear and anxiety as leading politicians and the media whipped the public into an escalating mass frenzy, over Nuclear War with the Soviets, in both satirical and serious ways. It's a film, both children and adults would love. Yet, there is some things, that people might not, like, about this film, such in the case that the story of the movie bears very little resemblance to author, Ted Hughes's novel, 'the Iron Man', in which, it loosely based on. Not only is the settling change from United Kingdom, to United States, but the film also, cut, most of the fantasy parts, such as the battle with the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon. Another thing, that the film cut, was the fact that the giant robot was a harmony of the spheres whom keeps the cosmos in balance, by singing in the ocean. Because of this change from siren to alien robot, the original producer, guitarist Pete Townshend, from the rock band, 'The Who', instead, chose to release a rock opera adaptation, 'The Iron Man: A Musical', in 1989. Regardless, of the changes, the movie still has amazing soundtrack by composer, Michael Kamen. Great use of collection of Bernard Hermann cues from 50's and 60's sci-fi films. Not only that, but wonderful voice acting from everybody in this film, ranging with Jennifer Aniston as the mom, Annie to supporting voice actors like Harry Connick Jr. as dead-on, beatnik, Dean McCoppin. Another great thing, about this movie is the animation. I love how director/animator, Brad Bird and his crew, blend the CGI Giant with hand-drawn Norman Rockwell, mixed with 1950s illustration so well. Everything looks and feels the era. It really does mesh. Even the pacing for 'the Iron Giant' was, well-done. However, I don't think, the signature edition is the best version of the movie. The once delete scenes of Annie & Dean, talking in the diner, doesn't really add much, as we see them, interact, later in the film. Another thing, I don't like, about this version is the dream sequence. It really ruins, the mystique of the Giant, by revealing, too early that he is a doomsday weapon. I really don't like, how jarring, it is. I would, rather have the fight in the junkyard, instead. It's a little stronger, as it has weight, due to Giant, nearly killing the person, he love, due to his programming. It makes the climactic, tear-jerking ending, a little more powerful. Don't get me wrong, I still think the Signature Edition is a good version to have, if you're a mega fan, but if you haven't seen the movie, just watch the original theatrical cut of the movie. Overall: I like how this film is picking up in popularity, due to the film's director, going on to direct, other animation hits like Disney's 2004's 'The Incredibles' & 2007's 'Ratatouille'. While, it's still not a household name. I think, with each new generation. Both children and adults will come to love, this film for its creativity, comedy and heart. It's highly recommended. An animation classic & masterpiece.",8,3,5,25 July 2017
Straight Outta Compton," You're now about, to witness the strength of street knowledge and you will love it. Straight Outta Compton was a pretty good movie
","The subject matter inherent in most gangsta raps, has always caused a great deal of controversy of the years. Criticism against the genre, has always accused it as a foul way of promoting crime, street gangs violence, disregarding law enforcement, profanity, misogyny, homophobia, racism, drug abuse, etc. etc to today's youth. I can understand, their concerns, but clearly, I feel like, music like that, has always been unfair singled out, because how often the music reflects, the reactions of deep problems within urban society not being addressed or resolved, within those in power. While, it's alright that some people can condemned the genre; it's also, alright that a lot of people see it, as a way, to protest or address the several civil injustices within America and its dealing with race relations. Like the late 1980s, where the genre gain a lot of steam, many in the present day seem hungry for a smart look, direct or indirect, at the black experience and race relations today or at least in recent history. It's no wonder, why this movie became an internet sensation, even before it's released. People want an outlet! People want to see people rise up, against the system, and tells how things, really are. Directed by F. Gary Gray, this biographical drama film, tells the story of one of gangsta rap's most famous hip hop groups, the N.W.A. from their rise from Compton to their fall from the Billboard charts. Borrowing its title from the name of the group's 1988 debut studio album, the movie follows, the same often popular music theme biopic film clichés. Still, it does delivered something new, by presenting and addressing a more relatable topic that been in the news as of late, which is the relationship between black communities and mostly white police. This is by far, the movie's greatest hooking point, and the reason why this movie made so much, money. While, yes, the inner-money struggles of the rappers, might be engaging to a point; in my opinion, the majority of people, probably coming in, are more likely to relate to the group's 'F*** the Police' message, than anything else, that the film is delivering. After all, it's not like these rappers, are as popular as they were in the early 1990s; while yes, they still have their cult-following and, still able to sport some main stream status, but majority of their music skills has somewhat died down. Ice Cube became more of actor than an artist; Dr. Dre does more backseat-producing than anything else, and Easy E, well, we know what happen to him. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have a great cast, and the actors chosen to portray these real-life men were amazing. O'Shea Jackson Jr as Ice Cube was a near-mirror image of that of his father. Corey Hawkins really look and act, the part. While, Eazy-E's son, Lil Eazy-E didn't get the role, Jason Mitchell, who portrays his father in the film, really looks the part. Still, while, the movie is technically about the rap group, it's more popular message about police brutality and racial profiling, outshine the inner dramas of the group or the group's music. The movie rarely focus the songs, if any. The film play small bits of it, but the majority of the music use in the film, comes from later albums that, each member of the NWA did, on their own time, when separate from the group. It's nice to see the inner-working of other studios such as Death Row, and the Bomb Squad, but it's has little to do, with the overall N.W.A story-arch. The movie focus more on the three members being apart, than the group, being together. It doesn't hurt the film, but it's somewhat noticeable. For those wondering how accurate the movie is, to real life, the answer is that, despite Hollywood injecting some of its flair into it, it's mostly a true-to-life. There were some changes, such as how the 1989's events in Detroit, really play out and how certain popular rappers were introduce, but the majority, is the same. Sadly, the whole 'Bye Felicia' one of the most famous scenes in the film, was totally fake. The supporting cast for this movie was pretty good, as well. Despite, looking odd with the dye white hair, Paul Giamatti as the group's music producer, Jerry Heller was alright for the most part. R. Marcos Taylor as the sinister Suge Knight, was just crazy. I really hope, to see more from this actor in future films. One thing, that the movie loves to do, is have cameos. Don't be surprised, if you see, actors portraying real-life rappers such as Snoop Dog, Tupac, Public Enemy, and others have some small screen time, in this film, even if they don't really connect with the main story. Even at one point, the script, call a scene between Dr. Dre meeting Eminem. However, the script was changed, at the last second. The movie pacing is pretty good. It never felt long. Overall: While, this movie has strong language throughout, strong sexuality/nudity, violence, and drug use that might turn away, some viewers. For me, it's was very enjoyable. By far, one of the better hip-hop biopics, I have saw, and I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but it is must-watch for any NWA fan. You will like it.",8,11,42,17 August 2015
X-Men: First Class," X marks the spot
","This movie is hard to say if it's a prequel or reboot when the movie opening is similar or the same with that of the first X-Men 2000 movie. At first glance, it can be confusing as it looks like the audience is watching that movie. Erik Lesherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbasser) seek for the death of Klaus Schmidt aka Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) for the death of his mother during the Holocaust. It takes him forever to find the right time to kill him and the movie fails to connect the dots between what happen to him from childhood to adulthood. Due to the film absenting much of his past, the audience is to believe through flashbacks that he suffers from harsh experiments by Shaw or that he went to work for him, but deep inside wanted to kill him. What ever happen, 1962 Magneto is now on a hunt for Shaw. Michael Fassbasser is brilliant in the role, as he able to speak Spanish, French, English, & German very clear, unlike Kevin Bacon whom Russian and German doesn't match what's coming out of his mouth. Still Michael's voice spokes different between him speaking a foreign language to that or English. His English is in a higher pitch. Michael is able to act in a sinister matter without speaking, and able to portray a man in rage. Magneto soon become a good friend with Charles Xavier aka Professor X (James McAvoy) on his quest when Xavier save his life. McAvoy was able to portray a new light of Charles as a smart young sexed up, self-serving man while having the selfless, egoless good for mankind ideas. Sooner than later, these two men would end up being enemies as both men have different views of life and revenge. Professor X is against murder despite him trying to kill a character later on the film, and him knowing Magneto kill people in the past. There wasn't a hero to really follow and get behind. Fans are not supposed to firmly get behind Professor X or Magneto as they are supposed to see both of their points of view and be a little conflicted. Then with shape-shifter Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Mystique was never a good person; she was always a manipulative borderline sociopathic monster. But in this one she was one of the good guys despite she was friends with Charles since childhood but totally abandons him paralyzed. Jennifer Lawrence just seems awkward in the role, due to the make-up and CGI being not that good. In some scenes where she changing her form; the body and face doesn't match. She willing to hit on the male leads, as well as supporting character Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast. The actor looks awkward in the Beast form. The Beast's make up and suit was just not menacing enough. It needed more build to it to make Beast look strong. Charles and Eric go off to find other mutants to join their team against Shaw and his group whom trying to start World War 3 between Russia and USA using real life events such as Cuba Missile Crisis. They got CIA officer MacTaggert, Banshee, Darwin, Havok and nearly got Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Wolverine would only have the only curse word in the movie. Having Wolverine introduced in the film was to bring the comic fans and fans of the previous films to see the movie, but having Darwin introduced just to be used to be killed off. As for most of the other characters they were only present so the film could demonstrate various powers using today's special effects. Banshee, Havok, etc were nothing but cardboard cutouts. They had no character development what so ever, they were there simply to look cool. Shaw's group made out of Riptide, Angel, Azazel continues to create chaos while Shaw's strongest member Emma Frost (January Jones) put the final touches to the plan, getting the Russians to move their missiles to Cuba. January Jones's Emma Frost isn't much of a character, but more like eye candy. She wears skimpy to no clothes during the film. She gives nothing to the role, like Kevin Bacon gives nearly nothing new to Sebastian Shaw, but the 1960's look to the character. The 1960s setting of X-Men: First Class had that James Bond look. The scene in the bar in Argentina can pretty much look and acts like Michael Fassbender pitch perfect as badass, charming, ruthless and sweet Sean Connery's style personality while having that tense moment western shootout. They did a cool job representing the period like showing old Las Vegas, and the way the character dress in a way it still felt muscular and action-oriented as if reading the 1960's comic book. The X-Men yellow and blue costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while looking space age for the action scenes. The action scenes were great in the film. Most of the visual and special effects work out. Henry Jackman composed score worked for the film as it goes into a heroic epic super hero theme to disjointed disturbing beat when Magneto does something bad. The film does an OK version of paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast, but it does go wrong with the lore of the story to the point it's beyond fixable. Writers do whatever they want with the characters and their origins and powers and such that the movies don't follow each other. It doesn't even follow the first team of X-men from the book, but if comic books fans are able to turn their mind off and just watch it as a stand alone film. It's watchable. The film has to be an alternate history for the X-Men to work. It stilled a better film, then the previous films like X-Men 3 & Origins.",7,3,4,12 December 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," This was indeed, Fifty Shades of F*** up!
","My safe word should had been 'turn off', because this movie was indeed torture, when watching. I don't know why I watch, such crap. I guess, I was really hoping the movie was going to be, 'it's so bad, it's good'; type of a movie, which it wasn't. Based off the bestselling Twilight Fan Fiction-turned erotic novel of the same name, the adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a naive literature student, that falls in love with wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), only to find out, a dark side about him, where Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. Can Anastasia Steele saved Christian Grey's tormented soul or will she submit to his every demand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the movie, this movie was truly painful, insulting, and really dumb to watch. The movie never reaches a satisfying climax in the awful third act. The whole movie felt like just one giant setup for the sequels. A movie like this, should be a stand-alone movie, as it's the introduction piece. The movie is directionless. No wonder why director Sam Taylor-Johnson & author E. L. James fought endlessly about the film's direction. I went into this, with extremely low expectations. I was really trying to give this movie, a chance, because the source material was already pretty bad. I knew, coming in, that movie wasn't going to be in the same highbrow levels of writing, that great taboo erotic films, had such as 1962's Lolita or 1967's Belle de Jour. After all, the book was indeed, hilarious bad, with its bad dialogue, awkward story-telling, and unrealistic tone. A lot of the story seem clichés, influence, or rip off from better works, like 2002's Secretary & 1972's Last Tango in Paris. Much of the novel's charm, come from the laughable narrative and outrageous sex scenes. I was really looking forward to that. Sadly, it didn't have, any of those things. Since the narrative was indeed missing from the film; it was really hard to connect to what Anastasia was really feeling, during her time with Christian. It was a lot more define and clear in the book, because we understood, what kinky stuff, she was passive for, and what she wasn't. It's hard to figure out, here, because the sex was too tame and similar. One minute, she's having an organism, and then she's having fears for her safety. What? It doesn't help that most of the dialogue that they were feeding her, are very confusing, convolute, inconsistent or hypocritical. She says, she love Grey even though there are hardly anything that justifies it. She barely knows him. She has been told over and over again that Grey doesn't do romance, yet she's forcing herself to do this, for reasons, that are never explained. I guess, it's there to show, now naïve and inexperience; young women are, when it comes to love, but it comes across as too annoying childish for a serious adult melodrama. I really don't hold it, against Dakota Johnson's acting, because that felt more to the writers faults for not fleshing out their characters more. Johnson actually makes the whole thing pretty bearable thanks to her coy sense of humor. Even during the handful of serious parts, she really sells her character's innocence and struggle. Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan as Grey is just awful with his wooden delivery. Honestly, he's the weaker of the two leads. Due to the movie portraying him as a mysterious complex person, we don't really see any good redeeming likable qualities with his character, besides Grey's money and his looks. It's feels odd, for Anastasia to have feeling for him, because his cons really out-weight his pros. She really have to blindfold, to not see the mentally unstable, stalkerish, and manipulative, that he's putting out. He's almost rife with misogyny. The connection between the two seem too much of a fantasy. It didn't help that both actors, had little to no chemistry with each other, both in the sex scenes and their dialogue exchanges. Both looks very uncomfortable. Simply put, romantic leads, Johnson and Dornan do not like each other. The movie sex scenes were lame, compare to the edgy nature of the novel. The film, tease the audience, with all the weird things in the red room, but all you see, is nearly normal sex. The film tones down or removes most of the creepier parts of the book, including the infamous 'tampon scene' to get an R rating than an X rating. I don't know if that it was the wisest decision. While, yes, it makes the audience more comfortable, watching the film; it also makes the movie, a bit safe and dull. Nothing, they did was really that strange. This movie does an incredibly poor job of portraying BDSM culture. The film also a bit sexism, when it comes to nudity. Clearly, this movie is made for women, and there is barely any male nudity. Dakota Johnson does all full frontal and it's Rated R, but if the man does it, it's turn into a rated X movie. Very odd. While, the sex scenes are nothing to look at. The way, how the rest of the movie was shot was beautiful. This is one of the highlights of the film, besides the use of establish songs as background music. While, the book and movie seem silly at first glance, it does have a somewhat harmful message that the studios is willing to mislead the audiences for, for money. The movie acts like a romance movie, when in truth, it's a movie with a lot of abuse. Why would anybody fantasize being in extremely emotionally abuse relationship like this? It's odd that many of older woman's fantasy is a book that demeans women. Overall: This movie is pretty awful. Don't recommended, watching. This is 50 Shades of not okay.",3,5,10,28 February 2015
The Wolverine," Wolverine is a good movie, bub. It's cutting edge.
","I was very impress on how good the movie was really is. It wasn't as good as 2003's X2, but it was a lot better than 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Still, the movie doesn't match up with any of the previous films very well. That's why the plot holes were so big in the film in this film. We're talking about a franchise who continuity is very washy where it goes, where it came from and what it being present right now. It seem like FOX's Marvel team doesn't know how to handle the X-franchise properly. At less, Disney's Marvel kind of fix the loose-ends of the previous superheroes movies for 2011's Avengers release. I would love to see Marvel under one company sooner than later. Add, Columbia's Spiderman and any licensed Marvel that belong to other companies elsewhere. I don't care who own Marvel, as long as the films are good and make sense. With that, say, I was under the impression that he visit Japan storyline takes place prior to his joining the X-Men in the canon after WWI. Like the comic and the previous movie, he fought in Europe during WWII. So how was he in Japan in WWII? Plus, how does Logan even have memory of the event, if the previous film showed us he took a bullet to the head that made him forget everything that happened to him prior to his operation post-WW2? It wasn't that big of a deal, since I know the movie takes creative license, which is pretty OK in my book. At less, he goes back to Japan just after the Dark Phoenix saga, so this movie fits in with the comic pretty correct there. The Wolverine, is loosely based on Chris Claremont 1982 four-issue spin off comic series that sent Logan to Japan, for which Claremont drafted then-rising-superstar artist Frank Miller. The characters have the same name, but it's doesn't follow the comic book so well. It doesn't work as an adapted as the comic book, but as a movie of its own. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue, it's worth watching. After the events from 2006's X-Men Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackson) lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by hallucinations memories of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Was Jean just a personification of Logan's guilt, or is it really phoenix in his head with him? Logan then finds himself being seek out by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who works for Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) who wants to offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his father's body. Allowing Logan, a chance to live a normal life rather than being curse with immortality. Logan hating the fact that he outlive everybody he has once love, agrees. Logan set out for Japan, once there, he finds that something malicious is being case as Yashida's doctor, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) plans to use it for a ultimate weapon call the Silver Samurai, a suit made out of Adamantium metal. Logan refused, but Viper weaken Logan's body to the point that the first time in Logan's life, he might die from the poisoning of Adamantium metal in his body. If not the poison, he might die due to the large numbers of Yakuza and Ninjas set out to kill him. In my opinion, the movie's plot could have been better. The movie's plot moves really slow, it's not well spread out, and last a lot of sub-plot got in the way with the main. I really couldn't find Logan falling in love with Yashida Clan member Mariko (Tao Okamoto). There was a lack of chemistry between Jackman and Tao, their characters were well written had the chemistry but the actors did bring that to life. I know, based on the comics, Logan likes Mariko, but in my opinion, I thought Yukio made a better love interest in this film. Better yet, why even have a love interest. It's seems like any female character put into a comic book film is there only for a love interest arch. I wish Mariko had more to offer the film. Mariko remained the useless princess stereotype. It felt like watching a superhero version of Karate Kiba, a martial-arts film starring Sonny Chiba, released in 1973. About Yukio, she is a mutant with the precognitive ability to know when someone will die. Her power wasn't needed. Nor does it makes any sense, in the case of Yashida and Logan toward the end. Fans may hate what they did for Silver Samurai. Silver Samurai look like Super Shredder in my opinion. FYI. The robotic Silver Samurai is in the new comics, so it does somewhat works. What doesn't work is Viper. The model actress is so awful in acting. Her scenes were so cartoony with all those hissing sounds. Was it really all that necessary to include Viper as a mutant, when she works much better as an Captain America villain. While Hugh Jackson did great as Logan. I just wish to see Logan learn more about the Japanese culture. In the comic, he was being trained in martial arts. In the film, he isn't doing anything new. He seem like a fish out of water there. Critics says the film is darken in tone, in my opinion, it wasn't. The action scenes were good. Bullet train scene was over the top, but it was short. Don't watch it in 3D, it was pretty useless .In a mid-credits scene, there is a scene worth watching hyping X-Men: Days of Future Past. Overall: If you're watching it as an action flick, yes it's a good movie. If you're a fan of the Wolverine character and actually know something about this storyline, you'll be quite disappointed, just like the last X-Men. Still, it's fun to watch.",7,10,17,1 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Bane wants you to watch the film, then you have Bane's permission to die
","You don't need that much CGI, and special effects to pull off a good movie, and Christopher Nolan third and last film in the trilogy pull it off again. Being a huge fan of superhero movies, I like realistic heroes more. I always love Batman because he's just a normal guy. He doesn't have super powers; he's a man who fights crime by training himself and outsmarting his foe. Well, also gadgets and money, but he's a hero whom get beaten down by time after time, when he call to fight for the people against criminals, preventing him from anything that represents normal life. He is always tormenting by the crimes of others in the past. It's 8 years since the events of Dark Knight, the movie starts out, with ice breaking—it's seems to be symbolism of all our favorite characters being broken down by the great lie of the last movie. (Lying about Harvey Dent becoming Two Face) and the lie about the death of Rachel. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) looks like an old man with a bad knee and cane, nearly Howard Hughes like while crime is all time low. Here enters Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscle assassin that sounds like Darth Vader if Sean Connery voice him began to terrorize Gotham. Hardy is great in the role, both playing sinister and a challenging foe to Batman whom is very superior than Batman, but sometimes it's hard to hear what he is saying through that mask. It doesn't help Batman, that also Selma Kyle AKA Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is on the loose as well. At first, it felt like Anne was miscast, but she truly fill the role in, by giving it some needed edge. Things get worst, as a young police officer detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is digging for the true, about what really happen to Dent and Commission Gordon (Gary Oldman) is losing control of the city due to the chaos. Not only that Wayne Enterprises invested in a clean energy project with Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), and after learning that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon; the project was closed leading to the company's financial loss causing Bruce Wayne to loss his money. Tate is elected as the new CEO of Wayne Enterprises and Wayne entrusts responsibility for the reactor core to her. Bane continue with a series of terrorism attacks, the stock exchange, traps the majority of Gotham's police underground, sets off bombs throughout city, kills Mayor Anthony Garcia in the process at a Gotham Rogue game (I think the Animated Series is the first to show the team) , and destroys the bridges and tunnels leading to the city. The city turns into anarchism state. When Batman does fight Bane. Bruce is betrays by Catwoman– leaving Batman to fight Bane alone. Bane breaks Batman's back (similar to the Knightfall comic) and imprisons him in his former prison, and gains access to Bruce's armory and nuclear weapon. Bane claims to have armed an anonymous citizen with the trigger who will detonate the device should anyone leave Gotham – unknown to the citizens, the unstable bomb will detonate regardless in five months no matter what happens. Trying to recover from his injuries in the prison, Bruce must try to save the city. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. I love the similar plot points to the comics like Batman Cataclysm and No Man's Land. I love the symbolism of the prison (it's like escaping from Hell on Earth). The twist ending of Miranda Tate and Blake was amazing. I love the story arc that boils underneath the main narrative, between the rich continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the poor. The Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch, but it's not the perfect film, people think of. The film lacks Batman, most of the 3 hr movie, as Batman is in 33 minutes of it. The villains have way to over complicated plot. I didn't get—why did the villains kept the bomb so long, if they works for Al Ghul. Didn't Ra Al Ghul wanted to destroy the city so badly. Wasn't the original reason Ra Al Ghul wanted Gotham gone was because he felt that the city was a cess-pool of crime, but it's 8 year since Dark Knight, and the city is made out to be peaceful and crime an all time low. So why destroy it, and if so why wait. It was a pointless waste of time. The movie has no sense of time, and travel with its pacing. Bane is made to be, older than Ra Al Ghul in flashbacks, come on! Yet, he's stronger than Batman. Batman is made to be old, while Bane is young. How on earth, did Batman, Bane, get back and forth from Peña Dura to Gotham so easily: wasn't Peña Dura in the Caribbeans? It's clear that Dark Knight was the better film, still in conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.",8,5,10,23 February 2013
The Croods," Move on over Flintstones, there is a new caveman cartoon family in town call the Croods. A modern stone-age family!!
","After their cave is destroyed, a Neanderthal caveman family call the Croods must trek through an unfamiliar fantastical world with the help of an inventive Cro-Magnon guy surprising name Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his pet Sloth name Belt. I do like the idea of having people think the end of the world is coming in the beginning of time. Its makes me laugh, when I think about how silly dogma thinking is. The Croods are made out of Eep (Emma Stone) a girl looking out for adventure with a touch of Daddy's issues and rebellious. It looks like DreamWorks Animation took the Disney Princess concept to heart in this film. She comes off being bratty or cruel at times. The movie nearly mirrors Ariel from 1989's Little Mermaid and 2012's Brave Merida way too much in how much the character looks and acts upon dealing with fathers figures. Grug (Nicolas Cage) is her overprotective father who surprising is the character, I can sympathize most. He's not a bad guy, he just a man who lives in fear, who wants to protect his family at all cost. What I didn't like the movie is how the other characters were treating him when Guy came around. They act like he rarely did any good for his family. I would deeply hate being over look and can understand being threat by Guy. I think Nicolas Cage did a pretty good job in the role. The rest of the family are made out his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his daughter Sandy (Randy Thom), and his son Thunk (Clark Duke) and mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Ugga doesn't really state out in her role, besides playing the mother figure. Thunk, Sandy and Gran were funny in the roles they were given. Still there were moments of the film, I just wish they would shut up. The movie doesn't take itself so serious, as it's more cartoony than historical accuracy or realism. The cavemen take a good number of falls, and hits that would clearly kill you in real life, but in this film, it's like watching a bit of Captain Caveman mixed with Roadrunner cartoon. I didn't know Neanderthal could lift heavy boulders, get crash by it, and still live. The wild creatures are made all cute like, rather than menacing at all. For goodness sakes, the Sabre Tooth tiger look like a stuff toy animal chasing them around. The action scenes were pretty cool to watch, but not once did I think that they were in any strong danger in how cartoony they made the film look. I would say it pretty safe movie for the kids to see. The movie does have good teachings for children, if you do take them like the ability to learn, invent, and adapt. Second is the importance of cooperation and family. I wouldn't say it was a great 3D movie. I watch it in 2D and honestly, couldn't really tell where the things popping out for 3D was. The plot reminds of a bit of The Gogs, Welsh cartoon TV Series that has a family's cave destroy by a volcano forcing them to go find a new home. Aardman Animations and Dreamworks took the idea, and remade it into the Croods. Overall very nice movie, made me laugh quite a few times, very entertaining and sweet all around. So tadtaddaaa everybody.",7,4,5,24 May 2013
Black Panther," Black Panther roars into theaters. Was it good? It was alright.
","Follows the events of 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. T'Challa Udaku (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as king, only to find, that an old enemy, Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens AKA N'Jadaka (Michael B. Jordan) has reappears to challenge him for the throne. Without spoiling too much of the film, from all 'Cinematic Universe' movies from the Walt Disney Company & Marvel Studios so far, there is perhaps, none that is more celebrated from fanboys & movie critics, right now, than director, Ryan Coolger's superhero film, 'Black Panther'. The film received praise for nearly everything. It even become one of the highest-grossing films of all time. A global phenomenon. However, it does beg the question, is all that praise, truly justified? The answer is somewhat yes. 'Black Panther' was indeed an entertaining movie. However, it's not a complete perfect masterpiece of art. Some of the praise from critics and fans is a bit overblown to the point, that it sounds like pompous. They're overlooking some of the film's biggest flaws. Examples include the fishing plot-hole, pacing issues, the story being too similar to 1994's animation movie, 'the Lion King', the heavy use of fake-looking CGI during the clichÃ© looking chase sequences, the uneven & unrealistic portrayal of modern day economics in isolated sovereign state, and last, by not least, the lack of vulnerability & suspense when it comes to Black Panther's overpowered suit and abilities. All of these are worth criticize about. After all, all these issues came across, as very jarring on screen. It kinda took some audience members, out of the film. Although, it wasn't as distracting, as the obvious disconnected this movie had, over previous Marvel's films when it comes to the portrayal of Wakanda's intentional isolationism beliefs. Instead of having the nation be a little more open into intermingling with other countries; as seen in 'Captain America: Civil War'; where Wakanda had establish foreign aid with certain African nations like Lagos. The movie chose to backtrack, and make this African nation's people seem more traditional close-off; despite the fact, in the previous film, they were a powerful influencer in United Nation, when it comes to reviewing the Sokovia Accord. That was a big risky big retcon that sadly, didn't pay off. After all, Coogler and his writers kept the very public death scene for king, T'Chaka (John Kani) from the previous movie, even though, he supposed to be, a hermit. It doesn't add up. It lesser Killmonger's argument, big time. All this 'blind eye to foreign affairs' retcon muddled things up. It doesn't make much sense. Not only that; but it also made the world building seems a little more jarring. After all, how does the technologically advanced nation, stay so hidden for so long, during the Modern Digital Age? Do their citizens live within the country's border under a heavy watch by their government, unable to leave or bring anybody in? Seeing that Wakanda has assassins and spies, everywhere. I'm starting to doubt, that this nation is truly worth rooting for. After all, these are the same smart people that blindly follow their new leader into battle, without questioning anything about their way of leadership. The place sounds like a cult in the verge of turning into another Imperial Japan. After all, they worship a living embodiment of their panther god. Wakanda might be a highly control, centralized, cult of personality feudalism-like state. After all, there seem to be, some type of social caste system in Wakanda that borderline, doesn't seem right. If anything, side-villain, M'Baku (Winston Duke) seem more of the good guy than anybody in the film. He's the only one, truly using his brain, by questioning establishment and exploring his surroundings. Still, you would think, he would had expose the royal family's lies on the internet by now. After all, this tribe seem to know, a lot about some western culture. So, they has to be some sort access to the outside world to get that type of an information; even if it's hard to find a WIFI connect in the mountain. Regardless of that, another problem with the over-fawning by fans & critics, is how incorrect, some of them are with their praising. A good example is how some people treat this, as the first black superhero movie. They act like it's a milestone in cinema; which it is not. If you notice on IMDB, they has been black superheroes movies, way before this, like 1993's 'Meteor Man', 1997's 'Spawn' & 2008's 'Hancock' to name a few. It's nothing new. If anything 1998's 'Blade' deserve most of the credit. That's the true,' first Marvel black superhero movie ever'. Despite all that, there's are some truly some good examples to appreciate in 'Black Panther'; such as the Afro Punk design, the soundtrack, and the use of real foreign languages like Xhosa. Nevertheless, it's the unique characters that truly stand out. Even if, Chadwick Boseman's African accent sound cheesy. All the acting from the performers were great. Overall: While, 'Black Panther' might not be Wakanda Forever for me, due to plot-holes in the story. At least, it's not kitty litter. It's still a decent movie, worth checking out. Highly recommended.",7,3,6,26 March 2018
Mother!," Holy Mother of God! What a weird psychological movie!
","Watching this horror movie from director Darren Aronofsky on Mother's Day, is probably not the best thing to do! Without spoiling the movie, too much, it's no comfortable sit popcorn flick. It's more like a nauseating 'Doomsday' want to abort, kind of a film. It's gloomy, disturbing, and highly annoying. However, it's something, you should had expect by now; seeing how Aronofsky's movies has always been hard sit. Still, as dark as his 2000's film 'Requiem of a Dream' & 2008's masterpiece 'The Wrestler', were; it did had an overarching message about hope & some uplifting moments sprinkle throughout the film. This one, not so much. Without spoiling too much of this movie, Aronofsky had turned everything good about believing for better days into a negative. It come across, as very nihilism & way too unpleasant. It will certainly turn off, positive thinkers and sensitive religionist people. If that wasn't enough, the director also, has a pessimistic misanthropy view on humanity as a whole. Focusing way too much on humanity's depravity and abuse of the natural world. Because of that, this movie has barely any redeemable characters. Most of them, are very unlikable. So, it was really hard to care or invest in what happening in the movie. If that wasn't enough, the film is also a miscarriage of sophistical ways to use surrealism metaphors in a dream-like settling. Aronofsky's writing is way too on the nose for it. Not only that, but it's really not that hard to see, where the director was going for, when he dreamt up, this fever nightmare, one night and wrote it in five days. The story of an unnamed woman (Jennifer Lawrence)'s anthropophobia mental state is being tested when uninvited guests kept on, arriving at her house is obvious, a retelling of the Bible told from nature's feminine perspective. Even, having the events set in modern day, was very poor attempt of hiding that. There was nothing really smart, in the way, Aronofsky's metaphorical scarf was trying covering the religious environmental message. I guess, that why, Aronofsky gave up, half way & just expose everything to the masses. At certain parts, the filmmaker even spell it out for you, like hinting at the apocalypse toward the end with a throwaway line of dialogue or having obvious visual tipoffs as the unnamed writer/poet (Javier Bardem) rubbing ink on the forehead of his fans or showing the infamous baby eating scene. Aronofsky is treating his audience members as if they were simpletons who can't interpret, worth anything. Not only that, but Aronofsky couldn't stop his damn mouth, before the movie was released in press interviews. He pretty much spill all the beans about his film, before people saw it. Because of that, there wasn't really anything, too surprising in the flick for people. Anybody that read the bible, knows, how it would end. 'Mother' really does lacks subtlety and nuance. So, it came across, as very predictable for a film built as a mystery. The story doesn't stand out on its own. Despite that, with its mute color choices and low lightning, the movie does a good job on making certain visuals from cinematographer, Matthew Libatique seem haunting. Even the sparing use of CGI from Andrew Weisblum and his crew kinda works for that behalf. All of those filmmaking tools really does made the house, seem really creepy. Another thing that works was the use of close ups. It really gave the feel of anxious and claustrophobic for the viewer. Yet, it's could had been, better used, if Lawrence's character's reaction was a little more emotional driven, than bland confusing stares. It made the film seem more hilarious than scary. To add on that, Aronofsky's misdirection for the over the top, gimmicky, quick paced action really does ruin the slow gothic 'Lovecraftian' fear of the cosmic unknown. It also really desensitized the viewers from feeling, the pain from more ground issues, such as the atrocities that have been done in the name of religion. It was very disconnecting in every way, despite how well-acted, the performers were. No wonder, why this movie nearly bomb at the box office. It felt like absurd Freudian wet dream, too extreme & esoteric for mainstream audiences. While, personally, I cannot recommended seeing this movie. I know, that 'Mother' is indeed, better, suite for art house crowds. However, even with that; overall, the movie is not worth worshipping about. It's a bitch to sit through.",6,3,4,15 May 2018
Creed II," Ring the bell! It's time to step back into the ring for Creed 2. Is it worth watching? Yes, it is.
","This sport movie directed by Steven Caple Jr, came out, swinging, and it did not miss! Without spoiling the film written by Sylvester Stallone and Cheo Hodari Coker, too much, this motion picture was action packed from start to finish. It was a totally hit for me! I love every minute of it; even if this 'Rocky' spin-off film, still follows the same guidelines as any of the previous franchise films & the story mirrors 1985's 'Rocky IV', a little too much, by having Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) fight Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) yet again. This time under with their protégés Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) & Ivan Drago's son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu). Like 2015's 'Creed', which in return, is a soft reboot of the first 'Rocky' movie that released in 1975. I didn't mind, too much of this eighth entry in the storied 'Rocky' film series and the second in the 'Creed' successions, being too similar to the fourth film in the franchise. While, all the familiar schmaltzy tropes & callbacks may make this somewhat of a predictable rethread. The movie did give us, some new material to work with. Some examples are the way, the film gave a lot of scenes of hardship to the villains, making them, a lot more sympathetic than any other antagonist, besides Adonis' father in the past. I glad that they're not robotic one dimensional meatheads. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, this sequel kinda fix, some of the problems, I had with the 2015 movie, as well. Some examples were the lack of resolve to Rocky's rocky relationship with his absence son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). I'm glad that oddly, out of the blue, forced subplot finally got some closure, here. I'm also happy that the film gave Adonis's singer-songwriter love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a little more depth. The loss of her hearing subplot was very compelling. I just wish, the movie focus, a little more on how that loss was effecting her singer career as she is struggling to maintain it. Regardless, I like how the film shows how much this tragic, including the birth of his daughter has cause Adonis; to the point that he has to rethink his career choice. Can he still afford, being a good friend, husband & father figure, meanwhile still somewhat maintaining his self-driven attitude in a dangerous profession that could end his life? It's a challenging question that Adonis has to ask himself. Regardless, Jordan really does show great details of the boxer's struggles of trying to figure out, what he's really fighting for. He really put an outstanding performance. Not only that, but he has great on screen chemistry with all of his co-stars. I can really believe that his character really does love his family. Sylvester Stallone is also good. While, his character has less to do this time around, Stallone still excels at mentoring Creed and reminding him what's truly worth fighting for. I just hate that second half plot mandated friendship break, involving him and Creed. I found, the reasons for them to hate each other for a bit, very weak, and somewhat forced. Of course, also prediction, as they make up in time for the climax. As for Tessa Thompson, she does well within her limited role, keeping Adonis's growing ego in check, while also being a good wife & mother. Because of this, the audience really does root for Creed to win, because it will seem to be for nothing, if he doesn't. Not only that, but Jordan's boxing skills are pretty impressive. He really did put a lot of work in the gym, gaining 25 pounds of muscle to match the real life boxer, Florian who had to lose 20. Both of them, really put out a realistic intense match with their choreography. Not only that, but the way, this movie was shot was amazing. Kramer Morgenthau's cinematography was outstanding. Brutal, and grounded. The training montage here, was a lot more intense than the 2015 version. As for the background music that went with all, these amazing scenes. Composer, Ludwig Göransson did a hell of a good job. Despite, not being a huge hip hop fan, the score mixed with some rap vibes sounds really epic. It wasn't as annoying as I thought, it would. I also glad the movie didn't seem Blaxploitation. That would had been cheesy and cartoony. Never once, did I felt like I was watching a movie target to a certain audience. It felt like an every person movie. I'm also happy that the movie wasn't portray in a simpleton over patriot jingoism propaganda matter, as well. However, I kinda wish the film didn't make everybody from Eastern Europe seem like they had a blunt serious demeanor. It makes the film, a little bit stereotypical. The private dinner scene for the boxers is one such example. Russians are not that uptight, stern and cold. Despite that, I still dig the cameo of a certain familiar woman. Without spoiling it, that was fun to see. Nevertheless, it would also been awesome to see Geraldine Hughes return as Marie from 2006's 'Rocky Balboa', as well, as it seem that storyline never got finished. Hopefully, she can return back in the next film. Regardless, overall, 'Creed 2' goes the distance. It was a total knockout in all departments. A entertaining movie worth seeing.",8,6,9,17 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bat-Crazy Man Vs Super-Serious Man: Yawn of Justice is super disappointing. Still, I did enjoyed this superhero movie. I just wish, it could had been better.
","From director Zack Snyder comes Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the first big-screen meeting between DC's (Detective Comics) greatest superheroes. For the most part, the movie was entertaining, due to the intense action scenes & the quality of the visuals effects. However, I just wish the movie was a little more light-hearted and fun, than over-serious and dark. It doesn't even seem like a kid's movie with several of DC characters brooding, philosophical talking, and doing extreme violent acts in an over complicated plot about Meta-humans being left unchecked and turning out to be wolves in sheep's clothing. Like, really why would believe and blamed Superman for the massacre in Africa when he never used a gun? I get that, Detective Comics wants to continue to the adult-driven tone that director Christopher Nolan has done with the Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012) and 2013's Men of Steel, but gees, this movie was a little bit off-putting with how messy, they treat Superman and the rebooting of Batman. Don't get me wrong, I like Ben Affleck's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/ Batman and his Frank Miller style of costume. After all, Affleck is by far, the best performance in the film, but I just didn't like all the screen time, it took to establish, his already known backstory. It took away, all of screen-time needed to establish Clark Kent/Superman's problems (Henry Cavill). For Superman, I really don't have a problem with Henry Cavill. He looks and acts the part. I just didn't like, how he became a secondary character in his own movie. After all, isn't this originally supposed to be, Superman's sequel? In my opinion, Batman should had been establish first in his own movie rather than pair up, out of the blue with Superman, without much establishment. Second off, the whole 'dream' story structure within the first 2 acts was really annoying with Batman. I hate, how it's cut to something, very vague and random like a hint to the comic book 'Crisis On Infinite Earths', until the main plot picks up, again. About Batman killing people, as much as I would love, that he had a moral code, I'm willing to accept this change, with a grain of salt. After all, Batman did kill people, throughout the comic book world, many times over, before. I just wish, the movie show a better reason, why Batman dislike Superman, rather than the fact, that Superman accidentally murder people, once in a while. It's very hypocritical, when you think about it, since Batman does that every night. I also hate, the fact, that the weak conflict got resolve, way too quickly. It's really odd, to consider them, being good friends after one night of battle with some very invasive music playing in the background. Another thing, about that night of battle is how they rushed and changed, much of the Doomsday and Superman storyline from the comics. This version of Doomsday's appearance toward the end of the film felt very offensive to fans of the 'Death of Superman' comic-books. I didn't like it, Doomsday should had been save for the oncoming Justice League movie, like the other random cameos of Justice League. Members like Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) & Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher) felt like a tease. One big character, that wasn't really needed for this movie is Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). She really comes out of nowhere, with no backstory at all and has little to do with the main plot. The actress does work as a strong female lead, however, her presence in this film was a little jarring. Since the meta-humans program, doesn't really come into play. One character, I didn't like, from the movie is actor, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luther. He was horrible with his hammy joker-style humor. His reasons for hating Superman is also very inconsistent. I get that, they wanted him to be suffering from psychological disorder rather than just being greedy, evil, or driven by ego I still don't know, what his main goals were. How does he know about the character of Darkseid? Plus, his scenes with Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) were too-sexual awkward. Does he has feeling for her? Is she, his mother? We will never know. I just felt dirty, for watching it. It's also a sad attempt, by Warner Bros to change his character from Lex Luther Senior to Lex Luther Jr. as a lame way, to draw away the backlash of Eisenberg's casting in this film. Plus, to leave it, open for their originally choice, Tom Hanks to come in, and play the senior role. Another character, that bug me, is Lois Lane (Amy Adams). While Amy Adams brings her usual warmth, humanity, and mix of moxie and vulnerability to the Daily Planet's most intrepid reporter. I just hate, how much, the movie makes her, into a dumb damsel in distress burden for Superman. She really does way too any stupid stuff in the film like throwing away the spear. Overall: This movie never fully transcends into being an awesome viewing experience and yet is also too competently made to be anywhere near the disaster, its haters probably wanted. With that said, if you've already made up your mind about seeing this movie, then the actual film itself won't do much to change your mind one way or another. You're going to love it or hate it. For me, I found this superhero escapism movie to be very disappointing.",6,4,7,30 March 2016
Tombstone," This movie is indeed my huckleberry. Tombstone is a film too tough to die. It's highly rewatchable even today.
","Released by Hollywood Pictures and based off actual events in American Old West during the 1880s. 1993 'Tombstone' is one of the two epic westerns released within a few months of each other that tells the story of Wyatt Earp played by Kurt Russell battles with the Cochise County Cowboys. The other film being director Larence Kasdan and Kevin Costner 1994 film 'Wyatt Earp'. Without spoiling this motion picture too much, while the production was indeed troublesome to the point that writer & original director Kevin Jarre had to replace by George P. Cosmatos. The movie was still very well made and very beautiful shot. Everything about the film was highly focused on historical accuracy including casting, locations, costumes, props and sets. Much of this success was due to Russell who pretty much make things run smoothly, during the majority of the production. However, there were some inaccuracies. One of them is with the omission of certain Earp Family members. Don't get me wrong, I can understand why they didn't introduce Wyatt's half-brother, Newton into the story as he has nothing to do with the town of Tombstone. However, Wyatt's other brothers James & Warren were there. Even if they weren't presence for the gunfight at the OK Corral, which in reality, was in a vacant lot next to Fry's photographic studio, six lots away. James was still a key member in the historical events, as he was saloon keeper who gambling houses were often visited by the Cowboys. Not only that, but he very helpful to the events that Morgan Earp played by Bill Paxton went through. They could had add his story. The same goes with Warren whom was original part of the Vendetta Ride yet not feature in the film. I really don't know why. The only guess is that Jarre really wanted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse metaphor. While, this motion picture has the more tighten pace film than Costner's film. There were still some parts of Wyatt's story that went underdeveloped in this movie. One of them is the struggles he went through when first arriving in the city. While it's true that he did became part owner of the Oriental Saloon which is depicted. The movie didn't feature scenes of him starting out as small stagecoach business owner before turning to working as shotgun guard for Well Fargo. It's here where much of the real tension between Wyatt and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) came from, as Clanton was a loose association of the outlaws and was looking to cut a deal with the lawmen concerning some stagecoach robberies and cattle rustling by some of the Cowboys. He may have feared that his dealings with the family would be revealed after the shooting, hints why he chose to side back with the Cowboys. The movie also romanticize Wyatt's reasons of becoming a lawman, a little too much. Much of his interest in being a deputy sheriff came from seeking power in elections and gaining more money, not from protecting the people from criminals. In truth, the Earps probably did more harm on that infamous day at the OK Corral than good, as there was no need to disarm the Cowboys. It was very custom for riders heading to Tombstone to carry their guns. After all, Apache warriors had engaged the Army near the city just three weeks before the shootout. It was very well established. Yet the brothers carry on with the attack fearing an later ambush for Wyatt's friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) at his living quarters at CS Fly's boarding house even after sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) disarmed two of the members of the outlaws knowing that issues was high after the accident involving Marshal Fred White played Harry Carey Jr. The film makes them look more like heroes, when the movie should had made them more like antiheroes. Regardless, the Cowboys revenge afterwards was more spaced out in real life than the film. The shooting were not done during the same night, but rather several weeks apart. As for Wyatt hunt for the outlaws like Curly Bill (Power Boothe) & Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Much of that is up for debate. Nevertheless, one of the weaker parts of the film is the love story between Wyatt and Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The film doesn't give enough time between the violence and tension with the outlaws to establish much. I thought the western could had done better if they cut that subplot out. It made the ending so cheesy. In real life, the whole idea that Doc would tell Wyatt to find her after the events in Tombstone is very unlikeable due to Holliday's ethic remarks about the woman. In truth, the two friends actually parted ways. Nevertheless, I love the acting between the two performers. It was amazing, but Kilmer really does steal the show. He put a love of work into his sickly alcoholic character. It was very believable even if the Latin speaking parts were fictional. I just wish the historical narrating from Robert Mitchum from the closing and opening wasn't part of the movie. It distracting from the reality of the story. It kinda hurts the film. As for the other actors, they were just as great. Also the cinematography from William Fraker and musical score from Bruce Broughton is to die for. It really help set the tone of the movie. Overall: While the script ask to be lot more epic with the original intention being a three hour plus movie. I really felt that the filmmakers did enough to make the western, highly rewatchable. In the end the movie is highly recommended checking out. It put the wild in Wild West for sure.",8,0,0,1 June 2019
The Greatest Showman," For the most part, 'the Greatest Showman' was truly a great watch. A feel-good whimsical movie.
","Ladies and Gentlemen and Children of All Ages! 'The Greatest Showman' has arrived. Directed by Michael Gracey, the film showcase, the visionary of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) who rose from nothing to create one of the greatest shows on Earth. Without spoiling the movie, too much, much like the real-life, promoter, this movie is here to entertains, and it completely succeeds in doing so. Nevertheless, it came without a few criticism from groups whom felt outrage & revulsion for what they deem as somewhat offensive overly exploitative of the physical impaired. Much like 1932's 'Freaks', a similar film before this, they're overlooking the positive incentives on showing people with impairments. Stories with characters with physical difficulties can help build understanding, compassion, and tolerance among viewers who don't face those challenges -- as well as give those who do a chance to see relatable people on screen. As a man of many physical challenges, I champion this portrayal, even if some of the disabled characters are played by able-bodied performers like Keala Settle, as the bearded lady, Lettie Lutz. As for the film portrayal of race. I also welcome the mostly positive portrayal of it, even if parts of it can be seemed as scientific racism, due to the fact that color of the skin, was group as an 'oddity', by Barnum's way of showmanship. Nevertheless, it's not as offensive as it could had been. After all, the film doesn't bring up, the fact that the real-life, Barnum bought slaves for blackface minstrel show, despite possessed, many anti-slavery convictions. Nevertheless, some of the artistic liberties about him, in this film, is still, a bit jarring, such as not, portraying any of his significantly involvement in politics, leading up to the American Civil War. It would had made, the reasons, why some people want to burn his museum, more convincing than the surface-level negative public attitudes about the theater as 'dens of evil'. While, I would had wish the movie was a little more open in exploring, more of the complexity social issues of the time. I didn't mind, for the most part, the film playing it safe with a water down version to make it more family-friendly. After all, it's supposed to be, musical escapism, not a historic accuracy biography film. However, there are two things, I didn't like about this portrayal of history. One is the villainess disservice to Swedish singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) by painting her as the evil jilted lover of Barnum. In real-life, they broke up, not due to a botch romantic relationship, but over marketing. Nothing really sinister. Secondary, Barnum's company nearly went out of business, due to bad property investments, not Lind's tour. In truth, Lind made Barnum, a lot amount of cash. The other thing, I didn't like about this movie was the idea, it was saying that Barnum invented the modern circus, which is highly misleading. In fact, the first modern circus was introduce to the public, 100 years earlier, by performer Philip Astley in 1770 & the first circus tent was introduce in 1838 by Thomas Cooke. Barnum didn't really start his show business until much later, after his lottery business went under. Honestly, it wasn't until his most well-known partnership with James A. Bailey that his museum show started to look like, 'the Greatest Show on Earth' of today. Despite that, the high-energy, upbeat, choreography dance & acrobatic action, throughout this movie very effectively evoke the ambiance of the circus's reckless, but daring persona, even it's not historical accuracy. While, the fake-looking CGI effects that went along with it, is kinda jolting to look at. It didn't really bother me, as much as it should had. Maybe, it's because all the musical numbers written by songwriters, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who also wrote the songs for the acclaim, 2016's musical, 'La La Land', were pretty memorable. No wonder, why the songs are winning awards. Catchy songs like 'This is Me', 'A Million Dreams', 'Never Enough' & others is the heart of this film. It had me, singing along in my seat. I don't care, if the music choice does not match the time period. They were catchy & enjoyable. As for singing. It's a mixed bag for me. Most of the singing from the cast was great; Ferguson as Lind, & Michelle Williams as Barnum's wife, Charity, were the only ones that were disappointing, as they had to be vocal-over. As for the acting, Jackman's performance, is a joy to watch, in spite of looking nothing like the real-life partially bald, promoter. As for supporting actors like Zac Efron; this is one of the few roles, I like him in, even if his character, Phillip Carlyle is highly fictional version of Bailey. Even, Zendaya was good in her role, as Anne Wheeler doing all of her own trapeze stunts. Yet, I just the film had more subtlety with the character's story between the musical numbers, a little more. The film does seem a bit rushed, with the focus going from one song and dance number to the next. It cause a lot of befuddling. Some confusing areas are with Barnum's career, grown. The film doesn't showcase enough. After all, some of Barnum's major attractions are either gloss over, left out or only hinted at, such as the infamous 'mermaid'. Even Barnum's relationship with the 'freaks' & the circus animals get very little screen-time. Perhaps in order, not to get the audience to dig too deep into the controversies of the circus' history. Nevertheless, their out of the blue, appearance, once in the while, were really perplexing at times. Another one that came out of nowhere, is the relationship subplot between co-owner, Carlyle & Wheeler. When did it started and how!? Nevertheless, things like that, could had been work better. Despite that, overall: while this crowd-pleasing movie a bit campy and hokey with old-timey surface-level sentiment at times. 'The Greatest Showman' is a show still worth watching. Highly recommended.",8,6,12,12 January 2018
Monsters University," Pixar's Monster Inc. is taking you back to school with Monster University. Was it worth it? Yes!
","OK, I'm not a huge fan of the prequel fad that been going on in Hollywood these days, but this movie completely pleased me. I guess I'll always be a kid at heart. I loved Monsters Inc. 10 years ago and I was utterly surprised by this prequel. If you have kids yourself and want a great family night, I recommend checking this out. And if you still have that kid inside you, you will most definitely leave this movie with a huge smile on your face. I know I did. This is just a prequel of Monster Inc. Directed by Dan Scanlon, the story is about mostly about Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) quest to become the world's best scarer, due to his hard work and lots of studying, Mike is accepted at the prestigious Monsters University. His quest become challenging, when he meets arrogant, playful, all-brawn, large blue monster Sully (John Goodman) and both often bumps heads. When both of them find themselves kick from the program due to Mike and Sully's petty competition gets out of hand, both must work together to create a team and win the Scare Games, a series of physical challenges that tests a monster's scaring ability, in hopes of joining the program once again. The movie start out slow, and it wasn't until the Scare Games that the story pick up and became interesting and funny. I felt like this was the Disney monsters kid version of 1984's The Revenge of the Nerds. The movie in my opinion, isn't anything new. Monsters University played it safe and silly. It was totally cliché in every way. The underdogs arch, the school stereotypes, the mom. Pixar was once about taking this simple idea and transforming it into something magical, something new. As a follow up, was it better than Monster Inc., no. Don't get me wrong, I do like the movie. As a comedy that teaches its protagonists to either come out of their shells and open themselves up to new kinds of goals and friends, which can help them stand tall even when cynics come hard. I think the journey of Mike and Sully is one of divine intervention. As we see, Mike isn't scary, and Sully isn't that smart. The two of them are forced together to confront which attributes they lack, and with that, the things they can accomplish beyond the Games. I do like the ending, even if it's might angry people. There was an entire scene dedicated to how Mike didn't fail, he just didn't succeed like he wanted. James laid it on the line that he was nothing without him, and the need to be recognized for that isn't important, it's about striving for a goal and adjusting to life's curve balls. That's the true meaning. If they went the other ending, it wouldn't be realistic nor interesting. Sure, it would have been feel good moment, but there are some things some people can't do certain things, even if you try as much as you can. Yes, even with certain scenarios it would seem like you could defy the odds, but life gives you curve balls; that you have to adjust. Some things you can't do. Accepting your limitations is a part of growing up, just like retreating is sometimes the best option for a great war general. It's not giving up on your dreams. It's call being smart. I do like the fact that it shows that people don't really needs to go to university or college to become a qualified professional in a field. In some ways, college became overrated with people seeking titles. Sometimes, by entering the field inside, you become a professional of the field overtime. I guarantee that Pixar would hire the guy who taught himself and is insanely good at animation over the guy who went to school for four years and got an 'animation degree' who isn't all that good. Is the movie brainwashing kids that schooling is unnecessary? It's say, no. It's just that certain people had success in life, going through schooling, and other don't. I think this is one of the more understated messages of Pixar: that even though we hold certain lifestyles and beliefs to be ideal, there's always the possibility that something even greater is right around the corner or beyond a flower-decked door. Pixar made the right choice with the college theme. There was speculation that when children between 6-10 years old watched Monsters Inc. they will be exposed to Monsters University when they are between 18-22, the basic 4 years of college life. They planned this well. This movie is perfect for parents who went to college to take their kids to, and both will enjoy. Really, anyone who went to college or fans of fraternity underdog movies will get a huge kick out of this. I love the funny scenes especially when that monster mom started blaring heavy metal unexpectedly, I lost it. I thought the breakdown of scaring technique was really clever, too. Really glad they showed the classroom environment. Lots of growth and good messages in this movie, including: bad actions have consequences, and even if you fail, it's still not the end of the world. A lot of people hate the fact that there wasn't no Boo. Well, this wasn't Monsters 2. It's a prequel. Hopefully one day we'll get a proper sequel. Monsters 2 should about Boo again if made. I was so looking forward to that. I love the cameos of characters from Monsters Inc. Overall: This movie has great charm, comedy and characters that you love.",8,6,8,27 June 2013
Ben-Hur," OMG! Ben-Hur is one of the best movies ever made. It's a sweet chariot. That's worth the ride.
","Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor. 'Ben-Hur' remains one of the most inspirational, epic action spectacles ever made by a major Hollywood studio. It was a landmark achievement in grand peplum/biblical genre storytelling. Directed by William Wyler, the film tells the story of a kind, wealthy Jew, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) whose life is thrown upside down, when he is betrayed and falsely accused of crimes against the Roman Empire by his childhood friend, turn tribune Messala (Stephen Boyd). Spending three years as a galley slave, Judah must find, a way to restore himself to high standing and while, also seeking revenge on his enemies. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while everybody thinks that this movie was the original; it was in fact, the third movie, follow after 1907 & 1925 of the same name to be made from Lew Wallace's successful novel, 1880's 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ'. It can be argued that a talking picture made from the same story as an earlier silent film is not a true remake, since the storytelling techniques each employ are so radically different, but that's up to debate, but at least, it's more original than the later films that came after it, like the 2003's animation version & the 2016 remake. Anyways, like the book, the movie also has a sub-story running in parallel with Judah's main event narrative; which was the unfolding story of Jesus. While, Jesus does play a more important role in this story more than other films, his cameo presence is still somewhat tangential. It's jarring to see a violent revenge plot, mixed his story about love thy neighbor. Thank God, the film cut the sequences of Ben-Hur faking his death, and raising a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, as it felt that Christ's message of forgiveness, could be lost. Still, 'Ben-Hur' is the only Hollywood film to make the Vatican approved film list in the category of religion, despite having scenes of him killing an innocent guard. However, the film does have other problems than the mixed messages, it was presenting. The book and the films have always been accuse of being too similar to the book, 'The Count of Monte Cristo' by author Alexandre Dumas to the point that some critics have stated out that the film is 'The Count of Monte Cristo meets Quo Vadis'. While, me, personal, I don't see much of anything comparable; some critics says, the film is ripping off, that premise, way too much. Regardless, I did like the changes by the many screenwriters, did, to couther, being too similar to the novel, like having Messala's vindictiveness be motivated by a sexual and romantic rejection as much as a political one. I'm one of the few people that, kinda like the somewhat hidden homoerotic overtones between Judah and Messala. I also love how Heston didn't know about this; adding an interesting uncomfortable dynamic to the tense dialogue scenes between the two actors. It adds some spice and realism that was really needed for this period film. I also like how the film, add symbolism to the ocean scenes and also cut other things, like the character of Ira from the novel. I always felt that the scenes with her, was time-wasting. On top of that, the other changes like having Judah's sister being the one who dislodge the roof tile & how they treat Messala after the climatic chariot race were equally as important. However, the movie still have pacing issues. 212 minutes running time is way too long. While, I get why, the soul-stirring scenes of Christ's birth and crucifixion was needed, as it provide biblical bookends for MGM's action-packed epic. I think the outdated, theatrical overture & intermission sequence should had been delete in future releases. If anything, scenes like Judah declines the race at times, even after he learns that Messala will also compete, could had been delete as well, as the famous chariot race sequence did happen, later on the film, regardless of Judah wanting to do it or not. It felt like filler. Despite that, the climactic chariot race, which includes collisions, men dragged under chariots, bloody injuries, and intensely suspenseful competition, was so impressive in the stunt work & make up that it set new standards for action-filmmaking without modern cinematic razzle-dazzle. It was very surprising to hear that nobody got kill or seriously hurt. The colorful 1959 version was the most expensive film ever made up to its time, and the most expensive film of the 50s decade. Shot on the grand scale of $15 million, the film took six years to prepare, and over a half year in production, it was a tremendous make-or-break risk for MGM Studios. Luckily, for them, the project, ultimately saved the studio from bankruptcy as it became a box office hit, earning three times more than it took to make. Does it hold up? Yes, while it's slow at times, and some of the acting feels now, mannered, stiff, and awkward like Hugh Griffith in blackface. It still worth the praise and achievements, it got, when it first released. It still has great acting from all the cast, including more physically than emotionally compelling Heston, amazing color widescreen cinematography from Robert Surtees, beautiful music from composter Miklós Rózsa & wonderful costumes from Elizabeth Haffenden and her crew. However, this movie might be too intense to be rated G, even at the time. After all, this movie has a leper colony where two principles characters are shown with open, rotting sores and a few men drowning in the ocean battle. If anything, it could be rated PG or PG-13 now. Regardless of that, I have say, Ben-Hur is one of the ultimate epics movies of all time. A legendary movie that needs to be rewatch, time after time again. Highly recommended.",9,15,19,18 April 2017
Toy Story 3," Literally the toys are us!!!
","There are movies from our childhood that continues to make an impact on us, even when we're adults. This movie directed by Lee Unkrich is one of those. Unlike the 'Shrek' franchise that became a shell of its former self. The 'Toy Story' is a movie series that continues to get better with each film added to it. Yet, I really, hope this is the end of 'Toy Story' trilogy, because any fourth movie will not live up to this. Debuting in 1995, Pixar's 'Toy Story' introduce us to the world of 3D computer animation. Most 90's children will remember where they were when Toy Story came out. Some of us were like Andy playing with mixed match toys, making our own adventures with them. When Toy Story 2 came out,(1999) some of us were in middle school or high school and slowly the toys were become less and less interesting to us similar to Jesse (Joan Cusack) retelling of Emily in Toy Story 2. Fast further to 2010, and we watch Toy Story 3. The movie series that we saw during our childhood has gotten better since then. Surprising, when I got there, I thought I would be swamped by little kids who knew little about Toy Story, but it wasn't like that. I saw many of young and mid 20's years old who grew up watching this movie there watching this movie and every moment of the film made us remember our own childhoods. If you haven't watch Toy Story 1 or 2, you might want to watch them, before entering into this movie. The start of the movie was very interesting, and it's really pit the nostalgia feeling in this movie, as it remind us of the beginning of Toy Story 1. It made us seems like we were there growing up with Andy. Andy doesn't play with most of his toys anymore since he has grown up and move on to better things like college. His sister, Molly seems to be more... let's just say she was nicer when she was a baby. Most of the gang can't get that through their plastic skulls that both are out of that stage of play. Well, at less, Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) are still there with the normal supporting cast minus a few characters. I don't care about Weezy, but why Bo-Peep? Plus, no explaining why she isn't there. The gang felt abandoned and when they were mistaken for trash. They wanted out and move out of Andy's house and into in a daycare center lead by Lotso (Ned Betty). His present on film remind me of a mixed character between Cool Hand Luke's Warden (1967), Dr. Moreau from Island of Dr. Moreau (1977), and Jabba the Hut from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983). He is a very great actor and he really gives this character depth, and made us feel pity for the character when a flashback of his past came to view. Lotso's second in command is a Ken-doll (Michael Keaton) tries to make the new toys feel welcome in their new home. This character will become a gay icon similar to Cher. Big Baby was creepy, but he did have a great role in the film as the enforcer. His presence in the film might scare little children, so do warn. From all the new characters, Dolly (Bonnie Hunt) is my favorite. Soon, they find out that the day-care is not the ideal place they think it is, and more like a prison. Now it's on, as Andy's toys must find a way to escape. There were a lot of good jokes. Look out for a lot of Hispanios jokes. The action scenes in the film were great as well, most likely the last action scene in the film. I forgot it was a Disney movie at that point, and totally forgot I was watching a cartoon in that scene. It was really heart pounding.There is a lot of tear jerking moments in this film. Without giving much away, just note the ending of the film is heart breaking that will leave you crying. Overall review: it seems to be the darkest of all the films, audience seems to like the gritty darkest to films as of late, but the running theme of abandonment, concentration camp like places and near incineration might turn off others as depressing. Still, a good movie. Overall, an great movie 9 out of 10.",9,4,6,31 July 2012
Space Jam," Yes, I know this movie has some bugs, but it's still my Jam! It's a guilty pleasure of mine!
","There's been a lot of variations of the classic Looney Tunes characters over the years, but the 1990s reincarnation has caused the most controversy, due to its bloated use of commercialism marketing. There is no bigger example of that, than 1996's 'Space Jam' directed by Joe Pytka; a giant glorified marketing ploy to sell Looney Tunes toys and Air Jordans. It was no surprise that the feature-length movie was like that, seeing how a series of Nike commercials starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in the early 1990s, was the source that spark the idea for this movie. Despite that, I still kinda like this movie. I didn't mind the commercialism style as much as others, maybe, because this obviously produce placement film did had somewhat of interesting story. Don't get me wrong, on the surface level, Michael Jordan teaming up with the Looney Tunes to face cartoony aliens in a basketball game, in order to save them from slavery in an intergalactic amusement park is indeed ridiculous & somewhat stupid. However, there seem to be, some thought provoking, undercurrents themes, running through this fictional film that could had been great. Let's start with father & son dramatics that the beginning of the film established! It was very heartfelt. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do anything with that, as the relationship with his father is never brought up, again. I think the movie could be better, if the film explore their relationship more, because we know from real life, that Jordan retired from the NBA to pursue the dream of his late father who was murdered in 1993, who had always envisioned his son as a baseball player. Sadly, the film doesn't give that exposition, making the baseball subplot, more out of the blue. Just think if they did, there would be a great conflict for his character, as Jordan tries to honor his late father's wishes, despite, not being any good in the sport, while also trying to fight the urge to play basketball, again, so that he can make a living for his family due to financial problems. I guess, mentioning Jordan father's death was too dark for this 1990s kid movie, but just think, if this film had a little more 'balls'. It would give this film, a little more stakes. Also, I wish, the movie gave a better reason, why Jordan was helping the Tunes, besides the villains bullying the tunes and him. Honestly, the movie could had intermixed, Jordan's children, a lot better with the Looney Tunes basketball plot, by having them, be abducted by the aliens and taken to Moron Mountain after Bugs seek his help. It would add some really needed stakes. Yes, I know, the kidnapped plot would be clichés, but it's better than the pointless scene, that we got of them, helping Bugs Bunny (Voiced by Billy West) & Daffy Duck (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), search for basketball shorts. All of these ideas, would help make Jordan, feel less drywall than he is, in this movie. Without it, Jordan's bad acting is more noticeable, due to his limitedly. I would rather see him, attempt being dramatic, than seeing him, such a square in this film. Despite that, I have to say, the animation department at Warner Bros did a great job, making it seem like Jordan was really interacting with the Looney Tunes. In the field of animation, the film is almost in par, with 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Still, I wish the humor in this film could be, a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some funny moments, but there's some off-color humor, that didn't need to be there. Also, some of the slapstick jokes, during the game were a little too childish for Looney Tunes. In the end, I just wish, the movie could had play more on the satire part of the cartoon series, more. One miss opportunity was making fun of the concept of Moron Mountain. It would had been entertaining to see the Looney Tunes poke fun at the idea of selling their souls out for an amusement park. It could had a Six Flags/Marriot Park vibe to it. Regardless of the lack of satire humor, Looney Tunes characters were amusing. However, I wish the filmmaker gave new character, Lola Bunny (Voiced by Kath Soucie), a little more personality, than being a token objectified hot rabbit. She seem a bit one-dimensional. Anyways, I have to say, the voice acting for the tunes, is pretty damn accurate to the original voice actors. As for the live acting actors; Bill Murray's cameo was indeed a highlight. The deadpan, don't give an f*ck attitude to the animated madness going on around him provide some of the biggest laughs, toward the end. However, surprising, it was the other professional basketball players that takes the cake for best jokes. Seeing the players going through series of embarrassing moments was pretty hilarious. I can't say, the same with Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak, whom comes across, as too annoying for his own good. The numerous close shots with him, made me, want to turn off the movie. As for the number of NBA stock footage, quickly being flash during the credits. I didn't mind it, but I can understand, if somebody get really ill. That sequence was indeed, seizure epilepsy due to how photosensitive, it was. Still, that upbeat rap by Quad City DJ that came with it, was pretty awesome. The other songs in the soundtrack like 'I Believe I can Fly' by R. Kelly & 'Fly like An Eagle' By Seal was equally as extraordinary. I hope the rumor sequel with LeBron James has songs, just as memorable as the original. Overall: Even with its flaws, Space Jam, for better or for worse, is just so outrageous, you can't help, being drawn to it. I just can't help, loving it. It's just one of those movies.",6,4,6,21 May 2017
Signs," This is a bad sign, M. Night Shyamalan. A really bad sign!
","Written and directed by the India-born director M. Night Shyamalan, this religious film cloaked in horror science-fiction garb was the beginning of the end of the director success in the box office. While, this movie didn't tank, it did get a lot of mixed messages from critics. For me, this movie wasn't that entertaining. It was really bland & disappointing. The movie tells the story of an ex-minister turn farmer, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) whom homestead might be the site of an oncoming alien invasion. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the settling of this film is indeed scary. However, along with the alien invasion plot, comes a moral journey of a man's loss of faith and the circumstances that help him regain his faith. This part of the film, really undermine the other plot, by making it, confusing and too complex for the general audience. Due to the miscommunication of these two separate stories, whenever the two parts try to mash together, it didn't work. A good example of this is the whole idea of aliens invading a planet, full of water, when they're supposedly hate water. Now, it would make a lot more sense, if these creatures were demons from hell, and they were invading a desert region? Better yet, if the film told us, that the chemicals in the water kills the aliens, not the water, but the movie doesn't give enough subtext to make it seem that way. Another is the fact that these creatures can't seem to open any doors. Wouldn't it make sense, if the film show us, that the reason why these supposedly, technologically advanced aliens can't get through the doors, is because, they are fallen angels!? After all, there is a verse in Exodus; where God told Moses to have the blood of an unblemished lamb put on the sides and tops of the door posts of all the Israelites, so the spirits will not killed their firstborns? It's would match better, than the way, Shyamalan badly wrote about it. In the end, this story makes it looks like these aliens possess traverse space, but lacks common sense and strategy when it comes to opening doors, and avoiding water. It's uneven. Even the whole idea of crops circles being first a hoax, only to find out that its real debate is questionable, at best. It still doesn't make sense, why they would do that. Unless, the aliens were too stupid, in attempting peaceful first contact, but lousiness, mess it up. Even, the human characters are somewhat idiotic. It's weird that they saw, one of the creature trying to get in the house, through the roof, earlier in the film, only for them, to forget to board it, later, when the home was getting attack by the aliens. That's bad! While the story doesn't cite itself as such, there are a large number of similarities between Signs and the 'Hopkinsville Goblins' event in 1955. It's quite possible Shyamalan drew on it for inspiration, whether it's a true story or a hoax is largely immaterial to the movie. All, I know, is this movie has very-very-slow plot development pacing with large amount of psychological dialogue and little action. Yes, I know, this is meant to build the tension, but gee, it was hard to get through. Another thing that suck, about this movie is the acting, or in this case, the lack of acting. The creepy, bland, non-expressive reply from the children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) is so clichés. Honestly, what type of children, act like that? Even, the crazy, full of emotions, Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix was flat and boring. Nobody really shines. I think, the only things that kinda shine in this film is the music by composer James Newton Howard, the sound effects, and the visuals. Shyamalan's visual style, and in particular, his use of the long take and the following aspects of his mise en scène, his use of 'reflected images' and mirroring effects, is somewhat amazing. It set up, the uncomfortable mood or unworldly environment, so well. It heighten intense moments. Overall: While Signs contains the semantics of the science fiction and horror elements film. It's more of a message film that somewhat got lost, between the phrases of writing from script to screen. I really don't recommended watching. Unless, you like want to figure out the subtext of the film, or like really bad movies. For me, I never want to see this film, again. I just swing away.",6,6,10,13 April 2016
The Deer Hunter," Oh Dear! This motion picture is not historical accurate at all. Despite that, it's still worth hunting for.
","This movie directed by Michael Cimino is supposed to be in-depth examination of the Vietnam War and how its events, impacts and disrupts the lives of three Russian American Soldiers in many ways, when returning back to their small industrial town in Pennsylvania. However, the characters in the film are more traumatic by having to play a game of 'Russian Roulette' than anything else, they witnessed. The film really lingers on that in the 3rd act, to the point, that the movie is probably best known as today, as the 'Russian Roulette' motion picture. It has caused some film scholars to question if the movie really deserve all that praise, as it hardly has to do with any real after effects that soldiers came home with from the war. Don't get me wrong, this movie was truly one intense watch. However, I have to somewhat agreed, the flick is indeed highly fictionalized & somewhat unrealistic. Without spoiling the motion picture, too much, the reason for that, is because this 1978 Academy Awards Best Picture Winner was loosely based, first on an unproduced screenplay called, 'The Man Who Came to Play' by authors, Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about a group of gamblers risking it all in Las Vegas, by playing Russian roulette. However, when producer Michael Deeley bought the screenplay, he hired director Michael Cimino & screenwriter, Deric Washburn, who hate each other, to work together to rewrite it. They did this, by having the deadly game take place in a Vietnamese Prison Camp between capture American soldiers, despite there being no documented cases of the game being played during the war. Regardless, those roulette scenes were shot in real circumstances, in dirty locations with the performers getting real beatings. The reaction from all the faces from all three principal actors, were somewhat genuine, especially Christopher Walken, who had no clue that he was getting slap for real. According to the director, the performers got so method with their acting, they requested, one real live cartridge in the revolver to heighten the intensity of the situation. That's totally insane! It's just as crazy to hear that Robert De Niro and John Savage mostly performed their own stunts, including the 30 foot drop fall into the river, 15 times in two days. They could had really got seriously hurt or even died. They almost did, as during a helicopter stunt, the skids caught itself on the rope bridge, nearly causing the copter to fall on two of the actors. They took a good amount of risk for actors deed too old for the ages, their character was supposed to be. Besides the stunts, the acting in this film is outstanding. There is no better example of this, than the 'One Last Shot' sequence. De Niro's emoting here, is ever brilliant, such a thoughtful performance. While, Walken's character just looks like a dead soul waiting for the body to followed. He's so hollow. What an amazing scene. Not to be outdone, the supporting cast were just as good as the main two. Despite, being a vague stock girlfriend character, Meryl Streep was fine in this role. Streep's then, boyfriend, John Cazale was also alright in the film. It's surprised me, to hear that he was very weak when filming began, due to being diagnosed with lung cancer. You really couldn't tell. Sadly, Cazale died shortly after filming was completed & never saw his work. Nevertheless, not all acting was praise, the film got some criticize on its one-sidedly portraying all the North Vietnamese as over the top sadistic racists and killers. Regardless of that, it's really hard to say, that this movie is an indeed a war film, when technically, the sequences involving Vietnam were a small part of the 183 minutes runtime. Most of the movie takes place, during a wedding. 51 minutes to be exact. Because of that, the movie's pacing has been claim to be, somewhat of a slowed burn to the point that Universal wanted the movie to be trim, even more. I somewhat agreed. Scenes like the drunk nude streaking could had been cut. Despite, the film going way over budget and overschedule. The movie is beautifully shot. There is no better example of this, than the deer hunting scene & the depressing climax involving 'God Bless America'. Overall: In spite of backlash from some Vietnam Veterans & War Historians who protest the film during its one theater released. The film was indeed successful enough at Oscars, that Universal Pictures widened the distribution to include major cities. It became a box office success. It made the bucks. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. That's how important, this film, has become to some people. For me, the over amount of praise for this movie is bit much. It's like, some critics don't mention, this film's big flaws in their reviews. Regardless of that, the movie is still worth watching. 'The Deer Hunter' might have starts out slow, but in the end, it's big bang. Highly recommended, checking it out.",8,8,9,12 February 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Chim Chim Cher-ee, this movie is a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious movie!
","Saving Mr. Banks is the first Walt Disney's company film that takes itself very serious as a dramatic sophisticated comedy historical piece. It's better than any subsidiaries films that Touchstone or Hollywood Pictures put out in a long time. I can't believe how mature this movie is. There is no other film like this from Walt Disney Company besides their documentary films that tackle such adult-theme driven subject matter about their history in the movie business. I wouldn't say, this movie is a family friendly film, due to its dark subject and adult-theme driven matter, but WOW, I have to say this movie knows how to give the audience, a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down in the most delighted way. At first, I thought this movie was going to be paint Walt Disney like saint, when the company produced it, but it's so unlike that. The studios didn't sanitize Walt Disney at anyway. You see Disney curse, drink, smoke, and most of all, backstabbed. In this film, there are scenes that fans of Walt Disney and anti-Disney would love. The movie directed by John Lee Hancock centered on the development of the 1964 Walt Disney Studios film Mary Poppins, and the conflicts between the book author P.L Travers (Emma Thompson) and filmmaker Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) on where the film should go. I would greatly advice to see that movie, before seeing this, so you don't get confused. Both are equally in love with Mary Poppins, the source book material. Walt Disney wants to make the film to show love to his daughter, while P.L Travers wants to keep it all for herself as a memorial of her own father play by Colin Farrell in flashbacks. Walt Disney wanted Mary Poppins, a musical animation film, while P.L Travers wanted a dark Ronald Dahl's type live action movie. It's easy to say, Saving Mr. Banks is a movie about making a movie, but it has deeper themes than that. In a sense, the movie is mostly more rooted in the conflict between interpretations of what people view as naïve optimism escapists versus nihilism realism beliefs. Both Walt Disney & P.L Travers react to past pains different and it shows in their actions and their works. Tom Hanks, while not too much looking like the real life Disney, pulls it off. In real life, Tom Hanks is a distant cousin to the Disney family. You can't help, being happy every time, he is on screen even if you know it is Tom Hanks playing Walt Disney. After a while, you forget that, and see Disney there. While, I would had love to see more about Disney's personal life and maybe more hints of his well-known controversial nature. I think the movie does a fair adaptation of what Walt Disney might had been during that time. I think those who think he was anti-Semitic, racist or fascist might want to take a closer look at his life by researching rather than criticizing this film with faults accusations. This film isn't about Disney, at all. It's not his bio-pic. Indeed, this movie is mostly about P.L Travers's story. Emma Thompson is great as the always unhappy, strict, negative P.L Travers. Some people might not like the movie due to her unlikeable nature, but with a great positive supporting casting roles from Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, B.J Novak, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell surrounded her, you can feel the love that they all had for the project. I can see any of these supporting actors or main actors getting Oscars for their roles. Never once did I thought, her character went too far out, that make me not care for her tragedy life story. She indeed had some of the best mean-spirited one liners in the film and some lovely heart-felt moments with the crew making the film. In real life, P.L Travers never lightened up, and went so far to say, she hate the final copy of 1964's Mary Poppins. We don't see that in the film, but the movie doesn't hide the fact, she might had hate it with all her scorning. Like, Walt Disney, I think the movie gives a fair adaptation of the real P.L Travers. She was a lot worst in real life. At less, the movie doesn't show the harsh relationship between her and her son like in some versions of the script has. It would make her look too evil. In my opinion, the movie, Mary Poppins is a lot better than the book version. While the great satire and subtle humor of the book is great. I have to say, Travers was truly wrong about the picture. The anti-feminist ending as she call it, wasn't anti-feminist at all. The animation was ground breaking and the songs were charming. Without Mary Poppins great success, we wouldn't had the great Pirate of the Caribbean ride that was pay by Mary Poppins success in the box office. Without that ride, we wouldn't get the great film series. So it was a win-win. Now for this movie, pacing. It is pretty good, but it seems that the series of flashbacks depicted Travers' turn of the century youth in Australia seem like a different movie than that of the 1960's California settling. Both the locations of Australia and Southern California were beautiful to watch. I love the wardrobe in this film. The soundtrack is amazing. It's nice to hear the Sherman Brother's music for Mary Poppins, again. I adore Thomas Newman's score. Overall: a great cheery, upbeat movie with a very dark undertow.",8,4,6,6 January 2014
Jojo Rabbit," This motion picture is All Reich. I kinda like JoJo Rabbit.
","A satire black comedy about making fun of Nazis is always going to be funny in my book; despite some people feelings about uncomfortable laughing at the subject matter. After all, 1940 Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece 'The Great Dictator' is one of my favorite movies of all time. Since humor is subjective some people might still find this movie a bit unfunny regardless if it has Nazis or not. On the other hand I really doubt that peace loving musicians like the Beatles found it funny to see the German version of their pop songs be turned into a represented of fascist cult of personality culture. Maybe David Bowie, but who knows. Nevertheless director Taika Waititi still went down the rabbit hole and delivered a surreal surface level humorous look of what life was like for the citizens of Nazi Germany by telling the story of young Hitler Youth member, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) finding out his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. Without spoiling this coming to age journey based on author Christine Leunens's book 'Caging Skies' too much, Waititi indeed put a rabbit out of his hat and delivered an unexpected magic trip through World War 2 in a boyhood whimsy child's perspective. The screenplay also written by the director didn't felt as bleak and harden as the more adult like writing approach the source material had. The film's story felt more dream like. The movie is also beautifully shot. There were several lingering shots focus intently on the mother's distinctive shoes foreshadowing future events that was a really nice touch. It's just too bad that it's really hard to figure out the timeline of events were as historical accuracies was somewhat tossed out of the window. Honestly for a director who explicitly did zero research on Adolf Hitler, he was also fine in his acting as the make believe friend version of the dictator who eat unicorn and smokes too much. While the whole imaginary best friend was not in the source material. The scenes with him and JoJo were charming, but also somewhat disturbing when it has to be to overlook that. It wasn't as deliberately light hearted vapid silly and corny offensive as 1990 British sitcom 'Heil Honey! I'm Home' which was cancelled after one episode. The filmmaker did show how brutal his teachings can honest be with the rabbit killing allegory scene. Much in the same way Walt Disney 'Education for Death: the Making of the Nazi' cartoon did in 1943. Nor does the filmmaker shy away from the many crimes that the Nazis had competed. The powerful emotional hanging scene is one such example. The way it was shot with shot of the feet lying lifeless is haunting. Then there was the intense suspenseful sequence involving the Gestapo led by a sinister agent Deertz played by Stephen Merchant coming to the titular character's home for a visit. That was very creepy. The film also even challenge the concept of war with JoJo challenge his mother's lack of patriotism. That scene with the mother acting like the father with the soot and her not breaking character in order to apologize for yelling is really commanding. Scarlet Johannsson's acting really capture that moment even if her character didn't seem so traditional mother like. It's very emotional and heart breaking. You really do see JoJo start to question his beliefs after that. So begins a tense, complex, and at times hilarious series of exchanges between Elsa brilliant played by McKenzie & himself. Roman's acting is truly amazing for somebody that young. Glad they made JoJo somewhat likeable. The character here is a lot more sympatric than the source material version who kept Elsa a slave for years after the war because he couldn't cope with losing. Also glad that the filmmaker didn't make them hate each other in the end like the book due to the confusion of possession for love. That was too much of a downer. Regardless one thing I didn't really get was what they were going with his mentorship with Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). I felt like that subplot got lost. Don't get me wrong, Rockwell's acting is pretty good as the tired bitter injury ex- Wehrmacht soldier, but what was the endgame for him. One minute he seem like he is bad mouthing the party's policies during the war during a lecture at the youth camp and turning a blind eye in order to protect JoJo from the Gestapo, but in the end, he's still fighting for the party. I guess it can be said that his loyalty is with protecting Germany, not the Nazis but it's not really explore or explain. It's difficultly to find a read on that character. It's frustrating but not quite hopping mad. I also found Archie Yates portrayal as Yorki, Jojo's best friend very amusing. However I felt that the character didn't have much to do besides spill exposition and be comedy relief. In truth a more tragic ending for him could had been really powerful for the film; much in the same way Piggy met his end in William Golding's novel 'The Lord of the Flies' showing the end of childhood's innocence. Still the movie was push the envelope enough. It didn't really play it safe. Overall: It's a pretty good film. The flick's messages about acceptance and tolerance is just as needed now as it did in 1945. There is a lot to relate to today's modern society. In the end, it's a wonderful motion picture that needs to be seen. So hop onto it & check it out!",8,4,10,20 December 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Can Lightning strike twice? Yes. Thor: The Dark World was as good as the original film.
","Thor: the Dark World was action pack to the point that indeed it was the God of Thunder. My ears hurts after this movie. Louds of exploding sounds. Unlike the first movie, where Thor lost his power, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in this film is more God-like, and mature. Thor isn't learning anything new as a human being, or being taught a lesson in this movie. It just Thor trying to stop an alien invasion, yet again like 2012's Avengers. Indeed, comic book fans would like to see Thor do more Thor things and they got it. In my opinion, I like character development, and this movie lacks that. The movie plot is bit too confusing and silly for me. The aliens trying to conquer the Universe with a weapon known as Aether seem one-dimension villains who just happen to be just evil. After all they are call Dark Elves. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) played a competent bad guy and I was really disappointed by his performance. I really wanted him to stand out more. Even with me, reading some of the Thor comic books, knowing a few Norse mythology, and watching the previous films, I did find myself, coming in lost. I can only guess, what first time people were thinking coming into the film, they must be asking themselves, what in the hell are we watching? The movie does an OK job, telling the backstory of the plot, and then to repeat it time after time just to make sure, but even with that, as a first time Thor watcher, you might find yourself confused. Unlike the original film that takes place mostly on Earth, in this film, most of scenes take place in the CGI world-building nine realms worlds of Norse mythology. The worlds is a lot better, than the first movie as I thought Asgard look so fake in the CGI due to all the shine crap. Asgard is supposed to look old, grittier and dirty like Vikings. It been there for thousands of years. Glad to see the film, wasn't in Dutch angle that much this time. In this film, it remind me of bit of Lord of the Rings, as more details are added to the mixed. After all, there was even a language created for the Dark Elves. Still, the Shakespeare dialogue got to the point, I was not only getting lost, but tune out. Hard to relate to the main characters, when nothing about them, is even relates to the real world. I found myself, trying to escape this world, but the dialogue is so bland. Yes, the film did had lot of humor. Mostly the same fish-out-of-water jokes from the first film. It was a hit or miss. They even made Thor look more like a meatball than the previous films. They did give Loki (Tom Hiddleston) most of the best lines in the film. I have to say that when Thor has to team up with Loki against his newest threat, it was some of the best scenes in the film. They had this buddy cop thing going for them. I think Marvel really did hit the gold mine with the actor because he does bring some really need charm, and humor to a really out of place world. I think the ladies in the room even like his presence. Most of the humor, came in the form of a side-character that fans of the first movie kinda didn't like which is Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning). In this movie, she is given more annoying scenes, but at less she kinda has a reason to be in the film. I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of the character as her scenes feel like filler scenes that has nothing to do with the main plot. The female leads seems really weak in this film. In my opinion, I thought Thor and Loki had more screen connection, than Foster and Thor. Natalie Portman as the love-interest to Thor, Jane Foster, seem really to be phoning in her performance, here. I really doubt, Portman really gave much of herself in acting for this role. She really seem like she didn't want to act in this picture. It was no surprised that on screen, her performance was mediocre. She nearly backed out, when Director Patty Jenkins was replace by director Alan Taylor. She refused to return for the sequel but she was forced to return due to her contract. I did like the surprise secrets cameos: look out for somebody a certain American to make his brief presence, creator Stan Lee and if you stay after the credits, a certain character from the 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy movie. There was some things, I didn't like. I didn't like the awful plot recycle similar to the Avengers film with Aether sounding like the same thing as the Tesseract AKA Cosmic Cube. Without spoiling too much, look out for a lot of recycle fake out deaths like the first movie, 'Thor'. So annoying as hell. I did like the action in the film. I like the portal action scene in the end. It was pretty interesting and funny seeing Thor's beloved supercharged hammer 'Molinjor' trying to find him. Watch it in 2D, the 3D added little of worth. Overall: The movie is a little far fetch even for a comic book movie as Thor has always been a hard character to get people into liking him, but it works here to a point. At least, if they cut like 30 minutes of the film. This deeply cheesy cartoonish, extremely noisy action movie that's drowning in CGI was not the worst comic book film, in my opinion. It was a feel good fun fantasy escape movie. It work as a good filler film before the next Avengers film.",7,4,7,11 November 2013
Lucy," This movie felt like it was using less than 10% of their brain capacity. It wasn't smart, yet it was outrageous fun to watch
","While, the movie did entertain me: I found the premise to be really dumb. I can't believe that certain people still believe in the myth, that human beings only use 10% of their brains. Everybody should had known by now, that the ten percent myth likely arose from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of how the brain works. If neurological research have taught us, anything, if we did use only 10% of our brains, we will, clearly be dead or in a vegetable state. It's clear, that the other 90% is there, to keep us alive. While the film's very premise is indeed very fallacy, this film wasn't such a headache for me. In my opinion, it was more entertaining to watch, than 2011's Limitless that had a similar concept. While, movies like Limitless kept the increase intelligent genre, somewhat grounded. This movie delivered it, way over the top. Directed by Luc Besson, Lucy tells the story of Lucy Miller (Scarlet Johansson) a young American studying in Taiwan who gets kidnapped by gangsters and force to be a drug mule for them. They surgically implant a parcel of super-drugs inside her, but after the package bursts, Lucy's brain capacity increases at a feverish rate, endowing her with mental and physical abilities far beyond those of mere mortals. Can the mob stop her or will Lucy become a Goddess that nobody can stop? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that the whole god-like capable to be pretty cool. The only problem with that, is that nobody in the film seem like a serious threat to her. If only one of the villains was smart or suicidal enough, to take the drug CPH4, the same way, as Lucy, maybe we would have somewhat of an interesting really cool movie. I really hate that, this MacGuffin is rarely used, by other characters. Scarlet Johansson is alright in the role. It's clear, by now, that she's one of the coolest & newest leading ladies in action films. I just wish, they didn't give her, such silly lines at times. A good example is Lucy's phone call to her mom. It's supposed to feel heartfelt and even a bit wrenching, but it comes across as goofy, and a bit disturbing. Honestly, who says, I can still taste your milk to their mom!? For somebody, who's supposed to be smart; she says some of the dumbest things. After Lucy gets the drug in her system, she expresses little to no emotion for the remainder of the film, only speaking in exposition. It's alright to show that the character is becoming less human, but don't make it too dull and unlikeable. Not only that, she also does a few illogically things that make you, wish it was better written. A good example is her reckless driving through Parisian streets. Honestly, if she was that powerful, wouldn't she just make her, car fly over the traffic? It doesn't make any sense for her to waste time, here. Another thing, I didn't like the movie is the misused of Morgan Freeman. He wasn't really needed, when you think about it. I didn't like that he had to be there to repeat the same exposition or give us, information that wasn't needed. This movie treats its audience as if they're idiots. The movie tries really hard to seem smart, by copying 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but unlike Stanley Kubrick, Luc Besson delivers it's symbolism in such a clumsy way. Honestly, is all the natural stock footage, really needed to prove a point? Did we really need to see laughable footage of animals having sex with each other? Did we need to see a clip of mouse trap to get that Lucy is about to walk into a trap!? Come on, movie. Be a little clever with it! Despite that, some of the stock footage was somewhat, beautiful to watch. I love how he shot his wide frame with colorful cityscapes. The movie also have some sweet action set-pieces with some good CGI effects. The violence gets fairly graphic, with lots of shoot outs and blood splattering everywhere. So heads up on that. It somewhat reminds me of 2010's Inception in some scenes. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen almost all the action sequences in the film. Overall: I have always been a fan of higher intelligent Sci-fiction movie since seeing 1968's Charly & 1996's Phenomenon in a young age, and this movie kinda works in the same way. It's a fun movie that you might have to suspension your disbelief to find, watchable. Mediocre movie with a very undeveloped story.",6,3,7,8 April 2015
The Sixth Sense," Have some common sense. Go get the Sixth Sense. It's a horror masterpiece!
","According to director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, the idea of making a horror movie about children seeing ghost; first came to him, while watching an old 1990's Nickelodeon show called 'Are You Afraid of the Dark: titled, 'Tale of the Dream Girl' (1994), directed by David Winning. Hoping to capitalize on that success, he wrote and pitch a similar idea to studios as a kid movie, until rewrites made the script's subject matter, more mature and harder to sell. That's until, the most unlikeable of sources, came to him, looking to buy it, which was Walt Disney Studios. It seem that then-president of production, David Vogel read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the high price tag of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. While, Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and apparently show little confidence in the film value, by selling the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining a few distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt. They still greenlit the project and gave their share. Lucky for them, the film was the biggest jackpot gamble win of all time, becoming one of biggest box-office hits of the 1990s. The reasons, why everybody loves it, are very clear. The film's chilly astrosphere, acting, and unexpected twist ending are some of the best moments, cinema can give you. It was a very memorable movie from a then-unknown director. The story of redemption was also great, with 'Six Sense' telling the story of a once-prideful disheartened child psychologist, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), dedicated himself, by trying to cure a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) from being traumatic by the spirits of the dead. Without spoiling the movie, too much, after watching this film the first time through without spoilers, it is almost impossible to watch it again without seeing obvious foreshadowing, during the second watch. Still, this movie has a lot of rewatch value. I love how the movie has a Hitchcockism/Kubrickism feel to it, as there was a lot of carefully devised storytelling, going on here with the visuals without using too much dialogue. Some great examples are, how the color red was prominent whenever the worlds of the living and the dead came together, follow by visible cold breathing and shivers. Wonderful use of foreshadowing. Added to the tension that is already brought by the wonderful make up effects, sound mixing and haunting soundtrack by composer, James Newton Howard. Another brilliant example of visuals using as foreshadowing, is how everybody's clothes seem heavy wore, their normal hair seem a bit grey/white, and how they barely interact with their surroundings. I like how the filmmaker were very careful, not to spoil the clues of the true state of any of the characters, too much. They were even worry that Cole's iconic, and highly quoted, revealed at the hospital might have spoil the movie for everybody. Lucky for them, most of the audience still, didn't see the twist coming. Another magnificent thing, Shyamalan does well is using reflecting surfaces such as glasses, mirrors, windows, and other reflecting surfaces for a slew of dramatic and thematic reasons. You really get to see, good examples of that, whenever, Malcolm is looking at his depressed wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). Nevertheless, perhaps the best shot in the film, at least for me, was the extreme close-up of the bright silver door knob in the 3rd act with a distorted image of Cole. It was both scary and clear transparent to a positive change. It's great to see, a horror movie, that doesn't end with a downer. Another great use by the director, was the idea of using long take to establish important character relations. We see this, compositional strategy, during the first official meeting between Cole and Malcolm. Not only, does it build a special bond between the two leads, but it gives the impression that Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) and Malcolm were perhaps are at the end of a conversation about him. Almost tricking the audience. Nevertheless, if they did talk, the dialogue would had been cheesy. As much, as I love, everybody acting, particular Osment. Some of the lines, they were given to say, were a bit silly. A good example of this, was any of the scenes with Lynn and Cole. Seeing them, argue and later, embrace in the car about a Bumble-bee Pen felt a little odd and humorous. It wasn't as intimacy as it should be for me. Still, Toni Collette has said that she was so moved by the emotional resonance of the story while filming, she did not even realize it was a horror film until after its release. Anyway, I think the scenes with Malcolm and Anna, had a more emotional impact on me, than any of the scenes with the Sears interacting with each other. Overall: While, the dialogue writing isn't the best and can be highly spoof by later films. Not even, the awful director cameo by M. Night can hurt this movie. Regardless of what you know, think of M. Night Shyamalan's work since this film. His first horror movie is often viewed as one of the best, and I have to agree. It's worth checking out.",9,3,4,19 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Chewie! We're home! Star War: the Force Awakens is a Force to be reckoned with!
","The 'Star Wars' film series is so engrained in our pop-culture, that even the rarest of movie fans have heard of it. There is no way in escaping from it! Several generations of people had gone through, at least one of the six films (1977-2005) in their lifetime. After all, the first 3 films (1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) are often seen as the great examples what the ultimate cinema experience was meant to be. While, the chronologically recent 3 prequels releases (1999: Star Wars: Phantom Menace, 2002: Attack of the Clones & 2005: Revenge of the Sith) were somewhat mostly critically hatred. Can 2015's Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens fined a balance in the force? Can it live up to the hype and the high standard of movie goers, everywhere? The answer is a clear yes! Yes, it's better than the prequels, but no, it's not as good as the originals. What it is, however, is a promising start. The Force Awakens indeed awoken the long dormant Star Wars fan-boy in me. It's nearly a cinematic masterpiece with a few flaws. I wouldn't say, the movie is perfect. After all, The Force Awakens has the unenviable task of reintroducing audiences to a beloved cinematic universe isn't an easy task for anybody. Like the original 3 films, none of them were perfect. When you take off your nostalgia goggles, you will see the films for what they truly are, incredibly well-made, extremely fun, smarter-than-average blockbusters. Nothing more, nothing less, and after watching this film, you can put it in that level. I have to say that director JJ Abrams and his crew really did pull it off. With that said, the story is a mixed bag for me. It's a bit predictable. Set 32 years later, the events of Return of the Jedi, the galaxy's greatest hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished. In his wake, a new threat arises, from the defeated Galactic Empire. Now call, The First Order; they attempts to rule the galaxy through power and fear. Only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them. Can they stop the threat, while also try to rediscover the true reason, why their galaxy's greatest hero, sudden exile from society? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, like JJ Abrams's last movie 2013's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the movie story is bit of a copy and paste rethread of familiar older films story beats with some differences in the way, in the, it's told. It can be a bit nagging with the 60 year timeline being call a myth, the movie being full of bad exposition spots, un-liking encounters with items and people, and it's lack of show don't tell moments, but for the most part, it does kinda work in establishing the connection from the new films to that of the old. They do somewhat work, together like emotional Han Solo (Harrison Ford) story arch. Make sure bring some tissue. Other moments, not so well. A good example is like how is there a Resistance movement, if the galaxy is once again, ruled by a Republic? Is the New Republic, some type of unseen villain that General Leia (Carrie Fisher) does not like? It doesn't make any lick of sense. The whole reason of conflict was a little awkward and a little unclear. One minute, they looking for maps for Luke, the next minute, it's about stopping a weapon from blowing up star systems. It's a bit flabby. Despite that, the original establishment cast were really great in their limited roles. It's really nice to see the characters back in the film, even the connection between them, wasn't well-established. However, I was disappointed by the lack of Luke Skywalker in the film. The new cast is just as good. Daisy Ridley as Rey, really was able to show the character's strong, capable, and courageous side, while also showing her weaknesses. She does match the role, very well. However, her character backstory wasn't really told, well. John Boyega's Finn was somewhat annoying, due to his mixed sense of morality, but for the most part, he works well in his means. For the most part, Adam Driver as the villain, Kylo Ren was alright, despite other critics might think of him. He show that he can easily be deeply conflicted, between doing what he feels is good and he feels he must do to keep the galaxy safe. From all of the new main characters, Poe Dameron is by far, the weakest. Oscar Isaac did well with the role, but I really didn't see much, character development within the film. In the supporting character side, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) with their limited time and acting. These are just a few nagging bits and pieces to them that hopefully will be further fleshed out in future installments, but for now, they are mostly likable and despicable as they are meant to be. They work well off each other and with the old cast, and have a lot of promise for their future growth. The action is well-paced in the film. Never a dull moment. It looks more brutal and realistic, than the previous films. However, the CGI squid alien attack wasn't really needed. Despite that, most of the visual effects were really stand out. I like how the studio preference for using real locations and miniature models over green-screens and computer-generated imagery. The film is more aesthetically, because of that. It does work. The film's score is by John Williams is just as amazing and enduring. Overall: Regardless, what I say in this review, and what critics say about this movie; everybody should see the newest Star Wars film. So find the force within you and check it out for yourself!",8,8,37,19 December 2015
Cinderella," Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo! This quintessential rags to riches story was kinda cool.
","Cinderella is one of the oldest, best known, and most universal stories in the world. The bare bones of the story are mostly the same with the Disney version directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson. The 12th canon film for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Cinderella tells the story a young noblewoman, Cinderella (Voiced by Ilene Woods), whom is forced to live with her crude & vindictive stepmother (Voiced by Eleanor Audley) when her parents died. Unable to get along with her step-family, they mistreat her by making her work as a servant. When the local prince (Voiced by William Phillips) holds a kingdom-wide ball, they refuse to let her attend, but she was able to go, when her fairy godmother (Voiced by Verna Felton) takes pity on her and outfits her for the ball. However, there is limit to the spirit's help: Cinderella must return by midnight. Can she win the heart of the prince or the limited time, be too much for her to overcome? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, the best known version of this story, is the one written by Charles Perrault in the 17th century call 'Cendrillion'. When you hear the name Cinderella, you think of fairy godmothers, glass slippers, and a pumpkin turned into a coach, you're thinking of Perrault. In the1950, Disney adapted Perrault's story into a movie, cementing it in people's minds as the 'truth' story of Cinderella. Not a lot of people know this, but this movie help save the Walt Disney Company from being bankrupt. At the time, Walt Disney Productions had suffered a big blow, when their European film market was cut off, due to the outbreak of World War 2. They were in debt, after high production films like 1940's Pinocchio, 1940's Fantasia, and 1942's Bambi weren't making a lot of money when they came out. Disney was limited to making collections of shorts while many of their staff were drafted to the war effort. It's Cinderella that save the company from bankruptcy. It's no wonder why the Cinderella Castle is one of the company's main logo. Since then, the popularity for this movie, has somewhat died down, as a lot of people saw the Cinderella story as alright at the time, but somewhat dated for the modern viewer. Then, you got those, modern viewers that really get angry, when you mention the name, Cinderella. Their beef against the film, was how the film is sexist, due to fact, that it portray women as hysterical servitude slaves who can only be rescue, by men or magical forces. I can understand, a bit, of what they were saying. Cinderella was indeed, somewhat a submissive and meek character, but she also has a fighter side. She did make a choice, to go to the ball, against the wishes of her crude Step-family. She did try to escape her abusive environment, toward the climax and despite the abuse and neglect she had gone through, she still remained kind and forgiving. Any normal person would have become cynical if they had gone through this, but she didn't. Yes, she got married at the end. But how does that make this movie less feminist? Being a feminist doesn't mean you hate men, so getting married didn't make her any less of a strong character. There is nothing wrong, with caring. I know that whole essays have been written ripping Cinderella apart, but those are some good examples of her being more than the submissive, servile archetype. Also is the Fairy Godmother really damaging to children, convincing them someone will solve their problems, or is she a symbol of hope? There has been many of brave, productive people that believe in higher powers, throughout history. I really doubt of any of them, were call fragile. Maybe we just need to admit we don't know the character as we think we do, and leave our interpretation of Cinderella up to the individual. However, this doesn't stop the movie, from having other faults; like how the movie is call Cinderella, but most of the screen time, is with the mice. Another is how Cinderella's looks win over the prince, over her personality. The two of them, have little to no chemistry. The film also fails to explain, how the magic works. Why doesn't the Fairy Stepmother step up and save Cinderella, earlier? Why does Cinderella's magic end at midnight? Why doesn't the glass slipper, disappear when the clock strikes midnight? Could Cinderella really the only person in the kingdom who the slippers could fit? These things, really needed some more exposition. Anyways, the animation is alright, but it definitely marked down to form, compare to the painstaking and extremely expensive animation techniques of the earlier films. The songs were pretty catchy. I love all of them, but some songs do go, way too long. The voice acting is alright, for the most part. However, the prince is the worst of them, all with his limited role. Glad, the movie nearly goes all Brother Grimm with the story. It never goes too gory. We don't see the stepsister's gruesome acts of self-mutilation of foot-binding and cutting off limps. Then later, them being blinded by birds. Still, I can wish, they kept the part of one that one of the step-sisters was slightly less mean than the other one. Anyways, parents need to know that this Disney classic is one that whole family can enjoy together. Even, if kids saw the film, they will likely already be familiar with Cinderella and her Disney Princess colleagues due to a massive marketing effort behind the ladies. Cinderella got not one, but 2 Directed-to-Video sequels: 2002's Cinderella II: Dreams Come True & 2007's Cinderella III's A Twist in Time. There is also a 2015 live action remake with the same name. Overall: while, not the best Disney movie, but it does have enough magic, to keep the magic going. Do recommended.",7,0,0,20 August 2015
Flight," it's turbulence to watch
","It's hard to say that this was a airplane movie by the opening scene which has close shots of nudity. The movie seem more like a porno at the first 5 mins, rather than a serious film. It had way too much nudity in that scene alone, that didn't serve no value to the plot, but shock value to the audience. It's here we meet, Captain Pilot William 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington) awaking up after having rough sex, and drugs with flight attendant (Nadine Velazquez) at a hotel room. Whip and Nadine then goes to their job, where it's turns into a frequent flyer's worst nightmare – trapped inside a plane in mid air that suddenly plummets towards the earth at an uncontrollable speed AKA Alaska Airlines Flight 261 type. The flight itself was intense, perfectly extremely realistic sequence shot for a few minutes ruin by horrible acting by Whit's co-pilot Ken Evans with over-dramatic laughable screaming. It was Whip that save the day miraculously maneuver the aircraft towards a crash landing. It's odd in a way, despite several vodkas and a line of coke, Denzel as Captain Whip Whitaker, pulls off some extraordinary maneuvers to glide the airliner to earth. It's out of place, as it's seems that Captain Whip can seem sober and orderly in some scenes, and other scenes, badly mumbling, stumbling and out there. The film shows the addicts in a way, by showing how raunchy and dirty they are, but also shows them as a cartoonish way too. Whip tends to able to drink large amounts of alcohol, that is unreasonable too much. Anybody who drinks as much as he portray to, would die of alcohol poisoning. Commercial U.S flight crew are regularly subjected to being breathalyzed and drug tested by the FAA but logic tossed that away, so we get the post-crash investigation instead. Conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), lead by Ellen Block (Melissa Leo) the investigation begins to reveal some troubling revelations about Whip and his higher than permissible BAO levels, which his attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and Union rep Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) are confident can be overlooked by his public hero status. Don Cheadle as the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, is great against Denzel's character. It's never establish why Whip really drinks, and I think it's hurts the film, a bit, not explaining it. We just see the negative results of it. Whip so unlikeable as a character, and most of the time, the film serve its audiences, disappointments after disappointments after he continues to fall from grace, and fail to live any moral value. He does try, but it's a lose and lose to the audience. We don't know whether to cheer for Whip to beat the rap, or be exposed as the fraud. Very difficult to sympathize with someone who would put his passengers in constant danger by being a chronic substance abuser. Though finely acted by Denzel Washingto. His character has few redeeming qualities and it's flat out hard to root for him, even in the clichéd ending that hurts the film. It's 'that' disappointment, that makes the film really hard to watch: 3/4 cruising altitude of the film, is nothing of lying his way after the plane crash. The supporting cast seems out of place too. Nadine's character serve little to the plot, odd to see her get top billing, as her character seem to be only there to be a sex object that Whip to screw. She's killed off quickly in the film, giving us Nicole (Kelly Reilly) a heroin addict for Whip to sleep with. The first quarter of the film, waste a lot of time for back story about her life, that wasn't needed as Kelly's character will tell us later in the film about when Whip starts to care for her. Their relationship seem rush, as both quickly falling in love seem out of place. Cancer patient character Derek Hogue (Dane Davenport) that comes and disappears for a few minutes for no reason to deliver cleaver funny and tell the addicts his new perspective on life. John Goodman as Harling Mays, Whitaker's Big Lebowski-esquire drug dealer that brings comedy. There is a horrible use of symbolism as the plane crashing into the church, the act of God, and the co-pilot beliefs. Christians are shown 'out there' and the film made fun of it. Although clever, dialog can be offend certain audience groups. Those who may be sensitive to alcohol situations may also be offensive with the film stereotypical visuals. Some of the dialogue, laced with some cursing, also may cross the line to make you very angry and distracted. Some people can handle a movie with foul language but there are a few scenes where it was just so vile that you couldn't help but feel awkward and cringe. Other than offensive stereotypes though, there are some other weaknesses to this movie. The pace of the movie is also slow. Anyone who thinks this is a disaster film will probably be surprised, & possibly disappointed. The end of the doomed flight is a perfect piece of suspense and tension. But that episode is not the theme of the film, and it's sadly tossed away in the first couple of minutes. Rather we get a standard-issue hard-luck story, but by the end you might not care whether the main character overcomes his obstacles or not, and that's not good.",6,3,7,11 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.
","While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichÃ©s and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking.",8,3,4,10 February 2016
Unbroken," Unbroken seem a little broken to me. It was mediocre, at best.
","Unbroken doesn't shows that a lifetime of glory, is worth a moment of pain, but it's semi-alright, because the will to live is strong with this movie. This historical biographic life story movie had been in development for nearly 60 years. At one time, even the great actor, Tony Curtis originally attached in the lead role. It was only made, after the phenomenal success of Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 novel, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption; which went on, to become a New York Times Bestseller. Soon, after this, actress Angelia Jolie show interest in turning the novel into a movie, with the movies studios backing, her claim as director. While, her skills as director are not that sharp, she was still able to product, a semi-alright film. It was well-shot, much thanks to Cinematographer Roger Deakins, but it felt like it was trying too hard to be Oscarbait. While, it didn't win any Oscars in 2014. It still had a strong opening for the last month of that year. The film revolves around the life of USA Olympian and athlete Louis 'Louie' Zamperini, (Jack O'Connell) during his time in World War 2. Without spoiling the movie too much, the movie is pretty historical accurate to Louis Zamperini's real life accounts of the war. Sadly, the later years of Zamperini's life are not mention in the movie, but can be read about in the latter chapters of Hillenbrand's book. Omitting Zamperini's fight against alcoholism and PTSD, as well as his Billy Graham-inspired religious conversion might seem wrong, because the audience don't see the happy redemption part, but I know Jolie wanted to spend the most time, with showing his near-death struggles during the war-years. After all, that's the meat of the story, and the movie run-time was already, getting a little long. The movie tries to hint, about all those omitted problems, but it doesn't work. It makes the movie so much more confusing, because it's missing those huge chucks of information. We don't know, much about his adult life. He's seem like a bland-boy scout caricature for the most part. Don't get me wrong, Jack O'Connell is fine actor, but they really didn't give him, much dialogue to work with. All, we know of him, based, just on the movie, is that he runs fast, and able to take a beating. We barely know anything about his personality. Another thing, we hardly see, is the supporting characters. All of his family or the co-pilots that he flew with; seem very much stock characters to me. They hardly gave, any useful exposition about Louie, nor help the scene, become memorable. I also didn't like, how the movie open, because it gave the movie, so really odd pacing. Jumpstarting the movie in the middle of the war, made the film, so chaotic. It's not good. The movie tries hard to tell the backstory, through flashbacks, but there so awkwardly, edited into the first part of the film that it barely match up, with what was happening on screen. While, the flashbacks did help show, how Louie became a runner; it doesn't show, how Louie the runner, became Louie the Airmen. Honestly, the movie would have, work better. if they only to focus, showing his life as a runner, first, then his time becoming an airmen, rather they showing him, already a airmen. I also didn't like, how the flashbacks stop, after the first act. It felt like a waste of a medium. They could had fit, so much more, in. The film really needed it. The first act is weak, because of it. It got really boring. The second part with the raft, really drags. While, it's shows how many days, Louie was stranded in the ocean, the movie tries too hard, being artsy that it forget to show much change in the characters. By the time, they are capture by the Japanese, the men barely have any facial hair, and still have somewhat clean enough clothes. It was really jarring. The last part of the film, was market the most, by trailers, making it seem like a survivor movie, but after watching this film, it felt more like torture porn. I really couldn't stand the Japanese actor, playing the Japanese prison of camp warden, Mutsuhiro 'Bird' Watanabe (Miyavi). He was so over-the-top. He's a guitar player and needs to stick with music. For a PG-13, the torture is pretty harsh and brutal. While, the book make it seem like, they were trying to make the Bird seem like, he hiding some sexual repression, toward Louie. The writers here, don't do it. The movie plays it, safe, by making him, into a one-dimensional stereotype villain. While, the movie says that the Coen Brothers help wrote the script, I really don't see anything in the film that has that Coen Brothers style. I think, the others writers, mostly rewrote a lot of Coen's earlier scripts. One big that I kinda hate about the film is the lack of score. The movie seem a little too eerily in how quiet, it was. I really didn't think composter Alexandre Desplat did a good job. While the movie has a pretty predictable outcome, there are still dangerous moments that might surprise you, and make you jump, wondering if he was going to live or die. Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. I think this is the best way to leave an imprint on yourself. Overall: While the movie barely left one on me. It wasn't, a bad movie, for sake. Just meh. Could had been better.",7,3,5,27 June 2015
The Purge," This movie will make you purge. By purge, I meant more like hurl vomit.
","Don't get me wrong, it's not a boring film or not that bad of a film. It was pretty entertaining, but it's nothing new. It was a disappointment. It had an awesome interesting plot that could have been more awesome if they were to take it to a better story than this dumb 'home invasion' movie. A cool concept was really wasted, and became a typical home invasion flick. I just wish they had a back story to the film. The film did little to no explaining how this world became this way. Honestly how does crime and unemployment rates hit an all-time low when the government instituted an annual 12-hour time period called 'The Purge', during which people can vent their negative emotions because all crime is legal and emergency services are suspended. How does killing people stop poverty? Cause they kill homeless people. If unemployment is 1%. How can there be homeless people? Why spend hours trying to kill some homeless people, when you can rob a bank? How do people get envy of the other people wealth, if unemployment is 1 %.? The movie would make more sense if they explain it more like saying it was more population controls reasons. The movie doesn't explain how the country went from bankruptcy to prosperity through violence through Social Darwinism. Even if the Purge did exist, are we to believe that nobody would commit a crime after it. Most people that commit crime, does it because it's not legal. If it was legal, than it's not a crime. In no way, is crime going to stop, because one day out of the year, it's legal. There always going to be rule-breakers. It's like saying, people can only smoke marijuana on April 20. Is that really going to stop people from smoking any other day? No. When most people kill another person, most of the time is on it because it's a crime of passion, where the person can't control sudden strong impulse such as rage, and attack people. In no way, can these people just wait and wait for one day just to arrive to get rid of somebody. Society would cave in plus vendettas would carry over, if someone killed someone you loved or tried to kill you of course you would want revenge and might not be willing to wait a year for it. Most people that commit crime, are not thinking of the consequences of it. Anyways, Directed by James DeMoncano, the movie starts in the year 2022, where the Sandlin family held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous group during the Purge. While the acting is alright. I have say Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great in their parent roles. The children are some of the most annoying, and unbelievable characters ever. The movie is full of stupidity people trying to hide in the dark with a flashlight on. In one scene, the daughter is held at gunpoint, thrown against a wall and knocked out, wakes up and is mad at her dad for tying up the dude that did that to her. Plus, the son is still sticking up for the guy after he does that. While the characters do make pretty stupid decisions, I always make the argument that in a moment of terror anyone is prone to not making the correct decision, but this was just pure stupidity. The people that want to murder them, are not scary, but more comedian type. Let's us purge guy was just hilarious to watch. I think it would have much better ending involving the Sandin boy. Too bad the government is exempt during it. If the left-wing and right-wing extremists all stabbed each other to death with machetes once a year, maybe we'd get less scumbag politicians on both sides. At less, they explain that plothole. In my opinion, the story isn't that original. There was a 1967 episode of Star Trek call 'Return of the Archons' with a similar plot, in which an otherwise placid society is allowed pre-scheduled 12-hour periods of lawlessness and violence. Rather than a normal home invasion, this movie could have been pretty good like 2000's Battle Royale. A 'state of life' film instead of a thriller. Instead of making it about 1 Purge, it should be like a film that takes place over a long period of time. It starts with the pre-conditions that lead to it, and then the purge comes out and we see how life gradually improves except for that 1 day a year. Instead of treating the purge as something disturbing, treat it as something normal. That way, the viewer is more disturbed by it, just as 1971's A Clockwork Orange shows violence in a very nonchalant light. We see how successful the purges initially are, and then learn the moral of the story by the end when the purge isn't working anymore when society bring down to years of years of violence abuse. That would have work, but this movie didn't. Some critics think the movie plot is, an attack on the Republicans and Tea Party ideas. Leave the poor on their own and eventually enough of them will die off, thus eliminating most of the country's troubles? Republicans tend to be tougher on crime than liberals, so I doubt the majority of Republicans would support purge. After all most Republicans support things like the death penalty and tougher laws on child molesters. So no, I don't think so. I think it's just a dystopia idea. The plot/concept is absolutely brilliant, they should have more with it. This is another movie that did not reach its full potential. It's worth a look, but probably not in the theater. Just rent it on video or something. That being said, overall it is good idea, poor execution",5,9,12,22 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Hunger Games is indeed catching fire. It's red hot!
","A lot of critics are now calling this movie, the Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games movie series because of the dark brutality our heroes have to go through. Indeed, this was a pretty dark movie for already dark young adult's novel. The controversial elements seems to die off a little bit, as first off, as the movie has no children killing children theme. Even the murdering is rarely done by the heroes. Instead, the movie focus more on the psychological effects of committing murder, the satire of reality media, conflict between interdependence/independence and fighting against brutality of totalitarianism. This movie is no way, a feel good movie, but it's watchable as the dark themes doesn't make it too depressing. As of a sequel, it was a lot better than the previous film, 2012's Hunger Games as its cut down on the shaky cam. The movie continues the story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the post results of her win of the previous Hunger Games events. That win has cause a spark into rebellion against the oppressive Capitol of Panem as people view her as a lady liberty type figure. Because of this, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) force her and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back into the arena in a special edition of the Hunger Games against all the previous winners of the Hunger Games. I have to say the movie follows the book 'Catching Fire' by Suzanne Collins almost exactly. Despite the film cutting a few things out of the book version such as no Bonny, Twill, and Darius. In my opinion, they weren't needed. One thing, they should had add was Katnis watching her mentor Haymitch's (Woody Harrison) previous victory video. Not only does it give depth to Haymitch's character and why he drinks, but how Haymitch and Katnis are more connect to each other then it seems. Not only that, but it foreshadows the ending because it shows that Haymitch use the arena's force field to his advantage. The whole force field attempt in the end was badly explain. The book does it better as it foreshadows it, with the mockingjay watch and the bread code. The changes, they add, really does make the story better like having the Games be first thing, rather than the long wait for it in the book. I like Effie's (Elizabeth Banks) big goodbye. The change emphasizes Effie's humanity, making her movie self-more sympathetic than Collins's cartoonish character. I like how Peeta can swim in this film version and fight out a bit more as it doesn't seem like he was such a dead weight like the last movie. Still, his character is still a one-dimension love interest like the last movie that stupid actions cause a lot of people's deaths. I love how the film shows Katnis post-traumatic stress disorder through the birds. Show, don't tell, at its best right there. New Director Francis Lawrence smartly adds more into that. Because the book is told from Katniss' perspective, I love how the director presented a more, human, multidimensional side to the villains by adding a granddaughter to Snow and putting more insight into the new gamekeeper Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) during the games events. The big twist in this movie is a bit out there. Without spoiling it, it's a bit odd for the people that secretly support the rebellion, to put Katniss in danger at first, only to later help her. It's like saying I will put you through hell by I'm doing this to save you. The logic doesn't make sense, because what if, she get killed because of you. Then you don't have your poster child for your little rebellion. Why couldn't the rebellion just rescue her before the special Hunger Games? The whole reason of having the special Hunger Games could had be prevented. It's not the film's fault, but the whole bad guy turn into good guy in the end of the movie cliché. I do like the other victors characters like Finnick (Sam Clifton) and Beetee (Jeffery Wright). The highlight for me is Johanna (Jela Malone). Malone nail it for me as the sexy vixen. Plus, how they did they find enough victors to represent all 12 districts if 1, 2, 3, 4 mostly wins? Another thing, I can do without is the CGI monkeys. It was awful. At less, it's better than the CGI dogs from the last movie. The violent is still pretty brutal here, but not as vicious as the last movie as less people are trying to kill Katnis in this movie. The problem with these victors is that they were presented as very good killers, but only a few want to kill her, due to all of them very angry at the Capitol. So it was clear that Katnis wouldn't be in that much danger in the games. The deaths in the film wasn't that emotional as the last movie. It's hard to beat, seeing an innocent kid die. I think the only part I cry in this movie was where Katnis visit District 11, the home of Katniss's deceased friend. That was pretty sad. People that compare this movie to 2008's Twilight, need to stop. This movie is smart. The way the film makes fun of reality television, indeed mirrors reality. We choose to expose ourselves to entertainment such as this movie without thinking for once how it visual metaphor, the inhumanities of our real world. I think as more, people really dig into the movie, the more, they can see that. I would put this movie and the books in the same level of George Orwell. Like smart works like George Orwell's 1984, Hunger Games foreshadowing a illustrating exactly where we are headed again, if things do not change for the better. This movie does a great job.",8,4,22,25 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla is indeed King of all monsters! It was pretty good movie.
","It's about time, they try to reboot the Toho Pictures Godzilla film franchise. Glad, the film studio didn't repeat themselves, with the disappointment of Tri-Star 1998's Godzilla. It really did look like there wasn't going to be a Godzilla film ever again. Since, Tri-Star had no clue, how to use the characters right, and Toho getting tired of making Godzilla movies after the release of 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars, which mark the 50th anniversary of the Godzilla film franchise. Toho did announced that it would not produce any films featuring the Godzilla character for ten years. Indeed, they kept that odd promise. It wasn't until 2014, that this Warner Bros' modernization version of Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards came out to retells the origins of Godzilla. In my opinion, the screenplay could need some retouching, as there is way too much plot holes, and lack of exposition. Without spoiling too much of it, the movie has everything, you would think would be in a Godzilla movie. Yes, they even have the atomic breath. Also, don't bother watching the movie trailers as they are very misleading, coming in. First off, the movie trailer, makes Bryan Cranston look like the main character, but he isn't in the movie long enough. It was very disappointing, how misused he was in this. I guess, they wanted the Alfred Hitchcock Psycho like twist surprise. Still, Bryan Cranston gives his A-Game performance in it. Most of the other human characters are bland and uninteresting. You spend a majority of the film following Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody, who I like as an actor but does nothing with his character's personality here. The family drama that has no impact on the larger story, and was bit disappointing. I thought, there could be more Japanese or Japanese-Americans add to the film. After all, this is supposed to be homage to the older films. The only main Japanese, Scientist Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanbe) more felt like a fan-boy, than a real Scientist. His only job seemed to be to speak the subtext in order to inform the audience that Godzilla is actually supposed to be the good guy without any prove of that. Second off, Godzilla isn't the main threat like the trailers, make him out to be. In the film, Cloverfield type monsters known as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) pose more a threat. Godzilla, himself, has a very slow build that might anger some viewers. It really didn't anger me, because a lot of Godzilla's films have slow builds. When they finally showed Godzilla, it had that great money shot of him roaring right in the camera and it made the seats in the theater shake. It was a great way to build up anticipation and hype up excitement from the fans. The director was going for a deliberate effect in keeping him off-screen for much of the movie, which works well, in my opinion. Hell, 1975's Jaws does the same thing. Lots of film references to that film like the main characters being name after the family in Jaws. So, the director knew how to keep the suspense. One thing, I didn't get, is how the movie quickly makes Godzilla, the hero. Yes, he wasn't trying to destroy anything, but Savior of San Francisco? Hmmm I doubt that. The city is really wrecked. Honestly, the movie never explain, where he came from or why he was hunting the Muto creatures, in the first place. The CGI & action scenes were good, and didn't mind that the film skip some of the big fights, as I know it was building up to something grand. Don't worry, they hint at it, with the use of background television, and GPS, that the three monsters would end up fighting. The movie was beautifully shot. I love the human's point of views. The haunting scene of them sky jumping into the ruins of San Francisco is just epic. The cinematography was beautiful. Honestly, I thought the military were really dumb, and made the whole conflict even worst with the nukes. What was the whole point of fighting monsters that feed on radioactive material, with nuclear weapons? It clearly backfired. The 3D is alright, but there isn't a lot to see there in 3D as most of the fights are in the dark. It's better off, watching it in 2D. The movie's symbolism for PG-13 is very haunting from the thoughts of Hiroshima to similarities to 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster. I wish the movie would have more humor. Despite what some people say, there is plenty of Godzilla action in a movie call Godzilla. So overall: check it out! You have a roaring good time.",7,7,13,18 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars is the Modern Day Blockbuster! An Awesome Tour-de-Force!
","What can I say about this Sci-Fantasy film directed by George Lucas, that hasn't been said before? Everybody knows how magical, exciting, epic, and fun, this space adventure is. After all, it was directly influence by other older mythological stories like the Arthurian tales, classical Greco-Roman mythology, & old Sci-fi film serials like the 1936's 'Flash Gordon'. The movie even got influence from historical events like the foundation of religion beliefs, American westerns, Samurai Culture, and even World War 2 and Vietnam. Plus, I think, everybody know that the film follow the hero journey path laid out by mythologist Joseph Campbell's book, 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces'. So, what are some things, you might not heard of? Well, here's one. Did you know that Lucas had originally wanted to remake the 1930's Flash Gordon movie serials, but the rights were snapped up, so he choose to make his original Sci-fantasy movie, instead. The original story of the film was way different than the film that came out with lizard people, helmetless villains and older main characters. One big different is how long, it was. It had to be split up. The discarded first half was later used as prequels, although some have disputed this claims, saying that Lucas never mapped out the story at the time. Regardless of that, the half of the story Lucas was left with, was still too long, so it was split and rewritten into three parts with 1980 'Episode V: Empire Strike Back' and 1983's 'Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'. The first of this trilogy would be the film that Lucas would make, originally called 'Star Wars', now retitled in 1981 as 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. Anyways, both versions of the script had a plot where a royal is trying to deliver a device, through a ship in a last ditch attempt to rescue a planet, from being destroy by an evil empire. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the generic plot is a bit secondary. It's really not anything new, when you think, about it. After all, films serials like 1939 'Buck Rogers', had stories like that, every week/weekend. It's not perfect at all. There is ton of plot-holes in the film that doesn't make sense, mostly with the Death Star to be note, here. However, I'll let those things go, because it's supposed to be, a fun-corny unrealistic fantasy movie even if the movie has contrived coincidence moments. Yet, I can't let the mediocre acting in this film go pass. I really didn't like the farm boy turn Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)'s whinny little voice. I really wanted him to shut up, most of the film. Also, it's bit weird, how Princess Leia's (Carrie Fischer) weird British accent, comes in and out. Despite, the limited acting chops of the two main leads, they got better as the film series went on and their characters were very memorable. In my opinion, the supporting cast was probably better than the main cast. Harrison Ford as the scoundrel smuggler, Han Solo was a lot of fun. Much of the great humor of the film, comes from him. Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi was amazing! I love how Shakespearean, he was. He made me, believe in the force. Last, but not least, Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin was brilliant. His enthralling voice & his charming, yet evil manner was evil and menacing. The same goes with James Earl Jones voicing the character of Darth Vader. Still, I would love to see a version where 'Star Wars' try-out actors, Kurt Russell, Jodie Foster, Christopher Walken & Toshiro Mifune played these characters. Anyways, most people remember this film for its visuals special effect and action. Those were amazing, even if a bit dated. Another noticeable thing about Star Wars is the soundtrack by composter John Williams. His thematically rich score would give a heart to the action and usher in a new era of romantic old-style music in films. Even the sound effects like Wilheim scream were top of the line. Another thing, worth noting is the exotic locations. All of them, work, even if the production for this film was troublesome, due to weather issues. Another great thing about this film is the well-paced editing. For the most part, the original 1977 version, had really no slow parts. Yet, the 1997's Special Edition kinda ruins that, by adding fake-looking pointless scenes like Luke talking to his crewmates before the battle or Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo. While, a lot of the Special Edition edits, do help the film, by retouching outdated visual effects; it also kinda hurts the film. A good example is the 'Han Solo shot first' scene, which kinda betrayal his pirate-like character! While, this might sound controversy, I think the Special Editions were indeed somewhat needed. Updating old source materials is nothing wrong, as long as you keep the original films out-there, as well. After all, the special editions kept 'Star Wars' fresh on everybody mind in the mid-1990s & got me, into loving this film franchise. It's work for what it is; which is a Director Cut version. Some people might hate it; some people might love it. Nevertheless, it expose new audiences to the mythos of these films. Star Wars is one of those films that has become sewn into the very fabric of our popular culture. With the continued prominence of the Star Wars story through movie sequels, animated series, video games, and toys, I glad this movie went on, to great success in awards and money. The impact of the first film in the series was enormous - tremendous profits helped to generate funding for Lucas' state-of-the-art special effects factory known as Industrial Light and Magic, Lucas' sound company, THX & Lucas' American film and television production company, Lucasfilm. Overall: It was indeed a cinematic masterpiece. Every major movie blockbuster released today, has George Lucas to thank for. So go see it.",9,0,0,5 May 2016
Deadpool," This comic book movie is dead on with its break the fourth wall self-demonstrating humorous style. It was a fun film to watch.
","After, the disappointment appearance in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Merc with the Mouth returns with a vengeance. 2015's Deadpool shows that movie character resurrection is indeed possible. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and directed by Tim Miller, this Rated-R superhero film, is a rarity. Most superheroes movies tend to be PG-13, to fit larger with the general audience. Deadpool doesn't do that; it's lives on the gimmick of having extreme graphic violence, nudity & sex, and harsh profanity as its selling point. Using over-the top adult-theme super hero type humor similar to films like 2010's Kickass & 2010's Super as its calculus; the 20th Century produce film is by comparison, a lot more raunchy than it's X-Men counterparts or it's Marvel Studio produce film rivals. However, I felt that, the film doesn't go, far enough to use the Rated R subject matter, enough to make the paper-thin story of revenge seem very compelling. It's only use, as a joking matter. Somehow, they were able to, made normally, extremely, uncomfortable taboo subjects like incest, rape, and murder, somewhat too light-heartened as jokes than tools. Don't get me wrong, I like, how the movie use its break the fourth wall, meta humorous style, but it's only surface deep. Honestly if you cut it away, all the fan service, the movie's plot is pretty damn generic. Like 1990's action movie generic. I know, I'm probably get heat for this, but I just thought, maybe they would do just something more intense or sophisticated. It remind me too much of a low brow version of 2005's V for Vendetta without the political, philosophy and social commentary. Let again, I actually do enjoyed the small scale of the story and scope. It is a refreshing break from all the overused 'saving the world' plots we have had and will have coming down the pike. I would definitely move that con to a pro. However, I can't say the same, about the marketing campaign in which, trailers are making Deadpool seem like a romance movie. Yes, most of the film, focus on him, falling in love with a former-prostitute, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin); only to find out that he's been diagnosed with incurable metastatic cancer. However, it's here, where the movie veers from romance, into an oddly done revenge film that Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) honestly mostly cause, damage to his self. Offer for a chance of survival: to be experimented on (and tortured) until his body mutates and heals itself. Wade's sarcasm and caustic wit become too much, for his experimenter Dr. Ajax (Ed Skrein), who ends up torturing Wade until his skin looks burned and disfigured. After escaping from the clinic, Wade feels too insecure to approach Vanessa and reestablish his relationship with her, only to instead re-invent himself as Deadpool, with the goal of getting Dr. Ajax to reverse the treatment. If you really think, deep about it, all of this problems, is because Wade's somewhat annoying and obnoxious personality, not the weak-so-called 'British villain'. Despite the frail origin story and how he came to be, one thing, worth saying is that Ryan Reynolds was born to play this loud-mouthed, acid-tongued anti-hero with the ability to crush heads and crack up audiences. He's charismatic, exuberant, and larger-than-life, which isn't easy considering how much of the film he spends either in a full-body costume, voicing a CGI character or beneath heavy prosthetics. With his action skills, athletic build, and well-honed comic timing, Reynolds made the action scenes, so much, more impressive than it's honorably seem. I just wish, the movie would mention or use, Deadpool's comic book power of teleportation. I guess, the carries devices like the magic satchel that grant him that power and holographic disguise was a little too much to sink in, for the general mature viewer. I guess it was also decide to be cut, so to make the movie more self-contained and leave some room for any future films on the weapon X Project. Deadpool's power in this film is from his own innate mutation rather than derived from comic book Wolverine character, BTW. Another thing, that seem to be missing from this movie, is Vanessa Carlysle's mutant powers. Where in the hell is her shape-shifter or power mimicry powers!? I guess, they didn't want anything too much that didn't seem normalcy; since they had the X-Men cameos from Colossus (Voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), already bringing the superpowers part to the script. Also, when exactly did Colossus and Deadpool meet? They never establish that. It's too bad that we didn't get to see, any other X-Men characters like Cable or Genesis from the comics. I'm hoping for sure to see them in the sequel to this. Maybe, a Disney own Marvel crossover as well. Who knows!? Anyways, instead, we got T.J. Miller as Wade's only real friend, an arms dealer named Weasel, but he comes across, watchable than super hilarious. I wasn't a big fan of his work. Not sure how his star power rose over the years. I mostly find him, mediocre, as best, as a comedian. However, we do get to see an actor, Hugh Jackman and Marvel's editor, Stan Lee's cameo. Also, an after credit scene. So that's something, not to miss. Anyways, while, I'm not the biggest fan of Deadpool. I have to give the movie, a lot of credit, in making a film, the fans of the comic book series, wanted all along. Overall: I enjoyed every moment of it. A watchable superhero movie, indeed",8,5,14,17 February 2016
300," 300 is testosterone full over the top movie! Still, it's a good watch.
","300 is an awesome film from Director Zack Snyder. Before this movie is over, the world will know, that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many, and that even a god king can bleed. While it's not historic accurate, it still was a great film. Still, I wasn't looking for something historically accurate because I knew that it was based off of the graphic novel by Frank Miller. As an interpretation of a graphic novel, it's works. Most of the film was shot in blue screen, so that later on, the comic book graphics lighting visual effects could be added on. The film is full of slow motion and bullet time that gives the film, its graphic novel action feel. It can be a bit annoying at time, as nothing in the film seem real to history. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book that it become less a live action movie, and more like a looking into a CGI orgy animation movie. The film makes the real life harsh Battle of Thermopylae seem like a woman and gay man wet dream fantasy. While it's clear that the movie mock homosexual and other sexual acts by making the Persian King, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the villain monstrosity and play Spartan King Leonida (Gerald Butler) as the protector of heterosexual norms. In real life, Spartans were known for their homosexual. The Spartans actually had no problem with homosexual activities and would have been unlikely to use this as a reason to look down among someone. The movie wants to be this non apologetic celebration of masculinity, but it only semi works. One thing I found odd about the film is the lack of clothes the Spartans are wearing. I know in the graphic novel, they fought in the nude. I can understand not fighting in anything, most likely because they didn't want to show fear, but in real life fact, I think a real Spartan would have worn body armor, like leg and chest plates, and at the very least would have had crests on their helmets to protect themselves. The film is about 300 Spartan warriors that help protect Greece against the invading Persian army during the Persian-Greco War. Spartan King Leonida's army was deeply outnumber by the larger Persian force lead by King Xerxes and force to do one last stand at Thermopylae as a last ditch attempt to save his country. The Battle of Thermopylae also known as the Hot Gates was not the same as its view on this film. For one thing, there wasn't only 300 soldiers there. According to Herodotus, 5,200 Greeks held the pass for three days against 2,600,000 Persians This battle actually happened, it's just the movie was so ridiculously inaccurate that it makes it look like it like Greek was going to war with 300, ripped, Chippendale dancers. The character of Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) is another instance of inaccuracy in the historical movie 300. He was a pretty normal man, however, in the movie he is shown as being severely disfigured and an outcast among the people. It is insinuated that his life should have been ended when he was a baby because of his hump back and that he was undeserving of life. This is pretty harsh. The film felt anti-disability. The movie tries too hard to make the Sparta society seem like it's a country that represent freedom and way of life. In truth, the Spartans were less democracy, and more like a caste system or fascism where few were truly free, and others were in slave. This is Sparta! In no way was Sparta life any better than the Persian life. Athens were more democracy then Sparta. There was a lot of controversial about the whole Middle East VS Western Culture feel of the film. A lot of Iranians got offended by the film. Still, it's a very entertaining adaption of a real life battle of tens of thousands against 300 soldiers using superior tactics to upset the battlefield. The Spartans fought primarily defensively only once in a way breaking formation. In the film, I think they broke formation way too much to be taken serious. I enjoyed every actor's performances. Still, I didn't see much of the supporting cast in Leonida's army standing out. The only other actors besides Butler, Tiernan and Santoro that stood out was Lena Headey's Queen Gorgo. I do find David Wenham narrating great as Dilinos. I liked the unique visual style the movie had going on, the action scenes were pretty kickass too. I think everybody love 'This is Sparta' kick scene. The soundtrack by Tyler Bates was boundless intense. The violence might be gory, and outrageous, still the movie is so popular, that a sequel was created. If you like 300, also check out the book 'Gates of Fire', it's a good read. So prepare for glory and get dinner ready for the movie because tonight, we dine in glorious hell.",8,3,6,20 July 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," It's good to be King! Kingsman: The Secret Service is over the top, fun.
","This movie is a love letter to the old school bizarre campy spy films, while also reenergize the genre to the mature audience, by keeping it modern and smart. Without spoiling it, the movie is full of movie references. Too many to list, here. The movie is also full with satire comedy wit, reverence melodrama, and hyper-violence action. Kingman has the right amount of realistic, and camp value to be entertaining for the most part. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, and loosely based on the comic book The Secret Service by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The movie tells the story of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young trouble man, who might end up for a life behind bars. However, he is saved by an old friend of his late father, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), whom recognizes potential in the youth and recruits him to be a trainee in the secret service organization call the Kings Men. Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) launches a diabolical plan to solve the problem of over-population by worldwide killing spree. Can Harry and Eggsy stop the madman or will Valentine's plan come to light. Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, every character, every frame, and nearly every line of dialogue is delivered with a hilarity tongue in cheek, brash motion. Newcomer Taron Egerton was pretty good as Eggsy. The trailer of this film, make it seem like his character was an unlikeable thug, but I'm pretty glad, that they didn't go that way. Eggsy is coarse and prone to fights, and at first glance appears to be a typical Lower-Class Lout, but he's also protective of his mother and sister, has a deep well of kindness and loyalty to animals, and wants to do right by others. Colin Firth works great as the mentor, Harry. Firth is the veteran actor, with a smooth, proper British charm, but also a deadly operator. His ability as an action hero is amazing. The church scene with him, alone, is worth the price of admission. I love Samuel L. Jackson's character. Valentine is a very friendly, cheerful, and charismatic man who cares about the world so much that he's willing to kill most of humanity to save it. He's also appalled by the violence and afraid of blood. I love how Valentine discusses various tropes of Tuxedo and Martini Spy Fiction: like the James Bond series with various characters over the course of the film, showing how dangerously, he can be. I haven't saw, many of those types as villains, before. One thing, I didn't like about the character is the lisp. It was kinda annoying. It kept coming in and out. His henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is very intense. She really look like she could take down the hero. The fight toward the end in the dance floor, was good. I love how they adapt dance moves to the fighting style. The movie has this stylized action and design that people will clearly love or hate. I think the endless parade of so-over-the-top-that-it's-almost-cartoonish violence; is pretty cool, but kinda jarring. Don't get me wrong, I love how the action sequence are shot: very clear, without shaking cam, and quick cuts, but the violence and its choice of using blood is a bit confusing. It's a bit odd, that anything worse than a gunshot wound is remarkably clean. Most notably, when person is cut in half or head explode, it does not result in a single drop of blood. It's gruesome, no matter what. The movie language is also harsh, and the movie's odd sexual ending, might offend some. Still, it makes me wonder, why the movie didn't try to go for a hard Rated R. It seem that the movie was trying to go PG-13, but change its mind, half-way, through filming. Another fault of the movie might, to be how loose the adaptation is, compare to the comic book. They took a lot of artistic license on this story. A lot of things have change, big time. Gary London becomes Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. Gary's Uncle Jack is no longer his uncle, and is renamed Harry Hart. The Secret Agents become referred to by codenames derived from Arthurian legend, so they might retain their names if they aren't ever called by their real ones. Characters like Sir Giles and Rupert Greaves in the comic are no more. They form Merlin (Mark Strong) and Arthur (Michael Caine), respectively. The villains change, also. Gazelle was a man in the comic. The character of Mark Hamill is combined with the character of James Arnold played by Mark Hamill. Much of James Arnold remains in the form of a new character, Richmond Valentine. Another thing, annoying from the film is the product placement. McDonald's being eaten by the villain. Come on! The movie has a great movie score by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson. It was easy listening. The movie made good use of establish songs such as Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing' in the intro, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Freebird' during the church massacre. KC and the Sunshine Band's 'Give It Up' was also rocking! Director Matthew Vaughn expressed interest in a sequel if the film did well at the box office - as the film exceeded all box office expectations it is a definite possibility. I hope, they do. Overall: Despite, the large amount of violence. The movie does have an enduring message with the quote, 'Manners maketh man' meaning, class and money aren't what define you -- your character does. Loyalty and hard work are rewarded. This movie is a must-watch. I do recommended.",8,3,9,31 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," Time to sober up, for this film is no longer a hangover.
","While this film still has the same title, it's not the hangover formula that people love or hate. This one is a little bit more nausea. Two years after the events at Bangkok, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) escape out of jail and now it's the job for the Wolfpack members: Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), Stu Price (Ed Helms) and Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) to find him or Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) will get murder by the ruthless drug mob leader Marshall (John Goodman) wanting Chow. The movie feels less than a comedy, and more of a dark humor crime drama. I know director Todd Phillip took a lot of criticize for 2011's The Hangover Part II for recycling the same plot as 2009's The Hangover. Now he is getting criticize for delivers a film so different from the first two, which in my opinion, I'm pretty OK, with, but I think he forgot to add more humor to it. I didn't see much people laughing in the theater at any of the jokes. I don't think a lot of people were laughing at all the animal deaths in the film such as giraffe, the chickens, or the dogs. There was an even a jab at PETA. The point is, the killing of animals just kills the mood - it's mean spirited. I know it's weird in a way that people care more about a dog dying in a film, than a guy getting shot in the film, but in my opinion, the animal killing joke was just awful. Still, I was kinda depressed that two of the original characters met their maker in the film. The movie pretty much suck the fun out of the room, by having endless amount of death and violence on the screen. I would have thought the film would be funnier since giving more screen time to both Alan and Chow, but it wasn't. Most of the humor in the film was dumb man-child humor or crude jokes. Both of them were just annoying to the point that I stop caring about what happen to him. I just want them to go away for good. I would have like more smart jokes. Even if it had smart jokes, it was still missing something. I don't know, maybe like 'an actual hangover'. I do think the movie strayed too far from the formula of the original Hangover. I do have to say, the post-credit sequence does deliver that for the fans, but it might have been too short and too late. Having them return to Las Vegas was pretty awesome and work as a nostalgia feeling for long term fans of the comedy series. It would be fun to have more of that, with another other original characters returning such as Officer Franklin (Rob Riggles) or Mike Tyson. At less, they got Heather Graham to reprised her role as Jade the Stripper and Mike Epps as 'Black Doug' even if they are the two characters in the original film, I didn't want. News character like Cassie (Melissa McCarthy) and Marshall had too short of a screen time to make the film any funnier. I know Melissa McCarthy and John Goodman could have milk more into their scenes. I was just waiting for Walter from 1998's the Big Lebowski to come out. Now, that's how you make a funny dark comedy, the Big Lebowski, not this. I think the best thing about this movie is 'Hurt' by Nine Inch Nails. I just wish, it wasn't use for humor. It was awkward to hear the song, butcher like that. It kinda turn me off of the movie, and made me want to listen to good music instead. Absolutely beautiful cinematography in the film. Overall: It was an entertaining movie. There seem to be a lot of scenes cut out that makes me wonder what happen. What happen to the storyline that involves the boys rescuing Alan from a mental hospital? How on earth did Stu get the drugs out of the pharmacy? As for this movie being the end of the Hangover series. I doubt it, if there is money to be made. The studio will make another one for sure. I don't see this series ending anything soon, but if this is the end. Thank God. It's over. One less mindless sequel comedy, I have to review.",6,0,0,3 June 2013
Apollo 13," Houston, we don't have a problem. Apollo 13 was amazing.
","Apollo 13 has that don't tell me, the sky's the limit, when there is footsteps on the moon, feel to it. Directed by Ron Howard, this out of this world movie was very successful on bringing the exciting and the entertainment value. One small step for a man, is indeed one giant leap for mankind. Adapted from the book, 'Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13', by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The movie follows astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) aboard Apollo 13 spacecraft, attempting for a Moon landing mission. En-route to the moon, they suffer from an on-board explosion that deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. This force NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turn the mission into a rescue operation to get the three men home safely. Can they get the men back to Earth or will the astronauts, perish in space? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; since the movie is based on true events, the movie does have a predictable outcome. Anybody, who readt the history books, or saw any NASA program, knows how the events ended. Still, there are some really dangerous moments that might surprise some viewers, and make you jump, out of their seat, wondering if the crew was going to live or die. Even if you were the biggest NASA fan; the movie showcase a lot of things that you might not, know about the mission. You don't know the gravity of the dangerous situation until you watch Apollo 13! Indeed, failure wasn't an option. This movie was intense! Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. It will leave you more of an impact. While, Apollo 13 shot for the moon and it kinda miss, at least, it's among the stars. Every actor in this movie shine. Tom Hanks was great as the leading man. The supporting cast was equality as good. My favorites had to be Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, Head of Mission Control and Gary Sinise as astronaut, Ken Mattingly. I even love the cameo from the real life, Jim Lovell as a captain of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film, is how negatively, the portrayal of Jack Swigert was. They portrayal him, as a weaker astronaut, compare to the others, because of his lack of training, and bachelor status. In real life, Swigert was a well-trained Command Module pilot and highly respected. He was no black sheep. No one was really too worried about whether he was up to the job, but the real-life, Lovell admitted, he were really worried about was the rendezvous with Swigert as they left the Moon, but that never got to happen. Another thing, when did being a bachelor; became a bad thing? Didn't every man in the life, start out, as a bachelor, at one time? I have to say, despite that. Kevin Bacon did surprising, pretty well. Bill Paxton as Fred Haise, was alright for the role, but he's by far, the weakest in the film. I love how accurate the film is. The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, 'Houston, we have a problem.' This quote alone, was voted one of the best movie lists in movie history. Ron Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and even obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft, KC-135 for realistic depiction of the 'weightlessness' experienced by the astronauts in space. The actors went aboard multiple KC-135 flights so much, that they outdone, even real astronauts in the amount of training, they got. I have to say, all the training, pull off in a realistic portrayal. Not only that, the movie went the extra mile in special effects. In an era where CGI was primitive, this movie was able to make it look like a rocket was blasting off into space, while, using little CGI. All the space shots were original made, and not taken from previous NASA space stock footage. There was no moment in the film that I didn't believe, they weren't in space. Even, real life astronauts like Buzz Aldrin got fooled, in believing they were in space. While, the movie is pretty accurate to historical events, Apollo 13 did take some artistic licenses for dramatic effects. In real life, the three astronauts remained surprisingly cool under pressure in real life, but the movie ramped up emotional tensions between them to make it, more thrilling. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is how much, foreshadowing, they used in the film. We get it! Did we really need, the scene where Jim's car was having problems or Jim's wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) losing her wedding ring? Come on! Another problem is the abundance of technical babble and bureaucratic jargon. Some scenes were really hard to understand, what was going on. Still, the movie does a good job, trying to explain, all the science. One thing that I love about the film; is composter James Horner's score. It really captures the wonder of flight. Overall: From lift-off to splashdown, Apollo 13 gives one hell of a ride. It was a very compelling, smart and suspenseful movie. A must-watch.",8,3,4,29 June 2015
The Great Escape," All Hail the Cooler King!
","The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, 'Big X' (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), 'the manufacturer,' makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is 'the tunnel king' in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), 'The Cooler King,' whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.",9,4,6,9 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The sequel that strikes back and was pretty good.
","Directed by Irvin Kershner, The Empire Strikes Back, like the original movie came out with mixed reviews with a difficult production, it's since then became considered one of the greatest film ever made. The film is set three years after the events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has studying the Force under exile Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Mid while, Darth Vader (voice by James Earl Jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. When his friends are capture, Luke Skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. This gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but I love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. That's great filmmaking. Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draw from mythologist Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like Arthurian, classical Greco-Roman and others. There are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's Flash Gordon, 1975's Dersu Uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. The movie even took influence from historic events like Nazism, the Wild West, and Samurai culture. It even dig into world religions. Some people might seeing the teaching of Yoda as boring scenes, but I love them. The movie really makes good on explaining more about what the Force is. The Force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. A sense of Manichaeism, mixed with elements of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Romantic nature worship, Pantheism and Western-influenced Buddhism. Luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. Yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. The way Frank Oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. Not once, did I think it was a puppet. I would say, this was way better than the CGI Yoda or the puppet from Episode 1, big time! Industrial Light and Magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. This movie really make the Hoth Battle look real and intense. Another big prop to them is how great, Cloud City looks. As the technology has improved, Lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. In my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's Special Edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's CGI. Glad, they didn't add the bad delete Wampa scenes. The Special Edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. A good example of this is Cloud City. You really see more of the city than the original. It's beautiful. The 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing Boba Fett's voice, but at less they add the real Emperor. The music by John Williams is great. I love the Imperial march introduced in The Empire Strikes Back as the theme music for Vader's pursuit of Han and Leia. The march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing Vader's own relentless progress through the story. For action, it's not as epic as 1977's Star Wars, but the story is way better than that movie. The love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in Episode 2. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. You know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. That's realistic. The love affair had a shade of grey to it. One memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with Han Solo given a badass reply. That was amazing! Without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about Han Solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that Harrison Ford would return for a third film. I glad he did. Another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. I did find a few. I don't like the whole Leia kissing Luke thing. It makes no sense even if Episode VI wasn't made at the time. It's still gross. Another one is how Ben Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guinness) hide the truth from Luke, throughout the film for no good reason. Why!? You would have thought that information would help Luke deeply before heading to Cloud City! It doesn't make any sense. Once again, without spoiling it. During production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about Darth Vader & Luke Skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. I like how George Lucas fought for this movie. To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas put the screen credits in the end. Even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the Writers and Directors Guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. They fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. Due to the controversy, he left the Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association. He also left 20th Century Fox over controversy when the President Alan Ladd Jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause Fox to lose Raiders of the Lost Ark's film rights. Overall: George Lucas change movie history with this film and the world is better because of it.",9,0,0,4 April 2014
Minions," The movie wasn't despicable. The movie just mindless entertainment. Fun to watch.
","Ever since they first appeared in Universal Pictures/Illumination Entertainment 2010 film debut, Despicable Me. The lovable side characters, the minions have been fan favorites! There is something special to these diminutive, banana-loving, nonsense-spouting henchmen to the point that they somewhat overshadow the main characters. I have to believe that the minions became popular, due to three factors: their cartoony baby-like appearance, their toddler-like gibberish language, and last, their charming, silly, childlike humor. They're pretty much, the embodied all the good things about children. Adults love them. Children love them. Most people love them. It's really hard to hate them. So, it's no surprise that their role was expanding in 2013's hugely successful sequel, Despicable Me 2. Now, with Universal Pictures' latest release, the Minions have been push as the main characters in their own spin-off movie, due to their overall, likability. While, it's nice to see them, in their own standalone film, sadly the film lacks substance. The movie really doesn't have, much depth to its unimaginative plot. Directed by Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin, the movie chronicles how the little yellow creatures have always been drawn to follow the biggest villains surrounding them. This time, they seek out renowned international villain Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) to be their boss. They win her trust and accompany her to England, where they must prove their loyalty by stealing the queen's crown jewels with the help of Scarlett's weapons-specialist husband, Herb (Jon Hamm). While the movie seems like a 1960s spy/heist film, from the trailers, the movie is barely that. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie plot moves very slowly. The first half, with the Minions, trying to reach Villain Con in Orlando was very pointless. The whole idea of them, finding it, by secret villain channel for television was a badly done, deus ex machina. I really hate, how that, scene came into play. Honestly, the scenes in 1968 New York City and the road trip was a real time-waster and should had been cut. Nothing from there, seem that important to the plot. Yes, the Minions meet the Nelsons family, there, but they were very weak human characters. While, I like the voice actors, playing the parents, Michael Keaton as the Dad, Walter Nelson and Allison Janney as the Mom, Marge Nelson. Their interacted with the Minions barely moves the plot, along and their characters were pretty much useless later on the film. I would have, thought, they would end up, being related to Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell), but it was a big fat red herring that never got, off the ground. Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill was alright as the main baddie, but I was really hoping for more from the character. With a name like overkill, we barely got to see, anything like that, from her. John Hamm is a lot of fun as her nefarious husband Herb, but by far, the Minions are the ones, bringing out the laughs. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob – (all voiced by Kyle Balda), whom Despicable Me fans will remember fondly from the previous films. They are definitely cute. I love, how each one of them, has a unique personality. Kevin is the smart & brave lead, but also has a great snarkiest attitude. Stuart is the impulsive one of the trio; most likely to bring out, the jokes. Bob is the youngest, the most naive and kind-hearted of the trio. He's the one that most people would find, adorable. Honestly, if there was something to nitpick about the movie, it would be, how the movie makes being a criminal seem cool. While, personally, I don't see anything, too wrong, with it. I can see, why certain people might see this as a bad-influence to kids. The Minions are cute and funny. However, they're destined to be disciples to evil masterminds is pretty alarming. One problem that I found a bit, jarring is the way, that they wanted Scarlet to take them, back, after being abuse. It's downright chilling to me. It's like they have Stockholm syndrome mixed with self-hatred. The amount of crude humor, sexual innuendos and lack of heart is also a bit noticeable, here compare to the others films. Still, the filmmakers do fairly well to make sure, that the Minions shenanigans are pretty tame, just to make sure, parents wouldn't overthink those things when coming into this film with their children. Like, I say before, it's difficult to hate them, even with their biggest flaws. I found the humor to be mostly a hit, for me. There were some minor, not so funny moments, but for the most part, it was laugh out funny. The animation is pretty well-made. I love Scarlet's Three Little Pigs story depiction, and how it's in style that looks like stop motion, but still CG. It was pretty cool to look at. Still, I wish, this movie had a more compelling story to match with this great animation. Overall: With their vaguely familiar-sounding language and their penchant for causing chaos, the Minions movie will entertain, both adults and children. Just note, to turn off your brain, when it come to the plot. So check it out and enjoy!",6,13,23,12 July 2015
Aladdin," Aladdin grant the fan's wishes, by being a great film. A whole new world.
","Aladdin is a key piece to the comeback of Disney. Before Aladdin, Disney was still struggling after a long period of fail animated block-busters films. The biggest blow to the company, came in 1981's The Fox and the Hound when long-time animator Don Bluth left Disney, taking 11 Disney animators with him. Disney came back with 1989's Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast, but with the success of Aladdin, Disney spark the era known as the Disney Renaissance, that continue until the early 2000's. These film restore public and critical interest back into Disney. Aladdin was a very controversial choice for a kid's movie when it came out. Aladdin is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. It's still unknown if Aladdin is not actually part or not part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories. The tale of Aladdin was somewhat violence and had various forms of erotica. The original story had Aladdin, with the help of his magical ring full of Djin, kidnapped Jasmine on her honeymoon. How romantic, a kidnapping movie! Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song 'Arabian Nights' in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with 'Down, kitty' on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Seeing this as his way out, Aladdin created a new life as Prince Ali to get closer to the princess Jasmine (voice by Linda Larkin). Jafar starts to question Prince Ali believing him as the poor thief that he betrayed and start to make plans to steal the lamp once and for all. The movie has a great message for the children about being yourself and not allow yourself to be imprisoned. Glad they didn't go with the Greed is good message. The animation is great. Even today, I have to say when the Cave of Wonders, Sand Tiger come alive, it brings chills down my neck. The magic carpet ride through the cave was collapsing was intense. I can't help thinking of those scenes, even now. The music to the film is ground breaking good to hear. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is amazing. I love 'A Whole New World'. One of the best love songs of the 1990's. It has an amazing melody that complements the scenery very well. I too love how the song speeds up, giving it a very romantic yet magical and adventurous feel to it. The other songs like 'Friends like me', 'Street Rat', 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' also work. I do have to say the 2004, Special Edition released kinda ruin it, by having a new song 'Proud of Your Boy', performed by Clay Aiken which I thought was mediocre. Now there has been a couple of fan theories that goes with this film, that I like to address like The Merchant is the Genie. Both look very similar, and it seems to make sense because Robin Williams voices both characters. Another variation of this same theory says the man made the whole story up to sell the lamp, so Aladdin wasn't really a true story. The last theory is the most outlandish. Some people think that Aladdin takes place in a Post- Apocalyptic future where technological marvels had been long forgotten and been taking as magic. Some critics even think the Magic Carpet is a time- traveling device. The Genie proves this theory by making impressions of ancient, long-dead celebrities like Groucho Marx, and Jack Nicholson. Still, it can make sense that the Genie is an all-powerful being who can see into the future, so he can make jokes like those, but why would he make jokes that Aladdin wouldn't get. The truth is, Robin Williams was making cultural references jokes to get more people to see the film. Much of Robin Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed and it was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters for animation to work on. It was no surprised that the film has so many in-jokes impersonality as Robin is known for that at the time. This was a new type of Disney humor that wasn't in much kids movies at the time. Disney would later use this type of humor in other animation films like 2001's Emperor New Groove, and 1997's Hercules. In an odd way, Aladdin also take place in the same period as Hercules, so a crossover was used in later projects. Check out, Disney's first direct-to-video sequel, 1994's The Return of Jafar and the TV Show. 1996's Aladdin and the King of Thieves was OK so check it. Overall: Aladdin is a great nostalgia movie that takes us back to when we were kids. Worth watching.",8,6,7,11 October 2013
Incredibles 2," While, this sequel was not as incredible as the first movie. It's still a good watch.
","Following the success of 2004's Pixar Animation Studio's computer-animated superhero film 'The Incredibles', Walt Disney Pictures really wanted a sequel. However, writer & director, Brad Bird held off development to do other films. It wasn't until his last movie, 2015's 'Tomorrowland', bomb at theaters, that he returned to the project, in order to make the producers happy, while also try to salvage what left of his career. Because of that, I don't think, personally, Bird had the same heart & desirer for this, like he had, during the original. After all, it kinda shows in this film's script. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the story is pretty much a rethread, just with more poorly done foreshadowing and callbacks. Instead of Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Voiced by Craig Nelson) being recruited by a private company to do superhero work. This time, it's his wife, Helen/Elastigirl (Voiced by Holly Hunter) being chosen to, and now, Bob is the one, stuck at home, stressing out, while taking care of the kids. The only few differences comes from the overall tone. The first movie's is a little more fun & unique, as it portray superheroes in an bright, gratuitous 1960s spy genre adventure style, while the sequel takes the more murky atmospheric neo noir pulp detective mixed with 'Body Snatchers' horror approach to the main story. Because of that, the movie's vibrant, retro mid-century designs are not that endearingly nor as beautiful to look at, like the original. Thus, making the movie, a bit misty. Parts of the movie, was even hard to watch for some audiences, as the strobe lights used in the villain fight scenes cause them to suffer epilepsy. As for the rest of the action. While, less violent & fewer body count than the first movie, it was entertaining, but it lacks the overall family dynamics for a film called 'Incredibles 2'. They barely team up in this film. It's sad, because the climactic battle of the original, made them seem like they would fight crime together, regardless, what laws may say, and what challenges may come. Yet, the sequel drawn out, unnecessary excuses for the family, not to. It's highly annoying, because, the kids at this point, are very knowledgeable with their powers, when face with danger. As for the struggles of them, living in a 'herd morality' society. It's not that fresh nor does it make any sense worth continuing in the context of the last movie. That clash of beliefs has already been tackle greatly with the Ãœbermensch through man-made technology VS Natural God-Given Abilities storyline from the original. It didn't need to be, recycled yet, again with a similar, yet predictable new villain. Nevertheless, I kinda dig the smart cautionary tale of allowing the perception of media to supplanted reality & dictated control of our lives for good, or for wicked means. That part of the main story was somewhat captivating to watch. Too bad, it wasn't explore to its fullest, due to the many interferes from producers. Just think, how much more powerful, the film could had been, if they went with the original idea; superheroes vs computer AI. The same can be said, if they kept the baby storyline as the main plot. The idea of uncontrollable somewhat powerful toddler wrecking society with his body horror could had been very fascinating. Sadly, instead, the movie choose to moves around, way too much with too many mini different subplots. Thus, making the sequel, a little unfocused, badly paced, & muddled. Not only that, but also full of jarring plot-holes, bigger than the school on Saturday debate and the Elastigirl hypoxia question. After all, one of the hardest things to believe, in the movie, is that the family doesn't know, about the baby's powers within the three months, timespan, they spent together in a cramped motel. I can go with the idea that the villain from the last movie, not killing all the superheroes, due to them, not being well-known, but the idea that the family doesn't see the baby's abilities really did take me out of the movie. Nevertheless, the story, is a lot better than non-canon 2005's video game 'Rise of the Underminer', but not unique enough to outdo the 2009 non-canon comic adaptation of the first film. It was bit lackluster in creative in that sense. As for the jokes. It was a mixed bag. Some of them, flew over my head, such as the 'New Math' sequence. Being a millennial, I didn't get it, but most of the others jokes, were funny. The only one that I had a problem with, is the joke with the baby fighting the raccoon. It's not like the animal was stealing, anything of value. It was just searching for crumbs to eat in the trash. That sequence make the baby, look like a total psychopath. Despite that, the animation overall for the movie was pretty damn good. Since, Pixar no longer, used the same computer systems from the original. They had to create everything from scratch. Because of that, we got more crisp, vibrant and detailed effects. It really does look amazing. With the exception of a few performers, most of the original voice actors and actresses returned to their respective characters. This is a bit impressive given how long the production gap was. Not only that, but they were all great in their roles. As for the newcomers, they were alright. However, nobody from that field was really that memorable. As for the music; composer, Michael Giacchino's jazzy score for this movie was just as good as the first film. The nostalgic tunes were catchy to listen to. Overall: In the end, 'Incredibles 2' still turn out to be, somewhat great; even if it doesn't match the majesty of other Pixar sequels. Still, I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. It delivers as much of the joy, pathos, and adventure as the original. It's worth the price of admission. It's super, too.",8,12,19,21 July 2018
The Ugly Truth," Here is the ugly truth about this movie. It's nearly unwatchable.
","This movie, not only insults straight men and women, both gay and lesbians, and different countries social customs relationships. It's not good to insult your viewers like this. I don't find this movie directed by Robert Luketic, decent at all. Some critics really hate the film, some people says that this movie does tell the truth. I have to disagree. While I do say, it's a film that shouldn't be taken serious and I don't hate it, it does need some good old fashion criticize. If anything, I'd call this movie chauvinistic, as it exaggerated implies that all men are sexist pricks who only want to bang as many women as possible, and that all women exist only to be shrewish, egotistical money grabbing naive romanticism. In truth, yes, sex does play a role in relationships, but not all relationships are about sex. People also go into relationships for other reasons, like loved, cherished, made to feel special, safe and secure. Is it a bit selfish to want those things or all in a relationship? Yes, but it doesn't mean, people in relationships are pricks and shrews. It's because we differ from some animals because we don't only take, but give back as well. It is the ability to go against our natural instincts and treat the opposite sex with respect and equality that helps define us as humans. If this movie was indeed 'the Truth', then it seems to say we should all just give in to our primal desires for sex and make horrible choices with it. But why stop there? Why not give into our urges to murder those who invade our territory, rape at will, and lose all trace of progression and civility we have left! This is why this movie fails. Believe it or not, there are people like Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) and Mike Chadway (Gerald Butler). Really, they do exist. I have seen them, just not a daily basis. These people are the true annoying pricks and shrews. In no way does they represent society as a whole. Mike host a TV Show call 'The Ugly Truth' where he advice women into getting relationship with men by being an over-the-top misogynist. Heigl stars as the producer, Abby who disagree with Mike and try to control him every step of the way. Both make a 'battle of the sexes' deal with each other to see which idealism works on getting a relationship. How bad this movie is, obviously comes from these three women who wrote this. Like any other romantic comedy, you know deep in the end, these two would end up falling in love with other. Romantic comedies are so predictable and unrealistic. I doubt these two can ever fall in love, but in weirdest cases, it could, but most unlikely. I can never bring myself to feel for someone who has seemingly gotten themselves deeply involved with the totally wrong person only to turn 180º and abandon said person for that one true love, nor for a couple who manages to get back together after spending the entire movie hating one another, nor a case like this where both leads have such serious defects you don't want to see either one of them have that happy ending. Invariably, the audience is asked to sympathize with one or both leads. The three female screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz, Kirsten Smith, and Nicole Eastman who wrote this probably sympathized with Gerard Butler quite a bit, and make the other women leads as unsympathetic trollops as possible. Every woman in this movie, including Abby, was a shallow, dumb, selfish, or arrogant. I guess they were saying, while women might hate men; women hate other women even more. The movie never solves the real problem with Heigl's character that is that she was a control freak, she has ridiculously high standards, and she overly judgmental of the men she meets. Both just naïve fall in love. The movie mocks naive romanticism, yet in the end, the movie have naïve romanticism win out. Talk about being hypocrites here. The jokes are a hit or miss here. I do like the remote control scene at the restaurant and the odd baseball game scene, even if it's seem out of place. It wasn't that funny, but it was decent. The whole random rape joke was a miss for me. It kill the mood. Was that supposed to be funny? Both actors did a pretty good job, even if their characters are unlikeable. For a date night movie, I have to say, it didn't work. Watching this movie on a first date would be awkward. I think watching this movie will sent more people apart, then bring them together closer. I might not know that much about romantic comedy, but that's not good in this type of a genre.",6,4,7,25 July 2013
Gangs of New York," You know how this movie survives this long. All these years? Fear. The spectacle of fearsome acts.
","Quotes the best part of the movie: Bill the Butcher Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis). Yes, this movie is famous for its endless amount of violence acts put into film. Honestly I found this to be one of the weaker Martin Scorsesse films, due to the reason that the movie can't find a plot. Inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1928 non-fiction book, The Gangs of New York. The book didn't have no plot to it, so the movie searches for one for it, and can't decide on one. The movie jumps from plot to plot, with many unnecessary scenes. And just when you think we've settled into a plot line for the rest of the movie, bam! Something else come into view. I'll explain it. The movie starts out with two gangs fighting over a New York neighborhood known as the Five Points. One gang is the Natives (those born in the United States) lead by Bill the Butcher. It's kind of funny, that the Irish actor is playing a American while a American is playing a Irish immigrant named Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio). Amsterdam's father Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads an Irish gang known as the Dead Rabbits against the Natives. Before Liam Neeson can make an impact in the film, he is quickly kill off. A downer for the film, due to the level of acting he could have gave the film. Instead, we get a very green actor Leonardo DiCaprio playing a young man looking for revenge for the death of his father. Leo has gotten much better as an actor, but here, he was pretty mediocre and looks miscast. This revenge story get stretched for far too long, and was not a satisfying conclusion to the movie due to the other plot lines coming in and taking its ton on the script. In the middle of this revenge story arch, we're also focusing on the Civil War tensions that lead to the Draft Riots, the battles between the Catholic and Protestant groups, with the corrupt politicians like Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) waiting in the shadows. Jim is really great in the role, as he sees people only as votes to help him keep in power. The movie implies that America is corruption, how politicians and rich people are evil, and how the country exploits immigrants. Granted, there are lots of ways to show the underclass rooting against oppression and corruption, but you first have to make it look like the underdogs are worthy of triumph, which this movie didn't do. The people we seeing are just as bad as the politicians. Anyone who's read about New York knows that the street gangs of that day and age were pretty bad. In a city of about 800,000, you had close to 100,000 of them were criminals. It was definitely a colorful and dangerous world about which a cool story could be told. Still, it would be nice to see some redemption morality arch in there. I suspect this movie does not fully represent all the population. There had to be poor immigrants who were desperately trying to live honest lives and had some sense of decency. In general, the characters have few if any redeeming qualities. Instead we have violence for the sake of violence. The killing is drawn out and overemphasized. By the end of the film, you're just glad they are killing themselves off. Nudity and sex is also overdone. Breasts all over the place, triage, women hanging on men over and over again. Too much of everything, except story. The only two positive things I can comment about this movie is that Daniel Day-Lewis put in a wonderful performance as The Butcher. Daniel Day Lewis is the finest actor to ever grace our screens. Completely without parallel! While other actors does characters acting, Daniel Day Lewis does method acting, basically turning himself to the role. You just have to watch Daniel Day Lewis work in two of the best scenes in the movie, 'Poor Rabbit' and 'Honorable Men' speech. Of course Bill's a man of principle. He is the classic American archetype of a principled man in the mold of a Mark Twain character. A violent street thug, though ethically flawed, consistently loyal to his own principles, not necessarily yours. Still, lots of irritating details that makes you questions. He displays eloquence and vocabulary on par with an English professor yet living in the slum and also have pinpoint accuracy when tossing axes and knifes. I thought that required depth perception. There is a few Historical accuracy, for a film that is set in 1800's New York's ghetto- it gets the MGM musical clean treatment for sets and set dressing. The clothing is clean colorful and you expect at any moment the actors will break into song, the film need to looks appropriate dismal and dirty. I love the scene where New York gradually morph into the city it is today under the song U2, The Hands That Built America. Still, the movie has it fails, but it was still worth watching. It just didn't come anywhere near expectations.",7,0,0,7 March 2013
Spectre," I can somewhat bonded with this movie. It was mostly a good watch.
","Let's be honest, here. The dead is indeed alive. It's nice to see the words, Spectre come back from the dead, after a 40 year absence from the franchise. It has been way too long. The reason for this, is that when 1961's novel 'Thunderball', was being made; original James Bond author, Ian Fleming opt for some help from his friends, such as screenwriter, Kevin McClory & some others to make a film version of it. Only to screw them from writing credit, when the film script version was completed in 1964. This lead, to a long legal battle, between McClory & Fleming, until McClory won out, in 1976; retained the filming rights of the novel. With that deal, came the lost, at least ten previous own literary properties & titles. One of them, happen to be the Spectre Organization in which, James Bond fight against in the novel, Thunderball. Once, considered as a future James Bond title in the 1960s & 1980s, Spectre wasn't made into a movie, until November 2013, when Eon Production and McClory's estate formally settled the issue. This allow, MGM, Eon Production's mother company to acquire the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with. Still, the production for this film was troublesome. First off, the movie went, highly over-budget, and over-schedule. Many of these problems, came from the fact, that Sony demanded rewrites after a 2014 email hack. They really want to cover up, and recon the leak spoilers, even beyond when filming started. This cause, the movie to have a very incredibly underwhelming and at times, nonsensical third act. I have to say, its shows. The main plot of James Bond (Daniel Craig) trying to unravel, a new terrorist organization, doesn't match, well, with the sub-plot of M (Ralph Fiennes) trying to stop, his government from creating, a unified New World Order surveillance network. It was very uneven. I also get that the movie takes place 18 months, after the events of 2012's Skyfall, but it really seem, like all the flaws that James Bond had, in the last movie, is non-existence in this film. It's really odd, how he can barely hit his target in the last movie, and now, he's has the power of improbably aiming skills. It's so jarring. What happen to all of his weaknesses? For an action movie, this is probably, the weakest in the Daniel Craig's James Bond series of films. There are way too much, badly done, CGI effects. It's always stale, when we see the same, repetitive action. Most of all, lots of bad guys just standing around, talking and making idiotic decision making. Still, they did, get some hits on Bond. Sad, the whole torturing scene isn't one of them. I didn't like the whole, non-selling. It was a bit confusing on what the hell, was going on! However, I do like the demolition scene that the villains plan. Still, the filming process must have been extremely miserable for both the returning director, Sam Mendes & main actor, Daniel Craig. There has been times, when, Craig had joked that he would rather slit his wrists than play 007 again, and Mendes threating to leave, the production. However, I guess, cooler heads prevails, because they were able to pull, the movie, off. It was far from being a total disaster! In my opinion, the movie that has James Bond's first encounter with the global criminal organization, Spectre, since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever was mostly alright to me. I have only a few problems with it. First off, the movie length. It's a really strained watch. Since, the movie does have some slow & often clichés parts, you really feel, the long runtime. Still, the movie does have a lot more, humor than the previous Daniel Craig's films. I like, how the writers were a lot more open to a lot of old school Bond mannerism. It's nice to see that side of Bond, again. Also, I do love the cool references to the older films. Great homages. I also like, how Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) & Q (Ben Whishaw) are given, more to do, than minor background characters. Some of the best scenes, are with those characters. However, this movie is missing the emotional drive. The chemistry between Bond and his main love-interest, Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) is questionable at best, due to the age different. I really found, their love-affair, kinda forced. While Seydoux was alright as eye-candy. Her acting, not so much. Her French accent is a little distracting. I kinda wish, the minor, bond girl, that Monica Bellucci plays, had a bigger role in the plot. After all, Daniel Craig indeed love, working with her, the most. She might be 50, but she's still gorgeous. Christoph Waltz as the villain, Franz Oberhauser AKA Ernst Stavro Blofeld did a great job at being the charming host/criminal psychopath. I also didn't mind, Dave Batista's minor role as the henchmen. However, I kinda, wish, he had more lines. There was a lot of grief over Sam Smith's new Bond song: 'Writing on the Wall, but it sounded grand and a fitting Bond song over the credits. It's not amazing, but sure it's better than a lot of other recent efforts like Madonna. I just didn't like the weird octopus porn opening, but I did dig, the Día de los Muertos opening with Thomas Newman's score. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema did ensures that Mexico City are never less than ravishing. Don't care, if they got taxation benefits, because of that, but I didn't, how the movie travels from one exotic location to another. It was too much! Too hard to keep, track of it. Overall: While, it fails to pack the emotional punch. Spectre is 007 out of 10. It's still worth seeing.",7,12,22,9 November 2015
Braveheart," Great Scots! Watch this movie! Every man dies, not every man truly lives to see a great film like this.
","Braveheart is one of the best medieval films ever made; but also been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films of all time. Directed by Mel Gibson, the film is about a 13th-century Scottish warrior, William Wallace (Mel Gibson). King Edward I AKA 'Longshanks' (Patrick McGoohan) of England invade Scotland in 1280, murdering many of Scotland's people. Patrick McGoohan is just chilling as Longshanks. What a great performance from him. In the film, Wallace, at first, tries to live a normal life with his childhood friend turn wife, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), but the horrors of life under Longshank's reign became too much for him. With his fellow Scots, he launched a revenge attacked against the English causing the First War of Scottish Independence. Randall Wallace, the writer of the screenplay, has acknowledged that Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem 'The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie' as a major inspiration for the film. The film takes creative license on the piece, to make the film, more gripping like the like the hanging of Scots nobles at the start of the film or Wallace's getting help from Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). I have to say, Sophie Marceau was a great actress for this role. In real life, Isabella was 3 years old and living in France at the time. She was not married to Edward II until he was already king and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died. This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by the play, 'Wallace: a triumph in five acts' by Sydney Goodsir Smith, which historically has adult Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a real man. Yes, it's a bit historical inaccuracy, but it's brings something to the table that works. Little things complains like the Scots not wearing kilts at the time could be passed over. The belted plaid (feileadh mÃ³r lÃ©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century, 500 years after Wallace's death. Things like Jus Primae Noctis plot that supposedly allows the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters is still up to historical mystery. Still, there were some historic inaccuracies, I couldn't accept, like the film showing England's occupation and rule of Scotland being much longer. In fact, the English occupation of Scotland was just 2 years old before the battle of Falkirk. Prior to that, the Kingdom of Scotland was separate and fully independent. It was the Scots that gave power to Longshanks when they couldn't decide a king. I will defend the film for the depiction of the Prince of Wales, Edward II (Peter Hanly). His appearance in the film as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson. In real life, Edward II was believe to be bi-sexual who was very unpopular with his wife, the royals and the people of England. Many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all and that it was made up to discredit him. One of the few things, the film go semi-right was the portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen). Angus's performance is amazing in the film and my favorite character in the film. Some Scottish people got offended of the negative portrayal of Robert the Bruce whom is more a Scottish hero than Wallace. Even, the title 'Braveheart' is often refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. He got to play second fiddle. Other key figures in the war of Independence was cut out in the film like Bishop William de Lamberton and Andrew de Moray. They were replace by other characters such as Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, and the Irish Steven (David O'Hara). Madman Steven has some of the great one-liners of the film. A lot of Scots might hate the film, due to this misleading history, but in my opinion, a lot of Scots should be thankful because the movie brought a lot to tourists to their country. Some of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. Yes, because there is going to be a negative portrayal of antagonists in any war film. Doesn't matter if English or not. The action scenes were great. The battle of Stirling was missing the bridge part. The war tactics are not historical right, but it was still well done. It was brutal, bloody, and in close quarters. It's scary to think that men fought this way for years. Even the fake horse dying look real, that even Animal Welfare investigated the film. Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, with the final version being rated R. Some gory scenes are still disturbing, and disgusting for some viewers. Not a film for any young children. Still, there is some beautiful scenes in the film. I like the way, he shot the landscape even if it's Ireland, not Scotland. Braveheart theme song by James Horner is just beautiful to listen to. It's a very smart film. Then there is the famous quotes that continue to be overplayed whenever, the film comes on such as 'They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!' The film quote capture the spirit of Celtic heroism. The quote 'Every man dies - Not every man really lives' is from 19th century, American poet, William Wallace, no relation to the William Wallace in the film. I still love it. Overall: it was worthy of winning the Best Picture at the Oscars in 1995. It's still worthy to watch even with today's films.",9,4,6,3 March 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely day, to watch a good over-the-top popcorn carmaggeddon film! Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, watching.
","Mad Max is back on the road to success, after years of being off course. Don't get me wrong, the original ozxploitation Mad Max film franchises (1979 to 1985) by George Miller is probably the most famous post-apocalypse films to come out of the Australian New Wave of the 1970s, but this film series hasn't aged, well. First off, Mad Max's main star, Mel Gibson, fell from public grace, due his controversy statements against Jews, women and homosexuals. Second off, the film series hit a road bump, in 1985, when the movie, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome tries a more kid friendly approach by going PG-13. It got released with mixed feelings from critics, and audience members. The 1985 sequel also didn't yield the box office results that the producers wanted. It was only moderate successful, so any plans for sequels went into development hell for thirty years. Due to those reasons, the film series almost seem like it run out of gas. It wasn't until its driver, George Miller repacked, Mad Max as Fury Road, a continuity reboot; did the engines start to move again. Fury Road, once again, tells the story of 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, now played by actor, Tom Hardy, who must teams up with the a mysterious driver Furiosa, (Charlize Theron), to help a group of sex-slaves flee from their capturer, the evil warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Max and Furiosa must cross the post-apocalypse desert world in hopes of reaching, a mythic place call, the Green Place. Can they make it to the safe haven or will Joe recapture them? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, the film is visually impressing. The cinematography for this movie, is just as amazing. They made the Namibia deserts seem as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other post-apocalyptic movies which typically have bleak desaturated colors. It remind me, so much of 1962's Lawrence in Arabia, with how visually appealing, it was to watch. This movie is a must watch in 3D for that, alone. Still, there were some things that were too gimmicky or corny. The Doof Warrior's guitar, as it flies towards the camera in Fury Road, is jarringly poorly done. Especially given the utterly flawless effects throughout the rest of the film. Another thing, that I love about the film is how over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets. CGI was used sparingly mainly to enhance the Namibian landscape, remove stunt rigging and for removing Charlize Theron's left arm. The stunt work is intense. It's extremely violent, with nonstop car chase scenes, explosions, and hand to hand combat. This movie is a good example that the Academy Awards need to have a category for stunt work. Still, the movie does go over the top, unrealistic at times. It's funny, how many bullets are wasted for a post-apocalypse film. The acting is pretty good as well. Charlize Theron is great, as the female lead. She shows that female action heroes can be, awesome. The film is driven by strong women and can be seemed as a feminist movie. Mad Max is pretty much a supporting character, to be honest. Still, you see a lot of him. Tom Hardy really gets the character of Max. A man of action and of few words. He was build, to be an action star. Still, the character has a confusing, origins story. The writers try to suggest that this Max's origin is the same as the original films, but clearly something were changed. While, yes he kinda wears a near-identical outfit, while wearing a leg brace as he did at the end of 1979's Mad Max and the entirety of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, but the movie gives him, some really haunting flashbacks, that we haven't witness, before. I don't know, where his hauntings came from or who the girl, was. It wasn't in the original films. There was a few other things to nitpick. I wish, he drove the modified police Interceptor, more and he looks a little more like Mel Gibson's Max. The movie has a lot of odd-looking supporting characters. At much, as I love the character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult). I can't buy into his heel to face turn and his love story with one of the sex slaves. It was a bit forced. Another weird moment in the film is the freaky looking side-characters. It remind me of 2006's 300 in a bit when it comes to the grotesque. Still, this movie makes more sense, since it take place, after a nuclear holocaust, but there were some really over the top gross-villains. It makes me, wonder if the water at the citadel is honestly, safe to drink. In my opinion, it seem poisoned. Overall: This demolition derby testosterone full film is a lot of fun, to watch. It's amazing that Miller has been in charge of the Mad Max series for so many decades, and I'll be looking forward to the next series of Mad Max films, from him. This is a must-watch. You have to be crazy, not to watch this film.",9,5,13,18 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformer! More than meets the eyes.
","My first thought of hearing Transformer: Dark Side of the Moon was that, Pink Floyd was going to do the soundtrack and that Transformer was going into more space Sci-fiction. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. We start off the movie with some back story of the war between the Autobots and Deceptions fighting on their home world and one of the Transformer's spacecraft crash landing on Earth's moon. When Apollo 11, lands on the moon, they find in the craft, an invention capable of ending the war call 'the Pillars' that allows quick teleportation from planet to planet. This back-story, should have been place in the first movie (2007) as it will make more sense there. I don't know why we're given this information so late in the series. It would have made the wait for the third movie so much more. Also how does this become a government secret for so long? Honestly, you would think the military would be better prepared for the events of the first movie, if they knew this information about the alien spacecraft. Not once, during the events of the first movie, did they think, I don't know, try to use that invention as a weapon against the invading robots. Couldn't some of the back-story about Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) be put in the 2007 movie!!! He was an big character in the first animation movie. The story felt put into at the last minute and doesn't make any sense to the story already create in this world by the 2007 film. We go with the history of the moon landing to a 'Ass Shot' of Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington Whitely). The greatest mindless way to introduce your character to your fans, by saying 'yes, she's hot'. Her moon is hotter. In my opinion, it was mindless soft core porn. Couldn't we have something about her, besides that's hot? She's pretty much the hot Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) without any skills set. She takes Carly from the Generation 1 character Carly Witwicky. So we find out that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is looking for job, yes, the man who save the world twice, can't find a job. Like I will believe that, why wasn't he working with the military or something? By this part of the series, Sam should honestly be a bad-ass, but no!!!! Let me give you an example. In Star Wars: Luke was just a farm-boy who was just a bit silly, who knew how to fly and shoot a blaster, in the second movie, Luke got trained to be a Jedi, and was becoming a bad-ass. The third movie, Luke was a Jedi. I was hoping the same with this movie, yes he can still be a bit funny, but the years of warfare and him losing his girlfriend should have made him more serious. Somebody once said that Sam was the 2007 Marty McFly, but even Marty McFly from Back in the Future had a development arch where he got smarter. Sam is same character, he see in the first movie. In my opinion, I would have shown a back-story of Sam losing Megan Fox's character based on the war, like having her character killed by the Deceptions for God's sakes!!!! Mikaela breaks up with him for no reason. What? It's doesn't make sense for him, to get with Rosie so easy as well. We don't really get to know how they met up, based on the movie, Carly (Rosie's character) was working at the White House when Sam met Obama for a medal and she find him cute. Yeah. That's lames, Carly go from working at the white house to being eye candy. A step back in career choice, in my opinion. When did actual skill become secondary to attractiveness? Carly like the actress playing her has a character arch of a model. There is no reason to like her. Carly is a model who looking to become more popular with the public, and she use Sam as her way to reaching that. Are we supposed to believe that Carly is in love with Sam just because he's cute? Come on! Back to the movie, after mindless comedy shots of Sam looking for a job, that didn't really need to be in the movie, because it will play no part later. We find out that the Deceptions raid the moon for the pillars to invade Earth. Honestly, if they were able to go to the moon, couldn't they invade the Earth without it? What is the point of the pillars if you can quickly get back from Moon to Earth without them? The only thing that made sense was to bring the planet, but if there were like hundreds of Deceptions waiting in the moon to invade the planet, wouldn't they invade with their ships??? It doesn't make sense. The best part of the movie was the Chicago battle remind me of the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in it's epic scale. I like it. The CGI was great, but it felt like a visual orgy without any plot. The movie song by Linkin Park was pretty awesome as well. It's an enjoyable stupid popcorn flick. It's not Oscar worthy, but it's not the worst movie ever. If you just want explosions and hot chicks, it's so-so movie from Michael Bay. Michael Bay has a way to direct his movie as if it's mindless porn. If you are expecting something akin to the previous two, look elsewhere.",6,3,6,2 April 2013
Macbeth," While, this movie might have the sound and fury, there were some things that needed a little more work. Despite that, the movie was still alright
","As usual with well-known stories like Macbeth, there are an absurd number of ways, this classic play can be portrayed. While, the play will always be timeless, the adaption of that play into movie form might not. Sadly, I don't see it, with this film. While, this movie is nowhere near as good as director Orson Welles' 1948's version or even Akira Kurosawa retelling of the story in 1957's Throne of Blood. Director Justin Kurzel's version of Macbeth was still beautiful, haunting, and bloody enough for a well-made adaptation of the William Shakespeare's 1606 classic tale of betrayal. I have to rank it as the third best adaption of the bard's original text; just somewhat beating out, Director Roman Polanski's 1971's version. Although the play is not an accurate portrait of the real life, historical king of Scotland since William Shakespeare took a lot of liberties with the source material, 'Holinshead's Chronicles', a best-selling popular history book of the time. Still, Shakespeare's epic tale of madness being retold here, was faithful enough to the play, to gain a lot of critics support, but not accuracy enough for historians. Like the original play, 2015's Macbeth tells the story of a man, Macbeth (Michael Fassfender) being consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) to murders his cousin king, Duncan (David Thewlis) and takes the throne for himself. As he grows more powerful, his personality become more and more paranoid and cruel, until the day, he alienated all those supporters that help him, gain power, forcing their hand into yet another betrayal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, unlike other critics that praise the acting in this film. I have to say, for me, it was below average. Don't get me wrong, Michael Fassbender really shine in the gory action scenes, but despite that, I really didn't like, his mostly monotone reading of the lines. He really didn't do a good job, dramatize of the damaging physical and psychological effects of Macbeth that well. If anything, he seem cold and distance from the beginning as if a non-human, robot than a straight up good guy turn bad. He sounds like dull audio book, most of the time. I was really hoping for more an in depth emotional turn. A good example is how you don't see, much of his guilt, during the aftermath of killing his own King and friends. In my opinion, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth was a better actor here, than Fassbender. At least, she shows more a little more emotional than her couther-part. One thing, that I like about her, here is that, her French accent wasn't so thin. You can barely, hear it. However, like the rest of the cast, she was a bit boring at certain scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love the use of Old English, being spoken here; I just don't like, how nearly all of the characters actors didn't put any emotional to it. Just think, if they did! You would have somebody in the level of a 'Laurence Olivier' here. Another thing, that I didn't like, about the film is the pacing. Some parts, really takes forever, to get anywhere. Then other parts, are just way too quick. It's a bit uneven. I also didn't like how the film cut everything related to comic relief, including the porter at the gate and large chunks of the Witches' dialogue. The movie wouldn't be, so gloomy to watch, if they kept those. While, it sounds like I found the movie to meh. There were some parts, I did like; I like that the film was filmed on location in the Scottish Highlands. Every location was well-shot. The add-on effects of slow motion, blood & gore, and the spooky fog makes it seem so eerily. I also love the film uses carefully-researched 11th-century costumes for this film. This movie's look reminded me, of a mixer of 2010's HBO TV Series 'Game of Thrones', 2004's film, King Arthur and 1996's film, Braveheart, in how vicious, medieval times were. Another thing I like, is how they got mostly Scottish actors; to performed here. It adds to the feel of the film. I also love, the realistic portrayal of the supernatural here. I love how the three witches, are just three widows of a recent battle. I love how Macbeth has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which gives a new context to his visions. Another thing is how I love about the film is how, they kept some things, the same as the play. The twist that William Shakespeare has always establish, here in the story will always be wonderful. Overall: While, there were some flaws, 2015's Macbeth is still epic and cinematic, enough to be worth seeing, if you're a huge Shakespeare fan. So check it out!",7,4,7,21 January 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," I pursuit in finding this movie. Was it worth it? Yes, it gave me a little bit of happiness watching it.
","This movie is probably one of the best father and son relationship movies. I really enjoyed and learned a great deal about persistence in this film. It had me tearing up at times but in a good way. One scene in particular about never giving up, when his son is playing basketball, got to me. I like motivational films like this and this one is definitely hit the spot. The Pursuit of Happiness is based on the memoirs of Chris Gardner who struggle with homelessness with his son for nearly a year in pursuit of his dream job, a stockbroker. In the film directed by Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith starts as Chris Gardner with his son Jaden Smith as Chris Jr. In my opinion, I believe Will Smith was amazing. Glad he was nominated for the Oscar that year. If there weren't tough competitions that year, he would have won. By having the child actor and the main actor related to each other, it's portray a real life parenthood that rarely is shown in the movies. If you didn't know that they were related, and didn't know anything behind the screen. By just looking at the film, you would have think, wow, these actors truly seem connection as a father and son. This movie can be a bit depressing if any of its viewers have dealt with homelessness. There are some scenes that are really hard to watch. In my opinion, the bathroom at a subway station scene was the hardest to watch. Still, who knew Dinosaurs live at the train station? The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. First off, the wife portray by Thandie Newton was just a mean spirit witch who abandon them just because she wanted her freedom back. In real life, she left because he actually cheated on her and the arrest in the film was actually for domestic violence. She did take care of the child for a while he was pursuing his dream job, but in the end, she did abandoned the child with Gardner. It's hard to tell what were the real reasons why she left them, but the film, the wife seemed on the verge of breakdown. Even if Will Smith's character was going through hell and more he kept his poise and kept it together. The mother seemed unstable and not at all trust-worthy with a child. She looked and acted like she was ready to snap. Was she portray a villain on film? Yes. Did she deserve it? Probably not, she probably had her reasons, but still there is no reason to abandoned her child. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time. I think if the movie struggle was portray, like it was in nearly a year, it would be just too depressing. Although eight-year-old Jaden is portraying a five year old Chris, during the time of 1981, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Just think of that for a second, that's pretty hard for a homelessness man to deal with. While the movie love to say that he only had 30 dollars left in his bank account and no job when he struggle to find a place to live; in real life, he was earning a small salary and was able to afford rooming. Plus, he was gainfully employed as an early stage of being a stockbroker. Also in no way, did the Glide Memorial Church turn them away. I do like the special cameo by Chris Gardner toward the end that people need to check out. The music soundtrack by Andrea Guerra is amazing. The visuals of the film does make it look like 1981 San Francisco even if there are a few anachronisms. The homeless people in the film were truly sadly homeless people, so that's worth noting. The movie is telling the story of Chris's struggles with poverty and by having real people struggling in the film, it gave the movie more depth. While, Chris isn't the perfect father, he does things that might be wrong, like cheat and lie. Still, Chris isn't a hero, he was just an ordinary human being, and like every single ordinary human being in the world he did some things that probably weren't right and some things that he might regret. By having some flaws in the character was worth watching. What I learnt was that if one is desperate enough, one will do what one can to survive and protect their young. It's fairly primitive. Smith's character did not enjoy reneging on his rent but he had little choice. I didn't find his behavior too reprehensible. Some critics dislike the film with the capitalism ideas it has and the illusion of the American Dream. Was Chris Gardner pursuing happiness or pursuing money? It seem to me, it was money. Does money make happiness? No, always, but it does help. It's hard to find people not interested into making money. Plus, solving a Rubik's Cube in minutes, will make you land a gig as a stockbroker job? I do find that unlikely just as much as the scene with him showing up with no suit and landing the internship. Some people are thinking too much into the film, as they think of this movie as a movie against capitalism, for capitalism, pro-republican, pro-democratic, pro-Marxist, etc. etc. This movie is the struggle of one man trying to live a better life. Yes, times are getting harder, things are getting more expensive, everyday life for those who aren't rich just living from pay check to pay check, but this film gives them the optimism for themselves to pursuit such happiness for themselves. It doesn't mean, they have to be rich, as long as they are stable with who they are, and where they are at. That's what I believe is the overall theme of the film.",8,0,0,17 June 2013
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," If you going to see this movie, then you had chosen wisely. Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade is the holy grail of adventure movies.
","While, 1981's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' & 1984's 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', were all-great movies on their own right. 1989's 'Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade' was indeed my favorite of all those films. It had everything. Great action, wonderful humor, amazing special effects, powerful message, and a beautiful climax ending. It was a nearly a perfect movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg once again, the film tells the story of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), this time, teaming up with his father, Henry (Sean Connery) in order to protect the Holy Grail from the evils of Nazi Germany. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this film is without a few flaws. One of the biggest complains about this movie, is how much, this film copycat the plot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', down to a tee. Not only does both films have Indy search for biblical artifact, but also has a rival archaeologist/businessman that sympathizer with the Nazis in order to achieve power. This time, it's Walter Donovan (Julian Glover). No matter what the similarities are, with this plot and the first movie. I just have to say, the story is a lot better than some of the ideas, that writers George Lucas, Jeffery Boam, and Menno Meyjes were originally thinking of, like Indiana Jones exploring an 'haunted mansion'. That doesn't sounds like a 1930's serial, pulp adventure novel at all! Also, thank God, Spielberg didn't use, producer, George Lucas original idea of having Jones, look for alien skulls. We wouldn't get that, mess, until years later, when 2008's 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' came out, disappointing audiences everywhere. That would be horrible plot to end the original trilogy. While, Lucas's other idea of having Indy look for the Monkey King sounds ridiculous on the surface. In truth, it could had been an interesting film, if made. Regardless, there were a lot of new things that this film has to offer its viewers, as well. One of the better parts of the film was the action opening with River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones, trying to escape from some grave robbers via a passing circus train. That was a lot of fun. It was also very well told, as so many Indiana Jones's trademarks, were explain in 10 minute. During the filming of that sequence, producer George Lucas saw the potential of a prequel series. He would soon develop and produce, 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles', an American television series that aired on ABC from March 4, 1992, to July 24, 1993. Another innovative thing that the film has to offer, is the father/son relationship between Henry Sr. & Indy. The way, they interact with each other, both with body language and dialogue was amusing to watch. Of course, Harrison Ford as Indy was amazing, but who knew that, Sean Connery could be so funny!? He was wonderful in this role. Even, returning actors like Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody & John Rhys-Davies as Sallah were equally as great in their small roles as of the original. Sadly, not all sidekick roles in this movie was remarkable. I was kinda disappointed with Indiana Jones teaming up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) in the first part of the film. For a character that supposed to be archaeologist, she seems more like a stereotypical dumb blonde bimbo who really doesn't helps him in any way. She's pretty much there to be the required love interest & damsel in distress. Another thing, I didn't like about Elsa, was the character's twist toward the middle. Without spoiling it, too much, all I have to say, it very obviously that she's not playing with the right team, here. You can clearly see that, a mile ahead in the beginning. I thought, the movie could had done, better to make the character's seem more, heroic than what we got in the film; so that, her betrayal would hold more weight & be more emotional; rather than predictable & generic. Talking about broad. Like the original film, the villains in this movie were portray as cartoony over the top pure evil, rather than complex individuals. While, I wouldn't say, this is a bad thing, seeing how the sheer presence of Michael Byrne as Nazi Officer Vogel was just as good as Gestapo agent Todt (Ronald Lacey) from the first movie. I do think, a little more character development could be needed to fill in, some of the huge plot-holes of this film, has, like why the Nazis would be looking for the grail, if they can't bring it back to Germany, due to the Great Seal. It would be, pretty hard for the Nazis to control the temple, seeing how it's in the Hatay State. They weren't even close to Turkey, by 1939. Even in the height of WWII, Germany was nowhere near close in invading Syria. In the end, it felt a bit confusing. Thank God, we got the music by composer, John Williams to distract us, from that large plot-hole. Once again, the soundtrack was beautiful to listen to. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe at the many exotic locations was also breathtaking in visual standards. There were so many iconic well-shot memorable scenes that it make me, want to visit many of these real-life sites in Utah, Turkey, Jordan, Italy, Germany and Spain. Overall: This movie was absolute blast to watch. Still, watchable, even today. Highly recommended for anybody seeking the call to adventure. A must watch.",9,0,0,30 May 2017
Back to the Future," Great Scott! Back to the Future is a great time-travel movie!
","Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the 'Johnny B. Goode' sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, 'The Power of Love'. It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads.",9,9,10,21 July 2014
The Great Gatsby," It's probably the best Great Gatsby movie, old sport.
","I think everybody has read this book during high school. I don't know why they want us to read it, but it probably has to do with it being a linguistically sophisticated, intellectually teaching about the political, moral, and social fabric of our nation. In my opinion, it's not the greatest American masterwork novel of all times and no way represented how the people should seek the American Dream. I have to say, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was a better novel than this. I read the book, but 'The Great Gatsby' wasn't never sacrosanct to me. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald 'This Side of Paradise' was a better novel than this. Still, I did like Great Gatsby in an odd way because it was a cautionary tale. How faithful is Baz Luhrmann's movie 'The Great Gatsby' is to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. In my opinion, it somewhat follows the novel. Nick Carraway (Tobey McGuire) is an upstanding young man from the Midwest, moves to New York to seek his fortune in the bond business. He rents a cottage on Long Island, next to a mansion occupied by a man of mysterious origins but manifest wealth: Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), known far and wide for his extravagant parties. One day he is invited to his party, and learns his deepest secret. Everything he has work up for, was designed to attract the attention of his first love: the beautiful Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who happens to be Nick's cousin and marry to an unpleasant cheater of a husband, Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). He pursuits her, only leading to tragic results. The movies does well in establishing a lot of F. Scott Fitzgerald themes. Such in the case toward the end, in the hollowness of morals of the upper class and how greed decayed social and moral values. The film makes great use of the Green light that represent Gatsby's hope and dreams of the future, and the Eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg that represent God. The visuals in the film are stunning. The movie did change a few things in the story that work and didn't work. The biggest changes of the story is that of Nick Carraway, who in the film is not in a relationship with Jordan Baker. I didn't miss that part of the novel so much in the film, as it really does freed up space in the film to focus more on Gatsby and Daisy. Fitzgerald did devoted a lot of work to Nick and Jordan's relationship which was sadly cut. It would have been nice to add on the end of the film, rather than the depressing ending, the film put out there. The movie does reveal some of Gatsby's past way too soon in the film as it is repeated yet again toward the end. It would have been stronger to reveal his past toward the end, for a bigger reaction from the audience. The biggest problem with the film is while Fitzgerald's book always feels very much a product of a particular period in time, Luhrmann's work always seems like one grand costume party, irrevocably modern and full of rap music. This movie reminds me, too much of 2001's Moulin Rouge. Rather than having good songs like Moulin Rouge had, this just had badly made contemporary music. In no way does Jay-Z rapping help this film with the 1920's feel. I could have done without all the rap music. I just didn't feel it adding anything to it and seem out of place. I do like the Jazz score. In every film, he directs, Director Baz Luhrmann can really make a party seen fun, but gees, this are the most unrealistic parties I ever witness. F. Scott Fitzgerald 'The Great Gatsby' was very humorless. At less, Baz add a bit of humor to it. While Luhrmann's film is loud, bright, vivid extravaganza of color, action, and drama in 3D. The film could cut down a bit on the CGI & 3D; and focus more on the story. The 1974's Great Gatsby served Fitzgerald's novel better even if it's a bit slow then this. The acting in this 2013 film is great. DiCaprio was perfect as Gatsby. He plays the character exactly how he is in the novel. Still, could have there been a scene where he doesn't call somebody, Old sport for once. Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan were great in their role. Tobey McGuire was pretty OK, but since his character was cut down a lot when not talking to Gatsby. He didn't have much acting to do, besides walking around and watch people. About the characters. Yes, it's about rich people having parties. So it might be hard to identify with any of the characters, as most of them have little to no redeeming values besides many Nick Carraway. They can all be a bit unlikeable. Let's remember the film and book shows the lack of empathy is in New York society. Nick and Gatsby are the only ones who show any empathy in the film. It's the carelessness that is being criticized here and their lack of morality. That is what makes the book so great. In my opinion, the film works because of that, so if you ever get the chance. Watch this film and learn what makes Gatsby, so great.",7,13,20,9 June 2013
13 Hours," It's no secret, I'm not a fan of a lot of director Michael Bay's latest works. However, '13 Hours' was not that bad. It was decent enough to watch.
","Inspired by true events & based off author Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book of the same name, this biographical war film follows the story of six members of Global Response Staff (GRS), who fought to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, during Ansar al-Sharia militant's attacks on September 11, 2012. Without spoiling the movie directed & produced by Michael Bay, too much; the motion picture was hatred by most of the Libyan people due to their negative portrayal. To the film's credit, I have to disagree with them, the audience does see many Muslims grieving and mourning the deaths, cause by the attacks and held signs apologizing for the extremists' violent acts. Adding on that, we do see several locals assisting the Americans. If anything, people should be angrier at the flick for being very clunky with overbearing visual special effects, chaotic camerawork & gratuitous explosions, macho sex appeal, and out of place, product placement such as 'Call of Duty' video games and cars from Mercedes-Benz. However, the worst had to be the utter lack of substance & character development within the main subjects. I can hardly remember, any of the GRS members, besides semi fictional Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski), whom comedic actor really did go all out for this role, by bulking up. Krasinski was very surprising, convincing as a serious gritty soldier. It's very unique. Don't get me wrong, the other performers did alright in the acting department as well, it's just that the personalities & charisma of their characters seem to all blended into one, during the quieter moments of the movie. None of them, stood out. They lack diversities. It didn't help that the film focus too much on overfilled action scenes, involving fictional previous missions that GRS went through, while in Libya, rather than establishing more of their family units & the warnings signs, leading to the compound attack. Their actions throughout the film didn't seem heartfelt, despite Lorne Balfe's amazing nail bitingly dramatic score. '13 Hours' really did missed some good moments to show us, how truly deep their sacrifice were. It only had surface level depiction of heroism; which is sad. Still, I like how the Rated R war film does not shy away from the gory, bloody images of war and the harsh language. I also dig the mixer of real life news archive footage of the event, with the reenactments. It gave the film a lot of authentic, unlike his other war film, 2001's 'Pearl Harbor', which borderline romantic fantasy. Surprisingly, this combat movie is little more historical accurate after the first half. However, there were some jarring things that screenwriter, Chuck Hogan & Michael Bay put in the film that really did not belong. Some examples are the way, the film constantly berating the CIA & Diplomatic Security (DS) agents outside from these private military contractors, as stuck up villainy cowardly pricks with no concept of tactical awareness. This is far from real life, as testimony shows, that both government agencies acted heroic, given the situation. While, it is true, that both groups ignore warnings like when two former security guards for the consulate, threw an IED over the consulate fence in April 2012; & just four days later, a similar bomb was thrown at a four-vehicle convoy carrying the United Nations Special Envoy to Libya, exploding twelve feet from the UN envoy's vehicle. There is little evidence that those assembles, including the Obama administration top heads deliberate sabotage themselves furthermore, by not providing air cover and ground support, that night; in order to cover up, the intelligence that the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria. Things like the over the top, stick in the mud, disrespectful, ineffective twit Chief-of-Station Commander, 'Bob' (David Costabile) trying to tell the men to stand down is clearly false. In real life, they were only little tactical disagreements between them about the speed with which the GRS team should depart for the rescue, not full grown hatred for each other. As for no air support argument; that is also not true, as government agencies did sent a surveillance drone to do a number of flybys, throughout the night & early morning. The reason for this, was due to the fact that there were no nearby attack aircraft on high alert that night with weapons & fuel within a 10 hour flight to Libya, because of a major maintenance overhaul. While, it's true that the closest fighter planes to trouble spots in North Africa were based in Aviano, Italy. Unlike the film, those fighter planes there, were not ready. Misleading viewpoints like these, were the reasons why some of the things told by the perspective of the soldiers were debunked in the ten investigations by different agencies on the matter. That's the problem with '13 Hours'. It's specifically composed, only by the unchecked bravado perspective of the soldiers, rather than everybody involved in the rescue mission. It's a bit one sided. Bay should had research more about the event from multiply sources including the FBI; the one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committee, rather than taking the one book source material at its word. In the end, moviegoers should know, while, Bay says the film purposefully steers clear of politics. It's really not. You can clearly, see, where they stand on the issue, based off, how they market the film. Not only was this film about a controversial foreign incident released during an extremely contentious election year, with movie studios specifically marketed it to conservatives; but it also screen by key Republican Party figureheads, hoping to generate endorsement quotations. In the end, this film might have help cost, Hillary Clinton, the election, even with it being a box office bomb. Despite that & some flaws. '13 Hours' is still watchable, during its 2 hour & 24 minute runtime. It's worth checking out.",7,8,14,13 December 2018
Warm Bodies," A Fresh Idea for the Zombie Genre.
","I don't think there is a lot of Zombies movies out there that tackles the idea of a corpse reanimation back into human. John Levine's movie does. Plus, it's rare to see a movie told from a zombie's perspective and showing human characteristics in the living corpses. The movie also gives a reason why the zombies eat the brain, because it's makes them feel alive due to being able to relive their victim's memories. The movie starts out, after a zombie apocalypse, R (Nicolas Hoult) live at the airport wishes to be more than a zombie, and feel alive again. It wasn't until he met Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer), a human survivor looking for medical supplies. Rather than eating her, he felt something for her. Now, R must try to keep Julie alive from his zombie friends lead by M (Rob Corddry) and the really undead 'Bonies'. Bonies are the zombies lost the last shreds of their humanity and gave up becoming nonstop killing machines. The more we spent with Julie, the more he turning back into human. The movie is based on the novel by Isaac Marion and very similar to it. The acting is pretty good, but it's not like they were doing Shakespeare. Cross that, it was Shakespeare in a way. There is a few connections to Warm Bodies and that of Romeo and Juliet. R might stands for Romeo. M, R's best friend might stands Mercutio. Julie is short for Juliet. Perry (Dave Franco), Julie's ex is the character of Paris, and last Nora (Analeigh Tipton) Julie's friend is The Nurse. Still there is no social prejudices similar to that of Romeo and Juliet in Warm Bodies. The reasons for this is because the zombies were really eating people. Therefore, people had good reason to fear them. One thing this movie isn't like is Twilight, but it was made to cash in of that fad. There is no love triangle or zombies taking their shirts off, or a whiny teenage girl that just wants a zombie boyfriend to do everything for her. I don't mind feminizing the zombie lore, as long as the story is good. I think the movie works. Nicolas Hoult's acting reminds me of Edward Scissorhand's Johnny Depp with the soft talking, and in some cases, Leonardo DiCaprio dying in the water in Titanic. This is one of the very few roles, Rob Corddry isn't annoying. I didn't like how Teresa Palmer looks like the blonde Kristin Stewart. They were really trying to get the Twilight fans with this. I would give props to John Malkovich, but he's barely in the movie. I like the movie's allegory theme on how technology disconnects us and how we need to feel connect again. I like the Easter Egg of a zombie that looks like Rick Grimes from Walking Dead in the tarmac scene. I was kinda disappointed by the make up in the film. The zombies rarely look like zombies. I didn't think of R as a zombie, but more like a handsome Goth guy. The Bonies were made by awful CGI that makes it looks like leftover Imps design from the movie Doom or the Mummy. I think it was the same CGI from the Mummy (1999). Just watch both of them and you sees the similar design. For a zombie movie, there isn't that much violence in the film. I don't know if it's hurts the film, or not. I like how the zombies were not made out to be brainless, we really made to care for them if they do get killed. Still, I don't like watching movie that deals with falling in love with the dead. While they didn't have sex, it felt a bit necrophilia. It will still gross me out. I have to say that the movie was pretty good, and I enjoy it. Give it a watch if you're looking something new in a zombie movie.",7,3,5,17 March 2013
Sully," Sully soar high with me. Yet, there were some engine problems.
","Hailed as a national hero in the United States, Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) successfully executed an emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River off Manhattan, New York City, on January 15, 2009, after the aircraft was disabled by striking a flock of geese during its climb out from LaGuardia Airport. This movie directed by Clint Eastwood, tells about the real-life account of the aftermath of the 'Miracle on the Hudson', in which Sullenberger was challenge by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) if the water landing was really necessary, as it would endangered the passengers lives. Without spoiling the movie, too much, when fact-checking this movie, I found the film based on Sullenberger's autobiography 'Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters' to be very accurate. However, there was one big problem. In order to give his film some sort of friction, beyond the short, but intense water landing, Eastwood reportedly made antagonists out of the US federal agency responsible for investigating major transit accidents. That means a lot of scenes, them, being exaggerating too hostile to Captain Sullenberger and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). In my opinion, there were way too many of that. The deliberately stink eye and 'out to get him' dialogue, really got heavy handedly, and felt a bit annoying to watch. The reasons why, is because, in truth, the NTSB was far from blaming or criticizing the captain for his actions. Reports as early as 2009, has stated that they always supported the narrative of Sullenberger's heroism. I know, Eastwood just wanted to add some melodrama to the story, but they wasn't no need to make the NTSB to look like comical villains. Another thing, I found annoying, was the direction of the film. It was too sentimental and sappy at times. The music and patriotic visuals, only added to the cheesiest. Also, the decision to show bits and pieces of the crash several times throughout the film was not a good choice. It made the film feel repetitive. It really does takes away from what could have been a really hard hitting piece of filmmaking with the entire recreation of Flight 1549 in real time. Something, very similar to what is portray in director Paul Greengrass' 2006 biographical drama-thriller film, 'United 93'. There's no question that Eastwood's movie is still harrowing and gripping, but it really starts to lose its luster after knowing that there is barely any different, between each flashback to that day; no matter, whom vantage point, the movie is being told. Because of this, the pacing is somewhat slow. It really took forever to get to what really, did happened. For a 96 minutes, it's the shortest film, Eastwood had ever directed; yet, it felt long. Then, there is the fact that some parts of the movie was somewhat boring. Much of this, come from the fact that the main character is just not that interest in the film, besides the fact that he save people that day. Don't get me wrong, I have to say, for the most part, Hanks gives the quiet, monotone Sullenberger, an alright performance that worth seeing, but nothing about Sully in the film is that memorable. In the end, he was somewhat forgettable. It's sad, because there were some parts of Sully's life that could had been entertaining to watch, more. Yet, Eastwood really made, his past seem really boring and short. I really don't get, how that was possible, seeing that Sully once flew McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II for a living and help investigation other aviation disaster, such as Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 and USAir Flight 1493. It would be really nice to see, more of the past, rather than repetitive fake looking CGI shots of the same plane crash. Nevertheless, I do like how this movie show the other heroes that day, like Ferry Captain Vincent Lombardi, who was the captain of the first ferry to reach the plane, who played himself in the movie & the New York Scuba Divers. Yet, I felt that adding the story of some of the passengers, was a bit distracting; seeing how their stories, don't really add much to the rest of the film. You would think, their viewpoints of the crash, would play more into the plot. Yet, it didn't. The same goes with having Laura Linney as Lorraine Sullenberger, Sully's wife. The script barely had anything for her to do. Surprising, Hanks and her don't even share, any scenes together. It's really pathetic. How are we supposed to believe that, they have a connection with each other, if we don't see them, embrace!? Added to that insult is the fact that some supporting characters such as Aaron Eckhart & Kate Couric kinda plays their roles, a little bit too over the top to the point, that I found their performance to be a bit distracting. Despite that, I have to say, Eckhart does bring this movie, some really needed charm. However, I don't think, it was right decision to end the movie so abruptly after a tacky joke from his character. It felt so anticlimax. Nor did I like how film's release date coincide with the 15th anniversary of the 9/11/01 attacks. Yes, the film show New York in one of its best moment, but it a very blatant attempt to cash in on people's emotions. Still, if Sullenberger says he supported your movie about him. Then, you're doing something right. I have to agree with that. Overall: As much as I torn, through this movie and show it's faults; it still was somewhat enjoyable good-nature movie. Since, the director was involved in an emergency water landing in the past. You see that, Clint Eastwood put a lot of heart into making this film and it shows. In the end, Sully is worth flying over and go see, but it does need to leave a few things on the tarmac to be a masterpiece.",8,0,0,15 December 2016
Jurassic Park," Hold on to your butts, it's now in 3D. Jurassic Park is Rex!
","I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you.",9,8,9,6 April 2013
Valkyrie," This movie is a thrill ride of the Valkyries. It's a pretty good movie
","Valkyrie is a great movie that shows some ignorant Americans that not all German were evil Nazis whom goal was to conquer the world during WWII. A few of them, like these list of characters in the film, didn't like how Adolf Hitler was taking Germany into a downward path, and try to do something about it, even if the overcome wasn't in their favor. Valkyrie is a great movie about the last attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler prior to the end of World War II. The film depicts the 20 July plot in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate Hitler and to use the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the country. Tom Cruise is pretty OK as the Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who channels his anger at Hitler's (David Bamber) atrocities and mismanagement of the war by joining a secret organization bent on killing the Führer. Tom Cruise is pretty much acting like Tom Cruise here. He does try to speak German in the first 2 minutes of the film, but the film quickly turn to English to stop him from further butchering of the German language. In no way, does Tom Cruise even accept a German accent. In truth, little of the actors did. Some of the non-German actors initially experimented with German accents, but director Brian Singer discarded the idea, instead instructing them to adopt neutral accents that o it wasn't distract from the story'. Sorry, Brian, but it was a bit distracting. You never really get into the movie because of these inaccuracies. Listening to German officers & soldier speaking in British/American accents was unrealistic, you don't need to speak perfect German or even a strong German accent but when you have supposedly German officers/soldiers speaking in clear British/American accents, realism completely falls out the window. In the movie 1993's 'Schindler's list' they spoke in English but at least in strong German accents so it didn't seem to fake, and look at how well that movie turned out, and how this movie didn't reach that success. I think a lot of criticize come from the fact, that at the time, Tom Cruise's personal life controversial was reaching a new high. Let me state that, I don't think anybody should hate this movie because Tom Cruise is an extreme scientologist. Him being a scientologist, have nothing to do with this film at all. Yes, scientology can seem like a cult following like the Nazis movement, but Tom Cruise is making a movie about not following a cult leader here. It was shocking to hear that the film makers had trouble finding German locations to film because of this. It didn't help that also portraying Nazism in Germany is also somewhat banned there. So to attack the movie just because of that fact that Tom belong to scientology is wrong, and stupid. As long as Tom Cruise does an OK performance, I will be happy to see any film from him. I hailed Cruise's professionalism. I just wish he did more to portray Stauffenberg. He still seem a bit off. My opinion, the role should had gone to Michael Fassbender. Another criticize from some critics is that it is predictable. History tells us the plot failed, of course, and Hitler killed himself months later. But that doesn't stop Cruise or director Bryan Singer from approaching the film as a thinking person's thriller, told from inside the conspirators' camp, where the outcome of their deeds were uncertain for several tense hours. It was create as if we were reliving history at the first time, we didn't know what happen to Adolf Hitler. Who knows, he could had die in the bomb accept and we wanted the heroes to success in their goal. The film made me invested in the characters. Sadly the experience falls short of any realism or authenticity to the point that some people find it dull and boring. I found it interesting at a point, but without the realistic German accent acting. It seem like a really stage play or something like that. I think the actors did a swell job. Some of them like supporting characters like Bill Nighy as General Friedrich Olbricht, Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow and Tom Wilkinson as Colonel General Fredrich Fromm did amazing jobs standing out. While, Terence Stamp is awesome actor, his role as Colonel General Ludwig Beck is nearly forgettable until the end. I nearly forgot he was in the film. The production of the film went through hell with certain crew getting injury in an accident, and some of the film getting damage. While there is a number of historic accuracy, like historically, Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden on July 15. It didn't hurt the film. What seems to be missed in the movie is Hitler's obsession with SS leader Himmler. It was Himmler that Code Valkyrie was directed against, because Himmler was the most likely candidate to assume power. Historians have not yet unraveled the linkage between Stauffenberg's preemptive activation of the Valkyrie plan and the dire threat that Himmler posed to Hitler during the war. The movie score and visuals were amazing. While the movie was finish early in 2008. The release date got confusing with United Artists changing the date to avoid playing during other big releases and didn't release the film until late 2008. It was a marketing nightmare. It got troubles in some towns in Germany due to its Nazi subject matter. In America, it came out with other related Nazi subject matters films such as 2008's the Reader and 2008's the Boy in the Striped Pajamas. It didn't help that it open on X-MAS, but at less it didn't flop. Overall: it was a good decent film. It did help renewed the topic of the German Resistance among the German populace. That's the most important thing.",7,0,0,8 August 2013
The Simpsons Movie," Call me, Mr. Burns, because I thought, the Simpson Movie was 'excellent' even with its flaws.
","There was a period during the 1990s when it was impossible to avoid the unstoppable juggernaut that was 'the Simpsons'. The animation show aired on the FOX broadcasting network was must watch TV! However, those days are now over. With adult-driven animation shows being more couple, due to the thanks of cable networks like Comedy Central & Adult Swim, 'the Simpson' doesn't seem as funny and unique as it once was. It has really became, yesterday's news. In order to spice up, the show's ratings; in 2007, between Season 18 & Season 19, the sitcom created by Matt Groening & produced by James L. Brook, finally decided to make a full length movie with their writing and animation staff, after sitting on the idea for so long, since 1992. Thus, the first real steps of 'the Simpson Movie' was born. Directed by David Silverman, the movie tells the story of the working class family having to save Springfield from the Environmental Protection Agency, after Homer Simpson (Voiced by Dan Castellaneta), over-pollution the town's lake. Without spoiling the film, too much, I have to say, it must had been a challenge to make this movie. After all, they had to construct an overall story that they haven't done before for the die-hard fans, while, also bring forth something familiar. For the most part, they kinda achieve it. Taking elements from Season 2, Episode 4: 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' & the opening parts of Season 4, Episode 12: 'Marge vs. the Monorail', 'the Simpson Movie' molded a compelling adventure story that was strong enough for movie length. Unlike, their first try, with Season 4, Episode 1: 'Kamp Krusty' idea, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a season premiere. Numerous other ideas were also attempted, such as the Simpson saving the manatees, which was later used in Season 17, Episode 1 ''Bonfire of the Manatees', and a parody of 1998's 'The Truman Show'- which was later used as the plot in 2007's 'The Simpsons Game'. Groening even expressed a wish to make a musical parody of 1940's 'Fantasia', which also fell through. In the end, the environmental dome story was chosen. However, there are some debate if this story is honestly original, as some people had speculated on a perceived similarity between this movie and Stephen King's 'Under the Dome' novel. Regardless of that, the biggest flaw within this story, is how much, the sub-stories are tiresome rethread. Seeing, Ned Flanders (Voiced by Harry Shearer) try to win over, Bart Simpson (Voiced by Nancy Cartwright) felt like old news. We already saw this formula plot in past episodes like, Season 7, Episode 3 'Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily' & others. Even the idea of Marge (Voiced by Julie Kavner) threating to leave Homer for being a selfish, apathetic dick, isn't really new. Also, the way, the movie resolve, these issues in the climax of the film, doesn't feel complete or fulfilling. If anything, Homer's normally idiotic, selfish behavior is still around in the end. It's clear, that the film doesn't know, how to do, character arches; as the epiphany really didn't do much to change or evolve him. In my opinion, the movie would had done better, if they didn't make Homer into such an unlikeable jerk. At least, the movie would be, more watchable, as we can honestly root for the protagonist, rather than being dragged along with somebody, we don't care, as much. Despite that, I think there is only one sub plot in this movie that wasn't really needed, and that was Lisa Simpson (Voiced by Yeardley Smith) falling in love. Those romantic scenes really don't add much to the main plot. Plus, her relationship with the boy never really carry on, the main show, afterwards. It was totally pointless. It felt like filler. Regardless of the flaws in the story, as a fan of 'the Simpsons', I can safely say that, outside of a few good episodes here and there, this movie has the best animation. There is noticeably more prominent shading, a broader color palette and conspicuous CGI abound, not to mention a handful of more fluidly-animated scenes which were animated in-house that was really well-put. As for the voice performers, they all do a fantastic job. Even, guest voice actors like Albert Brooks, Tom Hanks and the band, Green Day did an amazing job. As for the jokes. It was a hit and miss. Some action sequences were really funny & smart, such as the breaking the fourth wall opening act with Homer yelling at the theater or Fox running ads for shows in the bottom of the scene. Even, the political satire were hilarious and clever. I kinda dig the jab at NSA (Natural Security Agency) listening in, to everybody and the scenes where the oil companies playing Alaskans to keep quiet, while they rampage the state's natural resources. They were very interesting. However, there were some jokes that seem really dated or flew over the heads of most viewers to understand; such as parody of 2006's documentary, 'An Inconvenient Truth' & Easter eggs such as seeing a crashed ambulance near the gorge from Season 2, Episode 8 'Bart the Daredevil'. Those are a little bit, harder to catch. Regardless, the movie is probably best, watching on the internet or buying on DVD, than waiting for it to air on television; as it has been known, that certain sequences like the penis & flipping off the bird scene within the movie has be cut or altered by FOX network censors to fit in with FCC practices. Overall: While 'The Simpsons Movie' will probably not outshine any fan favorite episodes. It's still a triumphant collaboration of nearly a dozen of the series' best head-writers and producers. The result is a film that's truly worth watching for any die-hard or casual fan. Like a juicy donut, this is one movie, worth drooling, after. It's a must-watch.",7,0,0,24 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Don't call me a facehugger. This is one movie, I probably wouldn't run up to, hug and never let go! It wasn't great or awful. It was just meh.
","I'm sorry, but I really didn't like the story of a space vessel answering a distress call, only to find, a mysterious life form, attacking them. It felt like a rethread of 1979's 'Alien', but this time, minus the great characters with unique personalities. Nearly, every member of the crew of the 'Covenant' is forgettable. Even, the idea of the crew being composed entirely of married couples is not memorable, as it kinda falls apart, as the movie doesn't give enough time to explain, which person is dating whom. Even with that, the characters by themselves, had little to show for. I think the problem with this, comes from the fact that, much of the backstory on them that was shown in previews for this movie, was cut out of the final film. It's sad, because I would love to see 'the last supper' scene in the film, as that sequence really does developed them as complex human beings, rather than surface level redshirts. Another reason, why I didn't find the characters, interesting is, because the acting wasn't that strong. Katherine Waterston's character comes across as too much of a heroine Ellen Ripley type character, that she doesn't seem real. Where is Daniels sense of fear!? Then, there is Billy Crudup, whom character is describe as self-serious man of faith. However, he rarely shows that. Then, there is Danny McBride, as Tennessee, whom comes across as a caricature of original movie character, Dallas played by Tom Skerritt. Of course, the other crew is violently whittled down to even stand out. Another reason, why I can't stand, the human characters in this film, is the fact that all of the crew were f**king stupid. What type of space crew, go to alien world, without wearing any sense of environmental suits!? At least, the scientists from the last movie wore protective suits and didn't expose themselves to any unknown pathogen like morons until much later. Did IQ's drop sharply since the last movie!? Even worse, the film also makes use of some very obvious horror tropes by having characters announce that they are going off on their own in order to kill them. The first instance of this is acceptable since the aliens have not shown up yet, but the characters continue to do this throughout the film even though they know the monsters are around. Without spoiling the movie, too much, one returning character goes even further in acting dumb, by trusting the same android that help kill, most of her friends in the last movie, in travelling to find out, why the Engineers hate them. That's pretty blatantly dumb, even to those ordinary members of the audience that hasn't see the last movie. It's pretty clear, by how David (Michael Fassbender) acts in this film that he isn't to be, trusted, seeing how he trying to be, the modern day, Dr. Frankenstein. While, parts of the story does have substance, mostly with that character. It too, felt like we heard those, dangers of playing Gods part of the story before in 2012's 'Prometheus'. In my opinion, while Michael Fassbender was great in the duo role. I felt that Cain & Abel subplot, between the two androids was a bit disappointing. There was no point, in reexamine it. Characters quoting John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' & Percy Bysshe Shelley's ''Ozymandias' sonnet, felt a little too recycled. It really didn't add anything new to the story. It's sad, because there were other things that the writers could had focus more on, like explaining, why the engineers hate humanity. I guess, we will never know. Still, I did like how the movie, explain the 'black goo' more. Yet, it does leave, some unanswered questions, like if the 'Black Goo' was just a dangerous genetic manipulation bacteria, capable of poisoning life on its own, while combine with parasitic could create life, how can a Neomorph be created without a parasitoid form? It doesn't add up. Nevertheless, I also don't like how this film ruin the alien film lore, by saying the classic Xenomorphs simply didn't exist before this film. It makes no sense, seeing how a sculpture of a Xenomorph was feature in the last movie, even when, 'Prometheus' was supposed to be a stand-alone spin off film that wasn't a direct prequel to the original 1979's 'Alien' film. This is just one of many things that is upsetting, for more serious fans of the franchise. Another is the how long does, the aliens need to reproduce. Now, it only takes a few minutes for a creature to be, born, instead of days. Make up, your mind! Regardless, the creature from artist, H.R Giger still remains one of the most brutal monsters in all of cinema. It's nice to see them, brought to life with computer animation and moving with such intense ferocity and speed. I just wish, the movie would use more suspense with the creatures than gore. There were hardly any scary moments in this film. No jump scares. It felt rushed. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some entertaining action, some wonderful cinematography being shot in New Zealand and great special effects, but this film directed by Ridley Scott was also a bit painful to watch, because how pitch black, certain scenes were shot! I couldn't figure out, what was going on! Overall: While, this film fails to match the original in terms of sheer terror and elegance, Scott nevertheless delivers some imaginative takes on familiar sequences. However, it will be awkward for him, to explain in the sequels, why the technology in 'Alien' looks so retro; seeing how this movie looks so slick with 3D computers. It will be hard to fill that gap. In the end: I found most of this film to be just alright. Check it out if you want, just don't expect to get your mind blown, or your chest to burst in fear. I certainly didn't. Movie was just mediocre.",6,5,14,25 May 2017
Draft Day," Movie presented a rough draft day of a General Manager. Yet the story could had been told better. Movie was just alright.
","This movie was no touchdown. Honestly, the movie could had work, better, if the producers retouch in some areas in the script to make it more entertaining. As a huge football fan, I found it to be a bit boring. Even some NFL fans, don't bother watching the Draft due to its confusing nature, and how dull & long, it can last. You would think a movie directed by Ivan Reitman, who known for his comical movies would at less make Draft Day, a bit funny or fun to watch, but this movie is void of humor and action. I'm not saying, this movie is bad film, it was just disappointing to me. The premise of the film revolves around the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, Sonny Weaver (Kevin Costner) whom is trying to decide what is best for his team, for the upcoming NFL Draft pick. I think the movie is indeed a poor man's version of 2011's Money Ball with its similar premise. While, Moneyball was based on real events and was captivating. This movie was so fictionalized that none of it, really matters in the end. Yes, the trade that Cleveland makes in the movie is similar to the real-life trade made in the 2012 NFL Draft where the Washington Redskins traded their 2012 #6 overall pick, 2012 2nd Round selection, 2013 1st Round selection and 2014 1st Round selection for the 2012 #2 overall pick in order to select the star, they wanted, but it didn't help Washington win the Super Bowl that year. Honestly, we, as the audience don't even see the results of what the draft in the film did for the team for Cleveland Brown, or the film antagonist, the Seattle Seahawks. If the movie show them, winning or getting somewhere, maybe we can call the draft, a success or a bust, but the film doesn't do that for us. They don't even play a game in the movie. So, what was the point? I feel bad for Cleveland Browns and football fans, because there is little football action in a football movie. I don't get how the film need to dumb down the movie, for the audience mostly made out for hardcore NFL fans. Does the movie really need to explain what NFL team play for what city? It's pointless, because most likely non-NFL fans are not going to bother, watching this movie, anyways! I love wheeling and dealing backstage thing, but it wasn't tense, enough. The first half of the movie was really slow and had horrible pacing. Lot of filler scenes with the sub-plots of Sonny's secret girlfriend Ali Parker, (Jennifer Garner) being pregnancy that has little to do with the main plot. While, the movie did have a timer, it felt that the only good part in the film were the last 10 minutes, when the deals were going through. It was pretty realistic and accurate, plus a good watch. Why couldn't the movie just be about that? I think, this movie concept would have work better as a documentary like ESPN 30 for 30 film series. Why couldn't this movie be based on the documentary, 'Elway to Marino' an in-depth examination of the 1983 NFL Draft that was highlighted by a record six quarterbacks being taken in the first round, including future Hall of Famers John Elway and Dan Marino. Now, that was an interesting landmark draft. If not that, the infamous 1998's NFL Draft, where teams fought over Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. I love to see a movie that had some great draft bust and draft steals, which this movie sadly was missing. The acting is alright, but the movie mostly focus on the main character, so the film lacks development supporting characters. They are harden noticeable. I do like the cameos of real football stars like Arian Foster and legend Jim Brown. I give Arian Foster, some props. He can act. A lot of people might not like Kevin Costner's acting chops, but for me being a huge fan of Kevin Costner's early work, I have to say that, I find his acting in this film OK. Still, I think he was a bit typecast. I really don't know what the movie was going with his character. It felt like it was written for a much younger actor, and Kevin's presence make the film seem old and tiresome. Another thing, bothering me is the awful swap and cross cuts. The movie really went overboard with the transitions and it did become a bit repeatable. Lots of dialogue, but none of them were very noticeable. Give the audience more rocket-fire witty dialogue. I would pass on this movie at theaters or buying the DVD, and interception for a DVD rental price or wait into it aired on TV. Tackle it, if you really want to watch it, but just note, that while, it's describe as a football movie. There is little of it, in the end. Still, a very thought-provoking perspective into the business side of the NFL.",7,5,7,21 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," We're off to see the Wizard! The Wonderful Wizard of OZ! This movie is so magical!
","Directed by Victor Fleming, the 1939 musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is probably the most well-known and commercial adaptation based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. While the film is so dated, it's still watchable even today becoming part of American pop culture. The film is known for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters. The movie starts out amazing black and white, with Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), a young farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle, in Kansas in the early 1900s. She decide to run away, due to Dorothy's dog Toto, biting a neighbor. Before she can get far, a tornado comes up, carried her and her house to the Technicolor world of Oz. Dorothy find out that the only way to get home is to find the Wizard (Frank Morgan). With help from Gilda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and some new friends on the way, like Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin-Man (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lehr), they make their way to the Wizard on the dangerous yellow brick road, where the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is looking for revenge for Dorothy accidentally killing her sister. All the actors were wonderful in their roles, playing multiply complex parts, bringing the comedy and music and dance alive. Still, it was bit over the top. All the actors also play the farmhands in the beginning, making you wonder if all this Oz was just a dream. That was the main different between the film and the book. There were other things that the film change, such in the case of Dorothy's age. Shirley Temple was originally wanted for the role, but since they couldn't get her. They got Judy Garland and had to change the age from 7 to 16. They even wanted the blonde curls that Temple is famous for. The wig was top heavy and kept getting mess up, so they took it out, and went with Garland's natural hair. It's creepy in a way, that Dorothy was literally based on Frank Baum's daughter that die in childbirth. Frank Baum was known for his medium spiritual belief, and you see it in the character of Professor Marvel (also Frank Morgan). It's believe that the Wizard character represent fault power leader. The Wizard can be allegory to what Baum thought was fault power leader at the time, such as President McKinley who introduce the Gold Standard, in which many historians believe was represented by the Yellow Brick Road. Oz is indeed: an abbreviation that stands for gold, a hot political topic of the day where people were rallying for fixed gold and silver ratios. Some believe that, the Wizard in the film represent Franklin D. Roosevelt who was known to make illusions to sound strong and look powerful, when trying to present the New Deal to Americans at the time. Emerald City is allegory to Washington D.C that looks like money, but in the end, the film, it was dull white. If the novel, Emerald City look was based off the White City in the 1893's Chicago World Fair. Then 1939's Emerald City was the New Deal, Washington D.C. Then, all of Dorothy's friends could be presented as Coxey's Army, an group of unemployed workers made out of farmers (Scarecrow), laborers (Tin-Man) and free silver supporters (Cowardly Lion). It is said that the Lion represents 19th century politician William Jennings Bryan, who was viewed as someone having a load roar, but no power or bite. Honestly, in the book, the Bimetallism Ruby slipper were really silver. There were a lot of things that wasn't in the film that was in the novel such as the visit to China Country, Queen of the Field Mice, the battle with Giants Spiders & Kalidahs, and the attack of the armless Qualdings. Talking about missing limbs. Civil War vets with prosthetic limbs were inspiration for the Tin-Man. There is a tale that Tin Man was indeed a munchkin named Nick Chopper. The screenwriters wanted Tin Woodman to be a hardened criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. The torture of being encased in the suit had softened him and made him gentle and kind. Wow, that's really dark. Another dark urban legend claimed that, in the film, a Munchkin could be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree and swinging back and forth in the left background, but it was just a bird. There were a lot of weird rewrites, like a spoiled, selfish princess in Oz outlawing music and others. The role of the Wicked Witch of the West was also enlarged for the movie. While, the Witch of the West in the novel was less evil. I think this role fit the film, well. Mad props to Hamilton for continuing the role after getting badly burn during production. There are at least 44 major differences between the book and this movie. Nevertheless, the film was far more faithful to Baum's original book. Still, they almost cut the most famous song from the movie, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' written by E.Y 'Yip' Harburg. Glad, they kept it. The song 'The Jitterbug,' was instead delete. The film footage for the song been lost, but you can find the 'Jitterbug' footage rehearsals on newer DVDs version. I still dig the other songs. 'Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead' 'We're Off to See the Wizard' and 'The Merry Old Land of Oz' are some of my favorites. The movie always have great special effects, and top production value for the time. Still the story is lacking an overall moral and there were lot of not necessary extra scenes that could be cut out. Overall: a great movie that will forever be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I have to agree.",9,8,9,10 May 2014
The Martian," The Martian has the alright stuff. However, this movie didn't leave its mark on me, as it should had.
","I know, a lot of people love this science-fiction film based on Andrew Weir's novel of the same name. However this film about an astronaut, Mark Whatney (Matt Damon) being stuck on Mars after a botch mission was just meh to me. Don't get me wrong, I like the film about a man trying to science, the sh*t out of his dilemma in order to survive, yet I can't overlook the film's large jarring blemishes. First off, in comparison to director Ridley Scott's other stabs at Science Fiction, The Martian is considerably more cheery and upbeat than those other films. This overbearing optimistic tone to the film, kinda hurts the film, a bit, because it rarely allows the movie to very suspenseful or intense. Its way, too one-sided idealism. You rarely see the main character remoted any other, type of an emotional, besides his happy go lucky/problem solving persona. I know, astronauts are supposed to be brave, but gees, this man is not realistic at all. The movie doesn't really explore, the depth of his personality, much. I know, very little of the man, besides that he's a botanist and a joker. You don't know, why he's so willing to survive. Does he have love-ones? Does he have big dreams, back at home? Who knows, the movie doesn't exposition that. Also, you rarely see, examples, of scenes, showing his fears and his flaws. You don't know, if this guy has a breaking point? You don't know, if the lack of food, or the pressures of living on Mars is, messing with his body & mind, because the movie never once, investigates it. The man acts the same, from beginning to end. I find the lack of emotion weight from this movie, somewhat bland. Matt Damon is a fine actor, but if he isn't given, much to work with; he comes across, as playing himself. After all, Matt Damon already had the experience of being the only living human on an uninhabitable planet. His role as Dr. Mann in 2014's Interstellar, had more complexity in his personality than this. I really, didn't see, anything in the film that felt like character development. It was, a very featureless performance. Honestly, I can see, anybody playing this character. It's not much of a stretch. I know, that sounds a bit harsh, but the emotional depth in this film is so thin. It reminds me of the Martian's surface. Where are those scenes of Mark Whatney dealing with extreme loneliness, depression, or better yet, his own morality, because it's needed, badly?! While the supporting cast is semi- strong, featuring the likes of Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, & Chiwetel Ejiofor. I didn't like, all their choices. Many of the supporting actors, are playing roles that isn't that new, to them. A Kate Mara's character always working on the computer. No surprised there. Jessica Chastain as a brilliant mathematician/semi-lead character. Saw it, already in 2014. Sean Bean's character, not dying. Never mind, that one is pretty surprising. However, bringing on so many characters with their own part to play in a very unrealistic rescue mission plan, slows things down, unlike in 1995's Apollo 13, which made a more heroic, realistic viewpoint of NASA and what really could be possible. For a movie that says, let's science the sh*t out of this! This movie's events in the terms of scientific possibility is half correct; with the other half, being close-enough. Without going into much detail, the biggest insult to science, besides the large rockets on Mars's thin surface is probably the whole 'Iron Man/bomb' maneuver. You can research, how impractical, that maneuver is, on your free time. Anyways, I really didn't like, how the movie change the ending from the book. The whole 'where are they now' epilogue was very anticlimax, when you think about it. I don't want to sound, so clichés, but sadly, in my opinion, the book's ending is a lot better than this movie. There's just so much more in the novel that is amazing, that they had to cut out for time reasons. Still, author Andy Weir very much approved of the film version. However, there were some minor nitpicking from him. Like, how he wished the movie opened up with Watney already stranded, and more exposition, toward the sciences. I have to say, the movie's visuals/special effects are breath-taking. The movie is kinda worth watching in 3D. The music is alright for the most part. Not a huge fan of Disco, but its works, within the story of the film. Harry Gregson Williams' score is also pretty impressive, with a tone that bounces between intellectual and scientific while also being hopeful and inspiring. The movie has some funny moments, so it's entertaining in that value. Check out, the Council of Elrond scene with Sean Bean for awesomeness. Also, check out the Five In-Universe style promos for the film: 'Farewell' 'The Right Stuff', 'Our Greatest Adventure', 'Leave Your Mark' & 'Bring Him Home'. Those are a lot of fun. Overall: Director Ridley Scott did a pretty good job, however, it's no Ron Howard's 1995's masterpiece Apollo 13. There seem to be, something missing in this triumph of science, teamwork, and the human spirit; to make me, really like it. However, if you like films like Apollo 13, Interstellar, or Gravity. I have to say, you probably would like this film. So check it out.",8,5,10,12 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Remember! Remember! The 5th of November! While, V for Vendetta; V also stands out for victorious! What a great watch!
","People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. Indeed, V for Vendetta directed by James McTeigue kinda shows that. Based on the comic book by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. This controversy movie tells the story of shadowy freedom fighter, only known by the alias of 'V' (Hugo Weaving) trying to commit terrorist attacks against the fascist government of Britain with the help of an young woman, named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I love the obvious symbolism, in which; this movie is trying to say. Indeed, the idea of self-expression is hard to kill. This is a physical representation of one of V's guiding principles. While, Hugo Weaving is indeed playing as 'V', you never once, see his face, just his voice. This is very important for the film to do, because the purpose of the mask was for it, to be the symbol of opposition and revolt against the ruling class. I think, this idea somewhat works. Even though that was never Moore's intent, to have Guy Fawkes masks, feature in the comics. The mask model after Guy Fawkes, a 17th century man known for attempting to blow up the British Parliament, has become, so much more, outside from the media, in which it came from. It became the symbol of free-will. The mask has become so popular, that it also began to represent the new world of 21th century social activism. Like V in the film, Guy Fawkes, seem like a folk-tale hero to uninformed. However, in reality, both characters 'heroic' status is highly dubious. First off, I wouldn't call, the real-life, Guy Fawkes, a hero. After all, the Gunpowder Plot wasn't really to strike a blow for freedom, they simply wanted to replace the Protestant king with a Catholic one. Further, more, they packed in so much gunpowder that hundreds, possibly thousands of innocent civilians would have been killed. So thank goodness that it failed. Lastly, Guy Fawkes wasn't even a core member of the conspiracy, but a minor mercenary, who didn't do a good job, hiding the gunpower. To most historian, he was more idiotic, than a genius. Anyways, the reason why the British celebrate, Guy Fawkes Night, isn't because how heroic, he was. The true reason, they celebrate it, is because he fail, allowing Protestant to continue to rule the masses, there. By modern standards, both V & Guy Fawkes are depraved terrorists, nothing less. So for the film to present V as more of a good guy and fascism leader, Adam Sulter (John Hurt) as 100% evil. It resulted in a more black and white viewpoint than the more complex side from the comic book, in which you don't know, for sure, who is the good guys. While, Norsefire in the comics, were still a repressive dictatorship. At least, the characters within it, was a little more complex, than the disappointing clear-cut villains, we have here. In many ways, I wish the movie was like, the comic, with its biblical theme. The villain, Adam Susan AKA Sulter, in the comics, represented how society need to stick to its notion of purity. His solipsist belief that he control fate, is similar to that of Adam from Genesis. He genuinely believes that self-choice is dangerous & that V represented the devil. The choice to not obey, but live life as your own. Evey represented Eve, the woman who is tempted to exposed, the unfair judgements and discriminatory racial and sexual stereotypes in which, the power, make be, has on people. It's no wonder, why V target the three symbols of authority: the government, the church and education institution. It makes more sense. I like the complexity that the comic, had. You truly, don't know, if V was the good guy, bad guy or just mad. It's so unlike the movie, that makes you really want to cheer for anarchists, even after the sick psychological and physical torturing, they do, against each other. I love, how V in the comics, has more moral ambiguity. Still, I can understand, why the film wanted to make V, more sympathetic than its comic book version. After all, we have to agree for the cause, in which, he fighting for, or we wouldn't have a movie. Weaving does a likable job, here. His charisma shows through his speech patterns, his philosophy, his dry sense of humor, and his flair for dramatics. All these qualities make V, watchable. One thing, that I thought, the movie does better, than the comic, was not to make him, seem like a superhero with peak-human abilities. The movie stay away from the superman drugs. No mention of LSD or Batch 5 really help the script. That's one thing, I didn't like, from the comic. However, the Matrix-like action scenes and slow-motion domino scenes, were a bit over-the top, pretentious fillers. One thing, that I felt the movie does really well, is show, the duality between V and Evey. V was created by fire, signifying destruction. While, there is Evey who is reborn by water, signifying creation. It shows that Anarchy wear two faces- both creator and destroyer. I have to say, Natalie Portman was outstanding in her role. I didn't mind, the little changes, they did, for the character. Still, V for Vendetta was a bit heavy-handed, when it comes to Evey's transformation from simpleton to cult leader. It's seem like an easy choice for her, here, than in the comics. Overall: In my opinion, the original comic will always be better, because it was influenced by Alan Moore's fears of Thatcherite Britain becoming a repressive dictatorship. While, the film version owes more to critics of the second Bush administration and its clear filmic references to human rights abuses by the US, emphasis on terrorism and Islamophobia. Still, whatever, version, you get into. Both serve, its purpose: being thought-provoking. It's a must-have.",9,4,6,5 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, this movie is a masterpiece! I love it!
","Written and directed by the Coen Brothers, 'O Brother Where Art thou', tells the story of three Depression-era Mississippi prison fugitives Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson) on a journey to reach for the money buried in Everett's backyard, before that area slated to be flooded by a local dam project. Without spoiling the film, too much, I like the fact that entire plot contains various shout outs to the Ancient Greek poem, 'The Odyssey' by author, Homer. While the film doesn't follow, the poem to the letter, it does borrow some notable plot elements from it, such as the blind man, the Cyclops, the sirens, and one of the main characters trying to get home to his wife so she won't marry someone else. The connections to the poem can get pretty clever the more you look for them. A good example is how Everett is surrounded by Peter and Delmar, which in Greek, means 'the rock' and 'the sea', referencing to the Charybdis and Scylla in the original poem. Even the term 'odyssey' in the original Greek can be roughly translated to 'Constant Sorrow' which is aptly, the title of the song that identifies our heroes. Although the fictional story is mostly based off, 'The Odyssey', the canvas of the film come from the fictional book/McGuffin of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film, 'Sullivan's Travels'. Since that socially-conscious novel has never been define with any sense of a story, besides some downtrodden themes taken from author John Steinbeck, 1932's film, 'I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang', William Faulkner's novel, 'As I Lay Dying' and the Holy Bible; it allows, the Coen Brothers to draw their own creative artistic license to make whatever was, 'O Brother Where Art Thou' supposed to mean. One of those prominent themes is the idea of change. In this film, spiritualism is seem as a backward belief, made for laughs, that it's not needed for the more modern and technologically advanced. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, and perhaps Everett's change of heart, toward the end. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, itself, a step-backwards or a step forwards. I like that, about this film. Another thing, I like, is how this film is almost a musical. In many ways, the Coen Brothers really wanted to make a period piece version of the 1980s comedy film, 'Blue Brothers'. This comedy choice in direction allows the movie to have fun with the sophistical meaning of the themes, without going all grim and somber. While, this movie might not have the action that 'Blue Brothers' has, this movie has nearly the same style of music. Both films emphasize the power that gospel and bluegrass music has on its characters, both in positive and negative ways. There is no better example of that, then the 'Down in the River to pray' & 'Go to Sleep Little Baby' (Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby) sequences. Both songs are able to shown, the struggles of being sinful while, also righteous. Great singing from bluegrass singers, Alison Krauss Emmylou Harris, & Gillian Welch. I also love the other songs on the soundtrack, including music artist, Harry McClintock's 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', Norman Blake's 'You are my sunshine' and 'In the Jailhouse now' by Tim Blake Nelson. Yet, the best song, in the film, has to be, Soggy Bottom Boys (Dan Tyminski, Harley Allen, and Pat Enright) 'I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow'. It really tells, how life was like, during one of the most downtrodden period of American history. The notable use of dirges and other macabre songs in this film is wonderful. Hearing dark songs like 'O Death', 'Angel Band', in contrast to bright, cheerful songs 'Keep On the Sunny Side', 'In the Highways' in other parts of the film, make this film, one of the best movie soundtrack ever. This film really shows, how extreme poverty can indeed foster, a rich musical tradition of classic hits. Another great thing about this film is how well-shot, it was. One of the notable features of the film is its use of digital color correction to give the film a sepia-tinted look. If they didn't do this, the Southern summer landscape would have been a bright green, which is too cheerful for the Dust Bowl-type feel they were going for. Director of photography, Roger Deakins really did a wonderful job, capturing that time period. Another thing that I love about this film, is the acting. Everybody in the film, ranging from supporting actors, to the main actors were great in their roles. Mad props goes to George Clooney for making this film, a lot of fun. I have always love, his fun comedy side, better than his dramatic roles. It just sucks, that he can't sing, worth jack. It's a little more tragic, because he's from a line of well-known singers, like famed cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney. Anyways, due of his lack of skills in the music department, he had to be dubbed by Dan Tyminski, during any part, where singing was involved. The other faults of the film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Did we really need George 'Baby-Face' Nelson (Michael Badalucco) to cameo in the film? Wasn't he dead in 1939? That's another problem with the film. It's not historical correct, at all. The real Governor Pappy O' Daniels was a Texan, and the film's theme song, 'You are my Sunshine,' was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis. However, since it's a fiction fantasy movie. I'm willing to give this, some leeway. Despite some faults, this movie is a bodafine classic. A must watch for any Coen Brothers fan. Overall: Go see it. I do recommended.",8,0,0,29 May 2016
Furious 7," Furious 7 was alright. Sit back and enjoy the ride, let reality leave you for a couple hours.
","Furious 7 rides into theaters, yet again. Taking place, after the events of 2003's Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift & 2013's Fast & Furious 6. The story brings all the characters from the previous films, back together for one more adventure. In this movie, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, are faced with a sinister foe, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), whom seeks revenge for his comatose brother. Directed by James Wan, the movie combine, most of the plot threads of the previous films into one. It moves as if it's recapping the previous films. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. The movie starts out, with car racing like the first movie, 2001's Fast & Furious. It then goes into a heist sub-plot like 2011's Fast Five, and then the movie go into the spy genre, like Fast & Furious 6. In many ways, it's nearly a complete movie. Once again, the movie brings over the top action. Without spoiling too much, I found a few things about the film action, a bit jarring. I really didn't buy into most of the actions scene, because how unrealistic, it was. There were a lot of BS scenes where the hero walk away, nearly unscratched, when they should be, dead or in serious condition. If you're a fan of more realistic action, this movie might not be for you. If you like over the top. It's full of it. I think the highlight of the film, has to be the Abu Dhabi heist sequences. It was so testosterone full! I love the fight scenes between Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) & Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham makes a great villain. It's too bad, that the movie didn't focus on him, as much, as it should had. I really thought, the movie would had work better, if he was the main villain, rather than the large number of sub-villains, they had for the crew, to fight against. Who knew, that Djimon Hounsou's character, Jakande, would be just as huge as a threat as Deckard Shaw? I didn't see, that coming from the trailers. I really didn't see Kara (Ronda Rousey) being a minor character. I thought, she was working for Shaw. Instead, she was working for some prince. Still, the fight between Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) & Kara (Ronda Rousey) was pretty awesome. Like, I said before, honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's clear, that these actors only got this franchise to keep their careers, going. The actors are indeed, 'One trick Ponies'. Don't get me wrong, they're alright in the film, but I'm really getting annoyed by the lead actor, Vin Diesel's mumbling and lazy not buff, look. Unfortunately, one of the better actors, Paul Walker, was killed in a car accident, during filming, which lead to Vin Diesel having a bigger role in the film. Director James Wan did the best, he can, to replace Paul Walker, by giving Walker's dialogue to other characters, or having Paul Walker's brothers as stand ins. For the most part, it kinda works, but there were a few shadowy back-head or far away shots that clearly made, because Paul Walker wasn't there, anymore. Once again, actors Tyrese Gibson & Ludicrous are the comic reliefs. Tyrese Gibson's Roman still gives, some good one-liners and zingers, but he's a little more annoying now, since the movie made him, look more like a coward. Ludicrous's Tej is a little more unbelievable. It's weird that he's the tech guy, now. It's also strange, that he knows karate, now too. The cameos in the film was alright for the most part. I wish, Lucas Black's Sean Boswell, had a bigger part. I wouldn't call this movie, a stand-alone film. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. The movie is a bit long. They added a lot of tiresome long scenes, like skydiving in cars to rescue an important kidnapped hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) for a mysterious secret agent (Kurt Russell). The whole God's eye subplot wasn't really needed. I know, it is paper thin, but they would had stretch out the revenge plot. I came to see this movie just for that. Due to that add, this film became the longest movie in the series so far. Another fault of the film, is how they treat women. They parade them as sex objects. Michelle Rodriguez and Nathalie Emmanuel are strong, smart female role models, even though the movie does objectify them physically. There are tons of bikini shots and car porn that can make any young man, horny as hell. Overall: I really don't understand why films like this, get a higher score, than Michael Bay films. It's nearly has the same stupid problems. Too many explosion, clumsy writing and degrading stereotypes and women. I guess, Fast & Furious just have more loyal fans. Still, the best thing about this film, is how they handled the tragic death of lead Paul Walker with admirable grace, ultimately creating an emotionally impactful farewell. Despite, the natured absurdity of this world, it still worth seeing, only for that, alone.",7,3,17,10 April 2015
The Godfather," The Godfather make me an offer that I cannot refuse. This movie is a masterpiece.
","It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.",10,11,15,8 September 2015
