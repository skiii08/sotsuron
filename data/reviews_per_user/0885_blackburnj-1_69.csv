The King's Speech," What a film should be
","[5 Stars] If the basic aim of any film review is to tell the reader whether or not to go and spend their money on a film, let me fulfil that now: go and see this film, because it is almost the very definition of your money's worth. Director Tom Hooper has delivered a witty, engrossing, moving and thrilling film, driven by an excellent script from David Seidler and an exemplary cast, led by two terrific performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush.The story of George VI, one of Britain's finest modern monarchs, and his struggle with his stammer has usually been a footnote in the history of the 20th century, swept aside by the tempest and tumult of the Second World War and the defeat of the Nazis. However, this film finds the deeply human story of the man who had been bullied by many crucial figures in his childhood and had developed a stammer, and found himself in the unwanted position of voice of a nation at the time of its greatest trial.Firth is quite magnificent. Whilst Rush's Lionel Logue (the controversial speech therapist) has many of the best lines and is utterly charming, it is the power of Firth's subtle performance which makes the film so gripping. Far beyond the perfect representation of a stammerer that he delivers, one is with Firth's 'Bertie' all the way, delighting in his charming story-telling with his children, and weeping with him as he discloses the surprising harshness of his childhood.All of this builds and swells, never once dropping pace or losing the audience's interest. The final speech is utterly thrilling and spine-tingling, the perfect climax of a film which has made you laugh, cry and told a quite wonderful and inspiring story.",9,2,4,20 January 2011
Black Swan," Mad, bad and extraordinary to watch
","Black Swan is beautiful, engrossing, crazy, over-the-top, on-the-money, unrelenting, unforgiving, incredible, insidious, ridiculous, brilliant, intoxicating, exhilarating, mad, bad, dangerous and stunning. Not to mention disturbing. And bonkers. It is a film which inspires many adjectives. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it is undeniably an incredible experience.It is hard to know where to begin, because the film is so much. It is horror, ballet, psychological thriller, comedy, coming-of-age tale and family drama. Darren Aronofsky hasn't held anything back. This could have been a fairly straightforward character piece, probably starring a second-rate actress which would have garnered her a Best Actress nomination and been middle of the road and solid. But, Aronofsky has taken that and turned it up to eleven.He is helped by the fact that Natalie Portman is much more than a second rate Actress. Here, she truly excels as Nina. Her character is charged with playing two separate roles, and, in a way, so is she, but Portman must bring the White and Black Nina's into one character in the end, recognisable in one moment.This is not a story about a fall into darkness. This is a story about a duality. Nina's sweetness and innocence is unhealthy, particularly in her over-sheltered relationship with her mother, played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She is immature more than anything else and has to grow. Of course, this is not a coming-of-age tale through and through. It is about the insanity and pressure of young adulthood, the drive of ambition, the craving of perfection. Portman puts all of this across brilliantly, with great support from Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassell, and a very fine cameo-esque performance from Winona Ryder, who is strikingly convincing as a disturbed woman whose career hasn't gone to plan. I wonder why she got cast for that role though.All of whom remain under the guise of Aronofsky. In this film though he starts it quietly with a girl dreaming and waking up in a quiet, beautiful, princess' bedroom, surrounded by pinks and whites, Aronofsky quickly begins the crescendo of noise, tension and madness which lasts and grows through the whole film. There is no respite. A lot has been made of the lesbian scene between Portman and Kunis. Frankly, at first it's a relief – seemingly a moment of quiet – but Aronofsky is not in the mood for titillation. He is in the mood to drive his audience mad.The whole thing continues to build, knowingly over-the-top and funny with it. Nina's paranoia and hallucinations likewise grow, and, by the end, I had not got the foggiest of what was real and what was not. The ending was baffling, to the extent that it made 'Inception' look simple. But, I came out and was thrilled and filled with energy. Those who are unsure should go, because even if you don't like it, it's an experience which is well worth having. Besides, the level of craft and acting here is exceptional, and there is entertainment and great fun to be had as well.Four Stars out of Five",9,4,8,25 January 2011
Changeling," Another Masterpiece from Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood has established himself as master of modern cinema. His films are always interesting and effective and have the benefit of his years of experience, including his work with some of the world's finest directors. Eastwood rarely falls into the bombast. He is a master of control and can do emotionally heavy stories without resorting to worthy sentiment.His masterpiece, 'Million Dollar Baby', showed all of Eastwood's subtle expertise and quiet brilliance. It set the bar high for his next films, and 'Flags of our Fathers' and 'Letters From Iwo Jima' understandably struggled to live up to expectations. With 'Changeling' Eastwood moves away from the more epic scope of the Iwo Jima films and returns to the arena of the person in crisis. It is the astonishing true story of Christine Collins, whose son was kidnapped in 1928. The subsequent investigation, carried out by an LAPD desperate for results and good news, returned a boy who was not her child, and her protests led to her incarceration in a mental asylum before she was eventually, and tragically, proved to be right.Eastwood gambles somewhat in his central casting choice. Angelina Jolie is a superb actress, but her problem is that she is Angelina Jolie. Her fame can prove to be a barrier to her performances. In other words, it's really hard to forget that it's Angelina Jolie and believe in the character. Here however, she triumphs. It is a magnificent performance and the driving force behind the film. Not only do you believe in Christine Collins but you utterly empathise with her. Jolie deserves an awful lot of recognition for this piece of work.Jolie's tour-de-force is excellently supported by the rest of the cast. John Malkovich deals with a part which is actually fairly under-developed well and manages to make him an effective character. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as the corrupt policeman, Captain Jones. However, the second-half of the film moves away from Collins a little and considers the horrendous crime which is associated with her case. At the heart of this are three terrific performances. Michael Kelly is splendid as the film's only good cop, Detective Ybarra (and even he has his dark side). Eddie Alderson is excellent in a brief but impressive appearance as Sanford Clark, a crucial character in the tale. However, one of the most memorable and haunting performances comes from Jason Butler Harner, who brings a chilling depth to Gordon Northcott.That second-half of the film contains some of the film's real strong points. There is a staggering scene between Alderson and Kelly where the former's Sanford Clark tells the latter's detective about the horrible crimes he has witnessed and been coerced into. During this highly effective scene, Eastwood cuts from horrendous flashbacks to a simple shot of the detective's cigarillo, still in his hand, now more ash than tobacco. It is a brief example of Eastwood's subtle brilliance as a director.The film, although it is lengthy, is never dull and merits every scene. Having said this, Eastwood missteps slightly toward the end when there is a scene in a prison where the determined but quiet Collins suddenly becomes uncharacteristically violent. This scene is immediately followed by a hanging scene which shows a bit too much of the event and could be called gratuitous. The slice of closure which is achieved in that scene is necessary; the manner in which the scene is carried out is not.However, this is a small complaint in light of the rest of the film. The delicate score (composed by that man Eastwood again) and the subtle photography in themselves make up for those small errors. Added to that, Eastwood has crafted a superb drama which tells a gripping and shocking story well, and has a lot to say about the state, ordinary people and freedom. But at the core, this film is a heartbreaking and moving tale about a mother separated from her son and the selfish and horrible forces which acted against her and those good men and women who fought with her. It's a triumph for Jolie and another masterpiece from Eastwood.5 Stars out of 5",10,5,8,12 December 2008
Frost_Nixon," An electric adaptation of a brilliant play
","Richard Nixon is a compelling figure. However, reduced to a two-dimensional demon by popular culture and perhaps best known to a new generation as a character from 'Futurama', Nixon 'The man' has been somewhat lost. One character in 'Frost/Nixon' asks 'How can you possibly feel sympathy for Richard Nixon?' In this film, set against the backdrop of his post-Watergate disgrace and his first post-Presidential interview, with British chat show host and journalist David Frost, Nixon is quietly but completely made into a sympathetic figure.This is only half of the tale however. This film, adapted from Peter Morgan's electric stage play, is as much about the smaller figure of Frost, now a grandfather of modern British television and only recently retired from political interviewing. The Frost shown here (Morgan taking advantage of the interviewer's relative anonymity and using a bit of artistic licence) is struggling to shake off his chat show host background and risks everything for the interview of the century. No-one wants him and he seems doomed to fail.It is a story of two men of ambition in a boxing duel: Nixon desperate to get back to the East coast and into public life once more and Frost equally determined to be successful and prove everyone wrong. As the contest slowly unfolds, the film becomes more gripping, interesting and electric to experience. At the heart of this success are the brilliant writing, subtle direction and outstanding acting.Morgan's script is a masterpiece. The play came out in the same year as 'The Queen', for which he received an Oscar nomination, but this was the superior piece and he transfers it to the screenplay format with panache. It is a brilliant portrait of two men locked in a quiet battle where their opponent is not necessarily an enemy, but only one of them can win, at the ultimate cost of the other. It cannot be as fluid a piece of storytelling as it is on stage and the attempt to frame the story with a documentary style series of interviews jars a little, but this is more than made up for by the quality of what is contained within and the careful direction of Ron Howard.Howard has incredible respect for the play but realises that this is cinema and makes it fit the medium. The power of television, and the close up, becomes more apparent here as every flinch and twitch is caught on screen. Still, although this is a talky film (and a bit of a slow starter), there is a lot of motion. The camera flows through the world and circles around the characters capturing the film beautifully and giving it a necessary dynamism. Not that this is required to keep the audience's attention, as they are quickly sucked in by the quality of the performances.Whilst the supporting cast includes wonderful little turns by the underestimated Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones and Oliver Platt, and another impressive performance by the increasingly good Sam Rockwell, they are thoroughly outshone by the superb leads. It is unfair on Michael Sheen that his co-star alone is attracting nominations like moths to a flame as he is brilliant. Having got the mannerisms of Frost down, he constructs a performance of subtlety, control and power. He is matched by Langella who's Nixon is a triumph. He is painted as the liar and fool he deserves to be, but also as a determined man, frustrated by his flaws. Langella is great at realising this. The voice is memorable and rings in the ears long after the film has ended, whilst the physicality of his 'tricky Dicky' is carefully managed for maximum effect: sometimes big and imposing, sometimes smaller and more world-weary.They reach their high point in an electric last forty-five minutes, including the (rightly) praised fictional phone call, where it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. The power of television and the close-up (and good cinema) is proved, the dust settles and the aftermath is left and, when the red mist clears, even the most hard-bitten, liberal hippie might find a surprise. You might feel a great deal of sympathy for Richard Nixon.4 Stars out of 5",9,2,5,25 January 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Solid piece of work which lets itself down a bit
","The recent revival of the western has been notable, but many of them have been neo-westerns or revisionists. Films such as 'No Country for Old Men' and 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' have begun to drastically re-define the genre for the modern day, but '3:10 to Yuma' has not attempted to do so.An adaptation of an Elmore Leonard short story, which was made into a film in the fifties, '3:10 to Yuma' concerns a penniless and injured rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), struggling to survive in the drought-ridden Arizona of the late 1800s. In an attempt to raise some much needed money for his family, he agrees to escort the prolific criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the eponymous train which will take him to his trial and execution. Evans' motives, however, may not be as simple as they seem, as he is haunted by secrets and lies from his past and is quite desperate to gain the respect of his oldest son. As they travel through the wilderness, the honourable Evans and the unscrupulous Wade begin to connect as the small group struggle toward the train, all the while being chased by Wade's gang, led by the vicious Charlie Prince (Ben Foster).This film is not a special western. It is purely a character piece, with no great ideas on the table. However, it is a gripping piece and merits its near two-hour running time completely. It opens with a visually impressive scene and an exciting stagecoach robbery which get the audience's attention, and this high-tempo pace and tone is maintained throughout the film.It is also well acted, and merited its SAG nomination for Best Ensemble. Bale and Crowe are excellent. Bale has the more interesting part and deals with it well, facing up to issues of inadequacy and dissatisfaction that are central to his character with his trademark intensity and complexity. Crowe pulls his part off with his usual charm and charisma but, even in the early scenes, it is clear that the standout turn is from Ben Foster as the sadistic and committed Charlie Prince. But the strong cast, despite their brilliant work, cannot cover up the film's major weaknesses.Director James Mangold does a perfectly solid job here, but he doesn't display any of the flair that he showed in 'Walk the Line'. The film is put together well enough. It is pretty well shot by Phedon Papamichael and the film is supported by an excellent score from Marco Beltrami, but it doesn't strike you as particularly special in any way.The real weakness, however, is the script. It starts well and develops nicely, but for all of its good dialogue and moments of interest, the climax is baffling. One piece of character development is just incomprehensible and makes no sense, perhaps suggesting that the writers felt that they had fleshed out their central characters and their relationship with each other a bit more than they actually had. It is a shame, because this makes the ending a thundering disappointment and after two hours of solid and entertaining film-making you can't help but feel a little let down.Despite the late missteps, this was never going to be an exceptional film. It is however a solid and entertaining film, which makes decent if not necessarily highly recommended viewing.3 Stars out of 5",7,0,1,1 August 2008
United 93," Staggering and sensitive piece of work
","Paul Greengrass's bold dramatisation of the horrific events of September 11th 2001 was one of the biggest risks taken in cinema in the first few years of 21st century. The importance of the event was undeniable, but the emotions which it had naturally aroused in those personally involved in the story and the vast majority of the world's public made this subject incredibly delicate. However, with this film, Greengrass met the many challenges that came with it and established himself as one of the most talented and important filmmakers of the day.The power of this film comes almost entirely from the genius of Greengrass and his script, his style and his execution of a brilliant and sensitive piece of film-making. The film is not a simple docudrama (it is so much more than that). It is a true to the events but takes the licence necessary to turn it in to a story with intelligent perception of what happened but an emotional heart which makes this very difficult subject as gripping and moving as it deserves and needs to be. Bravely, however, this film takes on the subject of the hijackers without reducing them to inhuman psychopaths but portrays them as misguided human beings. Before one of them gets on the doomed flight to carry out their terrible plan, he gets on the phone and simply says 'I love you' – a touch of genuine class from Greengrass.For Greengrass's sensitive handling of the story he is to be praised (he only proceeded with the film once he had gained the consent of all the families of United 93, who co-operated with his research), but his realisation of the story on screen is the real triumph. His (now much-imitated) hand-held style, which is exhilarating in the 'Bourne' films, is brilliant here at bringing across the terror and chaos in the air – a style he contrasts with the scenes on the ground were the chaos is viewed through a far more stable and controlled eye. The sheer lack of order and control that occurred on the ground that day with the air-traffic controllers and the federal government is brought home brilliantly, with some of the crucial real life figures re-enacting what happened that day.All of this would still have been rather pointless had it not been for the power of the story being told. The courage of the passengers is incredibly powerful and a testament to the human spirit which seemed so absent that day. The final part of the film in which the fight back happens is a stupendous bit of cinema. Moving and haunting it is an absolutely perfect ending to an absolutely brilliant bit of film which left me (and still leaves me) speechless, with chills running up and down my spine.",10,3,6,8 July 2009
Finding Neverland," Superb Acting and Brilliantly Made
","Finding Neverland is one of the best films I have seen all year. Depp and Winslet are superb and their supporting cast is very strong in particular Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and Freddie Highmore. Forster's direction is tight and he maintains a story which had the potential to drag. Depp delivers a performance that is truly believable and he interacts with his co-stars well, in particular, Freddie Highmore who delivers a performance that outshines Depp's. It is a tour de force of acting talent. Clearly Highmore has a great career ahead of him. 9/10 for a superb piece of film-making, made diligently but, unfortunately, up against such strong contention, it had to make do with a disappointing award haul.",9,154,196,8 December 2004
In Bruges," Fresh, funny and thoughtful - a great time at the movies
","Black comedy is a difficult thing to do. Very often a balance between hilarity and depth cannot be struck to the point that the amount of comedy is negligible. 'In Bruges', a story of murder, guilt, suicide and violent gun hands, faces this problem more than most. It is, therefore, a delight that this film is one of the funniest for years as well as being wonderfully dark, twisted and deep.The first thing to say is that this won't be for everyone. It is uncompromisingly violent, it, quite literally, doesn't pull any punches and it is filled to the brim with foul language. But, if you're not put off by any of this sort of thing, then this is highly recommended.It is vaguely reminiscent of 'Withnail and I'. It has three main characters who are all leading a fairly insane existence and who all find themselves in a place that they are alien to. It is also one of the most fantastically sweary films since 'Withnail' but this is no rip-off. This is one of the most fearlessly fresh films for some years and this is largely thanks to Martin McDonagh.The script is magnificent. It may not provide much pay-off for its philosophising and it does at the end descend into a bloody shootout that is slightly over-cooked, but it is interesting in what it explores and extremely entertaining. It is the bizarre and brilliant humour that is the cornerstone of McDonagh's work. This is a comedy that pulls together witty, surrealist, observational, gross out and subtle, as well as distinctly unsubtle, visual comic techniques, with a heavy dose of character based gags to boot. The result is an onslaught of humour that is irresistible. McDonagh also brings an attractive and striking look to the film with an impressive visual style that promises much for his future work not just as a writer but also as a director.He is also blessed with a fine cast. Brendan Gleeson's quiet, restrained and likable performance is the standout, but a wonderful surprise is that the oft-ridiculed Colin Farrell almost steals the show with a brilliantly subtle and vulnerable turn. The pair work superbly whenever they're on screen together and they are handed a great deal of support. Poésy, as the love interest, is very good, as is Jordan Prentice playing the sardonic but flawed 'dwarf' (to use the film's terminology). Ralph Fiennes obviously enjoys himself hugely here, given free-reign in a part that demands over-acting of the very highest calibre to display the insanity and menace of the character.The film ends in a marvellous moment of ambiguity having touched on many themes. Prejudice, life and death, guilt, forgiveness, justice, deontological ethics and the sanctity of life, are all there and McDonagh leaves it up to the audience to think about them. It all adds up to a great time at the cinema. Funny, thoughtful, entertaining, this blackest of black comedies is the genre nearing its very best.",9,1,4,28 April 2008
I'm Not There," Some kind of genius
","Todd Haynes' bizarre take on the 'music and lives' of Bob Dylan is an astonishing piece of work. Its visual style is inventive and enjoyable. The performances are universally brilliant. The direction is outstanding. The film is a sensual experience that will leave those who go into it with the right mind bemused, intrigued and satisfied.This is a film that you have to want to see. Fans of Dylan should be entertained well and the more you know the more you shall enjoy. Haynes' script (written with Oren Moverman) makes the film seemingly difficult to follow and any background knowledge is helpful. However, it is a film that just happens: there is no need to follow it. As long as you have interest you'll never be bored.The success of the film is based around a number of rock solid elements. First off, Haynes' frenetic editing gives the film an energy and sense of invention that should keep most enthralled.If the film sags at any moment, all you have to do is look at the performances. Led by an astonishing turn from Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, the 'Dylans' are superb. Bale and Ledger deliver performances that fit their impressive standard, whilst Richard Gere is an enjoyable presence. However, the two that impress most, other than Blanchett, are Ben Whishaw, who has little to do but delivers each of his lines perfectly, and Marcus Carl Franklin who is charming and completely gripping. Leading the supporting cast proper, we have Bruce Greenwood who is simply brilliant as Keenan Jones and Pat Garret.If this isn't good enough for you, bask in Haynes' visual style. Each section has its own distinctive look and Haynes manages to fit in numerous striking images that are stunning. If you're still not satisfied, then there is bound to be a decent Dylan song around the corner.The film is far from perfect. It isn't boring, but it is a bit too long and on occasions Haynes' stream of consciousness loses its audience.Ultimately, the film provides little insight into Dylan and no coherent account of his life, but that isn't its intention. The final shot provides the simple message about a man and his music. This icon is shown in a wonderful way and remains enigmatic, but this is a film as much about the people who effected and were affected by Dylan. In short, this film is some kind of genius and has so much going for it that you are bound to get something out of it.",9,2,4,23 December 2007
The Other Boleyn Girl," Satisfying and entertaining, but it promised so much more
","The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' (awful) or the television series, 'The Tudors' (soft-pornographic trash), then it is 'The Other Boleyn Girl', the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film 'Longford' and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) 'The Queen' and 'The Last King of Scotland', his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.That's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it, the film is, for an hour and a quarter, perfectly pleasant, with intrigue, scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine, but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in 'Lost in Translation' and 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring'. The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII, but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun, whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.It is a perfectly bearable watch, but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through, the film's focus continually shifts, failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might, or should, be. He is more driven then driving, whilst his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), is given very little time on screen, thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with half-an-hour to go, with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene, which seems to be the start of the culmination, with so many points of interest going on in it, proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes, whilst quite stylish, are drawn out and slow, and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.It's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year (that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer). It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon, but it won't live long in the memory.",7,72,109,8 March 2008
Spider-Man 2," An entertaining blockbuster with brains
","Sam Raimi's 2002 adaptation of the 'Spider-Man' comic books was a phenomenal success and whether or not to green-light a sequel was a 'no-brainer' for the studio. However, sequels always bring higher expectations and often, as the sequel to this film shows, disappointment. With 'Spider-Man 2', Raimi pulls off that rarest of cinematic successes. It is a sequel that is better than the original.The strength of the 'Spider-Man' films lies in the central character. How Peter Parker deals with this stroke of fate and the stress on him being an ordinary man, and a young one at that, in an extraordinary position of responsibility creates a great deal of sympathy and depth. It is a role that Maguire is ideally suited for and his performance makes this more than just a simple blockbuster. It is a light-hearted drama. It has been described as 'subversive' by some and that is an apt description. It sits right at the top of the great summer blockbusters of this decade, a list that includes 'Batman Begins' and the 'Bourne' series.But, it certainly doesn't shirk on its duty to entertain. Sam Raimi is a born entertainer and he doesn't pull any punches here, quite literally. The action comes thick and fast. All of the set-pieces are eye-popping and inventive. The first hour, in fact, is spectacular. There is stunning action, breathtaking visuals, interesting character development and lots of brilliant humour.It opens as a pretty light-hearted affair and this is not really an example of a sequel going 'darker'. The birth of this film's villain, as it was in the prequel, is the result of a tragic accident and there is no suggestion that he is truly evil. The second hour is grittier, but not darker. It is a completely satisfying film that never bores, but Raimi can't quite hold himself back at points. The final scene should be awfully melodramatic, because it is, but it is forgiven on the basis of the rest of the film.The other failing is that the villain, Doctor Octopus, brilliantly played by Alfred Molina, doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The main focus of the film is Parker's struggle with himself and his desires, but it comes across as pretty much the only focus. There is an interesting 'Jekyll and Hyde' duality in the 'Doc Ock' character, but this isn't really explored. There aren't enough internal struggles to make the character believable at points.Though, this should not take away from the many positives of the film. Mention must be made of J.K. Simmons, who is brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson. If this performance were in an offbeat comedy, he would have got an Oscar nomination. And don't forget Bruce Campbell's cameo as the 'Snooty Usher'.All in all, that makes for a completely entertaining two hours. In every way, this film justifies a sequel. In fact, it's a 'no-brainer'. What a shame that the sequel turned out to be exactly that.",8,5,6,17 February 2008
127 Hours," Gruelling and gripping
","[4 Stars] This is a film made with Boyle's characteristic energy and intensity. The brutal story of Aaron Ralston's struggle to survive when he got trapped in the middle of nowhere, with only a rock on his arm preventing his escape, is brought vividly to life, primarily through an inventive script which manages to make one man in a hole for five days and a bit utterly engrossing, as well as a spectacular central performance from James Franco who is utterly believable in every second of arrogance, strife and madness.The scene where Ralston finally forces his way free through very drastic means is suitably gruelling and difficult to watch, but it is not gratuitous.It is curious to know what you're getting out of this film. Boyle has described it as 'a feel-good film'. Though it has life-affirming and uplifting elements, it is too gruelling to be described as that. Ultimately, it is a testament to very great value of personal relationships, that are so easy to take for granted.Not one of Boyle's very finest, but another excellent film which is well worth the money.",8,0,1,15 January 2011
Troy," Was the sacking of Gabriel Yared one of the worst decisions in movie history?
","Troy was a film which I thought was good for the most part but it lacked certain aspects. Foremost among these was the music. I don't wish to criticise James Horner for his efforts as he had one of the shortest time spans in history to do a film score, but Wolfgang Petersen's decision to scrap Gabriel Yared's score which, judging from the trailers, had potential was possibly one of the worst decision's in his career. As Empire magazine puts it 'Portentous Synths (check), ethnic wailing (check), morose love theme (check) - until the end credits ballad really does the damage' (sic). It goes onto call Yared's score richer, more resonant and original. Subsequently the rest of the film's quality made by Petersen's film-making genius is almost lost. Strong acting from O'Toole, Bana and Bean manages to shine through the resulting deluge",5,1,3,7 January 2005
Juno," Hilarious, sharp and heartwarming
","'Juno' is the next in an increasingly long line of films about unwanted pregnancy. However, this film has had more of an impact than 'Waitress' and 'Knocked Up' and it is curious as to why this should be. Whilst it confronts the issues involved with the subject, it hardly says anything truly affirmative about them. There is however a simple reason for why this film has been more successful than those that have gone before. It is heartwarming, hilarious and, in a phrase, just great.This is a film based around a number of strong foundations, the first of which is Diablo Cody's script. She creates interesting and detailed characters that are a joy to watch and the dialogue that flies between them is a joy to listen to. The plot is perfectly structured and it is refreshing that the plot doesn't play out as necessarily expected. There is a fantastic sense of reality in this film.Another strong presence in the film is the cast, lead by the extraordinary Ellen Page. For someone so young to perform moments that are, as her character says, 'way beyond her maturity level' so effectively is astonishing. She is moving, charismatic and charming: the perfect companion to waltz through the movie with. She is ably supported by Michael Cera who is disarmingly effective as the child's father. However, praise must be handed to Jennifer Garner for her subtle and surprising performance as the potential adoptive mother. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are also very entertaining as Juno's embattled parents.The cast are under the direction of the more than capable Jason Reitman who does a really impressive job. His previous effort, 'Thank You For Smoking', was a flawed comedy, but it showed potential and this film may prove that he is a director rather than a screenwriter. His direction is subtle and inventive and the film is so well crafted that you cannot doubt more than solid direction.You can't help but be moved and uplifted by this comedy. There is depth in the film that I found quite surprising and wonderfully emotive. This is not a political piece; it is a personal one where the characters are the most important part of the movie. It is sharp, intelligent and, above all, enjoyable. With all of the humour, the emotion and the brilliance, you can't help but leave the film without a smile on your face.",9,2,6,17 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It's too long, too complicated ... too bad.
","The third film in this mega-franchise has been called many things (my favourite being 'At Wit's End'). As the third film finishes (assuming, and it is a big assumption, that this is the end in a trilogy) the trio of films feels very much like 'The Matrix Trilogy': it started with promise but cashed-in in a disappointing manner that ruins the fine start.Now, this is not as bad as has been made out. The plot (or rather plots) is a complete mess, but there is still fun to be had. Johnny Depp is still thoroughly entertaining, as is Geoffrey Rush. Gore Verbinski also directs the film, at times, with a great deal of ambition and a bit of visual style. It is a truly cinematic film with many sequences that push boundaries and that are clearly made for the big screen. If you can follow the basic plot there is enough to get you by.However, the film is far too long and, though many actors try hard, you are bored and ultimately don't care what the outcome of the climax is. Also, individual characters get lost in the mêlée of this film (there isn't even enough of Johnny Depp) and so many people cross each other that you haven't really got a clue what anybody is doing. Orlando Bloom is complete tripe and I remain bemused at how he is a major film star, whilst Keira Knightley, that's Oscar nominated Keira Knightley, isn't much better, even though she's shown that she can be good. Furthermore, it's a geeky complaint but, Hans Zimmer's music is crap. It's so crap, you notice it, which is a real measure of how bad it is.Anyway, the film as a whole is pretty rubbish, but there are worse films out there and it isn't all dreadful. It is also questionable as to whether this film can really be seen as family entertainment. There is a lot of death; it's too complicated and too dark, though teenagers will love it. There are things to enjoy but I would, on the whole, advise against.",5,1,2,17 January 2008
Spider-Man 3," Despite being entertaining, this is a disappointment
","Sam Raimi's third Spider-Man film had awesome potential. After two strong films, the trailer for 'Spider-Man 3' looked spectacular with the distinct possibility that the interesting character work which had been started in the opening films would be taken to a whole new level. Unfortunately, whilst the third film in the trilogy is entertaining and a great spectacle, it is a disappointment as the film is lost without a proper plot and caught in a mêlée of villains and plot lines.The film starts off well. We begin with Parker, as opposed to Spidey, dealing with his everyday life and then being confronted by the New Goblin, his friend Harry Osborn. There is no problem with this. We have a plot and we know where we're going. We're heading towards a satisfying end to the trilogy's storyline. But then, that plot line is put into limbo for an hour, as is the action and we go off establishing the rest of the villains and their backstories. Every plot line and every villain is introduced and then abandoned for a long period of time. The plot is easy to follow, but it is shallow.However, the beacon of light was the inner struggle that Spidey must face. Alas, the really dark moments have little or no effect on the character and he only realises that he is turning into a thoroughly evil dude when he hits someone in a rash of anger, an event where no-one gets hurt. So, what was going to be the big climax of the central theme of the series (duality and the conflict between good and evil) turns out to be a real disappointment and without any great depth.Having said that, whilst this film lacks the brains that would have made it fantastic and any kind of proper plot it does have spectacle and entertainment in abundance. Whilst the visual effects are a bit lacking at times, all of the set pieces are done well. However, the final climax is almost ruined by the bizarre use of a news broadcast which is condescending and, frankly, unintentionally comical. Which emphasises another failing here. This isn't anywhere near as funny as the previous films or indeed as it should be.But there are the great cameos from J.K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell which bring some humour, but there are also very solid performances. Maguire has a lot of fun here. He becomes Travolta-esquire in a sequence that has Parker strut down the street. Whilst the idea of this is jarring, the performance is a joy to watch. James Franco has improved and Kirsten Dunst is solid.But there is nothing too much to ride home about here. It isn't as clever as it needs to be. It's bloated with too many characters and plots. It may well be satisfying, but it fails to live up to the high hopes. All in all, this can only be described as a disappointing end to what was shaping up to be a really interesting, subversive and magnificent super-hero trilogy. There will be a 'Spider-Man 4' but, frankly, this series has said all that it has to say. It must stop, now.",6,0,1,17 February 2008
Zodiac," The fruits of obsession
","Do you want to see a film about a serial killer with no solid conclusion? David Fincher does, so he made it. That is a little unfair, but essentially that is the genesis of this film.David Fincher was a young boy in San Francisco when the Zodiac killer started to strike. He can distinctly recall the little articles of fear that floated throughout the city and when he wasn't allowed to go on the school bus because his mother was too afraid for his safety. It is something that Fincher has, to an extent, obsessed about. How apt then that this film should be such a detailed and effective study of obsession.Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith is an awkward character, a good man but unusual. However, when his paper, the San Francisco Chronicle, receives teasing ciphers from the Zodiac killer, he, an outsider in the paper's hierarchy, becomes more and more interested and more and more obsessed. He descends from a man who likes solving crossword puzzles to a man utterly determined to solve one of the most complex and notorious unsolved crimes in US history. It is utterly compelling to watch.Fincher evokes the period of the late sixties and early seventies with ease. The film is perfectly designed and at many points ingeniously shot. He creates tension brilliantly. The fear that soaks into the city and the characters is almost tangible and the sheer horror of the few murders that are shown serves to enhance this. Some sequences are genuinely terrifying, and yet nothing happens in them. Examples like this show Fincher to be a master.He is supported in his efforts by an intelligent script delivered by a pitch perfect cast. James Vanderbilt's screenplay is responsible. It ends with a bit of speculation but all of the events that are crucial to the case happened and you get the sense that this is a fair representation. He provides detailed characters that the talented performers devour with ease. Mark Ruffalo delivers a truly fine performance. Robert Downey Jnr. does one of his usual mumbling but somehow gripping supporting roles (gripping mainly because you're straining to her what he's saying). However, Jake Gyllenhaal is, once again, the standout. He really has developed into one of the world's finest actors and has a rich and varied career ahead of him.This is one of the finest thrillers of 2007, a really interesting, entertaining and gripping work. It outshines the slightly surreal nature of 'Fight Club' and is a masterclass in film-making from one of contemporary cinema's often unappreciated greats. But this is more than just a simple thriller. It is an exploration of one of humanity's most perplexing traits: obsession. And who better to do it than an obsessive.",9,2,5,5 February 2008
Milk," Brilliantly acted and superbly well made
","As the world stands and watches the first African American US President take his first steps in the world's most powerful job, it is easy to dream, if only for a moment, that all civil rights struggles have been resolved. Alas, it is not so and, of the many which are still ongoing, one which still causes great controversy, across the democratic world, but especially in the States, is that of homosexuality. Whilst the images and words of MLK are carved onto the world's memory, the actions of people such as Harvey Milk are less well known.Gus Van Sant's exceptional biopic tells the story of Milk, opening up a new generation, or maybe even generations, to the story of a courageous and important man. With a brilliant script by Dustin Lance Black, the film starts with the end, using documentary footage of the day when Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were shot dead and goes back to tell the story of Milk's rise to power and extraordinary struggle against the prejudice which was sweeping across America.At the heart of this film is Sean Penn who delivers one of the most tremendous screen performances for many years. He not only becomes his character on screen, but changes him very subtly through the film's eight year time-span. It is a gripping piece of acting, ably supported by an outstanding cast. James Franco is something of a revelation as Milk's lover Scott, whilst Emile Hirsch is impressive once again as the reluctant activist Cleve Jones. All of the supporting cast, though, must bow to the brilliant Josh Brolin who is incredible as city supervisor Dan White and very nearly steals the film.All of them are framed beautifully in the world of the seventies which Van Sant conjures up with the help of his excellent craftsmen. The world is complete and superbly shot by Harris Savides whose use of reflection throughout the film is constantly inventive (one shot of a whistle is quite extraordinary). As a piece of film-making this is exceptional and always good to watch.The pace is slow at points, but this is an important story, deserving of a cinematic realisation. It is a moving and engrossing film, with supreme actors and filmmakers working at the top of their game. It amounts to a brilliant piece of storytelling and, particularly when that story is as significant as this one, that makes for great cinema.4 Stars out of 5",9,0,4,21 January 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Guillermo's done it again
","Guillermo del Toro's first Hellboy film was a little bit of a damp squib. This, from the man who would, two years later, direct the visionary, gripping and inventive 'Pan's Labyrinth' was a disappointment, even though it seemed to be part of the man. He suggested that his cinematic life was split in two, between films 'for himself' and films 'for Hollywood'.However, with 'Hellboy II', del Toro claims that this split is no more and that he has benefited from less interference. In short, he says he is happy to 'own' this film. This is a cause for rejoicing as del Toro, one of the real treasures of modern cinema, can be trusted to be left to his own devices and, here, he creates a really entertaining, popcorn, blockbuster which is everything that 'Indy IV' wasn't.It has del Toro's characteristic invention and style. From the opening sequence (animated mannequins acting out the backstory) through to the grand finale, this is as visually lavish as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The extended Troll Market sequence is a particular highlight.The film also has a fair dash of del Toro's wit. Anyone who has seen or heard an interview with him will be aware that he has a cheeky, mischievous and childlike sense of humour which is delightful to listen to. With the impeccable timing of Ron Perlman (who delivers another excellent performance) at his service, he injects Hellboy with some no nonsense humour and conjures numerous amusing scenes and characters to support him.It may not be to everybody's taste (one of the funniest lines in the film is 'I'm not a baby. I'm a tuma.') but there is a lot to enjoy. Johann Krauss, a new addition to the cast of characters, fits in with this, whilst Abe Sapien (Doug Jones continues his superb work with del Toro here) and Hellboy share a splendid scene involving two drunk paranormal beings and Barry Manilow.But, del Toro doesn't allow the film to become simple. The central plot features a villain who is in fact in the right (whether this justifies the proposed use of the eponymous army is another matter). Hellboy, now in the public eye, faces fascination and rejection from the humans and the villain is keen to exploit this. It is apparent that, like 'The Dark Knight', this is a subversive blockbuster which is, in fact, a character piece dressed up as an action film.All of which makes for great cinema. The film is never boring, always entertaining and a complete experience. This is superior entertainment and a true cinematic experience. It seems that, unhindered, del Toro is a joy. Let us hope that this form carries through to 'The Hobbit'.4 stars out of 5",8,0,0,5 January 2009
Cloverfield," Top notch entertainment
","There are event movies which are big by their nature and there are event movies that whip up hysteria and become big. Quite often, event movies don't live up to their hype. 'Cloverfield' is one of the biggest examples of an event movie that only has itself to blame if it fails to live up to its expectations as it created its own hysteria. Fortunately, for the filmmakers as much as anyone else, this is magnificent, popcorn-entertainment which is cinema spectacle at its very best.Having whipped up a burden of expectation with one of the most intriguing, effective and inventive marketing campaigns for many years, 'Cloverfield' then does more to build up the tension by starting off with some of the most annoying characters for many years. They are tedious, basically because they have perfectly normal, boring problems (all of which are encapsulated in an opening party sequence that sets up the camcorder gimmick as well) and they talk like so: 'Dude, he's, like, your main dude and, I love you man, but you blew her off, and man, you're going to Japan and she's crazy about you bro, like, right now'. So, after twenty minutes of this you're more than happy for the violence and gratuitous destruction to begin. And when it begins, it's clear: this was worth the wait.Like 'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow', this film destroys big landmarks like there's no tomorrow. From the destruction of the Statue of Liberty to the complete end of Manhattan, director Matt Reeves pulls no punches. There are explosions, violent deaths, all of your usual disaster movie bread and butter moments, but with a twist. For large portions of the film you see very little. This is the first use of ambiguity in a film that gorges on uncertainty and it works superbly. The near misses and the small glimpses grip you and terrify you. This is due to the camcorder style cinematography which, whilst it has apparently caused motion, is particularly well done. Not quite being able to see what you would normally be given freely is enticing. It is excellent and effective film-making, at once bombastic by nature of the plot but restrained by nature of the direction. Imagine how dull this would have been if it had been directed by Michael Bay.There is more than simple big wham-bam-thank-you-ma'm moments. There is a claustrophobic sequence in a tunnel, which provides thrills and chills. The characters' suffering makes them easy to follow and, whilst you don't love them, you do care for them. The demise of one character behind a screen is bleak and has devastating punch.But the major strength of this film is simple. It is its ambiguity. We never have a scientist (probably called P.L. O'Texplanation) turning up telling us what the monster is or where it came from or the answers to any of the film's many other questions. We do get the inevitable payoff, but it gives us precisely zero answers. We don't, on the other hand, ever really find out the fate of most of our characters. It all builds up a web of questions, and few, if any, answers.Which means you go away wanting more, wondering and with you imagination running wild. This is not a great film, just a terrific, thrilling and terrifying experience that will last long after you leave the cinema.",8,0,1,15 May 2008
Once," Dull and there's better stuff out there
","This highly successful, low budget Irish film has struck a chord across the world and the reasons why remain a complete mystery. Yes, it's nice. Yes, it's vaguely heart-warming. However, there are far better films out there and this film provides little insight into love or the human condition and commits one of the worst crimes of all  it's dull.Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova produce two adept performances, whilst their songs are of a high quality and the film itself clearly has its heart in the right place. But it just doesn't work. The pace is glacial, with much of the romantic suspense being done away with in the opening half-hour. In the end it feels like an extended music video and is hardly cinematic.Pleasant as far as it goes, but there really are better things to do with your time and far greater films that deal with the subject of unrequited love.",6,3,10,10 December 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Magnificent Achievement
","What a film. Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers have made a film that can only be described as one of the greatest ever made. It is a superb satire, brilliantly funny and filled with some spectacular performances. Peter Sellers' three performances are a masterclass in acting. From the wonderfully English Group Captain Mandrake to President Merkin Muffley and, not to mention, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers produces characters who will remain timeless. George C. Scott's performance, which he viewed not to be his own, is outstanding. It is tribute to Kubrick's spectacular direction that he was able to get such a performance out of one of his actors. And what of Kubrick's direction. Incredible. It is flawless. He manages to maintain a good comic script, which deals with a sensitive subject, without causing offense. Other than this, a superb supporting cast, a brilliant screenplay and the war room lead this film into the halls of the great.10/10",10,1,3,14 December 2004
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Stylish and macabre musical that effortlessly entertains
","Tim Burton is a master of style and he brings all of his experience and talent to bear here. Supported by brilliant performances and impressive music, Burton's 'Sweeney Todd' is a really fine piece of cinematic entertainment.It is a masterclass from Burton as a director. He toys with the audience's feelings, sympathies and ideals, all the while immersing them in world that is grim, unforgiving and twisted. He shocks and entertains and creates humour out of horror. The film looks fantastic, makes you laugh and is pumped with violence and shock-horror. The make-up and the costume are brilliantly monochrome, but the Gothic design of the film as a whole is ingenious, all, ultimately, down to Burton's skill and imagination. From the bloody title sequence to the bloody end, Burton is always in control and never puts a foot wrong.The story of a wronged man's descent into madness and murder is a classic fable that requires a central performance that has to be entirely believable and Burton gets this from Johnny Depp who is, quite simply, superb. His performance remains human, even through Todd's darkest moments, and this is crucial, as an inhuman Todd loses all sympathy. Depp holds that sympathy. He is pitch-perfect and every shot that focuses on him is filled with interest.Depp is brilliantly supported, chiefly by Bonham Carter who is excellent and has tangible chemistry with Depp, both of whom eek out humour at any opportunity. Then there are the trio of established English thesps, Rickman, Spall and Baron Cohen. Rickman is a convincing villain, though you get the sense that his usual venom is somewhat subdued, though he is still entertaining. Timothy Spall is chillingly creepy and Baron Cohen is hilarious in his small but memorable role. But mention must be made of the young Ed Sanders, as the workhouse boy who has a difficult role which he pulls off extremely well.All of them sing well, with Sondheim's music, beautiful and engrossing, filtering into the film effortlessly. Some of them sing brilliantly (Depp and Bonham Carter especially), bringing humour or emotion to the songs whenever required, which is essential. The music is also brilliantly orchestrated, emphasising the tone.All of these elements build up the brilliant climax in this wonderful, macabre and entertaining piece of work; more than solid, darkly comic and pretty satisfying fare. I urge you to see it  not for the squeamish, but utterly enjoyable.",9,2,4,19 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Flawed film with a great deal of promise
","It is now largely forgotten that Ben Affleck's big break was not as an actor in but as a writer of 'Good Will Hunting'. His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film (a quiet and subtle display) and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and co-Oscar-winner, Matt Damon. With 'Gone Baby Gone', Affleck moves back behind the camera, directing and writing, whilst his brother Casey, who really impressed in 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford', takes the lead.The film is a gritty thriller at first, with a quite masterful opening which is engrossing and effective. The sense of location is evident from the start and both Afflecks demonstrate their talents. Casey is an interesting screen presence, and Ben is an unfussy director with an eye for location and images.The film is served well be the stellar cast. Ed Harris is very good, as is Michelle Monaghan and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan is fantastic, whilst Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, which is nice. They do make the film easy to watch, even though the subject matter, focussing on child abduction, is difficult to deal with.However, although the subject matter is treated well throughout most of the film, its fatal flaw is that it lets itself go in the third act. The plot twists and turns three times toward the end to lose nearly all credibility and then loses any that it had left by landing on a truly unbelievable conclusion. Its focus on character is not lost, but it is still a disappointment to see such a tightly played drama unwind at the end.Nevertheless, this film has much promise. Its subject matter should be a consideration for anyone who is thinking of seeing this, but it is an intelligent and interesting film which is worth watching, mainly because of what it might be the precursor of.",7,21,25,9 December 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Greengrass is now established as one of the world's finest and most important directors
","Jason Bourne has single-handedly outrun hundreds of policemen, killed tens of assassins and changed the nature of the spy thriller. It is a simple fact that if 'The Bourne Identity' had not been made then 'Casino Royale would not have been made, and the latter was hailed as a great reinvention of the Bond franchise and raised the bar for 'The Bourne Ultimatum', released the following summer. This was just a little bit more pressure on the team behind the Bourne films as they had to take the twisted plot from the first two movies and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion for the enormous number of fans across the world and provide a tense and satisfying spy thriller.In a summer of deeply disappointing 'threequels', 'The Bourne Ultimatum' reigns supreme. Thanks, largely, to the work of director Paul Greengrass, the films holds the audience from the first frame to the last although, as always, there has to be a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, (but surely that is what the cinema allows you to do?). Every action scene is gripping and adrenaline pumping. Whether it's a game of cat and mouse at Waterloo station or a chase on the rooftops of Tangiers or a relentless car chase through the streets of New York, the film never drops the baton and it is completely fulfilling. Matt Damon, who has shown his range and ability in recent years, especially with Scorsese's 'The Departed', delivers his best performance to date and is electric on screen. He is ably assisted by David Strathairn, Julia Stiles (who gives her best performance of the series), Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Paddy Considine who hold the film together completely and together make one of the best ensembles of the year so far.Having gained an Oscar nomination for his direction of 'United 93', in my opinion the best film of 2006, Greengrass has now, with the addition of 'Ultimatum', established himself as one of the world's finest and most important film directors working today. In this film he continues with the hand-held camera style that made his 9/11 drama so effective but he is also a storyteller and is not afraid of moments of stillness. He delves into his characters minds with silence or a stare and creates intrigue seemingly effortlessly. But this is also a political film and subtleties, and not-too-subtleties, lie under the frenetic game of international tag, making their presence known but not enveloping the film. Greengrass controls his film well providing the perfect cocktail to produce a gripping film with brains and this will surely ensure that his name is thrown into the ring come Oscar time, though it will be surprising if the Academy vote for him or his film in enough numbers to get nominations, let alone victories.Powerful, tense, gripping, this film has put some quality into what has been a very bleak summer and has once again raised the bar for Bond. Greengrass has established himself as a top director and Damon as a top actor and this film is certainly one of the best of the year, though it is doubtful whether it will gain the awards it deserves.",9,3,6,20 August 2007
The Aviator," Brilliantly Directed, Shot, Acted and Made but so, so Long
","And so Martin Scorsese remains Oscar less. The members of the academy did not have the large bladders and mind boggling attention spans that were certainly required to see this film. If it hadn't been for its length I would have gladly given the film 10 out of 10. It's brilliantly shot, designed with spectacular direction from Scorsese and brilliant performances from the entire cast, especially DiCaprio, Alda and Blanchett but by the end of the film I half expected Hughes to see off his fears of dirt and disease in a cesspit before finding some new and crazy fear before locking himself in a room, stripping off slowly, drinking copious amounts of milk, taping his room into different sections, being met by Kate Beckinsale, who tells him he needs to get some clothes on before his big court appearance (which comes about because he has been spending ridiculous amounts of public money on planes bigger than the Empire State building which float but haven't actually got into the air yet), and then he, Phoenix like, rises from the ashes of his insanity to challenge the corrupt system and triumph for American freedom against that bastard of a senator, who looks like an older version of that guy from M*A*S*H before managing to get that insanely large plane off the ground and if you are still following this sentence, you've probably got an idea of how long this film seems to be. For those of you who have been paralysed by the, now self-confessed, tedious previous sentence may I suggest you see this film but when he enters that room after the big plane crash, take a ten to twenty minute break because he just acts like a total madman and nothing much happens.",9,0,0,5 February 2005
Burn After Reading," Strange but satisfying
","The Coen brothers' have recently struck form with their dark, tense and stylish neo-Western 'No Country For Old Men', which was more in tune with their past films such as 'Blood Simple'. With 'Burn After Reading', they return to the territory of 'The Big Lebowski', with a dash of 'Fargo'. This is at times hilarious, suddenly brutal and violent and quite bewildering at points. It is hard to describe the experience of watching this strange cocktail unfurl, but, at the end, it is found to be a satisfying experience.This film, which is at its heart an absurdist rip-off of spy films, struggles to find itself, initially. It toys around with the idea of being some kind of modern day, mid-life crisis drama, but this jars with these characters who are designed for farce. As a consequence the film is a slow starter, and throughout the film the 'drama' comes back briefly and never works, except in the case of Richard Jenkins' gym manager, who is truly sympathetic.After half-an-hour, though, the comedy starts and grows throughout the film. At the head of this is a magnificent performance from Brad Pitt as the idiot Chad. Yes, the character is grotesque and two-dimensional, but it is a brilliant comedy performance with perfect comic timing. The star-filled cast is excellent, though some feel a little constrained (Clooney most obviously). Nevertheless, they and the Coens give this film many memorable moments as the comedy generates from a genre which should be dealing with world powers, where this film is actually concerned with ordinary people doing bizarre things which are, to the outsider, inexplicable. It's all summed up by the brief but memorable appearance of a bewildered J.K. Simmons as a CIA chief. Halfway through he delivers the line 'Report back to me when it makes sense' and, at the end, he says 'What a Clusterf***'. These, essentially, sum up the film.As for the Coens, although their script is a little confused, their direction is spot on. From the opening shot to the last, they take the parody of overblown spy films to the extreme. The look, sound and feel of the film are nearly perfect. The zooming in for no reason, the ludicrous music and many other stylistic touches make this highly enjoyable at every turn.Is it perfect? No. Not by a long shot. Is it up there with 'Lebowski' or 'No Country'? No. What is the film then? It is intelligent, bizarre, funny, confused, stylish, confusing, at times brilliant, often strange and a satisfying and enjoyable time at the cinema.4 stars out of 5",8,3,7,19 October 2008
The Orphanage," An exciting directorial debut
","18 months back, or so, the world was astonished as three Mexican directors produced three exceptional and successful films. One of those three, Alfonso Cuáron, said in an interview last year that the trio (himself, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu & Guillermo del Toro) considered themselves to be nothing in comparison to 'what is to come'.With 'The Orphanage', executive produced by del Toro, we get to see some work from the first of the new Hispanic wave, namely the Spaniard Juan Antonio Bayona. Although del Toro's name is plastered all over the posters, this is undeniably Bayona's film who, with stylish photography, effective design and confident direction, makes this a fantastically gripping and moving piece of work.It is a staggeringly bold and extremely exciting feature debut by this director. From the very first shot, the audience can see that this director has style and an eye for striking images. But he also knows how to manipulate an audience. The early scenes grip the audience as Bayona builds up a tense atmosphere, filled with the sort of menace that Hitchcock created in so many films.Then, when the supernatural plot gets going, he fills the film with enough memorable visual touches and 'crash, bang, wallop' moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. A number of scenes excel, especially one where a medium is used in the eponymous orphanage and wanders the apparently empty corridors, viewed in the eerie green of night vision. It is a magnificent, thrilling scene and, although it sounds clichéd, it is fresh, inventive and spine-chilling.But this film is so much more than a nuts and bolts ghost story. The film ends with a wonderful, moving twist that is at once heart-breaking and utterly uplifting. This is an engrossing and thrilling film and a triumph of superior direction but it is the film's intelligent and philosophical side that stays with you, long after your spine has stopped tingling.",9,12,16,4 April 2008
American Beauty," You must see this film.
","Sam Mendes' tale of self-fulfilment is a masterpiece. Everything works together in a wonderful harmony which is utterly memorable, gripping and beautiful to look at.It rings true, for the most part, because of two people, namely Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Spacey is so sardonic, so world-weary and so precise with every word in every line that he makes every second spent with his character joyous, whilst Bening brings a pitch-perfect portrayal of insecurity and suburban façade that frankly puts 'Desperate Housewives' to shame. The entire ensemble gels together magnificently.But the film is not just made by the supreme acting but also by the fantastic dark comedy. The script, by Alan Ball, is hilarious in such a brilliantly inventive way, the likes of which have not been seen since Billy Wilder.And then there's the visual style. Mendes' images are stunning, memorable and clever (plenty of thanks should also go to DP, Conrad L. Hall). The direction is detectable but not overly forceful. You're aware of the director's hand but it doesn't bother you and this makes you think. It absorbs you into the film completely.This is a wonderful experience and not to be missed. The simple message of the film is born out to perfection and the end is utterly satisfying, but along the way it is moving, funny, intelligent, stunning, devastating and uplifting. You must see this film.",10,3,6,21 April 2008
Ratatouille," Wonderful film
","Pixar's films hit the big time thirteen years ago with the magnificent 'Toy Story' and since then they have a near flawless record in the quality of their releases. Perhaps the high point of this decade was Brad Bird's first Pixar effort, 'The Incredibles', which was by no means perfect, but was witty, imaginative, gorgeous to look at and intelligent. There were, therefore, high expectations of 'Ratatouille'.However, there were also worries. The project was originally assigned to Jan Pinkava, who retains several credits, but, under somewhat mysterious circumstances, Bird took over. Rumours of disaster spread like wildfire, but the film defied these concerns and was pretty spectacular in many ways.Many see the film as a clear metaphor for Pixar itself, fighting against convention and the 'rules' in order to realise artistic potential. There maybe something in that but, ultimately, it doesn't matter because this is a wonderful and joyous film, brilliantly made and thoroughly enjoyable.Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is the sublime animation. It really is a major step forward. Environments are completely photo-real, characters are designed brilliantly and the look of the film is highly detailed, luscious and vibrant. But all of that hard work would be nothing without an entertaining and amusing narrative and Bird provides this. The film isn't perfectly structured. The plot loops on itself occasionally and the pace slacks during the third act. But, the characters are brilliantly detailed and there are more than enough amusing moments to get you by. His direction is also terrific. He gives the film such energy and movement that every shot is arresting.The vocal cast are also superb, with the standouts being Ian Holm's villainous chef Skinner and Peter O'Toole whose breathtakingly brilliant voice is absolutely ideal for the food critic Anton Ego. The sound of the film is also supported by Michael Giacchino's electric and eclectic jazzy score, an example of the further elements that all come together to make this film what it is.It is by no means perfect. It's slightly overlong, it's poorly structured but that doesn't matter. It is a lovely, wonderful film and if you leave this film without a smile on your face then there is something wrong with you.",9,0,1,5 February 2008
Control," Devastating and Brilliant
","If Ian Curtis were a fictional character, he would truly be one of the most tragic anti-heroes of all time. He is a man whose romantic youth had been very foolish and had led to his sense of being completely trapped with every avenue of escape turning sour. The fact that he was a real person makes this story devastating. This is not a film for a rainy afternoon, but it is absolutely brilliant.The strength of this film cannot be pinned down to one single area. Matt Greenhalgh's script is intelligent. Corbijn's direction is interesting. The soundtrack is electric. The look of the film is stylish. The cast is superb. It is an all round impressive piece of work emphasised by the fact that it is able to overcome its failings, which mainly stem from the pace. Whilst it is nice to see a film that is prepared to take its time, there are times when the speed begins to drag. However, it is worth working through the slower moments.There are moments when the film is absolutely gripping and electric, but at all times it is interesting. Corbijn brings style effortlessly to this film. The monochrome cinematography may seem clichéd but it is completely apt and wonderful to look at. His cutting is fascinating: there is always something going on. His choice of music is brilliant and the soundtrack is an absolutely terrific collection of songs. It is an astonishing effort from the debut director, who actually photographed the band when they were in their prime.He is supported by a pitch perfect cast. Sam Riley, in essentially a debut performance, is magnificent. He completely holds your attention and is sympathetic despite his character's human failings. He is assisted by a wonderful supporting performance from Samantha Morton. When the pair of them are on the screen together, they create genuinely touching scenes. From playing the happy young lovers right through the lows of their relationship, they are utterly believable. The rest of the ensemble, especially Alexandra Maria Lara and Toby Kebbell, complete the sense of the world of late seventies and early eighties Macclesfield.However, despite the brilliant direction, the superb sound and the wonderful performances, the reason why this film will last for many years is the central story about a young man trapped by the accident of birth, his mistakes and his misfortune. It isn't uplifting and it isn't heroic. It is utterly heartbreaking. It is utterly human.",9,3,4,12 February 2008
The Duchess," An entertaining film which promises much for the future
","The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films. But, in 'The Duchess', an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.The film has been marketed with not so subtle emphases on Georgiana's relative, Diana, Princess of Wales. The tagline for the film, 'There were three people in her marriage', is not only, by my count, a miscalculation (a serious miscalculation if you count the dogs) but also guilty of creating a subtext which simply isn't in the film. Anybody looking for a film about Diana will be disappointed. Anyone looking for an entertaining film won't be.The film is a moving portrait of a very tragic figure, brought to life by a career best performance from Keira Knightely. Her abilities have grown over recent years, with 'Atonement' being her previous best, but here she shows great potential. She is ably supported by Ralph Fiennes, who is on fine form. His performance never descends into caricature or cartoonish villainy, but maintains a sense of humanity, no matter how selfish it is, underneath his characters various inexcusable actions. There is also a fine performance from Charlotte Rampling, though there is a weak link in the person of Dominic Cooper, who is too young for his part and struggles with it.The witty and emotive script has a lot to recommend it and its characters are put into an engrossing and lavish world, successfully created by the director Saul Dibb. Extraordinary costumes fill the extraordinary locations, and there is a beautiful score by Rachael Portman to accompany it. The result is a fairly stylish affair.The film's exploration of unfortunate innocence and the loss of freedom is at times poignant and adds to what is an extremely satisfying experience at the cinema and provides a great deal of promise for the future from its director and its star.",8,125,182,13 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Craig Stars as Film Dwindles
","The massive success of 'Casino Royale' created a weight of expectation on 'Quantum of Solace' which was always going to be hard to live up to. The gritty and intense redesign of the Bond franchise, with the excellent Daniel Craig in the lead, gave rise to these great hopes and the signs were, on the whole, good. Nevertheless, one cannot help but be disappointed by Bond's latest outing, though it is by no means a disaster and still worth going to see.'Quantum of Solace' is a film of two halves in many ways and it seems necessary to separate the good from the bad. Starting with the good, we have Daniel Craig continuing his fine work with the role. When the film comes to its end there can be no doubt that Craig is a man of awesome talent and the best Bond since Connery, if not the best. He is ably supported by the cast which includes brilliant turns from Olga Kurylenko (as the tough and interesting Camille), Giancarlo Giannini (reprising his role as Mathis) and Judi Dench (ever-excellent as M).Then, there is the style of the film. One sequence, set around an Opera, is wonderful to watch and quite entrancing to look at. Other moments are also terrifically intense, whilst David Arnold provides an exemplary score to accompany the often impressive images.Also, there is a continuation of the plot from 'Casino Royale' which is not perhaps as heavily explored as it should be but still provides the film with its finest moment as it reaches its denouement. All of which bodes well for Craig's third outing, but cannot make up for some of this film's failings.Most of the problems lie in the script which, whilst dryly funny and not without merit, has a plot (the one specific to this film) which is dull and overly reliant on action sequences. Poor Mathieu Almaric, who is his usual excellent self in this film, is lumbered with one of the most boring Bond villains in history and the central plot, though realistic and relevant, is hardly the most entertaining of ideas. A sign of its weakness is that, although this is the shortest Bond film on record, it feels long.Furthermore, Bond's character development through the film is sporadic, and, for a film which relies so heavily on action, it does a lot of the chase and fight scenes really badly. It is often difficult to tell what's going on during the sequences and sometimes they are horrendously overlong. Marc Forster, who is often a great character filmmaker, is pretty much out of his depth here.The film was badly affected by the writer's strike and there was not really an opportunity for it to be given the amount of work it deserved. Yes it is a disappointment, but it is not a regrettable experience or a disaster. It has its moments. The overwhelming experience is of a missed opportunity. This could have been so much more. Go and see it for Craig's performance, and in preparation for the next film which, with the greater amount of time available to the producers and writers, promises to be better.3(1/2) stars out of 5",7,1,2,9 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," A tense, gripping and intelligent masterpiece
","As the sun rises on the bare Texan landscape, the voice of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) talks of times past and the troubled present as shadows cross the landscape. It is an elegy to human decency and morality, and the beginning of the Coen brothers' masterpiece, 'No Country for Old Men'.Adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who goes hunting in the Texan wilderness one day and discovers abandoned cars in a valley, with corpses rotting and wilting in the sun. It's a drug deal gone wrong, and Moss goes in search of the last man standing and the money he undoubtedly has. He finds him dead and aims to make a getaway with the money. Unbeknownst to him, the money is being tracked by the ruthless and brutal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who stops at nothing and for no-one on what he believes is a predestined course through life. As they tear across Texas near the Mexican border, leaving bodies and destruction in their wake, they are followed by the aging, weary and increasingly bewildered Sheriff who does not comprehend the evil Chigurh poses and begins to wonder whether humanity is going to hell in a handcart.It is strong source material for the Coens, who started their careers on very similar territory with 'Blood Simple'. Their ability to construct intelligent thrillers is well established and with a strong foundation in the source material they excel. The script is clever, subtle and carefully constructed. At the centre are three characters who never quite share the screen, one of whom is the good man, principled and upstanding, whilst another is the evil man, confident in the idea that he has to do what is set out for him, and the third is caught in between the two, not a bad man, but not wholly good either. The three play out a gripping thriller, whilst the nature of man's morality is questioned.The figure of good is common in the Coen's work ('Fargo''s Marge is the prime example) and is normally the heart of the film. This could be said of Bell, but he is not the core of the film. That title belongs to Chigurh. The film opens with this quiet man killing a lawman and an unfortunate driver, the latter in a punchy and gory manner, the former in a sickening, sadistic way. From then on, every second Chigurh has on screen is menacing, a sense which is enhanced to the extreme by Javier Bardem's brilliant, subtle and electrifying performance. Dressed in dark clothing with the most unnerving haircut ever seen on screen, Chigurh becomes a 'ghost', a force of evil and it is this that drives the film to the heights it reaches.We have no special reason to feel for Moss. He does little to earn our sympathy, and yet we are driven to distraction for his wellbeing once Chigurh is on his tail. Whenever we do not see Chigurh we expect him to arrive. We gasp when he creeps into the back of the frame and we shiver when he's on screen. A scrunched up wrapper uncoiling becomes threatening in his presence and life and death hangs on a coin toss. The weight and clunk of his gas canister, the punch of his bolt gun and smack of his shotgun all contribute to our terror in what is a masterpiece of writing, performance and design.But Chigurh is not all of the film. Josh Brolin's Moss is a fine character and another magnificent performance. He is a true everyman. He is a good man in many ways but vulnerable in others. His greed gets him into trouble, but his generosity digs him deeper into it. Brolin brings his character into sharp focus, as does Tommy Lee Jones. Bell's dry humour and wisdom are engaging, but his sense of ever increasing evil around him makes him more interesting. His sense of free will directly contrasts Chigurh's blinkered determinism and the two bring philosophical depth to the picture.But, for all of the intelligence, this film would be nothing without its gripping and tense plot which is superbly executed by the Coens. Every element, every sound, every light, every note of music and every line, is used to maximum effect. Whereas in the infinitely comparable 'Blood Simple' the directorial style filled the frame, here the film uses subtle touches (hats off to cinematographer Roger Deakins most of all for his superb work behind the camera). Everything in it is sparse which makes every sight and sound all the more powerful. Some scenes make you slow your breathing so you don't miss a thing and draw you to the edge of your seat. The film echoes itself and broadens its message. It takes the brutality and wrongdoing out of the western wilderness and into the shining cities. It shows the corrupted and the uncorrupted. It shows the end of innocence and after the fall. It is brilliantly balanced and brilliantly constructed. There is not a false step anywhere. There isn't a dud performance or a pointless moment. It is an astonishing neo-western thriller.The ending of the film is pure poetry. It may be too abrupt for some, but think on it awhile. It adds mortality to this tale of morality and fate and it completes the films thoughts nicely. After the songs to human goodness in 'Fargo' and, to a lesser extent, 'The Big Lebowski' it is almost shocking that this film seems to say that humanity isn't going to hell but is already there. But that's not quite the whole story. In the middle of the savagery and inhumanity, there is still good with the bad. There is no shadow without the sun. It is the perfect ending to a film which is brilliant, gripping and absolutely satisfying. This is not just a must see. This is a masterwork.",10,1,3,23 July 2008
Mamma Mia!," Halfway through 'The Winner Takes it All', my resistance finally died
","Don't get me wrong. This is a bad film. The plot is poor and badly carried out. Some of the songs are appalling. Pierce Brosnan cannot sing at all. Colin Firth struggles. Story lines pop out of nowhere. In short, it's badly written, badly directed and has some of the worst singing ever heard in a cinema.I had spent quite a lot of the film with my head in my hands as the awfulness just flooded off the screen. And then, halfway through 'The Winner Takes it All', with Meryl Streep delivering the lyrics as if it were the 'To be, or not to be' of musicals, I suddenly had a realisation. 'Oh dear', I thought, 'it's all gone right'.That is about two-thirds of the way through the film which leaves you smiling by virtue of the fact that it's done with such a great deal of fun that some of it is bound to rub off on you. If you have no affection for Abba then you will be in trouble but if you do there is fun to be had.And it's not all bad. The aforementioned Streep is excellent as Donna, belting the songs out with gusto and clearly having a lot of fun. Brosnan's singing has to be heard to be believed but other than that he's fine. Stellan Skarsgaard's is as good as ever, whilst Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are as entertaining as ever.But it is a bad film, a very bad film. But, almost because of its awfulness, it's actually a good way to spend a couple of hours. This joins the very large category of films that are absolutely terrible, but wonderfully enjoyable.N.B. In Britain, this has been given a PG rating. It is questionable as to whether many children will enjoy this anyway, but there are some jokes and lines that might be unsuitable. Check the BBFC's parents' website before taking young children to see this.",6,2,4,20 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Society's Mirror - Why this film must be seen
","This film has had what can only be called a tortured genesis. Having been in the pipeline for some time it disappeared shortly before its original release date of autumn last year. Rumours of production problems were rife and expectations fell very low. Now it has arrived, only a year late, and, in what has been a year of many good films but few standouts, this film has rode in to save the day. It is, quite simply, awesome.Andrew Dominik conjures three exquisitely detailed, well rendered and poignant portraits in this film: Jesse James, Robert Ford and a society that must be seen as not so different from our own. Brad Pitt is astonishing as James, portraying the paranoid madness of a man trapped in his own myth whose fascination with and fear of death haunts his every move. However, Pitt is matched by the brilliance of Casey Affleck's performance. Robert Ford is shown as a man obsessed with the myth of Jesse James who, through disappointment, rejection and desire, turns against the epicentre of his dreams. It is this fascinating portrayal that lies at the centre of this film.However, Dominik places this engrossing character drama against a bewildering social background. The two live in a society that has a government that allows murder when it sees fit and punishes it when it doesn't and a public that celebrates a mass-murderer and despises an assassin who shows no remorse. To delve any further in this would give away the ending which, surprisingly enough, is not the one in the title, but the questions that arise from this film are ones about society and its moral nature and the power of obsession on a personal and a mass level.If this sounds dull to you then you're in for a surprise. The film, whilst slow-paced and long, is never boring and grips you from start to finish. Much of the reason for this has already been discussed but credit must also go to the brilliant ensemble. Sam Rockwell is the standout supporting player and his performance is a career best. Then there is Roger Deakins' cinematography which is fantastic and Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' music which is extremely well used. But, ultimately, the showpieces here are the central performances, an interesting and stylish director and a pitch perfect script. This is certainly the most accomplished film I've seen for a long time. It doesn't invite comparison (though it deserves it) with Leone's 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but the assassination scene is not only reminiscent of Leone's final shootout scene but is every bit as good.It may be seen as arduous by some but at some point, at home or (preferably) at the cinema, you must see this film for so many reasons  the technical brilliance, the incredible performances, the experience and, above all, the questions it raises that are some of the most important of recent years.",10,1,4,5 December 2007
Batman Begins," The Best Superhero Film of the Decade ... so far
","There is a moment towards the climax of 'Batman Begins' which illustrates why this film is an exceptional superhero flick. During a stunning car chase sequence, Batman (aka Bruce Wayne), our hero, crushes a number of police cars, at the very least injuring a number of policemen. Once Bruce Wayne returns home, he is reprimanded for showboating by his loyal butler, Alfred. In this sequence, the strengths of the film are neatly summed up. An exciting chase sequence is mixed with ambiguity surrounding our protagonist with questions raised over what is necessary for good to triumph. Indeed, at some points during this film, we are left asking what is good and whether it is triumphing at all. In short, this film merges superb action, clever character work and intelligent moral and philosophical questions all the way through with perfect balance.During a decade where the box-office has been stuffed with super-heroics of all shapes and sizes, this film remains the best super-hero film of the decade, with the only imminent challenger to that crown seemingly being its own sequel. Even the 'Spider-Man' films, which together with the 'X-Men' films can lay claim to starting the major revival of the genre, are able to beat this. But the comparisons are strong and the influences upon each other even stronger. 'Spider-Man' arrived in 2002 and boasted strong character work as well as blockbuster action sequences. 'Batman Begins' was deep into production when 'Spider-Man 2' arrived in cinemas in 2004 with even stronger and detailed characters, better visual effects and action sequences that were greeted with applause the world over. The bar had been raised by the time the Dark Knight's origins were brought to the screen a year later. Expectations were high and the pressure was on.Nolan had the guts to do what he thought was necessary to make the franchise credible after the disaster of Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin' from the late nineties. Out went the camp Batsuits and cheesy dialogue, the comical villains and supernatural design. In came a gritty, realistic Gotham with as much backstory as the central character and villains who were not cartoonish. This is a world that is not dystopian but downtrodden and at the centre of it is Bruce Wayne who we find in prison, a lost-soul.Nolan devotes a relatively action-free hour to the central character, his past and the genesis of Batman. He is trained with brutal methods, whilst we are slowly shown the origin of his fear of bats and the death of his parents. He faces questions of justice and identity before resolving to return to Gotham where he slowly confronts his fears, his guilt and his anger and becomes Batman.Once the suit is donned, the film hits top gear. The action sequences and set-pieces come thick and fast. We meet our villains (excellent performances from Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy), though the nemesis remains a mystery until late on. We discover the childhood sweetheart, now District Attorney, Rachel Dawes (a competent but unpopular Katie Holmes) and other lead good guy, policeman Gordon (another brilliant supporting performance from Gary Oldman), not to mention faithful butler and serial scene-stealer Alfred (long live Michael Caine). The philosophical questions, already established in the opening half-hour, are expanded upon (a detailed exploration of justice being the main one, with both protagonist and antagonist believing that they are carrying it out) whilst the world is filled in and Nolan's canvas expands.But the focus never shifts from Bruce Wayne, who is complex, interesting, sympathetic and expertly performed by Christian Bale. For all of the action (and there is enough of it, with none of it disappointing) the most enduring image is an astonishing shot of the Dark Knight silhouetted against the dawn sky as he stands at the top of the skyscraper surveying the metropolis below. It is a beautiful spine-tingling moment that, in an image, shows the strength of the film. This is an in depth exploration of a fascinating central character done with style and in a thrilling manner. This is not just the thinking man's superhero film. It is every man's superhero film with action and intelligence working together to brilliant effect.The bar had been raised once more and it became evident in what followed. About a year and a half after the release of this reinvention came a similar change of direction for the Bond franchise with 'Casino Royale' followed shortly by a trailer for 'Spider-Man 3' which seemed to be heading into ultra-dark territory. Spider-Man's identity and soul where going to be at stake, but the film itself failed to match Nolan's effort. In fact, in the attempt to raise the bar once more it fell well short of previous efforts.And here we are, three years later, with the sequel 'The Dark Knight' about to be released, and still Nolan's film sits on top of the pile. Why has no-one matched it? Is it something to do with the character or the director that makes 'Batman Begins' unique? The franchise is not unique, but the director is. All you need do is look at his other pieces of work (especially the intelligent 'Memento' and the intense 'The Prestige') to realise that Christopher Nolan is a director of great intelligence, ability and style. Another film like 'Batman Begins' from another franchise is not impossible, it is just very difficult.",9,5,6,5 June 2008
Revolutionary Road," Well acted, but hollow and derivative
","Sam Mendes's first two films ('American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition') are two of the great American movies of the last ten years or so. The films, which examine, with great flair, the hollowness of the American Dream (though the latter has this in the background), have a new companion piece in the form of 'Revolutionary Road'. However, although Mendes is on familiar territory here, he doesn't manage to get anywhere close to the power of those films.The film's story is familiar. 1950s suburban Americana turns into a living hell for a young bohemian couple. In short, it is something like an extended episode of 'Mad Men'. However, the driving idea behind the film is that this couple is trying to escape from their hell, rediscover the romance of their lives and flee to Paris. It is no coincidence then that Mendes has decided to reunite Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since they played the star crossed lovers in Titanic who embodied romance and the American dream.The thing is that the casting is the most interesting thing in the film and that wears off rather quickly. The same old tired clichés are rolled out. The yearning neighbourly lust, the affair with the secretary and so on have all been seen before and nothing new is added. A few years back, Todd Haynes provided a far more effective and interesting piece in the form of 'Far From Heaven' which examined the great prejudices and falsehoods that the fifties had wrapped up in them.There are plus points. Winslet is fantastic, and should have been nominated for this rather than for 'The Reader'. DiCaprio is not as good as he has been, but Michael Shannon delivers a fantastic turn in the rather stereotypical role of the crazy man who sees past the charade. It is also stylishly shot (yet more excellent work from cameraman Roger Deakins) and looks very good.However, it simply lacks a crucial element. It is very difficult to care for these characters. They always remain distant. Perhaps that is intended, but if so it is an error, because as the story unfurls in a predictable manner it becomes harder and harder to engage with them.",6,2,3,20 February 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," A Masterpiece
","From this film's startling beginning right through to its end, this film is a genuine masterpiece and the greatest film I have ever seen.It is stunning, beautiful, breathtaking, stupendous, brilliant, awesomely made and incomparable with almost anything that has gone before or after. The film follows the World War One escapades of the eponymous Lawrence as he fights for the Arabs, and struggles across miles of desert.There are so many people to be credited for the brilliance of this film, the film that is Steven Spielberg's favourite film of all time. Peter O'Toole's performance is incredible. He brings a mixture of arrogance, humanity and terrifying insanity to his performance. He is brilliantly supported by all of the cast but chiefly by Guinness, Quinn, Sharif and Quayle, who all produce performances of fantastic calibre.There is also Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson who produced a fantastic script which create so many layers for the enigmatic central layers. Then there is F.A. Young's spectacular cinematography, which is quite probably the most beautiful that has ever been produced. There is also Maurice Jarre's brilliantly memorable score with one of the most famous themes that has ever been composed.But the one person who is to be acclaimed the most for this wondrous achievement is the director, David Lean. His control of this fantastic picture is outstanding and his resultant creation is unbelievable.A true achievement, spectacular and a must see, Lawrence of Arabia will blow you away.",10,6,13,31 October 2005
The Lives of Others," An uplifting and important film
","When this film won the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, it had pulled off one of the few shocks of that night, beating the much loved and highly favoured Pan's Labyrinth. Here, in Britain, there was a degree of disbelief, as Guillermo del Toro's fantasy epic was a much loved and much admired film. Within a few months, critics could only agree that the competition was very close, with many concurring with the Academy's decision.This reaction is entirely deserved because The Lives of Others is a magnificent film. It is touching, intelligent and an impressive debut film. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck can only be praised. His script is tight, intelligent and honest. His direction is inventive. All in all, although the film has a few faults, essentially because it could use some cutting, his work is exceptional.The film is ostensibly a simple drama and it is taken on by the cast with aplomb and they manage to stress the complexity of the film without making it impenetrable. Every member of the ensemble is outstanding. Sebastian Koch, who plays the playwright Dreyman, is brilliant. He is sympathetic and intelligent and makes his character, who really doesn't come into his own until late on into the film, thoroughly interesting. Then there is Martina Gedeck, as the embattled Christa-Maria, who creates great pathos in a tough part. But the standout is undoubtedly Ulrich Mühe who, as the tragic Stasi man Wiesler, is pitch perfect. He makes his character not only believable but thoroughly interesting. It is heartbreaking that Mühe died shortly after this film became so successful, as he was on the verge of the stardom that he still deserves.Historically, the film is important. It is poignant as a depiction of unrestricted surveillance. Ulrich Mühe himself was monitored by the Stasi and you can see that this is a highly personal project. It provides a chilling vision of a totalitarian state, whilst remaining a human story.The film is moving and uplifting, with a series of exceptional performances and a promising debut from its director. It acts not only as a compelling thriller but also as an intelligent examination of a truly unpleasant time that needs to be remembered. As surveillance becomes more of an issue, this film becomes more and more important. But the film will ultimately be remembered as a superior piece of art and a thoroughly wonderful piece of work.",9,1,2,12 February 2008
Schindler's List," A Superb, Haunting, Uplifting, Great Film
","Steven Spielberg's career was somewhat unfilled before 1993. Sure there were some fine films and some enjoyable films but there wasn't the truly great film that such a great filmmaker deserved. In 1993, that drought was ended by Schindler's List.When Poland is subdued by the invading Nazi armies, Oskar Schindler attempts to form a business, employing only Jews and freeing them from the Ghetto. However, the Holocaust and the Final Solution begin to take hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but Schindler continues to try and get Jews into his factories. However, as the year begins to draw to a close, Schindler begins to draw up a list of Jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory.What a film! It is fantastic. It is supremely well made, exquisitely written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. It is a tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from Liam Neeson as the benevolent and great Schindler, Ben Kingsley as the mistreated Jew, Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the homicidal and psychotic Goeth. It is simply sublime from all.John Williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise indeed). The photography is superb from Janusz Kaminski and they all help to make a film that has two strong bases. The first is Steven Zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. The second is Spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. He deals with the case of the Holocaust in a suitably stark way but he also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in one man at the very least. He also uses his skill to the maximum. In particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her re-appearance later in the film Put simply, this is a film that is veritably great.Without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be seen by all.",10,9,13,28 October 2005
The Mist," Terrifying, interesting and brilliantly bleak
","Frank Darabont has a track record of uplifting, hopeful films. His most successful film, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a prime example of this. Anybody who watches 'The Mist', another Darabont-helmed Stephen King adaptation, expecting a similar experience is going to be more than disappointed.'The Mist', a horror film on a number of levels, is one of the most terrifying, intense, thrilling, chilling and, let's face it, brilliantly bleak films of recent years. Unlike a number of horror films, this sets out to shock its audience with characters and ideas rather than just horrific situations. Its supernatural premise is merely the backdrop for what is the really scary heart of the film.A group of neighbours are trapped in a convenience store when a mysterious mist descends on their town, containing some sort, or sorts, of terror. As they are confined and their situation gets worse, small divisions grow and grow as the group splits and becomes increasingly feral. Whilst there are plenty of good horror moments, and a number of fine set-pieces, nothing is scarier in this film than what the people do to each other over the course of the film.At the heart of this film is an excellent cast. Thomas Jane's David Drayton makes a good everyman hero and is ably supported by Laurie Holden and Nathan Gamble (impressive as Drayton's son), whilst the increasingly fantastic Toby Jones is magnificent as Ollie Weeks. However, the standout performance (and role) is Marcia Gay Harden's as Mrs. Carmody, a Christian fundamentalist, sure that the apocalypse has come, who whips up part of the group into a fervour. She is, without a doubt, the most terrifying thing in the film.The actors are helped by a superb adaptation by Darabont. The characters, which form a decent microcosm of the society, are wonderfully defined and are develop interestingly. Their divisions and disputes are simmering quietly under the surface at the start of the film and the way they develop is fairly believable. Added to this, the dialogue is very good and there are occasional moments of dark humour (one moment, when Carmody is whipping up her followers with a chant of 'expiation', leads to the wonderful line 'Welcome to Sesame Street kids. Today's word is expiation.').It isn't perfect. The visual effects often jar and it can't quite keep the intensity going all the way through, but this remains a thoroughly impressive, highly recommendable, completely satisfying piece of work. Added to that, it has a bleak, excellent ending which demonstrates this film's integrity. Darabont was offered more money for the film if he changed the scripted ending (different from the original story) and he declined. This is horror with the courage to follow its ideas and story through to a proper conclusion which deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wide audience.4 Stars out of 5",9,1,3,17 November 2008
Gran Torino," Eastwood delivers another cracker
","Clint Eastwood just gets more and more extraordinary. There's absolutely no stopping him. Almost eighty, Eastwood is still producing magnificent films as a director, but now has decided to retire from acting and remain firmly behind the camera. However, his final film performance is a fine one to go out on, coming as an echo of one of his most iconic film roles, 'Dirty' Harry Callaghan.In 'Gran Torino', Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a widower and veteran of Korea who has nothing much left to live for. With his wife dead, Kowalski's terrible, selfish family are alienated from him and Kowalski is apparently bitter and stuck very firmly in the past. He constantly yearns for years gone by when his neighbourhood was not filled with Asians, who he names in numerous fruity terms. He is haunted by his years in service (when asked 'What's it like to kill a man?', he replies 'You don't want to know') and is utterly isolated. And, in his garage, his classic '72 Gran Torino, still in mint condition, is his pride and joy, barely touched since the day it was made, a symbol of Walt's stubborn reluctance to move on from the past.With no-one left to care for except his dog, for a while this film could feel like a fairly simple buddy-movie, as Walt begins to bond with his young neighbour. However, seething underneath is the plot focussing on ethnic gangs in down town Detroit and an absolute tour-de-force from Eastwood. There is no question that this film is about Walt Kowalski, and Eastwood is the absolutely ideal man to play this role. And, he nails it. His performance is gripping and assured. At points, this film is played for a bit of comedy and Eastwood manages to control himself within this, never over doing it whilst he growls through some moments. Kowalski is not 'Dirty Harry – OAP', but Eastwood does inject him with some Callaghan-esquire threat. The line 'Get off my lawn', delivered in a gruff growl, sticks in the mind.As a director, Eastwood continues to impress with this film. Away from the period detail of his previous project, 'Changeling', Eastwood employs a far more subtle visual style, which becomes particularly apparent at the climax of the film. He also manages to control the film's changes of pace, and genre, masterfully, moving effortlessly from drama to comedy to thriller. The result is an absolutely gripping film.It seems a little churlish to mention the few weaknesses, but, whilst this is a thumpingly-good film, at its heart is a relationship between Kowalski and the young neighbour, Thao, who is played by film Bee Vang. Going up against Eastwood is tough, but Vang struggles and, towards the end, this becomes a small distraction. But, it is churlish to pick on this when you are faced with such a tight and entertaining piece of film-making with a powerful message of redemption. This is yet another film to add to Eastwood's exceptional work of the last few years.The idea that this is Eastwood's last performance is a sad one, not just because it marks the end of an iconic screen career but because, with this and 'Million Dollar Baby' not so long ago, he appears to be doing some of his best acting work at the very end of his career. However, he has said that he's retired before and yet he has been tempted back. It might not be too much to hope that it happens again.",9,0,6,4 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Groundbreaking, but it doesn't realise its promise
","The potential of David Fincher going into the mainstream is seemingly enormous. He is a director of brilliant vision and superb talent. With 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', the story of a man who ages backwards, he has the chance to explore the full extent of his talents, both as a visual filmmaker and a storyteller. It was an exciting proposition, but, for some reason, he only manages to pull out a solid piece of work, which, whilst being visually impressive and technically astounding, is somewhat lost in its own pretensions.The film's strengths are many in number, though light in weight. The most notable of these are the groundbreaking visual effects and make up which allow Brad Pitt, and to a lesser extent Cate Blanchett, to roll the years back and forward. This is a 'Gollum' moment: another brilliant and unexpected leap forward in visual effects technology.No matter how they may have been altered, the cast are also excellent. Brad Pitt delivers a very effective performance and is utterly believable all the way through the film. Cate Blanchett is as good as ever, whilst Julia Ormond is given a thankless task as Blanchett's daughter but she carries it off well, and there is also a lovely little performance by Tilda Swinton. Taraji P. Henson, however, steals the film as Button's mother, and fully deserves her Oscar nomination.David Fincher, himself, excels in his usually way, with his optimum style. Some sequences are breathtaking, such as Daisy dancing for Button which is wonderful to see. The film is utterly arresting as a visual experience. It looks beautiful from start to finish and is magnificently shot by Claudio Miranda.However, for a film which is 166 minutes long it does depressingly little with its time. The central motif of Button ageing backwards feels like it should be doing or saying something, but it isn't and, as the condition is never explained in the story or by a theme, it jars somewhat. There are only hints of ideas in this film. There is an anti-war (anti-Bush) theme which floats in occasionally, but is ultimately too short-lived, but there is nothing else which is really going on. Everything seems to be half-baked  enough to envelop the viewer, though not to grip.The film is a sentimental tale and is not an unpleasant way to spend almost three hours. It is at times an astonishing thing to see on screen, but it is not a magnificent thing. It promised so much, but it is a disappointment. It lacks a deal of sophistication and depth which the film perhaps deserves. A masterpiece was hoped for, but all we have is a solid, if groundbreaking, piece of film.",7,1,4,21 February 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Highly effective
","Clooney is interesting. Very interesting. He has become one of the major figures in modern cinema and rightly so. An actor who can produce challenging performances in films such as 'Syriana' as well as entertain in films such as 'Ocean's 11' deserves such an accolade because they can satiate every audience with artistry and finesse. Now he has moved into the territory of direction and screen writing. He was widely acclaimed with promise when he produced 2002's 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' and three years later 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' brought on more and greater acclaim.And rightly so for this film is a spectacular effort from Clooney. As a writer, he, in conjunction with Grant Heslov, has produced an intricate script. It is well designed with interesting characters, clear themes and genuine drama. As an actor he delivers a fine performance, possibly superior to the one he delivered in 'Syriana'. He manages to create a believable character - a producer whose thoughts can be seen by the audience in such a way as to give them a glimpse of the cacophony of emotions that are bubbling up inside of him but maintain a certain mystery - as a well as a man who has genuine camaraderie with the major players with his colleagues. And as a director, Clooney has made a bold statement, a fine film and a stylish piece of art.Indeed, the film is good to look at. The black and white photography maybe regarded as clichéd but it really works. It's natural contrast allows for a greater focus on characters, who are really the drive of the film. It adds to the sense of period, also evoked with the spectacular inter-cutting of archive footage, the art direction and the use of Dianne Reeves' jazz singing which is beautifully done and beautifully sung.Clooney's work, although startling, required the support of its ensemble. Clooney, as I have said, makes no small contribution and is indeed the stand out of the supporting players which also include excellent performances from Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels and Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. However, they are all of them overshadowed by a towering performance from David Strathairn. He uses the power of his voice, the strength of his eyes and every muscle in his face to create what is a truly mesmerising performance. He is the only person to look at when he is on screen.The Oscars were cruel to this film. 'Brokeback Mountain' and 'Crash' were good films, but the former, in my opinion, was driven largely by hype and the latter by a strong ensemble and script and went onto to claim the major awards despite their failings. 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' may not be the perfect film but it is superior to those two. The film that should have won was 'Capote' but that claimed victory in the Best Actor category at the expense of Strathairn. Whilst Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in that film is staggering, it seems to be inferior to Strathairn. Whilst Hoffman had to master the mannerisms of a well known public figure, Strathairn did not and he was not able to give as much of an emotion driven performance as Hoffman and these seem to be the reasons for the Academy's decision. However, Strathairn's performance is more powerful and packs a greater punch and his moments of emotion are striking.In years to come, when anniversary editions of this film appear on home entertainment, the film may not be able to say 'Academy Award Winner' but is able to remain a very fine film. Its single failing is that, whilst it grips its audience for a great length, it does drag a bit at times but this only a minor complaint when you consider the film as a whole.The film's major achievement is that it has the courage to question the integrity of a nation through a historical parable during a time when it is needed most and it does this with great style, accomplishment and effect. Not only that, but its message is one that will echo down the ages. We shall not walk in fear of one another.",9,2,5,30 January 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A powerful, distressing but important piece of cinema
","The dreadful and horrendous events of the Holocaust have been tackled by many films, the best of which have been Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and Polanski's 'The Pianist', both of which were appropriately bleak but offered at least some message of hope. With 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas', director Mark Herman has adapted John Boyne's highly acclaimed novel which sees a small part of this greatest of crimes through the eyes of an innocent and oblivious child.Bruno, the central character, is an eight year old who moves with his family to their new home in the country. His father, unknown to him, is no ordinary soldier but an SS commandant, in charge of the camp which borders his new home. All around him, events occur which he thinks nothing of. He merely wonders about the strange 'farm' next door, and why all of the farmers wear pyjamas all day, every day. Fond of adventure and bored in his lonely home, he sneaks into the back garden and comes to the edge of the camp where he befriends a young boy, Shmuel, who lives inside it.The handling of the Holocaust is very well done here, with the dramatic irony brought on by the audience's foreknowledge providing many questions about the people who carried out this crime. The central relationship between the two boys is incredibly touching. Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon deliver two fantastic child performances, adept beyond their years. They provide the emotional and tragic heart of the film.Around this is the family situation, with the increasingly strained relationship between the boy's parents. The father, who is this almost unbelievable mixture of loving family man and orchestrator of mass murder, is brilliantly played by David Thewlis, whilst Vera Farmiga is excellent as the mother.However, this film is all about its ending. I'm not going to give anything away here, but I cannot remember an ending this bleak and distressing for a very long time, if at all. There will be very few dry eyes in the house as the full horror of this chapter in history is driven home. This film should be watched by younger viewers, but there shouldn't be anyone younger than eleven coming to see this and David Thewlis has said that parents should go with children of this age and only take those who will be able to have a conversation about it afterwards.What this film has to offer for older viewers is an impressive, well-made, moving and powerful piece of drama, though it will be a tough watch. What younger viewers will also take from it is the terrible reality of this event. This may not stand up with the aforementioned great films about the Holocaust, but the fact that it is aimed at a young audience is important. After all, 'He who does not learn about history is doomed to repeat it'.4 stars out of 5",8,3,5,28 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Awesome
","When 'Batman Begins' re-launched the Batman franchise in 2005, the film was heralded as a seminal moment in summer blockbuster entertainment and rightly so. It was a thrilling action film with a script that spent as much time working on its central character as it did setting up extravagant sequences.The pressure of expectation on the shoulders of 'The Dark Knight', its sequel, has naturally been incredible. The weight of the original has been combined with consistently disappointing superhero films leaving fans thirsty for quality. Also, the tragic and untimely death of Heath Ledger has brought a lot of focus onto his final completed performance, which was rumoured to be fantastic before he died.So the pressure was on and writer and director Christopher Nolan excelled. He has, with 'The Dark Knight', built on the success of 'Batman Begins' and created a film of surprising power. It is exciting, thrilling, scarily intelligent, gripping, disturbing and awesome to see.As in 'Batman Begins', Nolan provides plenty of action. But he has truly raised the bar here. The opening salvo is effective but it is nothing compared to what comes after. There is a magnificent sequence in Hong Kong and an extraordinary chase which has the 'batpod', police vehicles and an enormous lorry all involved. They are truly amazing to watch. However, these sequences are just the cherry on the icing on the cake. The power and brilliance of this film is in its ideas.Where 'Begins' focused on the character of Batman, here our central character is sidelined a bit and there are problems with this. The film is lacking a bit of emotional depth and it is perhaps the marginalisation of Bruce Wayne which is behind this. Nevertheless, there is an upside to this problem. This film is not about one character but about all of them. Everyone of them is fascinating and ultimately it is about Batman (standing for the world of straight rules), The Joker (branded a terrorist and standing for chaos) and Harvey Dent (whose fate cannot be revealed here but sufficed to say that he completes the triumvirate in an interesting manner), and what their collision means for man and society.The ideas that these characters face are tied into some of the key-issues of our age. What is necessary to fight evil? What is a good course of action? Are humans actually ethical, or is morality an illusion, or simply incorrect? And, what price heroism? It is a film of our times and, although there have been numerous 'war on terror films', few of them have dealt with these questions as well.That's not to say that this film is preachy, or boring. It is completely engrossing. It is too long but that is a small price to pay when you consider what you're getting in return. The boredom never arrives for a number of reasons. Chief among these is Ledger's performance. It is a quite extraordinary piece of acting. The chilling role of The Joker is brought to life, complete with numerous ticks, a dense psychology and a voice that could cut through iron. Ledger doesn't just dominate the movie with the enigmatic and entrancing villain, but drives it. He is always present in the mind especially when he is off the screen.But the brilliance of the Ledger performance should not blind people to the other actors' excellence. Aaron Eckhart is superb as Harvey Dent. If The Joker is the malevolent driving force of the film, then Dent is the personification of its soul and Eckhart lives up to this billing. Christian Bale has to deal with a slightly diminished role but is as good as always. Honourable mentions should also go to the ever excellent Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, whilst Gary Oldman is fantastic in the expanded role of Gordon. It is a terrific ensemble.Added to that, this is a film of consummate style. Nolan's writing, with brother Jonathan, is fantastic delivering numerous fantastic lines, a gripping plot and brilliantly mixing action and intelligence. Nolan's direction is spot on and, with the assistance of Wally Pfister's cinematography, the film is interesting to look at. The pair have moved the feel and aesthetic of the film from the gritty, dark Gotham of 'Begins' to a more central feel. Gotham has progressed from the first film and this story plays out in the places of power. The visual feel of the film supports this. Added to that, the design of every character is magnificent. The costume and make up complete the world and enhance the storytelling and Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score is exceptional.It is not perfect, but it is extremely impressive. Entertaining, clever and exciting, this is exceptional summer blockbuster film-making with a truly iconic performance and a magnificent vision realised. This is not a masterpiece (the plot goes out of control at some points and Batman could use some more screen time) but it is one of the films of the year and, without a doubt, a must-see. When the brilliant climax comes to an end, you should be left in your seat with your spine still tingling. It is, in a word, awesome.5 Stars out of 5",9,1,6,27 July 2008
Into the Wild," Dull, weightless and dreadfully earnest
","The tragic story of Christopher McCandless is given the ultra-worthy treatment by Sean Penn in this ultimately dull and weightless film that tells a potentially very good story very badly.The problems with the film are numerous. First off, there is no notion of quest as Penn decides to start the film off with the beginning of the end in Alaska, thus removing any potential suspense in McCandless' quest. Then, the film goes along at a glacial pace with very few events of interest to speak of. As it crawls on, the inter-cutting between the main story and the Alaska finale destroys the narrative and ultimately the story. This wouldn't matter if there were a point to the film.This proves to be elusive. Half of the film seems to be saying that nature's stunning and brilliant. Excellent, but I knew that before and why are you taking two hours and a half to tell me this. The rest of it is focused on the character of McCandless, who is here portrayed as being ludicrously idealistic, to the point of annoyance. He appears to be on a quest to discover truth and honesty and yet he has as his hero a 'great man' who is arrested by the FBI under serious criminal charges. The character's nature and story provides no empathy, pathos or message. There is a notion of identity that develops but it is heavily embedded in a lot of other material that makes the notion difficult to access. It isn't properly dealt with anyway.There are a few positives in this film. The soundtrack is nice to listen to, and it did a lot to escape the tedium of the rest of the film. There are a couple of excellent performances. Catherine Keener is the standout, whilst Emile Hirsch is impressive, though not a revelation, in the main role. There are also a couple of nice sequences, especially the one at the slabs, and the natural surroundings look stunning.The film is ultimately let down by its helmsman, Penn, who writes not so much a script as a collage, and directs the film in a manner that shows a lot of observation though little understanding of the nature of film-making (e.g. styles of shooting and editing are used neither to create effect or meaning but just for the sake of using them). It is also amateurish in places. He has McCandless, in a scene where he is talking to an apple, break the fourth wall for no reason. All that does is alert the audience to the presence of the camera. And, of course, being Penn he can't help but bring a large sociological undertone to the whole proceedings. It is a shame because the majority of people would agree with his politics but he ends up making such a song and dance about them that it feels like he's lecturing you. The prime example of this is the completely inexplicable insertion of a shot of George Bush Snr. announcing the first war on Iraq, which has no bearing on the plot.I hate to say it, but Penn has all the potential of becoming the Michael Moore of narrative cinema - a man who can make good points very badly and great stories very annoying. 'Into the Wild' is awfully earnest, directed badly to within an inch of its life and commits the worst crime in cinema by being dull. Unless you like that sort of thing, stay away from this.",5,5,11,21 December 2007
Pride & Prejudice," A Glorious, Beautiful, Simply Wonderful Film
","After last year's abysmal Bride and Prejudice, I halted, uncertain on the threshold of this film, the period retelling of Jane Austen's classic novel, nervous of a similar experience beginning to show itself, but I took the plunge. Within a short space of time my fears had vanished, and had turned into feelings of joy and ecstatic wonder at the beauty of this film.The film has almost breathtaking beauty. It is beautifully shot by Roman Osin who uses glorious countryside and wonderfully colour in the exteriors and captures the sumptuous design in the interiors. And what design! It is a wonderful period piece with ornate and beautiful things to behold, all of which are held within the bracket of authenticity.Credit must also be given to three others: Joe Wright for a stunning feature length directorial debut, Deborah Moggach for a superb adaptation of a novel that is sacred to millions and Dario Marianelli for his glorious subtle and splendid score. But above all, the thing that stands above all others is the superb ensemble.Keira Knightley is brilliant as Elizabeth Bennet, providing the first really great performance of a career that will, no doubt, be glittering. Matthew MacFadyen is also good as the, initially, proud and miserable Mr. Darcy, whilst Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland are fantastic as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, although Sutherland's accent is occasionally questionable. The rest of the cast is brilliant with a star turn from Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins.It is simply the best British film of the year so far and is set to be embraced by thousands young and old.",9,9,18,18 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The series is beginning to pick up
","It seems to me that each new Harry Potter film is greeted with the same enthusiasm and expectation. Will the films become better? Will the three central performances improve? However, the films seem to produce disappointment. But with the third instalment, things began to pick up under the charming direction of Alfonso Cuaron and now in the fourth instalment things are continuing down the same route.This instalment shows a wonderful improvement in the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Much of the credit for this must go to the script which provides the threesomes characters with events and themes which they will be experiencing at the moment, therefore making it easier for them to act. Furthermore, the supporting cast has strengthened. Michael Gambon is excellent in what is a pivotal performance for Dumbledore. Brendan Gleeson delivers a brilliant character performance as 'Mad-Eye' Moody whilst Ralph Fiennes is fantastic and memorable as Voldemort.Technically the film is dazzling. The visual effects are outstanding and fit in the beautifully shot world of Hogwarts. The music, which lost the care of the experienced and versatile John Williams for the most part, was brilliant even though it lost some of the continuity that was gained by this film.Mike Newell has made a superb effort at taking the helm of such a mammoth series. His British touch in the direction has actually given the film an air of the British public school that helps to inject a bizarre and obscure form of humour, which adds to genuinely witty script, provided by Steve Kloves who will not be adapting the next film but will be back for the Half-Blood Prince. It is a little too long, but it can be excused for this as there is so much material in the books to be squeezed in to the short time space provided.A very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and a film that shows much promise for the future, Goblet of Fire is entertaining, well-made and emotive.",8,0,0,20 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," Impressive but unsatisfying
","Paul Thomas Anderson's epic about oil and one man's struggle for riches and power has been greeted as a modern classic. Featuring an astonishing performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, numerous memorable sequences, magnificent photography and an incredible, iconic score, one can see that all of the ingredients are there. So, why is it that, having seen the film three times, it still doesn't seem to be a great film? The first viewing was bewildering. It was obvious that this is a hugely impressive film and one which should be seen. Day-Lewis is spectacular as Daniel Plainview and thoroughly deserved his second Oscar. Added to that, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson uses his epic canvas to full effect with stunning visuals. The film is too long, but quite engrossing and always seems to be able to draw out another fantastic sequence to keep your attention. Having said that, it was a somewhat baffling and distant experience.The word was that this film was a spectacular metaphor for America where the twin forces of religion and capitalism are shown to be in a terrible and destructive conflict. This seemed to be a simplistic and inaccurate interpretation. The problem with it is the central religious character, Eli Sunday, brilliantly played by Paul Dano, is not a decent representation of Christianity (the final scene certainly shows him to be a poor representation). Indeed, any kind of grand message didn't seem to be there.The second viewing presented an interesting character piece. It was an easier watch and, on a smaller screen, was still impressive. However, the film was still an enigma. It still seemed to have a lot and do little and still appeared to be a somewhat overrated film.The third viewing did provide the most complete experience. Day-Lewis's Plainview remained a mesmerising presence in the film and the brilliance of Paul Dano's performance had also become more apparent. The thrilling moments (the Derrick fire, Plainview's baptism and the final scene) were still thrilling. However, it still didn't quite work.Why not? Some of it may well be a matter of taste as I have little complaint with the film and have to admit that it is a really impressive piece of cinema but I still think there are problems with this film. It is very densely packed with themes, sub-plots and events. As such, some things seem superfluous. The relationship between Plainview and the adopted son, H.W., is important but underdeveloped. One never gets a decent look at H.W., whose actions become increasingly inexplicable and who, as a character, gets increasingly distant. As for Plainview, his feelings remain a mystery which is distracting rather than intriguing. This is symptomatic of the film as a whole. Anderson leaves a lot of loose ends and infuriating, unanswered questions.There is one further problem. The film is, mostly, about the power struggle between the oil man Plainview and the zealot Eli Sunday. Plainview has to win over the town where Sunday rules supreme. Not only does Sunday resent this, but he tries to exploit Plainview's venture, apparently, for his church's benefit. Plainview's pride and greed generates further friction. A lot of the conflict is between the characters but the town of Little Boston caught in the middle of this disappears from view through the film and this seems to be a misstep from Anderson. How is the town affected by the sweeping changes around it? What do the ordinary men and women make of the events around them? Paul Thomas Anderson has never been a conventional or easy director and that shines through in this film. Some have taken to this style but I find it to be unsatisfying. 'There Will Be Blood' is not a bad film. It is a very impressive piece of work and should be seen. The central performance demands to be seen. The problem is that with all of the elements there it shouldn't be the film it is. It should be a must-see, but it is rather less than the sum of its parts.4 Stars out of 5",8,1,3,3 January 2009
The Last King of Scotland," Thrilling and at times terrifying
","In short, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a magnificent film. Well written, acted, especially by Whitaker and McAvoy, and impressively directed the film is thrilling and at times terrifying. This film is worth seeing as an excellent piece of modern cinema though it does have some scenes that could only be described as upsetting. However it is an extremely intelligent piece and deserves far more examination than some simple sound bites.The horror of genocide certainly does not necessarily make great film. You have to be a pretty sick person to sit down, enjoy and engage with a film that is solely about genocide. Recently, man's inhumanity to man has been pushed into film in cruel and nasty motion pictures such as 'Hostel' and 'Captivity'. This is not entertainment. It is not art. It is vicious and unpleasant and recent events have displayed that violence and murder is not something that should be treated lightly. At the pinnacle of these acts is genocide and the great films that have been made about genocide have never relied solely on their horror to generate entertainment. 'Schindler's List' focuses on one man's fight to save hundreds of people from cruelty. 'The Pianist' tells the story of one man's struggle for survival and the good man who saves him. 'The Last King of Scotland' could very easily have been horrid and vile, particularly as it took its subject matter from one of the most horrendous events since the holocaust. However, like it's predecessors it chooses to focus on character and provides an intense examination of the psychology of Idi Amin. However, the stroke of genius in this film is to have another character, the fictional Dr Nicholas Garrigan, as the audience's eyes.Garrigan is not a moral man. He is an adulterer and self-centred. He is also extremely young and naïve. The audience's foreknowledge of Amin's crimes are suspended by Garrigan's enthusiasm and by the 'Gen-e-ral''s charm and charisma. It is a slow realisation of how deep Garrigan is, how blind and how terrifying and unstable Amin is. A question hangs over the film  was Amin always a maniac or was it something that was caused by the paranoia of leadership and the ongoing struggle for power? It is explored quire thoroughly and terrifyingly. Garrigan is a character that the audience cares about and so we feel his terror and his Faustian dilemma is one that we can understand. He is dismissed by other characters as evil  Amin's 'white monkey'  but he is a force for good in Amin's camp ultimately thus making it possible for us to sympathise. He has unknowingly done a deal with the devil and is paying the price.A lot of the credit must go to the writers and actors in this film. Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan do an excellent job at creating tension and interesting, intricate characters. It has hard to think of a recent thriller that has been this psychological and this effective. Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy compound the groundwork laid by the script with superb performances. Whitaker is brilliant and paints the picture of the terrifying, psychotic Amin excellently. However, McAvoy is a real revelation. In many ways he has a harder part and is charming enough and talented enough to pull it off. The film hangs together as a piece extremely well and the work of Kevin MacDonald as director cannot be ignored. He is an exciting director and should be watched extremely closely.",9,5,6,24 August 2007
American Gangster," Return to Form for Scott
","Ridley Scott has been a little off form recently. 'Kingdom of Heaven' was a disappointment and 'A Good Year' was very poorly received. He does remain one of the most prolific filmmakers working today and all you need do is look at his back catalogue and know there is faith that he can pull many more great films out of the hat. 'American Gangster' rewards this faith.For the most part, this is a very fine thriller. It's gripping, quick and, despite a long running time, never dull. It features two actors at the top of their game. Denzel Washington's performance is electric and Russell Crowe is brilliant. A fine supporting cast, especially Josh Brolin, fill out the rest of the film with aplomb and they all exist in a wholly convincing world that Scott creates. All in all then, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film. However, the film is lifted higher by a thoroughly interesting social commentary that plays out in the background.Washington's Frank Lucas is a fine cinematic character. He is a family man, a devoted husband and a mass murderer and a drug lord. Crowe's Richie Roberts is a good man, but a flawed man, whose integrity casts him out of the corrupt police department. Here, a murderer and mass criminal climbs to a privileged and wealthy place in society, mainly due to the ignorance and prejudice of that society, whilst a good man and dedicated public servant lives out a fairly squalid experience.Scott's critique of the most successful capitalist culture is directed with vigour. The feel is frenetic and the look is superb. The sixties and seventies are evoked perfectly and the audience is utterly gripped. But the social comment, told with the aid of interesting and intelligent editing, shines through. Ultimately, a lot of this is due to the central performances. The scene where the two finally meet is brilliant and you simply cannot tear your eyes away from it.This film has lasting appeal. It's entertaining and intelligent. The two sides, the thriller and the commentary, sit well with each other, though the latter is lost occasionally, and this film is anything but dull but the real joy is seeing a film made by two actors and a director pretty much at the peak of their careers. It has the makings of a classic and, just as Scott is entering into a busy period, this can only be seen as more reason for faith in his ability.",9,1,3,8 February 2008
The Reader," Solidly made but overrated and disappointing
","The novel upon which 'The Reader' is based is a highly acclaimed and much loved piece, particularly in Germany. It deals with German national guilt about Nazism and it is a book which, by all accounts, is a clear, well-defined and gripping piece that has something to say and says it well. This makes it all the more surprising that the film adaptation is so confused.It is not just a confused piece, but a disappointing one as well, particularly as it is solidly made. It is very well shot and beautifully scored and there isn't, technically, much wrong with it. It is also pretty well acted, though this is not one of Kate Winselt's finer performances and the Oscars have nominated her for the wrong film (when compared with far more interesting performance in 'Revolutionary Road'). There is a particularly strong turn from Bruno Ganz, as a Law professor.However, the film simply doesn't amount to anything. You never really care for the characters as you have no time to connect with them before they begin to have a wail of a time. The plot meanders, ponderously, through many years and becomes increasingly dull. And, through it all, you're never sure that the film knows what it wants to be.Is it a Holocaust drama? Not entirely. Is it about German war guilt? Not entirely. Is it about the triumph over illiteracy? Quite probably, as most of the film appears to be about this. There are elements of all of these, but as the two hours of well-put-together, decently-acted drama plays out, the film, as a whole, doesn't really develop. It is as solid as you would like it to be, but thoroughly, thoroughly disappointing.3 Stars out of 5",6,2,7,8 February 2009
The Wrestler," Rourke, Tomei and Aronofsky have crafted a must-see.
","Good acting requires good actors. Great acting requires great characters. A brief glance at any of cinemas greatest performances shows you that the quality of the character fuels the quality of the performance. Travis Bickle, Daniel Plainview, Lester Burnham and many others were all brilliantly brought to life, but there was something about them which was inherently attractive or intriguing which gripped the audience.So it is with Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, the beating heart of Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler'. This character is a brilliant piece of writing (hats off to the film's scribe, Robert D. Siegel). The first half hour is dedicated to his persona, 'The Ram'; a quiet and much loved man backstage who becomes a loud and showy beast in the ring. But, when the wrestling subsides, we discover Randy Robinson (aka Randy Ramsinski), a charming but lonely man who treats himself pretty badly and finds himself to be 'an old broken down piece of meat'.All sides of the eponymous character are brilliantly brought to life by Mickey Rourke, who creates a man who is sympathetic and engaging. He is also deeply flawed, as he craves and seeks a life outside of the ring but can only find happiness inside of it. Rourke's performance will make you love Randy, support him, cheer him on, but above all, come the end, you will be pleading with him, like all of the other characters around him, to stop.The towering presence in the middle of the film is ably supported by Marisa Tomei. Tomei, as the stripper 'Cassidy', who has the closest relationship with Randy of anyone in the whole film, is at her very best here. With this film being Rourke's 'comeback', she could have ended up being ignored, but she more than holds her own and doesn't quite let Rourke run off with the film.Another 'comeback', of sorts, is from Darren Aronofsky. The failure of 'The Fountain' will be all but forgotten after this solid piece of work which slowly builds up the tension and emotion and becomes a really gripping and enthralling film. He doesn't shy away from the violence and pain of the wrestling (yes it's fixed, but the people really do get hurt) but at no point do you feel that you're being asked to enjoy it, but the film's best moments are the quieter ones.The end is a spine-tingling, ambiguous, final blast which will leave you thrilled. The melancholy of the final moments is a result of the fine craftsmanship of Siegel, Aronofsky, Tomei and Rourke. This is a film driven by character and emotion and, although you may feel that you've seen this story before at points, this is more than a simple drama. This is a brilliant, surprising, gripping and beautifully executed story.",9,2,2,18 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," At last, Lucas pulls one out of the hat
","And so, after all the hype and two flatulent films, George Lucas had one chance to gain relief from the hounds on his back. After watching his final effort, only one word sprung to mind, redemption. For the first time Lucas has managed to get a compelling plot. Even though we now what has to happen, Lucas' how and why is actually interesting. However, the dialogue is appalling, but more of that later. Lucas' direction is also much improved. He has created a complete world and manages to get away with the highly political opening in a way that he didn't even get close to in his previous two efforts. He manages to carry a very heavy and filled storyline very well and he has reached new heights of technical achievement. But, above all, he has actually created sequences that are highly emotive, moving and wondrous pieces of cinema. These are mainly in three places. Firstly, the murder of all of the Jedi throughout the galaxy is superbly well done. Secondly, the inter-cutting of Yoda's duel with the Emperor and the fabled duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan is fantastically well made. Finally, the inter-cutting of the creation of Darth Vader, suit and all, and the birthing of Luke and Leia and the imminent death of their mother is beautiful. But it is mostly the tying up of the loose ends that gives this films its charm. But, these sequences wouldn't be half as effective if was not for John Williams' superb score, David Tattersall's awe-inspiring cinematography and ILM's spectacular special effects. However, there are pieces in the film when the editing is hard to follow, but apart from this minor slip-up, the films beautiful feel and look is unquestionably a wondrous technical achievement. Even the acting is improved. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are all markedly improved, especially McGregor whose performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi is nearing brilliance, but unfortunately it remains sadly short of Alec Guiness. Ian McDiarmid is wonderful in his slightly eccentric performance of his crucial character, whilst the supporting cast is brilliant, in particular Jimmy Smits. However not even James Earl Jones, in his fleeting appearance as Darth Vader, could deal with the woeful dialogue, at times. Words such as 'Younglings' make far too much of an appearance and the final 'Nooooooooo!' of the series almost destroys the scene it is in. For the disillusioned, this film could save their faith in the series. It is the darkest of the six and possibly my second favourite, and it is pulled of with great panache and style.",8,1,5,22 May 2005
The Lion King," An absolute classic
","This was Disney's B-movie production. The studio was convinced that the following year's 'Pocahontas' was going to rake in the cash and the praise. However, armed with a story lifted from 'Hamlet' and some of the all-time great Disney songs, 'The Lion King' became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.From the breathtaking opening, the power of the songs is immediately apparent. 'The Circle of Life' with the sun breaking across the plain is striking and iconic, for parent and child alike. The energy of 'I just can't wait to be king' is contrasted with the scheming moodiness of 'Be Prepared'. 'Hakuna Matata' is still adored and is delightfully witty (it has the most intelligent fart joke ever) and 'Can you feel the love tonight?' is up there with 'Beauty and the Beast' in the pantheon of great Disney love songs.The songs complement a story which is simple, effective and daring. Like many of the best Disney films, there is darkness here that the young viewer can deal with but gives the film added depth. The death of Mufasa can still bring the butchest teenager to tears. However, there is also a wealth of humour which ranges from intelligent and witty to absurd and hilarious ('What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?'). Also, this is a proper story. The trials of Simba are thoroughly engaging and the world he finds himself in is richly populated by entertaining characters. The stand outs are the comic Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons's deliciously voiced villain, Scar ('I'm surrounded by idiots.').The film is also a fine example of technical class. It looks stunning – one of Disney's most beautifully drawn films – has a fine score by Hans Zimmer to accompany the award winning songs and was a major step forward in CG effects – the thrilling stampede sequence being almost entirely created in computers.This was a generation defining film, far superior and far more successful than 'Pocahontas' (the VHS was the highest seller of all time). It was and is adored by millions. It has been somewhat forgotten, particularly after the advent of CG animation two years later with the magnificent 'Toy Story'. This film, however, deserves better as it is an undoubted classic to be enjoyed by young and old alike.",10,2,2,8 July 2009
Defiance," Not as good as it should be
","Edward Zwick is one of the good guys, as it were. His films have often been really brilliant and under-appreciated works. Of late, he has been on top form, producing the excellent 'Blood Diamond' and the exceptional 'The Last Samurai'. At the heart of both of these were interesting ideas, gripping stories and enthralling characters.With 'Defiance', Zwick seems to have struck gold. He has found an extraordinary story about the Bielski brothers who, during the Holocaust, not only managed to evade capture by the S.S. but established a community for fugitive Jews in the woods of Belorussia.It is a great and inspiring tale, and yet Zwick manages to make a bit of a dud film out of it. This is made stranger still when you consider that he has three excellent central performances and a fine supporting cast who all prove to be very watchable, on top of a story which sounds like an absolute cracker. Appearances, of course, can be deceptive.To deal with the positives, this is a very well performed piece. Daniel Craig may be the lead but, despite another fine turn from Craig, this is Liev Schreiber's film. The latter's character is the more interesting of the two  a brooding and angry man who struggles to control himself. Craig's character struggles to control others, but disappoints later on as he goes from being an interesting man through most of the film into a fairly dull hero by the end. There is also an impressive performance from Jamie Bell who has matured into a fine actor and manages to make the most of his screen time here.So, why doesn't it quite work? Despite doing a perfectly solid job in most areas, Zwick has fallen in love with his story a bit too much. The film simply lacks a bit of thrust. There are moments of interest but a lot of the over two hours of film is people sitting around in woods. This extraordinary piece of history needed more honing to become the superb piece of film that it could have been. There simply isn't anything of the brothers before the war and their characters lack some emotional depth. It is an example of film which never quite lives up to its potential.This is perfectly solid and has many positives, but strangely for an Ed Zwick film, the entertainment factor is quite low here. A great story this is, but it just doesn't quite make the sort of film that it perhaps should.3 Stars out of 5",6,4,10,11 January 2009
WALL·E," A film to introduce a new generation to the magic of cinema
","Children's cinema is underestimated. It is perhaps the most difficult genre to pull off well. You have to be entertaining to young children and to parents as well and you must hold the former's attention for well over an hour  a very tricky thing to do. And yet, despite the many challenges that face the filmmakers in this genre, Pixar's animations clear the bar every time, and many of them clear it, raise it and then clear it again.But, Pixar do not just make good children's films. They very often make bold ones which don't condescend to the younger audience ('Ratatouille' is a prime example) and, every once in a while, they make great children's films that tick all of the boxes and bring the magic of cinema home to their audience and start millions of new relationships with the wonder of the silver screen. 'WALLE' is one of these films.Many thought that 'Ratatouille' was about as bold as you could get with a children's film. The idea of a film about rats and cooking in France struck many as too high-brow and not interesting enough for a young audience. Those who were unconvinced by 'Ratatouille' must have shuddered at the pitch for 'WALLE'. The first fifteen minutes have only two characters, namely a cockroach and the eponymous robot, who share little communication and no dialogue, naturally. It is forty minutes before any human contact is made and there is a large subtext of environmentalism, anti-consumerism and anti-corporationism (somewhat ironically showcased in a film from Disney, a corporation whose very existence is based on consumerism). This is hardly the easy fun of 'The Jungle Book', for instance. And yet it works, and it works brilliantly.There are many reasons for the movie's success. Firstly, the direction of Andrew Stanton is key to the film's excellence. He is, on the basis of this film alone, a visionary. It is clear in the character of WALLE, a creation of staggering brilliance, that this is a man of rare and great talent. How something so inanimate as the central robot can be designed to express so many emotions and thoughts is mind-boggling. But the central character is merely the crowning glory of a film which is extraordinarily well designed, firstly in a bleak post-apocalyptic earth and then in the sleek space ship. Every shot is beautiful and every character is perfectly created. The sound design completes the film's world with gusto and endless credit must be given to Ben Burtt whose work on character sounds in this film must at least equal his great work on the 'Star Wars' films.The film is also very funny. Most of this is silent-movie-like, with WALLE's actions making him like Keaton or Chaplin or, from the talkie era, Laurel and Hardy. There are the almost compulsory film references. 'Silent Running' looms large thematically, but for laughs '2001' rules supreme. Humour is only one of this film's strength but it makes it all the more enjoyable but there is balance and it is encouraging to see a family film with a good dose of darkness in it. The loneliness in the opening is not without this (shots of other, 'dead' WALLEs are brought in early) and there are many other low-moments in the film. It is sufficed to say that the film has a happy ending, although it flirts with a downbeat one. From an adult perspective it might be better if that was pursued, but this is after all a kid's film and even a pro-darkness in kids' films advocate, such as I, thinks that amount of darkness to be too much.The darkness is not overwhelming and the prominent sense one has upon leaving the cinema is one of magic. The first sequence in space is an absolute joy, as is a dancing sequence. The spine tingles at many points in the film, due to a combination of the film's emotional weight, its spectacular visuals and the brilliance of Thomas Newman's score. It is this overriding sense of wonder that makes the film a must-see.This is not Pixar's best (which is hardly a criticism really) but it is a great film of its type. Magical, ingenious, at times awesome and always spectacular, this film is a joy and an instant classic to be enjoyed for generations to come. Once again, the bold and visionary Pixar brand has cleared the bar by quite some distance.N.B. The traditional short which runs before the film, 'Presto', is wonderful, amusing and another delight to behold.",9,1,3,14 August 2008
Iron Man," Entertaining origin story which bodes well for franchise
","Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' fundamentally changed the superhero genre and became a gold standard. What it delivered was an often dark character piece with action to match and it was a blockbuster that art-house filmgoers could enjoy. When he came to direct 'Iron Man', Jon Favreau had Nolan on his mind and has cited that film as a key inspiration. Favreau has not matched Nolan's achievement, but he has delivered a terrific piece of entertainment, which is not without depth and is superbly cast and well made.The central character of Tony Stark has to work if this film is to be at all successful, and he does, thanks to a snappy script and an absolutely excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. Stark is similar to James Bond in one respect. You're happy to admire him as smooth and suave on screen, but know that, if he were an actual acquaintance of yours, you would probably loathe him. Despite his gambling, womanising, smug playboy nature, Stark is likable because Downey Jr. makes him unbelievably charming, funny and engaging. Added to this, Stark's character has an arc. Its progression doesn't span the whole film, and it isn't particularly original, but it does provide a point of connection with the character which makes Stark, and indeed Iron Man, a success.The pitch-perfect casting doesn't end there. Gwyneth Paltrow is far less annoying than she could have been and does make the ludicrously named Pepper Potts sympathetic. Terence Howard does a decent job with little to work with (his role is a place-holder for the inevitable sequel). However, the real star of the supporting cast is the ever-excellent Jeff Bridges, whose former-mentor Obadiah Stane is a treat to watch whenever his inversely-haired visage is on screen.The action is done very well. ILM's special effects are flawless and Favreau has a grip on the sequences which are thrilling and entertaining. The final sequence misses the mark a little but still has its moments. The rest of the film is humorous, entertaining and not a minute too long, which suggests that more time could have been spent on character.All-in-all, this film is a decent and entertaining set-up for what could be an interesting franchise. With this cast and the apparently safe hands behind the camera, we should be in for more superb entertainment in the inevitable sequel.4 Stars out of 5",8,2,2,16 November 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A delight
","Woody Allen's latest film is a return to comedy, after recent wanders into darker territory. It cannot be said to be a crushing, comic examination of humanity's madness in matters of love, but it is a subtle, clever and highly entertaining piece of humorous cinema which hits the spot quite expertly.The theme of the film, as it is with so many of Allen's films, is love and what the heart really wants. It is, however, incredibly light-hearted about it and swings through the brief running time with ease. Vicky, an engaged girl with safe and definite views on love, and her friend Cristina, who is much more given to passions, no matter how fleeting, have their worldviews challenged by their respective relationships with local artist, Juan Antonio, who embodies the passion that Cristina likes and the Catalan philosophy and lifestyle which Vicky adores.The story is quietly involving, as the characters are entertaining, well defined and beautifully played. Rebecca Hall continues to impress with a really beautifully executed performance here, which is as wonderfully understated as the rest of the film. Scarlett Johansson delivers a performance which draws on the talent which she has shown before now, but still doesn't quite live up to the promise that she gave us in 'Lost in Translation'. Javier Bardem is, once again, magnificent to watch as he oozes charm through the course of the film. And who could forget Penelope Cruz, whose controlled madness is fuelled into the ideal form of Juan Antonio's insane former wife Maria Elena? The actors have got a good script to work with here, as Woody Allen delivers a piece of writing which is delightfully restrained, constantly amusing and, at points, devilishly funny. There are numerous lines and moments which could be quoted, but that would spoil them.As a result of all this expert craftsmanship, Allen leaves his audience with a little gem of a film, which is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is a wonderful way to pass an hour and a half.",8,1,3,22 February 2009
Beowulf," Robert wants to show you his new toys
","Robert Zemeckis has a new toy. Two new toys, actually. After fiddling with cartoons and archive footage in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Forrest Gump' respectively, he's now using motion capture digital technology rather than film. But he's done it before so this time he's going to use it with 3D. Unfortunately, I watched this at home. So the film is left to stand on its actual merits, rather than its gimmicks.That's a shame really, because watching the film I could sense that in full IMAX 3D this would have been bangs-for-your-bucks, jump out of your seat fun. Whenever he has the opportunity to, Zemeckis throws things at the camera and moves it in such an incredibly fluid manner that on a really, really big screen it would thrill. Unfortunately, all I was left with was the narrative.The film's problems start early on. The opening is garish and, without the benefit of the 3D, overblown. It sets the tone for the rest of the film rather well. The characters chew their way through the dialogue before the first attack from Grendel, which has so much violence that it puts Tarantino in the shade. It is a miracle that this film, with all of its blood and guts, not to mention essentially full on nudity, received a PG-13 in America and a 12A (it's British equivalent). Don't let anyone younger than 12 see this film.It is a full quarter of an hour before Beowulf arrives. He receives extremely little time for development, which is the same for all of the characters, but this film isn't really here for that. It's a cheap thrills picture, and Zemeckis delivers them by the barrelful. But, many of them, whilst grand on scale, have something wrong with them. Beowulf's first fight, for instance, is done as an Austin Powers gag, with the nude Beowulf's manhood being covered with helmets, spears and swords. What would Freud say? There are strong points. Winstone, in his CGI form, is very good as the lead, Angelina Jolie turns up as Angelina Jolie and does very well, whilst Sir An-TH-ony Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself a lot. However, the quality of the CGI is astonishing. There are a few things that look dodgy, such as the horses and the fire, but at times it is photo-real even if the artistry of the animation and the creation of the images are nowhere near those of 'Ratatouille' which was released in the same year.However, there are weak points, most of all John Malkovich, who is so wooden that he is largely indistinguishable from the large cross he waves around. But the real problem with the film is that it isn't really a film. It is a bunch of gimmicks, designed to thrill rather than entertain, and now that it has passed away from the 3D screens it will not last.",6,0,0,14 April 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Cinematic Triumph and One of the Greatest Ever Made
","If anyone thought that Peter Jackson had 'bought it' with 'Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' then I would like to hear what they will say about 'Return of the King'. The film is nothing short of a triumph. From its intense, frightening and personal beginning, through the awe-inspiring Battle of Pelennor Fields right to its melancholic ending the film is a feat of cinematic skill and technique.Once again Jackson maintains a long film without losing the audience. His editing of battle sequences remains superb and all of the various elements that contribute to the film make it the a truly great film.The visual effects, which are out in broad daylight with no where to run in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, are spectacular and remain unequaled, even by films such as the Matrix (the original, not the shoddy sequels).Andrew Lesnie's cinematography remains flawless. He incorporates huge epic shots that daze the eyes and intense personal ones with great skill.The acting remains very strong. Sir Ian McKellen is once again superb particularly in a wonderful scene with Pippin during the Siege of Minas Tirith. Bernard Hill's performance is brilliant, building on his performance as Theoden in The Two Towers with an extremely well constructed performance. Elijah Wood's performance is fantastic and he is supported well by Sean Astin and Andy Serkis, whose Gollum is once again fantastically animated and remains a real technical achievement. The rest of the cast's performances are superb, right across the board, but in particular Viggo Mortensen who deals with a difficult character well.10/10 for a wonderful cinematic achievement.",10,4,9,14 December 2004
Slumdog Millionaire," 'The truth alone triumphs': Danny Boyle's latest is a joy to behold
","Danny Boyle's latest film, 'Slumdog Millionaire', is hardly an obvious candidate for mainstream success. It is set in the slums of Mumbai, has scenes of torture and violence and is in Hindi for a third of the film. However, it has been nominated for a mountain of awards, is riding high in internet rankings and is doing well at the box office. When one takes a closer look, it isn't surprising that this film is doing as well as it is. It is a gripping, entertaining and ultimately wonderful piece of cinema.The story, which is about a young man who goes on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?', is utterly simple. He has, unbelievably, reached the final question. He is arrested between broadcasts on suspicion of cheating his way to the top. However, the fact of the matter is that he just happens to know every answer. As he explains why, his tough and unforgiving past opens up, raising questions about why he's on the show in the first place.This film works because of the flashbacks which tell the story of a boy, his brother and a girl. It is not always an easy watch but moments of nastiness are rare, necessary and short-lived. As the story develops, Boyle's brilliance as a filmmaker pours off the screen. The raw, kinetic energy that he used to the maximum effect in 'Trainspotting' is always apparent. The numerous sequences set in the slums are mesmerising to watch, accompanied by a magnificent score by A.R. Rahman, and vibrant photography from Anthony Dod Mantle.Boyle also makes sure that this film is more than a 'nuts-and-bolts' feel good story. The central romance is beautifully done and all of his characters are brilliantly sketched and excellently well performed. Dev Patel (in the lead) is a magnificent screen presence and really impresses in his film debut, whilst the supporting performances of Anil Kapoor as the host of the show and Irrfan Khan as the sceptical police inspector are superb. Boyle has also managed to find some brilliant child actors who inject the film with yet more energy.Boyle also has a lot going on underneath. Like many great films, the location lives and breathes in the film. Mumbai, mirroring our characters, transforms through the film (for the better and for the worse). There is also a great deal about truth and integrity, neatly summed up in one of the answers. What is India's national motto? The truth alone triumphs.Although there is a slight drop in pace in the film about an hour in, this is really gripping, really entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable cinema. Despite the darker moments, this is a feel good movie which, in the present climate, will be taken to people's hearts. The real joy is that this good natured and excellent film deserves every piece of success it receives.5 Stars out of 5",9,1,3,9 January 2009
Gladiator," Breathtaking, entertaining and brilliant
","Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled 'Thumbs down', which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome – an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in 'Blade Runner' and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics ('Troy', 'Alexander', '300'), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.",10,5,7,9 July 2009
Valkyrie," Not a bad film, but a disappointment
","It is no secret to anyone with a passing knowledge of 20th century history that Hitler did not die on the 20th July 1944, and so the suspense of Bryan Singer's new thriller about the assassination plot which failed on that date seems to be irreversibly compromised.It is strange therefore to report that there is some tension through the film, even though the ending is never in doubt. However, it is still a failure. There is a feeling with this film, much like Ed Zwick's 'Defiance', that it should be better than it is  that this story merits a better film than the one it has ended up with.That is not to say that this is a bad film. The quality of the film-making is excellent throughout and there is little to complain about. It looks good, sounds good and is generally well put together. A lot has been made of the lack of continuity with the accents but, despite the fact there are occasional slips into German twangs from some, there is no distraction in the diversity and it is far less irritating than the thick accents which have become the norm in many films.The acting is very good. A number of liberties have been taken with the characters to make them heroic (von Stauffenberg, for instance, was in fact a raging anti-Semite), but there are still interesting figures here. Cruise's von Stauffenberg quickly becomes a fairly dull, generic hero (the fault of the writing and not the acting), but the outstanding supporting cast, which includes Ken Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Christian Berkel and Thomas Kretschmann, always make the film watchable. There is a particularly impressive performance from Bill Nighy, whose General Olbricht is probably the most interesting character in the film.But the film never rises above the realms of simple, solid entertainment. It is by no means a dull two hours. In fact, the time flies by, but this never becomes truly thrilling. Perhaps it would have been better to have created more interest in the peripheral characters rather than the dull von Stauffenberg. One feels that there would have been more tension if you cared a bit more about the characters.3 Stars out of 5",7,4,7,26 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Entertaining, but it could have been so much more
","Matt Groening's phenomenally successful cartoon creation comes to the big screen with plenty of laughs accompanying it. However, the transfer from television to film is not carried off well. The film seems to be caught between being three very funny episodes of the show and being a down-to-earth-dysfunctional-family film. The result is an unstructured, messy narrative, but an extremely funny film.As always, the visual style of the cartoons looks brilliant and this truly jumps from small to big screen with aplomb. The voice performances are, as always, superb. However, the plot, such as it is, is not the driving force of the film. It is either servant to the jokes or the environmental parable. This could work for 21-minutes, as it does in the film, but after an hour and a half you're left quite entertained though slightly disappointed.For fans of the show, then, this is a treat of sorts. The writing is better here than it has been on the show for some years and that will appeal to all, though for those who are not Simpsons-literate, the film will ultimately leave you entertained if unsatisfied.",7,0,1,10 December 2007
The Fighter," The high quality of the acting belies The Fighter's ordinariness
","[3 Stars] 'The Fighter' arrived on these shores adorned with nominations and plaudits aplenty. Some went so far as to say that the film was 'the best boxing film since Rocky', Esquire magazine having apparently missed 'Raging Bull' altogether. It is a shame, therefore, that the actual film should be so thoroughly ordinary.It is not a bad film at all. It is solid, pretty watchable, pretty interesting fare. The true story of Micky Ward's rise in boxing is one of those stories which sport throws up that seems born for Hollywood. But, Hollywood this is. The film is clichéd and predictable. It says very little but portrays a story of hard circumstances overcome in a manner which is more populist than the film's box office would suggest, the film's harder side counting against it there.It is however nothing extraordinary. David O. Russell certainly brings an ounce of originality with the frenetic style of the film – fast moving cameras, numerous cuts, characters jabbering over each other on and off screen – but none of this makes the film more gripping or appears to serve any real purpose. It jogs along following the expected path – solid, good, occasionally funny, and unremarkable. The victories do not seem to matter as much as they should. The trials and lows of the film are not very affecting. Nothing stands out.That is with the exception of the acting, which is fantastic. Christian Bale has received all of the nominations for his bold and flashy performance as Micky Ward's crack-addict brother, Dicky Ecklund, and rightly so. After the disappointment of his dull turn in 'Public Enemies', this is Bale back on form. However, as he acknowledged when accepting his Golden Globe, he wouldn't have got away with it without the sterling work from Mark Wahlberg, whose understated central turn is lead-acting at its best. He is always interesting, always gripping and gives the film its drive. He makes it watchable.In the supporting roles, there is seemingly a great battle going on between Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for the supporting actress gongs this year, and rightly so. Adams continues to establish herself as an extremely versatile and effective young actress with a great future ahead of her. However, it is Leo who should triumph for her barnstorming performance of the battle-axe mother of the two brothers. She is absolutely brutal on screen and entertaining. Though her character as written is slightly monotonous, she manages to disguise this very adroitly.However, the film leaves its audience impressed by the quality of the acting but unimpressed by the film as a whole. Frankly, there are better ways to spend seven or eight pounds. Get 'Raging Bull' out on DVD, or organise a whip-round so that Esquire can watch 'Raging Bull'. As for 'The Fighter', it shall dimly fade, but the performances will remain as fine examples of the actor's craft.",6,5,7,9 February 2011
Atonement," Breathtaking, heartbreaking, but flawed
","Ian McEwen's brilliant novel is one of the most popular of recent years. Ever since it was published in 2001 it seemed as if it was destined for the screen. However, there are undoubted problems with adapting it for cinema. The structure is anything but cinematic and there are so many perspectives that the novel is written from that adapting it successfully seemed impossible. This is nowhere near as detailed or as electric as the novel, but that would be impossible. This is a successful adaptation of a difficult novel that is filled with invention, quality and is genuinely beautiful.The starting point with any film is the script and Christopher Hampton's script can only be described as tough. It does a very hard job quite well. It is interesting, genuinely well written but he fails to do justice to the novel. The latter part doesn't matter, as each adaptation deserves to be taken on its own merits, but it doesn't manage to be quick enough at points and the film chooses to centre on the romance more than the real central character, Briony. As such, she suffers a bit.However, Joe Wright must be commended for his fine work on this film. He lifts the film from what the script is and introduces a lavish visual style to every frame, genuinely interesting directorial touches and, whilst this film is by no means perfect, he shows great potential. He evokes the heat of the English summer, the passion of the central relationship and the horror of the Second World War with apparent ease. The result is a film that is genuinely heartbreaking and breathtaking.The film is assisted by a supremely good ensemble. James McAvoy is the standout. He is spectacular as Robbie Turner and takes the weight of this film on his shoulders and carries it off superbly. The lack of awards consideration he's received is scandalous. Keira Knightley delivers her best performance to date, but is still somewhat outshone here. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant, as is Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, all in the role of Briony.The visual style is near perfect. The cinematography is stunning, as is the costume, the production design and the make-up. However, the score is quite astounding. Dario Marianelli produces some ingenious music that incorporates the strangely lyrical sound of the typewriter with a superb orchestral score and emotive piano solos.All of these elements contribute to an excellent film. It is also helped by some quite extraordinary sequences, most notably the four and a half minute long tracking shot of the beaches on Dunkirk that shows the horror of that retreat and is breathtaking, but there are four or five of these moments. It is a flawed film, but it is a fine one. A film that doesn't have to be seen, but should be seen. Wright shows himself to be a promising director and McAvoy appears to be a tremendous actor. But, ultimately, this film shows the visual power of cinema and its potential, even if this is not a perfect example of it.",9,1,1,8 February 2008
