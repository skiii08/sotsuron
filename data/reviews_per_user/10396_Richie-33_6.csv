Vertigo," Not his best by far
","For the most part, this suspense thriller from Hitchcock the master of the genre, seems a fairly run-of-the-mill affair. However, thanks to the usual directorial touches and a fascinating final act, along with some top notch performances most notably from James Stewart, it manages to lift itself above first impressions.The story concerns Stewart's retired police officer being hired by old college friend to tail his wife (the quite wonderful Kim Novak), whom he claims has been possessed by her grandmother. As he becomes involved in this mystifying scenario, Stewart finds himself falling in love with his quarry and elects to try and help solve her paranormal problems. The film really comes into it's own in the last half hour or so, which is hard to describe without revealing too much, but gives a fascinating portrayal of a desperate man and the hurt that can come of a doomed relationship.I wasn't too happy with the ending (surely nun's aren't that scary?) but all in all this has a dark psychological edge which could have been explored further and makes for an interesting watch. Plus now I know the film playing in the cinema in 'Twelve Monkeys'.",Null,0,1,18 January 2001
Meet the Parents," Right, that's it, the wedding's off
","This highly enjoyable comedy is based on a simple premise that we can all easily relate too, the first efforts of someone to introduce their partner to the prospective in-laws. Even if you haven't had this problem directly, it's easy to empathise, and surely everyone has been in the awkward situation of being a guest in someone's house and being petrified of putting a foot wrong. There is plenty of scope for humour with this situation and there are also several great set pieces as the weekend takes a turn for the disastrous. Even when they seem fairly predictable, each one hits home and gives a great payoff.Ben Stiller plays pretty much the same kind of role here as he did in 'There's Something About Mary', but that's no problem as his everyman likeability means you root for him throughout his tribulations. As Greg Fokker, he is desperate to impress his girlfriend's dad with a view to asking him for his blessing for her hand in marriage. Robert De Niro is great as the father who is not everything he first seems, and shows a knack for comic timing which you wouldn't expect of such a heavyweight actor.Even if the ending is slightly contrived, it's great fun getting there with laughs aplenty. One for those who can reminisce and those who will be filled with dread anticipation alike.",Null,0,0,18 January 2001
Memento," Excuse me, who are you?
","It's really not a question of whether you should see this film, rather when you should. It's obviously not an actionfest, however neither is it a mildly engaging thriller with a good plot and an unexpected twist. This is a film that requires the utmost concentration throughout to keep up with exactly what's going on - it's not a rollercoaster that threatens to throw you with sharp turns and dizzying sights, more of an endurance test which you struggle to keep a grip of for it's near two hour running time.The films concerns an ex-insurance investigator, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce, who gives a remarkable performance and is almost matched by the other cast members), who has lost the ability to form new memories since he was attacked while his house was broken into. The same incident left his wife raped and murdered and now his only purpose for living is to exact vengeance on the person who ruined his life. We follow his endeavours in trying to find this man and also to try and not have his condition taken advantage of by the various manipulative characters who know him.The reason for Memento making you feel like your grey matter is being stretched like the fabric of Lara Croft's t-shirt is not just because it is a meticulously constructed plot packed with twists, but because you have to negotiate the storyline backwards, reflecting Leonard's inability to remember what had previously occurred. Only the opening scene runs literally in reverse, however the sequence of scenes is rearranged so you know the end of the story from the start (bear with me here, please) but not until the final line are you able to say you can truly see the full picture.Once this narrative structure is adopted writer/director Christopher Nolan is more or less committed to it, although there are some interspersed scenes in black and white that break the framework but are vital in revealing clues or sometimes providing further complexity. When these 'flashbacks' (although essentially the entire film is composed of flashbacks) become one of Leonard's facts to remember each day, due to him taking a polaroid of the incident, the film subtly transfers back to colour. This format, combined with a sparse soundtrack and relentless  reassesment of each characters motives, makes Memento a wearing but ultimately rewarding experience; the only moments of levity are some laugh out loud moments due to Leonard's condition, or rare dramatic irony which we are denied for most of the film. However, even these are offset by the tragic story of Sammy, a man with a similar condition, that runs alongside the main events and is uncomfortable viewing. Make sure you've got your thinking cap on when you watch this film, anyone wearing their dunce's cap will quickly get lost and be denied a great challenge.",Null,0,1,18 January 2001
Fargo," I'm not gonna debate you...
","This darkly comic tale from the Coen brothers is arguably their finest piece of work to date. They apply their trademark quirky style to the not entirely original plot of a car salesman who arranges his own wife's kidnapping in order to get the ransom money from his scrooge-like father-in-law. However, the simplicity of the plot allows you to concentrate on the most important part of the film, the carefully crafted characters, each with their own idoesyncrasies that make it a delight to see which strange creation will appear in the next scene.These are perfectly realised by a fantastic cast of actors. While credit must go to the ever-dependable Steve Buscemi as the bungling kidnapper and William H. Macy as the salesman full of frustration and impotent rage, the best performance is by Frances McDormand, who deservedly won an Oscar as the heavily pregnant sheriff trying to solve the crime. The only main female character in the film, she is surrounded by a succession of increasingly more pathetic men, from her househusband, to an old school friend who still lives with his parents. Even the crime itself lurches from one disaster to another as events conspire to make a seemingly straightforward kidnapping escalate into a multiple homicide. The unfamiliar location of Dakota provides some great backdrops and spectacularly barren vistas and the snow somehow adds to the absurdity of the whole situation. Also adding to the comedy element are the unusual local accents which are seemlessly adopted by the cast and if you don't find yourself mimicking a Minnesotan for a few days after seeing 'Fargo' then you really ought to visit a doctor to see about getting that funny bone removed, it's obviously not working right.",Null,0,0,18 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Gosh, golly and quite possibly wow
","Forgive me this moment of supposition but I think I may have just seen the film of the year. I know it's only January but this epic fantasy makes such an impression that it will take something truly special to challenge it. Taiwanese director Ang Lee says this was the film that he always wanted to make and after much critical acclaim for his recent Western character-driven pieces he has finally been able to realise that dream. The current fad in Hollywood is martial arts fight scenes and it seems that every action hero, and indeed villain, must be capable of   chop-sockying their way out of a tight spot. So it's great to see kung fu in it's natural environment, a romantic myth of love and honour in ancient China. These kind of stories are churned out at a frightening pace by the far-Eastern film industry, but Lee was able to assemble some of the biggest Asian film stars and a most experienced crew and combine them with his knack for drawing out well-rounded characters and picking great locations to produce something truly special.The main story follows two warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and their search to retrieve the famous Green Destiny sword after it is stolen by a mysterious intruder. Yeoh and Yun-Fat return to their old stomping grounds after attempting to make an impact in America and it's clear why they are two hottest properties in Eastern cinema. They show that while they are both known as action stars they are more than able to handle the sideplot of struggling with their unspoken feelings for each another. However, I get the feeling that the only reason they are credited above Ziyi Zhang ('The Road Home') is due to their crowd pulling reputation, as the young Chinese actress is absolutely riveting as Jen, the headstrong aristocrat who the experienced warriors try to tame and who rapidly becomes the films central character. If 'The Road Home' proved that rising star Zhang can act then CT,HD shows that she can kick arse at the same time and really is one to watch.The kung fu itself is beautifully choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, he who stunned Hollywood with 'The Matrix' fights and although the wire work may not be realistic it is part for the course in this genre and employed to great effect. The duels scorch across the screen so that after each confrontation you find yourself scrabbling around on the cinema floor to try and retrieve your jaw. But CT,HD is made so much more than a succession of well-executed fisticuffs by the tale which holds it all together, conjuring up some really tearful, emotional moments.It's a foregone conclusion that CT,HD will win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, but I would be surprised if it hasn't staked an outright claim for Best Picture too.",Null,0,0,18 January 2001
Any Given Sunday," You should try rugby, lads.
","So American Football eh? A nancy's version of rugby replete with body armour and lax rules about forward passes or a game of tactics and skill played by honed athletes? Whatever your opinion on the game, you will be able to enjoy Oliver Stone's homage to that strange American 'sport'. This is mainly due to the blistering match sequences, which are the most realistic of any sports film with shaky cameras and frame jumping creating a truly kinetic feeling of action and bringing home the impact of the crunching tackles thrown by these human breeze blocks. Stone also evokes the testosterone-fuelled atmosphere of the front line with savage growls laid over the sound and cutting in of images to realise the aggression.However, these same techniques are totally inappropriate in the more dramatic scenes but Stone insists on employing them, erasing any tension that may have been established previously. Unfortunately this undoes a lot of the actors' good work, we all know Al Pacino can rage without him having to be symbolised with lightning strikes and feral snarls. The cast performs well though; I don't think anyone would doubt Pacino's suitability for playing the beleagured coach, so the real impression is made by comedian Jamie Foxx as the upstart quarterback with the talent to lift the team to greatness but an attitude which could instead bring it to it's knees. Cameron Diaz is okay in a role which was far from made for her but, like the rest of the female characters, is little more than a money grabbing bitch.The main story is the obligatory one for any sports movie, with a team struggling to overcome their difficulties and win a tournament - at least with American Football it can't go to penalties. It's disappointing that no one could come up with an alternative to this, although in 'Any Given Sunday' there are at least a couple of sideplots in which to take interest. These could have been developed further, and perhaps originally were; surely James Woods and Matthew Modine as the warring physios warrant more screen time than they are given here. Perhaps it was their scenes which were left on the cutting room floor to accomodate Stone's visual excesses.",Null,0,0,18 January 2001
