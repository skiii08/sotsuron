Iron Man 3," Better than Iron Man 2 but the first is still tops.
","Story, story, story. You can't have a good movie without a good story and there's a pretty decent one in this sequel. Iron Man actually takes a back seat to Tony Stark who stays out of armor for at least 3/4 of the movie. I think it was fun seeing Stark run around kicking butt as himself and not his alter ego.However, the title of the movie is 'Iron Man 3', not 'Tony Stark, The Crime Fighter.' As much as I enjoyed seeing the Stark storyline, I have to admit that I left the theater a bit unsatisfied. I bought a ticket to see Iron Man, not Tony Stark, The Crime Fighter or War Machine.Iron Man is there but relegated to the battle at the end of the movie. It's a bit absurd how fragile the Iron Man (Men - plural, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't give it away) armor is. Iron Man can battle the Chitauri and their mightiest giant weapons but fall apart upon being struck by a few guys on fire.In summary, I liked the Stark storyline but feel it took away from the true focus, Iron Man. In my opinion, the scenes with Iron Man in them were weak and unsatisfying. More is not always better (also, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't give away what this means).",7,1,2,9 June 2013
Iron Man 2," A big let down compared to the first movie
","I loved the first Iron Man movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. It was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is most likely not telling the truth. The audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. With these points of reference in place, let's talk about Iron Man 2. In a nutshell, Slam, bam, thank you. What a departure from the original story. This time around, they focused on putting as much action in as possible and did as little story as possible. In fact, what little story there is insults the audience's intelligence. For example, Stark's Mark II armor is taken by Rhodey and they fight a battle to a stand still. First of all, Rhodey does not have an arc reactor chest piece. What is he using to power the suit? Second, Stark is wearing at least a Mark IV generation suit. Rhodey with a Mark II suit would have had no chance against it. Third, how did Rhodey get to be an expert using the suit? Fourth, how was a third party organization able to reverse engineer the suit so quickly and integrate other weapons?This crazy lack of logic is present throughout the story and really killed the movie for me. If you are looking for action, you will not be disappointed. The action comes on early and continues until the end. However, if you want a complete story such as with the original movie, you will probably be somewhat disappointed.",6,0,2,26 May 2013
World War Z," Misses the mark
","World War Z is a movie that has great potential but goes absolutely nowhere. The most glaring issue, this is a zombie movie without zombie action.What do people expect to see in zombie movies? Zombies attacking and munching on people. Instead, WWZ gives the audience zombies running around at Mach speed and cut scenes at what should be interesting points.Pitt's character is wooden and unsympathetic. Even as an anti-hero, I didn't buy into the character. It's clear that Pitt and his wife/family are very close but does the audience need to be constantly remind of this? The story makes very little sense with Pitt traveling across the globe in search of answers. What makes matters worse, very little of the data gathered has an effect on the final outcome of the film.The South Korea airbase scene in particular adds no value to the story. Everyone is aware that they need to be extremely quiet to sneak onto a plane to leave. Pitt however, leave his phone on and receives a call from his wife at the worse possible moment and people become dead as a result. Pitt's character is supposed to be the best at what he does but yet fails to observe safety protocols? This makes no sense.The hoards of CGI created living dead are unconvincing and in some scenes, resemble the ones in 'I am Legend.' Not much in way of technological improvements over a film released in 2007 if you ask me.Camera work is terrible with shots bouncing up and down, side to side. Another film ruined with 'shaky cam' filming .In a way, this movie parallels the 2011 film 'Contagion.' In fact, you can replace the Pitt investigative scenes with the ones from 'Contagion' and have a more cohesive story.There is very little blood shown on screen. Given its PG-13 rating, violence of course needed to be toned down but not to the point of avoidance. Fans of the zombie genre may find this film a bit lacking but I think the producers of WWZ wanted to sanitize it to appeal to a wider audience.",6,5,7,23 September 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good but not great
","As a comics to movie vehicle, it was much better than some of the past turds like 'The Punisher,' 'Ghost Rider,' 'Hulk', etc.The fight scenes were decent and (intentional or not), the cgi special effects gave the perspective / appearance of the over-the-top action drawn by comic artists.***Spoiler Warning*** The story dragged at times unnecessarily and the writing was a bit inconsistent. Examples: We know Steve Rogers is sickly, wimpy and weak. There was no need to belabor the point for a good portion of the movie.The 'buy bonds' scenes. He was being used a a pawn to sell war bonds. Was it necessary to devote ~20 minutes to show him being turned into a caricature? Throw-away HYDRA soldiers. These were supposedly elite NAZI troops converted to serve HYDRA. In battle, they looked like they didn't know how to use their own weapons and were killed en masses. Additionally, foes were were able to easily take their weapons and use them on them.Red Skull's final act at the end was puzzling, it absolutely made no sense. The man is obviously mad as a hatter but is not stupid.Still, worth a strong 7 rating in my opinion.",6,0,4,8 August 2011
Oblivion," Fairly unsatisfying movie
","This is one of those movies that starts off appearing enjoyable but becomes terribly disappointing as it progresses. The storyline is fairly simple â€“ In the aftermath of a great war against an alien enemy, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable. To survive, mankind has escaped to another world but a few humans remain to tend the massive energy harvesting machines left behind. To make things difficult, a few surviving aliens have also remained and try to create havoc where ever they can.It's hard not to notice the behavior of the three primary characters, strange, wooden and unfeeling. Whether it was intentional or just bad acting, it effectively gave away the plot twists and secrets of the story long before they are revealed. You know that everyone and everything is not as they appear and by the time the movies hits its proverbial stride, you will have already correctly guessed everything that will happen.The film is 2 hours in length but loses its entertainment value near the half hour mark. The story is incredibly predictable and has laughable plot holes that make no sense at all. For instance, how do the clones share memories? They are independent of each other but yet they seemingly share memories at the lake scene at the end. (If you haven't seen the movie, I won't give away what this means.) Pros: Special effects are top notch, action scenes are interesting. Cons: Story (or lack of), plot, zero second viewing potential Recommendation: Watch the first half and turn it off, the rest you will have already envisioned in your head.",6,0,0,13 August 2013
28 Weeks Later," Started great but went down hill fast
","The premise of the movie is plausible (not likely but plausible) that a virus could suddenly infect a large population of London (hey , the plague did roll through there a few centuries ago) and create all sorts of mayhem. In this story, the infected become living zombies (as opposed to dead zombies since the infected are technically still living) and go around attacking the uninfected living. Why they don't attack one another is beyond me, perhaps out of professional courtesy? Sorry, I digress.Anyway, the military gets the situation under control (the U.S. military that is....where's the British military and NATO?) and start re-populating an area dubbed 'The Green Zone' isolated from the still unsecured 'wild' areas. Huh? What kind of logic is that, something as deadly as this virus and they don't do a complete clean-up before bringing in civilians? Obviously the World Health Organization (WHO) would not have allowed that to happen. This crazy lack of logic is present throughout the story and really killed the movie for me. Quick summary, the rest of the story goes as follows: Two kids slip out of the 'Green Zone' and wander around the outside. I estimate at least half an hour goes by before the soldiers mobilize and chase down the kids. (So much for the much ballyhooed secured area) The kids find their chewed up mother still alive and they're all reunited and live happily ever after. Well maybe not but from that point, the story gets more and more ridiculous until you pretty much don't care if anyone survives. It just defies logic that they would bring an infected person into the so-called 'Green Zone' and allow that person to make contact with others. Predictably, someone gets bitten, the virus spreads, and the zombies start taking over again!Without giving away the ending, I can tell you that room is left for a third sequel (FYI, the first movie is entitled '28 Days Later'). I certainly hope they don't make another.",1,2,4,28 November 2008
Knowing," The Apocalpse and New Eden.
","This could have been a great horror story, the first 3/4 of the movie was creepy as heck. Kids hearing things no one else can, trances, people in the shadows, seemingly demonic possessions, etc. With the proper ending, this movie could have easily have been a hit.However, we learn later that all of the mysterious happenings are caused by 'aliens' who have been watching certain people for decades. So this is a science fiction flick then, right? Well, maybe or maybe not.The Apocalypse is upon the world and all life will soon be extinguished from the face of the Earth. Good nature benign and benevolent 'aliens' have decided to pluck certain children off the planet and deliver them to a new place to restart the cycle of life again.So why is this not a science fiction movie then? Well, it could be because the 'aliens' in their true form resemble winged angels. It could also be because of the fact that one boy and one girl was saved. Or maybe it's because the children are deposited in what appears to be a lush garden with a single tree.Many movies have trick endings or messages, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. To me, the ending seemed to be a page from the Book of Genesis which makes very little sense for a science fiction movie. So are the writers intimating that religion is science fiction? Please leave metaphysics out of science fiction movies, OK?",4,0,3,23 June 2013
28 Days Later...," Entertaining for the most part.
","Having seen the sequel first and being disappointed with it, I viewed this movie with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and wound up enjoying most of the movie. The hero (actually more like the anti-hero)was an annoying weakling throughout the movie but this is what makes the movie OK. In real life, not everyone is 'Rambo' and it was refreshing to see the hero more helpless than helpful. As far as zombie movies goes, there's nothing really surprising. There are the usual chase/escape scenes and kill or be killed scenes. The gore is minimal, and left mostly to the imagination (which isn't a bad thing).My main complaint about the movie happens towards the latter portions of the movie where the story takes a left turn into the dregs of humanity. Even so, it doesn't detracted too much from the overall entertainment value of the movie.Watch this one but skip the sequel.",7,2,3,29 November 2008
Gran Torino," Interesting enough if you look past the stereo-types
","This is another movie where we see the lighter side of Eastwood. You wouldn't think so at first glance as his character is portrayed as a hard curmudgeon who's angry at everyone and himself.Your initial thoughts probably are, why is he so angry? He hates his adult children, he hates their wives, he hates the grand children, he hates import cars and he especially hates his Asian neighbors. As the story progresses, Eastwood gets to know the neighbors and even makes a statement that goes something along the lines of 'I have more in common with them than my family.'Life, love, exploration, death, it's all in the story.You see Eastwood go from a crotchety old man without purpose to a crotchety old man with a purpose. Yes, I realize that's says very little but you have to see the movie to understand what I mean. His character doesn't really soften by movie's end but he changes himself and those around him for the better.The story dragged at times but that was probably due to my expectations from the previews and trailers. I went in with the mindset of 'Charles Bronson, vigilante action' for which the story was not. Yes there are guns, shootings and violence but they are not a major part of the movie.Some may be offended by the stereo-typical portrayal of some races. Unfortunately, large metropolitan city do have gangs as shown in the movie. They probably aren't as over-the-top in their behavior though.",8,1,4,8 January 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Not bad if you don't take the metaphysical aspect seriously
","From a purely entertainment perspective, the movie was pretty good. There was mystery, suspense and accomplished acting led by Tom Hanks and supporting cast. Depending on your metaphysical stance, you may or may not enjoy the movie since it pokes holes in the Roman Catholic religion. What's interesting is that the author of 'The DaVinci Code' did not make up a lot of the issues, he took existing points that have been debated through the ages and incorporated them into his book. From what I understand, a lot of details from the book was left out (my guess the script writers didn't want to bog the story down with too much information) of the movie. I may grab a copy just to see what difference between the 2 is.Give the movie a shot, it's a decent movie. Some religious zealot will complain about anything. I found it interesting that some of those folks complained about 'The Passion of the Christ,' which was a pure pro-Christ movie. Go figure.",10,11,21,22 May 2006
Iron Man," Incredible movie
","Let me start off by saying I love this movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. This was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is probably not telling the truth. We the audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. Some questioned his change, others wanted to bury him for it.There is plenty of action but the story is what really raised the bar from average to above average. We see Stark slowly become Iron Man after surviving a few hilarious mishaps and fire extinguisher assaults. We see him struggle with moral conflicts and finally deciding to make a difference. The antagonist twist was nicely done, we are lead to believe that the obvious villain is the main antagonist. Nope, a more sinister character lurked in the background which made the story much more interesting and satisfying.Of all of the 'Avengers' prequel movies (eg: Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk) this is the best in my opinion. Grab a big glass of your favorite beverage, prepare some microwave popcorn, sit back and be prepare for a couple hours of great entertainment.",9,2,3,26 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars IV: A New Hope
","Star Wars IV: A New Hope Synopsis: A young man ekes out a life on a dry, barren wasteland planet. He one day chances upon a small droid carrying important information that is wanted by the Galactic Empire. The young man is initially reluctant to get involved but after witnessing the brutality of the Galactic Empire, he accepts the task at hand to help deliver the droid to the Rebel Alliance. He picks up companions along the way and look for possible assistance in a seedy bar populated with unsavory alien-types.During the journey, various small skirmishes are fought and one of the elder statesman in the group is killed. The death particularly affects the young man as he looked up to him in high regard.The droid and it's information is delivered to the Rebel Alliance successfully and everyone prepares for the final battle with the Galactic Empire's doomsday weapon. In the climactic scene, the Galactic Empire's doomsday weapon is destroyed after a single venerability is found.Star War VII: The Force Awakens Substitute 'young man' with 'young woman' , 'Galactic Empire' with 'First Order' and 'Rebel Alliance' with 'Resistance' in the above synopsis and you have Star War VII: The Force Awakens. This is not a new movie but a retelling of 'A New Hope.' It's been 10 years (2005) since the release of 'Revenge of the Sith' and this is the best they could come up with? Story wise, I rank this a s a FAIL. Special effects is top notch. Just go to see the special effects and forget that this is supposed to be a Star Wars sequel - it is not.",7,17,24,8 January 2016
