Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," visually spectacular
",it is to be noted that it is very hard to follow up on a spectacular trilogy 20 years after they were released.the plot is lack lustre at worst and mildly invigorating at best.this however can not take away from the miraculous special effects and overall splendor of the cinematography itself.the acting itself was above par to boot.......all in all slightly off center and up to the left from average.,6,0,1,1 April 2003
