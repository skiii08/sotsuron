"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Schwimmer, Pegg and Black - Comic genius
","Well, after Hot Fuzz I thought that Simon Pegg might have burnt his boats. I found it hard to see any one beating Shaun of the Dead - Just brilliant buffoonery..So having seen R.FB.R. I can wholeheartedly recommend this gem to connoisseurs of fun, stupidity and absurdity. A touch of romance too! Of course it will probably not stand the test of time and will probably be forgotten by the end of the year, but who cares! Those wanting to be entertained with laughs that occasionally cause stomach pains will be pleased. But you need to 'get' British humour. Those expecting any intellectual immersion should go to bed early and avoid this! It was so er, 'pleasant' to see Thandie Newton ( sigh!) again. Who can forget her in those skin tight frocks in 'Chronicles of Riddick'. But I was even more pleased to find Dylan Moran in there too. He does 'I can't control the world for you...you idiots... I cant do it for myself!!' so well. If you have watched him live or in 'Black Books' you will know this.Excellent movie see it!",8,2,5,29 February 2008
