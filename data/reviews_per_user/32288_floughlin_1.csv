Alien 3," Boldest of the sequels
","After the first sequel which was just a remake of the first movie with more aliens, this moved the story on in an imaginative way.
To put Ripley on a planet full of men and keep the character as a strong lead is pretty much unique amongst sci-fi and most other movie genres.
The storyline had purpose and the ending is sublime, Ripley knew what she had to do and followed through with it.
A masterpiece.",10,5,8,18 March 2019
