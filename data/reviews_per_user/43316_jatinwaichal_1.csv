Despicable Me 2," Amazing movie
","It is a amazing movie. I liked it a lot. Fun to watch and enjoy. As compared to its first part, the second part is more amazing. It has shown the changed attitude of Gru. He is still a amazing villein but with a soft corner for children's. The minions are cutest and adorable. Those guys make the movies excellent. The purple color for the evil minions are also good, but the yellow color suits better :) Very funny and enjoyable as the first one. The action is great. Doctor's bike is amazing. The way he starts after the send off that is the most amazing thing. The detective version of Gru is amazing. Gru has become an amazing, caring father in this part. Finally he gets the mother for his children's.",10,1,1,25 August 2013
