It," Great scenery and art but not an excellent film
","The movie was quite predictable, child is alone + room is dark/going down the basement = scary thing gonna happen, very predictable. I watched the movie on my own, in the dark, wasn't even afraid to get up to the toilet. I wouldn't say I did not enjoy it, but it was very deep or even realistic in the sense that when a kid sees such horrors, he doesn't just go on with his life...
It felt more like a gruesome fairytale or a long episode of Stranger Things especially with Finn Wolfhard (Richie) and the dysfunctional home redhead Sophia Lillis (Beverly). <<< SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS >>>If, in the last showdown between the kids and Pennywise, Georgie were real and then Bill would have wiped off his own brother, then this movie would have some bad twist to it, but I guess the book takes it elsewhere.",7,0,0,28 January 2018
