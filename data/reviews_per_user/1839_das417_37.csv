The Incredible Hulk," The Mediocre Hulk
","Hollywood is convinced that in order to tell a good story, especially in regards to a comic book movie, that it needs big actors and CGI effects that cost millions. While the first is understandable, the latter often means a lack of script, dialog, and overall plot which hinders the movie the CGI was supposed to help. This is the case with the latest installment of The Incredible Hulk.Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is desperate to escape not only United States Army General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) but the very 'beast' within him that transforms him into a dangerous and powerful creature with powers of strength far beyond anything human. While in hiding Dr. Banner longs for his love Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who, ironically, happens to be the daughter of General Ross. His existence is a lonely one that has taken him across the Western Hemisphere in order to not only stay free but to also find a cure.General Ross, a determined officer who sees weapon potentials in Dr. Banner's abilities, brings in Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to head a special forces team to track Dr. Banner who is discovered to be in Brazil. It is then that Blonsky will realize the force of Dr. Banner's power while coming to the realization that he wants that power as well.The setup for The Incredible Hulk is one that promises more than the standard comic book fare. A unique introduction that tells the story of Banner's transformation, which later leaves to a desperate chase scene through the favelas of Brazil, are unfortunately the only moments of the Incredible Hulk worth remembering. The problems almost begin immediately when Dr. Banner returns to the US and contacts Betty before finding himself facing a now transformed Blonsky who is willing to take the power of gamma mutation to the next level.However, if there is one thing to be critical about the Incredible Hulk, it is the poor writing which leads to unconvincing and poor dialogue. William Hurt and Tim Roth with the lines they were given might as well have been stage actors from some melodramatic stage play from the late 1890's. All they were missing where the long, black mustaches to twirl while they think of their devious plans. Liv Taylor in particular proves that either she has the ability to only find movies that give her clichéd and limited characters or, more likely, that she really can't act beyond a tearful love interest. Edward Norton himself is constrained by a script that leaves him little more than looks of desperation with wide eyes.CGI is understandably an important factor in movies like the Incredible Hulk. However, when the CGI alone is the most impressive thing about any movie (and even some of the CGI battle scenes are silly even for a comic book movie) there is going to be problems elsewhere. The Incredible Hulk proves why CGI alone cannot and will not make a good story.7/10",7,3,7,23 June 2008
Star Trek," These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise............
","The USS Enterprise is a cultural icon that has defined not only a generation but the entire idea of science fiction. James T. Kirk, Spock, Sulu, etc., are names that have been handed down through the years to new generations of fans and which stand out as characters as memorable as any other. Star Trek isn't just a show, its a vision of what humanity is capable of. J.J. Abrams has created a miracle by recreating not only the show and characters but also giving a new light to what the vision is. James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is man living with no real purpose in his life. Growing up in Iowa after the death of his father, Kirk has spent his years in rebellion and trouble. One night Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) approaches Kirk with an offer. Kirk's father was a hero who saved the lives of his crew including his family. Pike dares James to follow his legacy and become a Starfleet officer. Kirk himself is not to excited about the idea but he realizes that he wants something in his life and Starfleet may have the answer.Spock (Zachary Quinto) is a half Vulcan half human growing up on the world of his father. While Kirk is rebelling against the law and his parents, Spock discovers that he has no place among the people of his father due to his heritage. When he discovers that even the science ministers of Vulcan disapprove his blood, he turns down a prized seat in the science academy and joins Starfleet. It is there that he will meet a most unlikely friend.Kirk soon becomes friends with two of his fellow cadets who have their own reason for joining Starfleet. Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) quickly befriend Kirk despite his issues with authority and rules. This includes cheating to defeat the infamous Kobayashi Maru Scenario which was designed as impossible to beat. It is this act that catches the attention of Spock who is the creator of the scenario. Disciplinary actions against Kirk are prevented due to an emergency distress call that quickly mobilizes Starfleet Academy's cadets. Vulcun is under attack and Starfleet his forced to deploy the inexperienced cadets to rescue the Vulcans. Through some rather dubious means, Dr. McCoy is able to bring Kirk on board the Enterprise which is not only Captian Pike's new ship but also recently built and ready for her first mission. A new officer by the name of Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) is finding that his first mission is one of both excitement and danger. Later, an engineer by the name of Scotty (Simon Pegg) will also join the crew to defeat not only a threat to the Federation idea of space time itself.Star Trek is centered upon not only the story of Kirk and Spock but the idea of time and history. Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future, destroys Vulcan in order to gain vengeance against the future Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy) who he believes is responsible for his world's destruction. Spock himself travels back in time and witnesses not only Vulcan's loss but how his relationship to Kirk began. The destruction of Vulcan cannot be avoided and thus the history that Ambassador Spock knows now no longer exists. The Enterprise of his history is gone and that leaves cadet Kirk and cadet Spock to create a new future.J. J. Abrams was bold in deciding to create not only a new movie but also a new universe for Star Trek. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, etc., have been excluded from the history that we have come to know. There is freedom to not only make more movies but also a new history for the Federation. Star Trek needed this and while some will of course disagree, the Star Trek universe was drying up in terms of ideas and interest. The idea of a new universe is not only a sign of creativity but of Star Trek becoming more than what it once was. Star Trek is better than ever before. 9/10",9,2,13,9 May 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Power, Honor, and Sisterhood
","In an age of absolute monarchs, an authoritarian church, and despotic courts, the free will of an individual was often discarded for political or other such means. One family, the Boleyns who are an otherwise modest family with low connections to the court, will experience this with tragic results.Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) is traditional father for his time. He is concerned not only for the future marriages of his two daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Mary Boleyn, but also what his family can gain from such unions. It is no secret that he favors Mary above Anne so when he offers the latter to a suitor of otherwise middle class statue such as his own family, it is of little concern to him or anyone else in the family. Anne herself seems pleased with the choice and has little desire for a more wealthier and prestigious husband. Mary, even though it would be expected that she be married first, herself is excited over her younger sister's marriage and only promises support.Thomas Howard (David Morrissey), otherwise known as the Duke of Norfolk, is the uncle to Mary and Anne. A political creature if one ever existed, he learns that the queen has suffered a recent miscarriage. He knows that Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) will not be able to please King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) much longer so he devises a way for the still unmarried Mary to catch the eye of the king. Not for Mary or Henry's own personal sake but so that his family may gain by having a union with the crown itself. Especially so if the Mary is able to give Henry the son he has always wanted.What happens next is a series of ironies and misfortunes that send the Boleyn family, especially Mary, Anne, and their brother George (Jim Sturgess) down a path of jealously, rage, sorrow, and destruction. Henry, a cruel and petty man who discards women much as he discards old clothing, is impossible to please and once both Mary and Anne fall into his sight then their fates have been sealed. In this way the fear of their mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) are realized when she sees that her daughters are to be traded as if mere goods to be exchanged at a whim.The Other Boleyn Girl circles, as one expects, around the relationship between Mary and Anne during their relationship with the king. Anne, who ironically was seduced by the king after her marriage while Mary was ignored, is able to give Henry the son he needs. However, by that time, Mary has already caught his eye and thus Anne finds herself no longer in favor. However, Mary goes further then perhaps even her uncle imagined by having herself crowned Queen of England (and upsetting not just the entire kingdom but the Catholic Church which Henry VIII would later break away from). While Anne is portrayed as an innocent girl who is heartbroken at her fate, Mary is just as calculating as her uncle and perhaps just as blind because of her greed. In this we have a good sister, bad sister conflict where a once close relationship has been broken because of lust and politics. Only in the death of Mary at the hands of an executioner do the two sisters finally reunite as they were before their lives were corrupted by the desires of their father, uncle, and the king himself.If there is a complaint to be made it is the otherwise wooden acting that occurs mainly from Portmand and Bana which can only be blame on the script itself. As with all historical movies, one might question the historical accuracy that is portrayed when drama is needed to make things more 'interesting'. Regardless of these few problems, The Other Boleyn Girl is a case study in power politics and the price that must be paid when ambition outruns caution. However, love and honor can transcend these faults if only the will to do so is there.8/10",8,1,2,11 June 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," An average story about two brothers
","Wolverine is one of the main heroes of the X-Men and the idea of a movie focusing on his 'origins' was bound to be one that would receive much support from fans of the series. However, X-Men Origins: Wolverine may be a movie that most fans will compare to X-Men The Last Stand, a less than impressive accomplishment since there was great expectations for the movie. Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) are two brothers with unique powers. Escaping their Canadian childhood home in the 1840's, the two brothers will spend the next 100 years fighting in every war from the American Civil War to Vietnam. Ignoring the fact that these are Canadians who seem to like fighting for America, the two brothers find that their talents and abilities make them the perfect soldiers. Victor, more so than Logan, finds a taste for blood that eventually turns off Logan who himself has grown tired of the constant fighting and death.A mission in Vietnam ends with the death of a superior officer and a death sentence. However, the invincibility of the two brothers attracts the attention of Colonel William Stryker (Danny Huston) who would rather see the two of them work with his own team of soldiers. Men, who like Logan and Victor, possess special powers that make them stand out. The problem, for Logan, is that this leads to more death and a feeling of revulsion. He abandons not only Stryker's team but also Victor.Years later, Logan has made a comfortable life in the Canadian Rockies with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins). Tragedy soon follows Logan and, when he believes Kayla has been murdered by Victor, Logan will take the first steps that will lead to the creation of Wolverine. Logan has been fighting the beast within for years but now he will see that he has to unleash it in order to solve the mystery of Kayla's death. Not only will he become the weapon he always had the potential to be, Logan will discover that vengeance will not always bring redemption. The problem is that there really isn't more to draw us into the story. Instead of focusing in on the transformation from 'man' into 'animal', X-Men Origins instead uses overblown special effects, explosions, and pointless camera shots of slow motion rage. An average movie about two brothers, X-Men Origins suffers from not enough depth. There isn't enough time spent on the history of Logan or Victor to make us care about their relationship. A better movie would have focused upon their past instead of jumping straight to the present. What other experiences did the two share that lead them to two opposite lives? There is more to the story but we never see it. There is a sense of rivalry between the two but it is never explained except that Victor seems to suffer from low self esteem. The use of other minor mutants only distract since their stories are never explained either.A disappointment that compares to The Last Stand, fans will not be excited. The X-Men series will have to ensure that the next movie is able to live up to the standards of the first two movies. 6/10",6,1,4,1 May 2009
Alexander," Indian Battle Elephants and then some
","I read the reviews saying how this was a bad movie, in fact I was surprised to see that so many critics were against it. How could a movie like this fail in so many eyes? If movies like Gladiator could do Good, why couldn't this? I watched Alexander myself, wondering if what I was about to watch was going to be as bad as everyone said it would be. And, after what I saw, I have to say that most people were WRONG! Alexander is one of the better movies this year. I was more surprised by what I saw in terms of Colin Farrell playing his role well, an interesting plot, realistic battle scenes(being Indian, I loved seeing the war elephants!!!) as well as the soundtrack which seemed to fit.There were some problems so I can't say it is as good as other movies I have seen recently. Angelina Jolie simply did not belong in this movie. Her character was more bothersome and the scenes that flashed back to her broke the momentum of the plot. If there was one downside to this movie, it was her.Many have complained about the bisexual themes in the movie. I think Stone held back, he could have done much more with the idea, and I think he should of for historical value. I understand why he did not, so perhaps it was good he didn't. Stone should be praised for allowing such a trait in his character though, especially since it is historical.I would say see this movie and ignore what people are saying.",7,1,4,9 December 2004
Orphan," Serious script questions aside, The Orphan is a good movie
","The Orphan is a movie that uses an old theme. A scary kid who no one believes is evil is in fact the greatest threat to everyone around her. The idea has been used countless times and isn't too original. However, unlike those other movies, this one does stand out for the right reasons. A surprise hit of the summer, The Orphan is worth watching.John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) and his wife Kate (Vera Farmiga) are upscale residents who discover that their life is missing something. The miscarriage that Kate suffered earlier has left a hole that needs to be filled despite the fact they already have two children and wealth. Ignoring their own marriage problems that circle around Kate's alcoholism and John's past affairs, the two still want to continue the marriage. Deciding that a new child would replace the one they lost, and perhaps bring them closer together, they decide to adopt.Never explaining why they choose an older child to adopt, John and Cole reach out to a Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) whose orphanage is home to older girls. There, they meet Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who appears to be a polite and intelligent child. Not only does she paint she can tell stories, sing, and more importantly, act as a young girl who desperately needs a home. If there was ever a stereotype orphan, Esther is it and John and Kate can't help but want her in their lives. She is everything that a parent would want and they quickly accept her into their family.Esther soon reveals a darker side though to her new brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and hearing impaired sister Max (Aryana Engineer). Games take a dark turn and Esther shows a vicious side after killing a wounded bird. She then reveals an even darker nature after she forces Max to help her murder Sister Abigail after she attempted to check up on her. From there Esther descends further into the realms of madness and Daniel and Max both find themselves held hostage in their own home.Kate herself begins to notice that something is wrong. Instead of being the innocent girl they adopted, Esther becomes distant, cold, and eventually hostile. Kate is then convinced that Esther is hiding something despite John's refusal to accept such an idea. The family is slowly torn apart as Esther attempts to destroy everyone in her new family which leaves only Kate willing to stand up to her. The act of desecrating the flowers that honored Kate's lost child shows Esther's willingness to challenge her new mother. John's refusal to accept Kate's belief, however, only alienates her from her him. Kate is eventually forced into rehab after striking Esther after she accuses her of trying to murder Daniel. She finds that she soon has to face Esther if her family is to survive. When it is too late Kate, Daniel, and Max survive but at a cost that should never have been paid in the first place.The Orphan is a movie that excels in the use of suspense and plot development. However, the use of over exposed ideas such as 'scary' music and sound effects, at times limit the effect of the horror. The serious problems exist around the plot holes that eventually develop. It seems hard to believe that a Esther, who was in fact a dwarf who spent time in a mental institute and was 33 years old, could pass herself off forever as a child. And why wouldn't John and Kate spent more time looking into her past? The adoption process itself seems unrealistic as if one could simply pick up a child in a matter of weeks without really understanding who the child is. And if Esther did belong to a mental institute, how could it be that she was so easily adopted first in her own country and then across the world? Ignoring the plot holes, The Orphan is still a movie that draws you in. Isabelle Fuhrman is an actress we will watch in the future. Her portrayal of a murderous adult whose delusions lead to the deaths of those around her stands out in a character who will be remembered. 7/10",7,2,3,1 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Less than successful sequel that disappoints those who wanted more
","Terminator Salvation is very much a summer movie. Special effects, loud explosions, and over dramatic acting, ensure that Terminator Salvation is very much a movie that falls in line with other major summer releases. If you wanted a movie with good effects then this is the movie for you. If you wanted something more, well, then you will be disappointed. John Conner (Christian Bale) is a member of the resistance. Humanity has been brought almost to extinction after the nuclear war launched by the computer Skynet and the later use of terminators and automated hunter killer aircraft. Along with his wife Kate Conner (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two struggle to not only stay alive but also to keep hope. John finds himself using old recordings his mother made during the 1980's and 1990's in order to keep his faith. Now that he is fighting the war he was always told to expect, he is finding himself tested in ways he never thought possible.Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) was a death row convict in the year 2003. Before his execution, Doctor Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) arranged an organ donation so that he could perhaps have a second chance. However, as he feels the needle going into his arm, Marcus awakens and finds himself in a nightmarish world where robots hunt humans and where Los Angeles is in ruin. He meets a teen by the name of Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a pilot named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) who teach him how to survive this new world. Marcus then learns that he is not the human he once was and that he could be the greatest threat not only to Blair and Kyle but the human resistance as a whole. The Terminator storyline is one that is well known so fans of the series can expect to see the future which the last three movies only hinted at. The world is desolate and death is everywhere. Director McG was able to give the impression of a world perhaps a little less evolved then that of Mad Max. We see how the resistance is controlled and how it deploys itself against Skynet not only in America but also around the world. Skynet itself is finally revealed in its true evil after Marcus, who we discover is a advanced cyborg which uses the organs he donated, confronts it. The problem is that McG is unable to give the feeling of darkness and despair that the last three Terminator movies gave when it came to covering the future. Instead of massive ruins where skulls are crushed as if they were grains of sand, and large battles where small groups of humans find themselves overwhelmed by terminators, McG's future is one of hide and seek. The writing is good and the story flowed with no problems. The issue, however, is that it all feels superficial. This isn't helped by the use of explosions and special instead of dialog to keep the plot moving. McG's images of a San Francisco turned into a major Skynet facility and terminator production site is the best example of what the Terminator future should look like. It is a disappointing that he wasn't able to use more settings such as it to give a feeling as to what a world run by Skynet would appear.Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie. The problem is that it felt rushed and the decision to use Marcus Wright as a cyborg locater feels hollow as does his sacrifice to save John Conner's life. There was the potential to go deeper into the human/robot question in terms of where does one begin and the other end by introducing the possible romance between Marcus and Blair. However, it is never really explored and thus it seemed almost unnecessary to have Marcus and Blair form the relationship they did.The question is whether or not the next story will be able to surpass the disappointments within Terminator Salvation. There is reason to hope but the fans should demand something better.7/10",7,2,3,23 May 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Typical Disaster Movie
","**** SPOILERS!!!!!!! ******* The Day After Tomorrow, while amusing especially watching it in theaters, is a typical disaster movie. After watching TDAT, I am now convinced that all disaster movies will follow these rules. 1)There will be a scientist who no one believes, 2) a politician or rich person who won't believe him or her until it's too late, 3) and innocent kids who either just want to have fun or are misunderstood until the disaster happens. I can't think of a single disaster movie dealing with nature that doesn't some of these stereotypical characters.However, The Day After Tomorrow is still worth watching just because it's fun. Not very realistic, but then again this comes from the man who created Independence Day so what can you expect but some computer images of major cities being destroyed? However, there were really only several areas of the movie which I thought were stupid and only added to the unlikeness of what was being showed. I have to say that the last half of the movie is where it started going down hill and where it also turned into a near Hallmark family movie. If the ending had been a little better then perhaps I would have given it a better rating.The idea of Quaid driving, then WALKING up to New York from Washington in what he himself calls, in not so many words, an unheard of disaster is just too hard to believe. Though he has been to the Arctic before, does that mean that he and his two friends are going to drive then walk the distance to New York and survive while hundreds of thousands can't? I saw this as the point where the movie became less then a disaster movie, and more of a father son story.The next issue that annoyed me was the wolves and the attempt to get medicine from the freighter. It seems that Emmerich needed something to fill time with so he came up with this. I find it hard to understand why Enrich would run out of ideas now, if that is what happened. It's just seemed to be too silly compared to the rest of the movie.The last issue that came up was the 'cheerful' words of the new president, the man who believe Quiad was simply a crack before he of course was proved to be right. I am sorry, but if this actually happened the whole world would starve. The Third World cannot support itself AND refugees from the West at once. The West would surely 'die' if this were to happen.Despite these two minuses, I still enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow. It's not realistic however it is a fun movie to watch if you like seeing the end of the world. 7/10",7,1,2,27 December 2004
Spider-Man 3," The worst of the three movies, Spider-man 3 fails in almost every way
","Spider-Man was released in 2002 to much fan fare and excitement. One of the biggest movies of that year, it couldn't help but create a sequel which was just as popular if not more so. Spider-Man became the latest of a series of movie sequels where ticket sales were driven up by excitement over every planned sequel. Spider-Man 3, rumored to be the last in the series, will most likely make as much, if not more, then the last movie because of die hard movie fans who enjoy seeing the same hero in a new movie.However, the problem that movie series face is that eventually the series will run out of creativity and direction. Spider-Man 3 is the latest series to end not so much with a bang but with a whimper. Directors and writers can only carry an idea so far before any series becomes dry. Villains, CGI effects, and special effects overall do not entertain if there is no solid story or plot. Spider-Man 3 shows what happens when too much is placed on eye candy and nothing else substantial.Spider-Man 3 opens up with the exact opposite of Spider-Man 2. Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) is enjoying the fame that Spider-Man now enjoys from New York as well as high grades at university. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), however, is finding her acting dreams tarnished after being removed from play. Her jealousy over Peter's fame as Spider-Man only makes it worse as Peter begins to let such fame go to his head.Harry Osborn (James Franco) plans his revenge against Peter and eventually confronts him as the New Goblin in a blurry CGI battle that ends with Harry losing his short-term memory and his hatred for Peter. Peter himself takes advantage of this and even though he saves Harry's life he has no plans on reminding him of the past hatred Harry had for him. It almost seems, for a moment, as if his old friend from high school has suddenly returned. In the background is the rise of Sandman, aka Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a petty criminal who finds himself altered after a particle experiment. Driven to find money that would cure his daughter, Flint is later discovered to be the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and thus drives Peter on a mission of to avenge his uncle's death. Discovering that Flint now has powers of his own makes that mission even more difficult.As if there wasn't enough conflict already, the arrival of a strange meteor releases an alien life form that later adheres to Peter during sleep one night. Peter finds both his powers, and personality, changed by the life form as he goes from a mild manner individual and hero to one who is more emotionally driven and aggressive in almost every way. Peter's later rejection of the alien leads to it's takeover of Eddie Brock (Toper Grace) who was once a rival at the Daily Bugle until Peter exposes a series of false pictures that ends his short lived journalist career. Using the hatred he has for Peter, the alien transforms Eddie until Venom who as we all know is perhaps the most famous of all Spider-Man villains and one who many wished to see in this movie.The problem that Spider-Man 3 faces is trying to get all of these sub-plots to end in a quick and nice way. Often it feels rushed and lacks the tension and drama that the last Spider-Man movies had. Peter bounces from one conflict to the next but there is no real satisfactory ending to them. Sandman gives the sob story about his sick daughter before Peter forgives him for his uncle's death, Harry dies after a melodramatic scene that was almost amusing in it's absurdity, and Venom is only in the last half hour in the movie before his death which makes me ask why he was even included. These characters have so much depth built into them that the let down is in the end where we have no real answer to the conflicts they create. Oh, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship appears to heal at the end of the movie though we have no real way of knowing if this is true.Spider-Man 3 tries too much at once and suffers because of it. The humor of Peter dancing and trying to hit on women only adds to an air of desperation/bad writing and directing. Too much time is wasted on so many sub-plots that no real stand out plot on it's own is created. Again, resting on villains and CGI is not an excuse to ignore stable plot creation. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 learns this lesson too late.6/10",6,2,5,5 May 2007
Zodiac," A Story of Murder and Obsession
","The Zodiac killer is one of the most perplexing mysteries in American History. The Zodiac left a trail of fear and death for over two years from 1968 to 1970 with at least five killed and perhaps more though police were never able to link other deaths to the Zodiac. Just as he suddenly appeared he disappeared without a trace and left a scared and confused state behind. It was his name, the Zodiac, which stood for the mysterious killer who was known for sending in codes to various San Francisco papers which contained threats and promises of further murder. It was that combination that made the Zodiac standout as a particularly violent and dangerous murderer. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young, single father who works as a cartoonist with the San Francisco Chronicle. When the murders begin he is one of many who is drawn to the mysterious codes being since to the Chronicle and other papers in San Francisco. Along with crime reporter Paul Avery (Ropert Downey Jr.), Robert begins a personal quest of his own to discover the identity of the Zodiac while Inspector David Toschi(Mark Ruffalo) along with his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) investigate directly with the SFPD. Robert, Paul, and David will especially find their lives turned upside down as the search for the Zodiac lasts not just months but years. Turning into an obsession for each of them that affects their lives in unexpected ways.And that is what makes Zodiac standout in the field of crime movies. Instead of focusing just on the murders themselves, Zodiac pays more attention to the personal lives and feelings of those trying to find the answer to one of the most important murder investigations in US History. Robert, who remarries within the years of the investigation, finds his second marriage troubled after his wife fears for their family safety after his public pursuit of the Zodiac, Paul loses himself in drugs and alcohol (a trend he was already starting on earlier), while David is demoted after a possible scandal within the SFPD and his investigation. Even during these troubles Robert is the only one who continues the search in an all consuming quest to find the answer that has now become a haunting obsession.The Zodiac to this day remains a mystery even though one suspect, a former teacher named Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), becomes particularly important subject for Robert and David. Arthur, both in reality and in the movie, was cleared by the police from any link to the murders but is Robert and Paul's belief, and thus the movies conclusion, that Arthur was indeed the Zodiac.What is the price of obsession and what price is worth losing everything that you value? Zodiac asks these questions and, much as it does by not telling who the real killer was, doesn't give a direct answer.",8,1,2,26 July 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy faces his greatest challenge..... And choice......
","There have been many superheroes Hollywood has chosen to focus on. Batman, Superman, the Incredible Hulk, and even Catwoman have all had films dedicated to their stories and the plots that revolve around them. However, none of these heroes can compare to the conflicts and humor that center directly upon an immature and easily angered red demon who not only loves cats but is also determined to save humanity.Hellboy (Ron Perlman) has come a long way since his defeat of Rasputin. Though his father, Professor Travis Bruttenholm (John Hurt) is now gone, Hellboy can still count on his team which include the intellectual Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Liz has now become his girlfriend (a quirky issue in the last movie) which has brought the usually benefits and problems that such relationships bring no matter the species involved. The BPRD, run with a close leash by director Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), is still the best option to defeat that which 'bumps in the night'.What 'bumps in the night' this time is the Elf Prince Nuada (Luke Goss). Long ago the races of man fought that of the elves and ogres for control of the world. When Prince Nuada's father King Balor (Roy Dotrice) accepts a truce with the human world that banishes the elf race to the shadows of the world, Nuada goes into exile in disgust. What infuriates him further is that his father has at his disposal the Golden Army which is an unbeatable army of mechanical men that nearly crushed humanity during the first war. Why his father would throw away such an advantage is something that Nuada will hold onto for centuries.The control of the Golden Army lays in the hands of whoever holds the three pieces of the golden crown given to King Balor. While one of the pieces were given to the race of men to hold onto, the centuries have seen it passed down until it ends up in an auction one night in New York. Prince Nuada, returning from exile, sees his chance to claim victory over the humans by claiming the piece of the crown. Holding onto one of the pieces, Nuada knows that he must acquire the other two which are held by his father Balor and his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton).Hellboy and the BPRD and find themselves facing not only an internal power struggle but also the threat of the Golden Army itself which Prince Nuada is more than willing to use. The addition of Johann Krauss (Seth MacFarlane), an ectoplasmic stickler for the rule book, rounds the team out though of course Hellboy and him will have more than a few clashes over strategy and most of all personality.Known for his work on Pan's Lybrinth, Guillermo del Toro does not disappoint with his visual and interpretations of the world of Mike Mignola. The secret ogre market of New York, the battles between the BPRD and a swarm of 'tooth' fairies, and most of all the final confrontation with the Golden Army in the depths of a long forgotten elf city in Ireland, all support Guillermo del Toro's reign of visual rule in the genre of fantasy. Hellboy 2 is the most visual aesthetic comic movie released this year.There are several personal issues that confront Hellboy that are worth noting. Besides the change between Hellboy and Liz, he wants to be accepted by a public that otherwise only knows hints and rumors (and Youtube as well) that tell of his existence. This is not uncommon for some superheroes but with Hellboy it is more difficult due to his 'evil' appearance and rough edge. An issue that was only hinted at before in the first movie becomes more apparent now as Hellboy realizes that he won't be fully accepted despite his efforts to save humanity from the forces of evil.The more important issue though is the destiny that Hellboy will force upon the world. As anyone who is familiar with the graphic novels know, Hellboy will destroy the world. Liz, who faces the choice of choosing Hellboy's life even when facing the reality of his 'destiny', still decides to save his life. The question will be how her choice will effect not just their relationship but the world. There is also the matter of their children and how that will influence the events that are certain to come.....Hellboy remains the most intriguing comic character to reach the big screen. Hopefully we will see more of him in the future.9/10",9,2,6,13 July 2008
Cloverfield," A twist on an old genre, Cloverfield shows that even an old concept can still sell
","My first reaction to seeing the 'mysterious' movie trailer in which one is treated to the scene of large section of New York exploding, followed of course by the head of the State of Liberty bouncing down a street, was one of awe. Not only was this film being produced by JJ Abrams, better known in my opinion for the series Lost, but it was filmed in such a way that seemed unique. A hand held camera telling the story from the view point of one or at least a few other characters? Yes, we saw this before with the dreadfully silly Blair Witch Project. However, this was taking the concept to a whole new level even though no one had a clue to what actually was happening.Now that the plot is known to everyone, the idea behind it is still unique. A monster movie based upon the limited view points of only four major characters? In movies such as Godzilla and King Kong the audience knew more than the characters so it was easy to dismiss their actions and thoughts if one disliked them. However, with Cloverfield the situation is different. Now the audience is forced to only know and experience what the characters themselves are facing. Frustrating to some, but I found it drawing me in further because I was so desperate to also know what was going on.Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has been promoted and will now work overseas in Japan which of course will take him far from his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and best friend Hud (T.J. Miller). To honor the occasion, Jason's fiancée Lily (Jessica Lucas) decides to set up a surprise party with all of Rob's close friends so they could all see him off together. Of course Rob would want to remember this so Lily convinces Jason to record the party on an hand held camera which Jason then dumps upon Hud who finds himself enjoying the new responsibility as well as the opportunity to draw close to Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).The party is a success until the appearance of Beth (Odette Yustman) and her new boyfriend. I should back up and explain that Cloverfield starts with images from the camera of Rob and Beth together. Images that are slowly being erased as Hud continues to film but since Jason and Beth now seem to be far apart due to some strange twist in their relationship, Rob claims to have little interest in them.As if life couldn't get more stressful for Rob, the city is suddenly rocked by a strange earthquake. What is the obvious thing to do? Well, run up to the roof to get a better view of the city which of course everyone at the party decides to do. While Hud pans over New York's night line, it is then that an explosion literally tears apart a large section of the city. Everyone screams and begins running from the roof and only stop when they reach the city street where they are joined by other New Yorkers who stare with horror as buildings seemingly fall on their own.What happens next is captured solely by Hud who runs, trips, falls, screams, and cries as much as everyone else around him. The idea sounds silly but it actually works and also gives the characters a deeper sense of depth in that the only camera, so to speak, they are acting in front of is the small one before them. The sudden motions, fuzzy images, and dusty shots gives one the impression that for the most part something like this actually happened. Some complained of sickness because of this however I was not one of them. Cloverfield's strength is in the way it is filmed and if you didn't like that then you have no reason to like the movie at all.The movie follows the basic idea behind an escape movie in that Rob, Jason, Lily, Hud, Beth and Marlena, must escape the city at all costs. The deaths of Jason and Marlena, as well as the rescue attempt to save Beth, drive the rest of the drama of Cloverfield. It is easy to argue that there isn't much substance behind Cloverfield but one really misses the point if that is one's feelings about Cloverfield. Once more Cloverfield is a movie not just about the monster attack itself but in how the story is told. That is where the real strengths of the movie are found.Cloverfield isn't a perfect movie and one can argue that the idea of someone really wanting to hold onto the same camera during a monster attack is simply unrealistic. Okay, so what? How realistic is a monster attack to begin with? One shouldn't be too critical of Cloverfied but instead should simply agree with everyone that takes place and enjoy the ride. Cloverfield shows that an old genre such as monster attacks can still work even today.8/10",8,1,5,30 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Who decides what is right for a child?
","Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michele Monaghan) are private investigators who are known for their knowledge and contacts within Boston's blue collar world. Patrick himself is native to the area and so his connection to the people that make it up run deep. When Lionel and Beatrice McCready (Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan) approach them to help find their kidnapped niece Amanda (Madeline O'Brian) both of them find themselves in a case that runs far deeper then they imagined.Gone Baby Gone is a rough movie to watch but is powerful nonetheless. Ben Affleck enlists the difficult lower class areas of Boston almost as if they were characters for the film. The heavy Bostonian accents, punctuated with the famous short temper that many Irish descendent's are known for, give the film sense of life that other movies of this genre often lack. Many of the characters seem real simply by the way they hold themselves in a manner that one would expect someone from the wrong side of the tracks. The characters of Gone Baby Gone are for the most part stuck in a hopeless cycle that often accompanies those who grow up in a area known more for drugs and poverty then anything else.Patrick and Angie soon discover that Amanda's mother Helene McCready(Amy Ryan) was involved in a plan to rip off a drug dealer who she worked for. Helen, the stereotypical addict mother who cares more for her next high then her own child, proves more of a challenge then a help for the two which later becomes an issue. It is Helen's behavior and attitudes towards Amanda that will set the real moral question behind Gone Baby Gone.Police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who is less than pleased at having two private investigators help the police, assigns Detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) as contacts for Patrick and Angie. It is Remy in particular who becomes an important character once it is assumed that Amanda has been killed by the very drug dealer that her mother stole from weeks earlier. His own actions will also set the scene for the final question that both Patrick and Angie must ask themselves.Gone Baby Gone takes several changes that turn the entire case upside down. Even after Amanda's suspected death, Patrick and Angie discover that that it wasn't a drug dealer but Lionel, Remy, and even Captian Doyle who were behind the 'kidnapping' of Amanda. Lionel wanted a better life for his niece, Remy and his partner saw chance for money, and Jack wanted an opportunity not only to save a child but to perhaps replace the daughter he himself lost years earlier.The truth is made known only after several deaths and even then the question still remains difficult to face. Once it is discovered that Jack and his wife are raising Amanda in a safe country home far from the drugs, booze, poverty, and a life that will never escape her neighborhood, Patrick must decide if what Doyle has done is really in Amanda's best interest or if she should be given back to her mother. Remy's own death and confession of various illegal activities meant for the greater good forces Patrick to realize that if right and wrong are to be separate then the 'right' way to do things must always be done no matter what. And that includes giving Amanda back to a mother who in any other situation would probably care less about her. It's a difficult choice that leads to Doyle's own arrest and Angie leaving him after pleading for him to leave Amanda far from Boston.Gone Baby Gone isn't just a kidnapping or mystery movie. It's a movie that forces one to ask whether or not if justice and being right are always worth the price that both demand. It would be easy to argue that Patrick should have left Amanda with Jack but in doing so one enters a very dangerous slippery slope. As Remy proved through his own actions, doing the wrong thing for the right reasons can still lead to negative consequences. Doing the right thing can also lead to such an ending but in this case honor has been served if one is willing to hold to a greater standard then just emotions. Patrick must live with his choice but he could argue that it is choice that he was glad he made and one he can live with. 9/10",9,0,0,18 February 2008
Watchmen," Do the ends justify the means?
","The Watchmen is not just another comic book movie. It is the story of a group of men and women who, for various reasons of their own, decide that they want to make America, and the world, a better place. While most lack superpowers (with the exception of one), these men and women have developed courage, determination, and the strength to face the daily evils that surround us. The moral story behind the Watchmen is not the defeat of some super villain and how the heroes are better off. The real story behind the Watchmen is whether or not the ends justify the means and if heroes can live with the legacies that they create.The year is 1985. The hero known as the Comedian/Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is dead. Thrown from his condo window, the once famous hero belonged to a former team of vigilantes known as the Watchmen. His death is seen as a robbery gone bad though one who knew him better think otherwise. Rorschach/Walter Kovacs (Jackie Earle Haley), the only member of the Watchmen who still believes in what he is doing, is determined to discover why the Comedian was murdered and who did it. A dark and brooding individual, Rorschach's black and white view of the world and human nature suits him in his personal journey of vengeance and justice.His task, however, will not be an easy one. The surviving members of the Watchmen have little interest in the fate of the Comedian who they all knew as a violent man who may have finally reaped what he sowed. Nite Owl/Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) has buried his costume and his equipment beneath his apartment, Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) is busy as CEO of his own corporation with plans of creating a new source of energy, while Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) is busy trying to save her relationship to Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) who has the ability to exist outside of time and space.The Watchmen, as noted above, isn't a normal comic book about heroes saving the day. The movie focuses not only on the present mystery of the Comedian's fate but also the history of how the Watchmen came to be who they are. These are men and women who discovered that their place in society was no longer wanted due to politics and social anger over their actions. The sense of bitterness in all of them, with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, is felt as a betrayal. Why work so hard to defend the people when the people have turned on them? What about their lives? What about their sacrifice? Why be a hero when it only takes your own life away? Rorschach discovers that the conspiracy behind the Comedian's death is traced back to one of their own. Adrian knew that the Comedian, as well as the reset of the Watchmen, stood in his way to bring real world peace. However, in order to do so, it means the death of millions and the framing of Dr. Manhattan. Rising American and Soviet tensions makes Adrian believe that now is the time for a united world even if it means sacrificing the Watchmen, and millions, to do so. In a normal comic book story, this would seem straight forward but this is not a normal comic book plot.In fact, Adrian gets away with his plan and millions do die. Dr. Manhattan leaves the Earth once more in exile so that the world can believe that he was responsible and thus prevent a nuclear war while Nit Owl and the Silk Specter realize that Adrian cannot be stopped. Rorschach is the only one who chooses to make a stand and declare that Adrian is a murderer even if he saved billions from nuclear war. The tragedy is then that Rorschach must die so that the lie can remain a secret. Adrian may be a murderer, but he actions did prevent a nuclear war and the deaths of millions more.Thus this is the question the Watchmen asks in the end. Do the ends justify the means? Hero or not, we all face the question. The moral story behind the Watchmen is that these were men and women who choose to live a life of great sacrifice only to discover that the sacrifice wasn't always worth it. They couldn't save everyone and they couldn't even save themselves. Adrian brought world peace but at the cost of any morality he once believed in and Rorschach lost his life trying to live what he believed. The question of who watches the Watchmen is then answered.They watch themselves..... And don't always like what they see.The movie follows closely to the comic book in almost every way despite the exclusions of some character back stories, side plots, and a change of the details leading to the conclusion. In the end, though, the Watchmen is one of the most faithful movies to follow source material, and is a foundation for comic books movies that will come after it. 8/10",8,0,3,7 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," There is no escape.......
","The terror of the Rage Virus, an experiment that went wrong and destroyed most of Britain during 28 Days Later, has returned to a country devastated and a US led NATO effort to rebuild. However, as can happen, what was once thought gone has returned with even deadly consequences.Don (Robert Carlye) is one of a few survivors who has managed to remain safe and hidden from the population of the Rage infested. Along with his wife and several other survivors, their existence is kept secret and safe until they are discovered and quickly overcome during one of the most intense horror scenes in recent movie history. Don is able to escape but only after leaving behind his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) in order to save his own life. Later, this theme becomes important and the irony of it being that this relationship has much to blame for the second outbreak.28 Weeks after the first outbreak, a US led NATO force has occupied much of London. The population of Rage infected has died off due to starvation weeks earlier and now a clean up operation is established in order to bring back expatriates. Among the arrivals is Tammy (Imogen Poots) and her younger brother Andy (Mackintosh Muggelton) who happen to be the children of Don and Alice. Sent away from England before the outbreak, Tammy and Alice return to a country that is empty and abandoned as well as their father who has found employment with the occupation forces. It is their first day with him that he 'explains' what happens to their mother and why it is she is no longer with them. As children often do, they accept what they are told and grieve for their loss.However their father's lie becomes obvious when, during an attempt to return to their old home outside the safe zone where US forces have locked down the refugees, Andy discovers their mother hidden away in their home. It is then that she is discovered by the US Army which quickly wants to know if she is infected and how she could have lived so long on her own. Alice herself seems almost fine if not in a state of shock.Alice is discovered to have a rare gene that allows her to be immune from the effect of the Rage Virus even if she remains a carrier herself. It is through Don, who is stunned as his children to discover that she is alive, that the outbreak returns just as quickly. Within a single day the entire safe zone the US military has established is overrun forcing General Stone (Idris Elba) to declare a Code Red: an order to kill everyone moving whether someone is infected or not.Tammy and Andy find themselves protected by a Major with the US Army named Scarlet (Rose Byrne) and Sergeant Doyle (Jeremy Renner). While much of the action moves too quickly to establish much depth for the characters or even plot, the military response to the outbreak is shown as quick and merciless. Non-infected humans are shot down quickly without a second thought before air strikes and chemical weapons are used. Scarlet, who believes that both Tammy and Andy hold the same gene of their mother, wants them protected at all cost. In this her wish is granted even if it means her own death and Doyle's but the two are taken off the island..... Even if Andy himself was infected by his own father.The question of Andy become more important when clips of Paris, along with calls for help over a French radio, show the signs of an outbreak on Continental Europe.... 28 days later.28 Weeks Later lacked the amount of depth that 28 Days Later was able to create. Besides Don, Tammy, and Andy, every other character has little growth or even to say beyond the stereotypical roles we see in movies like this. The violence is there but often the camera shots are so quick and rapid that it's hard to take in everything that is happening. The idea that the US and Europe would allow so many to return without much more protection or even a real reason besides being British is rather far fetched and I wondered how the rest of the world would have seen such a failure. It would seem as if the very attempt to create a new England only destroyed what little remained of the old one.However, 28 Weeks Later is a good movie if one can ignore some of the weaker aspects of the plot. The question of what happened after 28 Days Later is answered and now what remains to be answered is the consequence for the rest of the world.9/10",9,2,5,12 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Horror at its best
","The Carters, an all American family, decide to take a family vacation across the desert. Instead of fun in the sun the Carters, including the rather out-cast son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford), will face something beyond their wildest nightmares in the hills of New Mexico.After coming across a lone gas station run by a eccentric (Tom Bower), the Carter patriarch 'Big Bob' (Ted Levine) decide to take the advice of traveling on a road that isn't listed on the map. In doing so, he drives his family across into the off limit areas run by the Department of Energy where, in the sixties, nuclear tests took place. It is in these empty hills where the Carter family will experience the wrath of those who suffered from such tests and have little compassion on outsiders for whom the blame for their current state. Only after the first series of attacks on the Carter family, and the eventual mutilation of several of the members, that we discover what the truth is. Miners, who refused to be driven away from their homes before the tests, hid in their mines while the tests were enacted upon their land. The result was a generation of physical and mental scarred beings who now murder and pillage any who come across their hills. Of course, they do this in league with the eccentric who owns the gas station who makes a good profit off the valuables they drop off for him.Only the tenacity of Doug, the courage Bobby Carter (Dan Byrd), and even sole remaining family dog, keep what is left of the Carter family alive. Through deceptions, and brutal hand to hand combat, what remains of the family finds vengeance against the group of mutants and survives another day.But perhaps only 'another day'. For it becomes clear that they are still being watched even after their nightmare ends...What makes The Hills Have Eyes so good is that it is an old fashioned horror movie with no strings attached. No political agenda, no advanced amounts of CGI, no big budget thrills. It runs only on suspense, acting, good make up, and the ability of the director to tell a good story. And that, especially in horror movies, is hard to do. It is violent, bloody, and even graphic at times. But it is a good movie that never lets down. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,13 March 2006
Knowing," M. Night Shyamalan plot without M. Night Shyamalan
","John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) is a divided man. The death of his wife has not only left him a single parent to their son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), but also leaves him questioning fate as well. Is there a reason why things happen? Or, do things happen for no reason? As a MIT astrophysicist, the question isn't one of mere scientific thought. It is now very personal and one which John hides from by finding a bottle.John Koestler, unfortunately, will have an answer to his question.The Knowing is a movie about fate and whether or not we can change the future. The question is also whether we would want to know the future even if we couldn't change it. Fate is something that has been written about before and been the center of many movies in the past. The Knowing takes the question into standard direction but with some special effects that are horrifying. However, the problem with the Knowing isn't a predictable ending but the fact that it takes some rather strange events to get there.The discovery of a piece of paper covered by a series of strange numbers suddenly captures John's attention. The numbers, and the paper itself, were taken from a time capsule from Caleb's school which was buried 50 years earlier. John discovers that the numbers are not random and in fact give the exact date, location, and casualties for a series of natural and man made disaster. While a scientist, John realizes that what he has is something that is unexplainable.John learns that the numbers were written by a school girl named Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) in 1959. Lucinda is now dead, but her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne) is still alive. John tracks her down only to discover that she is also a single parent but that, most of all, she wants nothing to do with the memory of her mother. During this time John has already witnessed a plane crash which the numbers predicted. By the time that Diana is able to speak to him about her mother, he also experiences a subway disaster that claims more lives in New York.Caleb and Diana's daughter Abbey (Lara Robinson) discover a secret as well. The 'whispers' that Abbey's grandmother Lucinda suffered from soon begin 'speak' to them. John and Caleb have also noticed that strange men dressed in black have shown interest in them as well even though the men have always disappeared before they are confronted. John finds himself under more pressure as he attempt to solve the mystery of the numbers while protecting his son.The Knowing is a movie that promises suspense but fails to deliver. Chandler Canterbury is underwhelming at playing a character who has been placed into the center of fate. He seems half asleep during most of the movie. John is the only character who is built up while Caleb, Diana, and Abbey are given almost secondary roles around his character. John's sister Grace (Nadia Townsend) only has a few lines which give little hint as to their relationship except that John and his father had a falling out. The characters of Grace and even Diana seem almost unnecessary. If the end result is predictable, which it is, then the Knowing should have chosen better characters. The only thing that stands out in the Knowing is the final scenes in which the Earth is consumed in a solar flare. The whispering men, angels or aliens depending upon your view, rescue Caleb, Abbey, and other children (so we are hinted at) and remove them to a new world to start over. They knew that the world would be destroyed so they gave hints of the destruction to a certain few. Why those choose who they did is never answered but the guess is easy enough. Kids are pure and they have faith. They can believe in the future despite the unknown that surrounds it. M. Night Shyamalan couldn't have come up with a better over the top moral ending. The problem for the Knowing is that even with him it is doubtful that it would have been a movie worth watching again. 6/10",6,1,4,28 March 2009
"I, Robot"," When Robots and Moynahan Rule The Future
","**** Spoilers!!!! **** The world created in I Robot is beautiful in terms of the work that went into creating the city skyline of Chicago and the CGI robots that inhabit it along with humans. As far as creating a feel for the story, I Robot is one of the better movies to do that, something which some sci fi movies never do.The plot is self explanatory, but it's worth some comments. I have to say that the movie was actually a good and it drew me in.... Until the last half hour or so. That is where my only problems with it begin.I think Smith and Moynahan made a good couple in terms of a movie like this. He being his usual Fresh Prince self but a bit mature, while she is the smarter an obviously higher breed of the two. I think they did have chemistry and it was interesting how their character's played off on each other. There was no romance between the two, however it would have been interesting though comical if it did happen. Though not likely, it would be good to see these two again together in a movie.The only real issue I have with I Robot was it's ending. Though it fit the story and I knew it was coming, the ending battle was just stupid and seemed to be put together quickly. When Smith and Moynahan are battling the robots on top of the USR tower, the movie became typical in terms of humans with guns vs machines.Had the ending been better, this would have been one of Will Smith's better movies. However, it's the ending that was given and there is nothing we can do about that. I would still watch it again, watching Will Smith be his usual self can be fun to watch sometimes. 7/10",7,0,1,27 December 2004
Wanted," CGI effects do not make a great movie
","Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a loser. He hates his job, his boss abuses him verbally, his best friend is sleeping with his girlfriend, and he has no money. This is just a short list of the problems that Wesley faces which, thanks to the power of pills, he is able to manage somewhat. His life is a empty shell and he drifts through the days as if he were in a daze.However, one night everything changes. When a beautiful woman, who is later known as Fox (Angelina Jolie) 'saves' him from an assassination attempt, Wesley finds his life turned upside down. It is then that he will learn the true meaning of fate and what it means to be a man.Sounds good, right? Well, the problem is that once Wanted reaches the point of no return and Wesley discovers who is supposed to be, Wanted then does a very unfortunate thing. Instead of using a good story with interesting characters to drive the movie, Wanted uses the tired idea of having CGI effects to tell the events of Wesley's transformation. Granted, Wanted is a summer movie and one expects such films to be over the top compared to past season movies. The problem though is that this is easily overdone and whatever story once existed is ignored for the sake of explosions and impossible chases.A another example would be the curving bullet scenes. Ignoring the laws of physics (we are never told how such thing can be done despite hints of a special power that a few have), Wanted relies on effects like this to amaze and to drive certain plot ideas. This is great but the whole movie cannot use this single idea to make the movie worth watching. This is portrayed as the pinnacle of the Franternity members's powers but we don't have enough to go on to believe that. There is little reason to go into the details of Wanted, and that includes the twist, because there isn't much to tell. This is too bad because there were hints of some interesting ideas like the question of fate and free will. Are we responsible for our actions? Is it moral to kill 1 to save a 1,000 as Fox tells Wesley? And what about this secret order known as the Fraternity? Lead by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) we are not told enough about the origins and working of the Fraternity to really care. How was it formed? We know it trusts a loom for a secret language but how has the group survived for so long without being detected? Once more a good movie would have told us these details instead of focusing only on CGI.CGI effects do not make a great movie. Wanted, like so many others, is entertaining but not to the level of being remembered years from now.6/10",6,3,9,5 July 2008
Disturbia," A major plot hole limits an otherwise good thriller
","Kale (Shia Lebouf) is a teen struggling to cope with the death of his father as well as the typical struggles of school and social life. After hitting his Spanish teacher during class, Kale is sentenced to three months house arrest with the threat of facing a year in juvenile dentition should he screw up one more time. In order to ensure his cooperation with the sentence, he is given a monitoring device wrapped around his ankle which, as it turns out in Disturbia, is a major factor for what happens next.During his weeks of house arrest, Kale begins to notice something strange with one neighbor in particular. Mr. Turner (David Morse), begins showing signs that he may have something to do wit the recent deaths of local women. Kale, who has taken up the hobby of voyeurism in order to pass the time, convinces himself more and more that Mr. Turner is hiding something and thus turns his now hobby into an obsession of proving what he believes to be true.However, Kale's spying on the neighbors does bring one benefit. Ashley (Sarah Roemer), has recently moved next door to Kale who enjoys her many swimming times and yoga practices through his binocular lens. In real life this would lead to more trouble but in Disturbia Kale gains a new friend who, along with his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), becomes convinced that Mr. Turner is indeed a murderer and that they can prove it. Ashley is the typical hard to get love interest that all socially inept guys dream of while Ronnie is the standard side kick friend who is good for laughs but not really worth more beyond that. The characters may not be deep but for Disturbia they work. The question of course is how they can prove it and this is where Distrubia falls. A seemingly random and pointless attack on Kale's mother Julie (Carrie-Ann Moss) after she attempts to explain her son's behavior after an apparent break in attempt at his house, later leads to Mr. Turner confronting Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie. The attack makes no sense because if Mr. Turner had simply let Julie leave without attacking her then there would have been nothing Kale or the others could have done about him. Kale was facing criminal charges and without him Ashley and Ronnie would have stayed far away from Turner. The climax is forced and can't escape the feeling that it is rushed without any real reason except to end the movie with a substantial conclusion.I didn't expect much when I started watching Disturba and eventually found myself entertained as the movie continued. Unfortunately, Disturbia like so many other thrillers finds that it can only end with a stereotypical confrontation that leaves much to be desired. Disturbia is entertaining but falls short in its most crucial moments is thus forgettable in the long run. 6/10",6,0,4,11 August 2007
The Butterfly Effect," The best movie ever concerning 'time travel' and it's effects
","When I went into to The Butterfly Effect, I wasn't sure what to expect. I actually had never heard of the movie until my sister said something about Aston Kutcher being in a Time Traveling movie. Perplexed at the thought, I decided to risk it and see for myself what this was about.I can honestly say that The Butterfly Effect is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It was well acted, written, directed, and it actually made you think about what the characters were doing and how they reacted. It's one of the few movies where I actually didn't want it to end, that's how involved I was becoming in the alternate lives Kutcher was creating for his friends..... And for himself. I actually cared what happened to him and the rest of the characters, always wondering what would happen after Kutcher changed one aspect of the plot's history after another.The aspect of the story that captured me the most was how well the co-stars were able to act in their alternate lives. If Amy Smart, Elden Hensen, and William Scott Lee failed to show how their characters were effected by actions of Kutcher then the whole movie would have failed. Like Cold Mountain, it was the supporting cast that helped make this movie. Another aspect that made the movie succeed was the fact that it stayed true to the idea of 'change one thing, change everything'. Even the most minor detail, or should I say Kutcher's lack of thought of what his next plan to save his friends would be, only caused more problems for the very people he cared the most about. Honestly, this is one of the best movies I have seen in the theaters, and the only one I was waiting to buy once it came out on DVD.",10,0,2,20 October 2004
District 9," Moving and powerful, District 9 is the best movie of the year
","Aliens are not new to movies. We have seen them countless time either invading, killing, or enslaving humanity. That there is still room for an original story about an alien 'invasion' shows that creative thought still exists within the movie world. District 9 is a reminder that even the most ordinary of sounding plots can still deliver. One will not see a major star or large budget. Peter Jackson is the only real known name with District 9 but even his presence is forgotten as the plot moves forward. The best movies of the year, District 9 is easily the standout movie of the summer.South Africa becomes host to almost one million alien survivors of a ship that suddenly appears in the skies above Johannesburg. The United Nations and South Africa hand control over the aliens directly to a corporation known as MNU which, along with caring for the aliens, is also interested in their weaponry. It is discovered that that alien technology can only work with their DNA so humans are unable to use them. Placed into District 9, a slum that separates the aliens from the human population which fears them, the aliens are subjected to a life not too different from those who also suffer such poverty. Wikus Van De Merwe(Sharlto Copley) is an uninteresting cubicle worker for MNU who is also the son-in-law of one of the major corporate owners of the company. When he is promoted to lead an eviction of the aliens from from District 9 where they were placed, he sees a chance at having a better future and a real career. The Prawns, as the aliens are known, earn no sympathy from him. Humans see them mostly as a problem that sucks away resource and breed crime. Wikus has the same mentality and has little ethical concerns about cheating the Prawns out of what little they already own.That changes the day he arrives to serve the evictions. Suddenly sprayed by an strange alien chemical, Wikus finds himself transforming into one of the Prawns. Not only this is distributing to one who was as bigoted as himself, but it also drives MNU to hold him captive. His arm, which was the first to transform, is able to use the Prawn weaponry which makes him suddenly the most valuable man in the world. If MNU can discover how to transfer this biotechnology into humans then that will make them one of the most powerful corporations in the world.Wikus, escaping and finding a place of hiding within District 9 itself, discover the chemical he found was the necessary fuel for Prawn shuttle which has remained hidden for years. Realizing how oppressive he had once been, Wikus joins with the Prawn who developed the fuel in not only an assault on MNU's headquarters but also a final stand in District 9 itself. It is the final scenes that make District 9 the most powerful because we see one of the most touching conversions seen in a story. From seeing the Prawns as simple creatures that can be ignored, Wikus sees their oppression as a cause worth fighting for even if it means losing his own life. If there is a small complaint then it is that we never really learn more about the Prawns and why they were made so sick in the first place. Then there is the matter of leaving aliens in the hands of a private corporation. Would the United Nations leave such a duty to a group of businessmen? It seems unlikely, but this does not subtract from the movie too much. District 9 is easily a commentary on the affairs of humans. That the Prawns would land in a country such as South Africa is evidence that the writers were attempting to say something about society as a whole. The barbarity of MNU and humans against those who are different compares to human prejudice against other humans. South Africa, once more, has experienced this throughout its history of being a colony and since independence. One cannot but feel a sense of the injustice delivered to the Prawns without thinking back up the injustices that humans continue to deliver to each other.The question District 9 asks is how would aliens change humanity. Would humans be better or worse? Unlike other invasion movies, District 9 shows that human reaction may be one that is not so different in terms of dealing with those who are not the same. Prejudice, that human emotion so common in all nations, may still be very well alive when it comes to those from a different world. That, it seems, is the real tragedy of District 9.10/10",10,6,13,15 August 2009
2012," Melodramatic movie that is everything it promised to be
","The end of the world is upon us again and this time humanity's greatest enemy happens to be the sun, the earth's crust, and some tsunami waves that have the power to destroy entire countries. 2012 is the latest mega disaster movie using the best special effects centered upon a melodramatic plot that is everything one expected it to be. While this isn't necessarily bad, it doesn't make a great movie.Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is another dad struggling to come close to his kids Noah (Liam James), and Lily (Morgan Lily), even though they now live with their mother Kate (Amanda Peet) and her new doctor boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). The relationship between Jackson and his estranged family is what one would expect between a father trying to do the right thing and a mother hoping that her ex will at least remember to pick them up when he's supposed to. Jackson himself is a struggling writer whose lack of fame and books sold has only further weakened his already low self esteem.As if Jackson's problems weren't enough, it turns out that humanity is facing its final days. Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Washington politician Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) discover that the world is going to be destroyed through a series of solar flares and massive weakening of the earth's crust. Helmsley, ever the humanist, sees a chance to try to help everyone while Anheuser sees only the possible diplomatic problems and financial problems that trying to save humanity would bring. They are two sides of the same coin facing a problem that threatens the whole world. The solution, it is hoped, is the construction of a series of massive ships that will contain the best (that is the rich enough to afford a seat) of humanity and remaining animal life. 2012 never explains how such a low number of survivors, especially those who are rich and spoiled, could save humanity, but it works at least for this kind of plot. 2012 follows a predictable plot with scenes of cities being destroyed, floods wiping out entire continents, and massive amounts of CGI death. While impressive on a big screen, the plot itself wears thin half way through. Of course we know that Jackson will reunite with his family and that there will be a spectacular ending that of course will defy all logic. The amount of scientific nonsense during the first half of the movie was enough to make one think that 2012 really should have been a cartoon. The fact that Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser both decided to focus on father trying to redeem himself to his family during the end of the world is less than original. Focusing on the struggles of Dr. Helmsley at least would have given some more intellectual and moral depth to the plot. Not a bad movie, but 2012 isn't more than one would expect it to be. In reality, the only reason to watch it is because of the CGI and not because of some deep scientific or moral idea. A disaster movie yes, but nothing really more.7/10",7,1,7,13 November 2009
Gran Torino," Not the story of a car, but of two unlikely friends on the same road
","Gran Tarino is the story not of a car but of a man who discovers that there is a meaning to his life. The problem isn't that his life is difficult. The problem is that he sees no reason to enjoy life. A dead wife, distant kids, and a neighborhood falling apart around him, give him the idea that there isn't much to live for. It will be two unlikely friends who will change his mind.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is bitter. Alone and single, living in the house he has called home for years, he can only sit and watch as the world around him descends into what he sees as madness. Immigrant families moving in around him, gangs running around his neighborhood, and his own sickness, leave him little to hope for. Every neighborhood has that one old man who is angry and Walt is very much the local angry recluse who would rather use racial slurs than smile and say hello. Walt also has little problem sharing his feelings about Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), the priest his wife confided in before her death. Not only does Walt seems to hate Asian ethnic groups, he hates religion and devout priests.Next door a Hmong immigrant family has moved in. Shy and timid Thao (Bee Vang), and his bold sister Sue (Ahney Her), live with their widowed mother and attempt to fit into both Hmong and American culture. The problem is that when a local Hmong gang attempts to 'recruit' Thao, they find themselves on the defense. It is then that their paths will cross with their racist neighbor who will become a kind of father figure and hero not only to them and their family but also the local Hmong community.Gran Tarino is a story about redemption. Not only for Walt, whose bitterness begins to fade as he slowly befriends first Sue and then Thao, but also for Thao himself who finds himself forced to redeem his honor after his attempt to steal Walt's Gran Tarino. The two are opposite in almost every way but they will learn from each other important truths that both needed to discover. Walt, insensitive to cultures different from his own, will discover that he enjoys spending time with immigrants he once despised. Thao will learn from Walt courage and the strength to stand up to those around him. Walt will also learn that his past experiences in the Korean War, experiences that have haunted him to this day, no longer have to be the burden they always have been.Some have complained about the acting by the Hmong actors and actresses used. However, there was a sense of cultural realness in the use of Bee Vang, Ahney Her, and the other Hmongs. The use of these new actors and actresses along with the experience of Clint Eastwood was a contrast that worked well for Gran Tarino. Walt's character seemed more real in dealing with kids and not professional actors. The dialogue was more valid and seemed realistic in terms of the cultural and age differences.There is some plot weakness that holds back Gran Tarino from being a notable classic. The conflict with the gang feels tacked on at times and distracts from the character development of Walt and Thao. Clint Eastwood's direction is notable, but the writing itself is weak in terms of trying to create a more vivid conflict. A more powerful conflict would have been Walt dealing with his own cancer and his struggling relationship with his two sons. Walt's death is a Christ like moment where he is the savior for Thao and Sue but also the one being saved himself. A touching ending, but one that felt forced.One of the best films to showcase Clint Eastwood's talent as an actor and director, Gran Tarino is worth watching and good ending to a career that has lasted over three decades. Not a perfect movie, but one that will be remembered as one of Clint's most humane stories.8/10",8,3,10,10 June 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Cruise should known better
","After watching this movie I can only conclude that John Woo only wanted nothing more then a typical Hollywood action movie with a beautiful girl, lots of 'neat' explosions, and pointless chasing around with cars and other vehicles. Other then that, I can't see why this movie would have even been considered by the studio that gave its money for this over the top and overblown experience.I am sorry; John Woo should not direct such things as this. Everything from the camera direction, dialogue, and especially the stunts ranked on a level that would see in a B rated moving trying to be something more then it actually was. However, this wasn't a B movie and still it resorted to such tactics.The worst Tom Cruise movie I have yet to see.Don't bother.1 out of 10",1,2,4,7 June 2005
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight reigns despite a disjointed effort
","Batman Begins returned the Dark Knight to the true realm which he belongs. Nolan's Batman is every bit the dark and brooding hero who finds himself torn by the memory of his parents, vengeance, and the conflict he finds himself facing alone as he stands between the worst criminals of Gotham and its citizens. Christian Bale's portrayal is memorable and truly is the best representation of who Batman should be in every way.It has been a year since the defeat of Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow. The criminals of Gotham have found themselves under a never ending siege as Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) continues his personal crusade. This time the major gangs and mob have been broken and forced to hide from the night as Batman hunts them down one by one. While there are always battles to be found, Batman has won the streets for the people of Gotham.He is not alone in his struggle. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckart) is also out to destroy the criminal element that has ruled Gotham for so long. Daring, popular, and determined, Dent is as hard on criminals in the court as Batman is on the streets at night. By his side is Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is as determined as he is to bring down the criminals who have made so many in Gotham cower in fear. However, her past relationship with Bruce and new relationship with Harvey, complicates an already delicate situation between her and Bruce. In the future it will have dangerous consequences for all three.The law of cause and effect comes into play when a mysterious scarred and painted criminal calling himself the Joker (Heath Ledger) appears. First seen as obnoxious by the existing criminal leadership of Gotham, Joker soon surpasses and replaces them as the most dangerous threat Gotham has seen since Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow. His terror will include everything from murder, robbery, kidnapping, and terrorism. If Batman is a one man army for law and justice, the Joker is a one man army of death and chaos who will not be stopped.The two collide head on and Gotham pays the price. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) leading the major crime unit of Gotham and Dent do their best to control the damage. However, Gordon and Dent find themselves unable to cope with the rising threat of the Joker who soon turns the city upside down in his rampage. The city is unable to deal with the Joker and soon the population of Gotham finds itself held hostage to the Joker's destructive urges. The police are crippled, the government nearly broken, and Batman himself finds himself struggling to defeat the Joker before he burns the whole city down around them both. This is Gotham's darkest hour and Batman may be unable to return the city to the light. The Dark Knight is stunning in almost every scene as we watch Batman soar, fall, and ride through the streets of Gotham to Hong Kong. The drama between Bruce, Rachel, Dent, Gordon is complex but works. This is a personal drama besides being an action movie and it works well. Bruce's personal transformation, and conflict between his desire of protecting Gotham and Rachel, is a perfect evolution from his trials during Batman Begins. Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) return as aides but also voices of conscience for Bruce who support but also challenge Bruce to continue his mission. The problem, though, comes in Nolan's disjointed direction. Unlike Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is unable to bring its many plots together to a conclusive end. There is so much going on that the Dark Knight bounces around so much that it doesn't focus well until the latter half of the movie. The transformation of Harvey Dent into Two Face occurs at the right time but then ends before we can enjoy it. Batman's sudden act of heroic sacrifice in that he becomes the 'criminal' to save Harvey's reputation seems well meaning but rushed and not convincing. Wasn't he already an outcast who many didn't trust besides Gordon? Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker will forever mark the highlight of that character's existence. However, in what amounts to a heresy, I would argue that Liam Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul was an even more interesting villain whose goal was more complex and more of a threat than the Joker's. Mindless death and destruction for anarchy is interesting but in the end of the day that is all what it is.The Dark Knight reigns despite a disjointed effort and the tragedy is that this will be Ledger's final role. The Dark Knight isn't a perfect movie but it is a excellent tribute to an actor who will be missed.8/10",8,2,5,19 July 2008
Taken," An action movie that stands out
","Taken is an action movie that stands out not because of great writing, or directing, but because it is an enjoyable film that shows that pure entertainment still works today. One doesn't need a 'best movie nomination' hanging over a movie for it to be enjoyable or a budget of over one hundred million dollars. Taken reminds us that the basic plots and action scenes can still work to entertain and create a plot that can stand on its own.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA agent who finds that his most difficult mission is to stay a part of his distant daughter's life. Kim (Maggie Grace) is a spoiled teenage girl whose mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen) does her best to not only shelter her but also keep Bryan out of her life. Bryan himself knows this but patiently waits for the time when he can be there for Kim in order to make up for the lost years he spent around the world. Her 17th birthday is a chance to do that but also reminds him that Kim belongs to a world where he has no place despite his hopes.Kim's trip to Paris is a dream vacation that will let her see Europe. However, when she is kidnapped by a gang of Albanians, Bryan discovers that his old skills are needed once more as he hunts down those responsible for her daughter's disappearance. Lenore herself pleads for Bryan to bring their daughter back and that is he swears he will do. It is then that he discovers a secret that is traced by to a friend and a corruption with the French government.Bryan spends most of the movie searching Paris and destroying the Albanians who kidnapped not only his daughter but other girls who are later sold into slavery. One can argue that some of the skills used by Bryan are not realistic and that the action scenes are clichéd. What stands out perhaps most of all is Bryan's use of voice technology to identify one specific Albanian which forces us to ask if the CIA is really that powerful to track and identify even a minor criminal. However, in comparison to Bond or the Bourne movies with their over the top technology, is there really a difference? Liam Neeson is a convincing agent and shows that he is still one of the top actors. Maggie Grace was not as believable as a 17 year old but she played her small part of being a kidnapped daughter well for what its worth. Taken is a movie that remind us that good movies still exist aside from major releases and that one doesn't need an 'original' concept to entertain.8/10",8,0,0,18 May 2009
Avatar," A spiritual experience that is more than a movie
","Avatar is a rare movie. Not only is it a stunning example of CGI, excellent writing, and acting that truly brings characters alive, Avatar is a movie that has a story worth telling. Today we are surrounding with movies, especially science fiction, of repeated stories of alien invasions, war, battles, etc., Rare is the movie that has all of these but actually has a story with telling within the CGI and visuals. Avatar is that movie.The year is 2154 and humanity has begun colonizing other worlds. Pandora is a world rich with resources and former marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen to replace his brother on a mission that would hopefully change humanity's role on the world. Crippled though not defeated in spirit, Jake is willing to do anything that could get him back the ability to use his legs and the Avatar program may be just that and perhaps something more.His arrival to Pandora opens up a world that is beyond imagination. Working with Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who makes her disdain towards Jake openly, Jake is thrown into the Avatar program where he mentally takes the form of one of the Na'vi who are the native people of Pandora. At first seeing his mission as a marine would, Jake has no problem gathering intelligence for Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who leads the military contractor wing that provides security for the mining operations on Pandora.Jake realizes that there is something more to Pandora and the Na'vi once he befriends Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). He becomes accepted by her tribe slowly once he begins a series of rituals that teach him not only how to understand the Na'vi, but to become one. Jake one day realizes that he is torn between his loyalty to his own race and marine identity and his new found people, and love, for Pandora. The battle that comes is one that will not only decide if Pandora will survive, but also if Jake will remain the man he once was. Pandora, a world of beauty and innocence, is facing its greatest challenge and Jake becomes the only man, and Na'vi, able to save it.There is a spiritual theme that runs through Pandora. The idea of environmentalism and new age thought runs through the Avatar but not in a way that is forced or condescending. Unlike other movies that preach a message, Avatar lets the idea of defending what is pure run freely and it is this that makes James Cameron's writing one of the best this year. No matter your religious beliefs, there is a spiritual message that is in Avatar and one can compare the corruption that humanity brings to Pandora much as sin did to the Garden of Eden. There are those who will not like this but that is okay. Even if you don't enjoy the ideology behind Avatar, the movie is still one of the best this year. James Cameron deserves best credit for what is one of the most original movies ever made.10/10",10,7,15,18 December 2009
The Descent," Terror Lives in the Darkness
","A group of friends out on vacation in the United States face what hides in remote cave deep within the mountains of rural North Carolina. While not a big budget film in anyway and lacking any major stars on this side of the Atlantic, The Descent manages to give a good horror film through suspension and not special effects or lots of blood as most American horror focus on.Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald) lost her family a year ago due to a tragic accident. In an attempt to find healing, she agrees to a vacation in the states with friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (Myanna Burning), and Holly (Nora-Jane No one). A group of experienced outdoors women, a trip in the mountains is something that should be without too much challenge or difficulty. Indeed, there is little to give warning for the terror they are about to face in the depths of the earth. What makes The Desecent so good is that there really is little to it. Most of the film consists of Sarah and the others crawling through small caverns and roping over and down rock walls. When they do come face to face with the horror of the cave (troll like creatures), the movie consists with more crawling through caverns, falling into water pools, and/or being torn apart. A simple plot which actually works because The Descent demands really little from the story itself to give suspense. The suspense centers around the darkness that constantly surrounds them and the feeling that the deeper the go within in the earth, the more they are certain to face death. It was as if the cave itself was the main part of the script and everything else was written around it with that idea in mind. Another positive was the actresses themselves. While none are major stars or even well known in the US, each held to their part. Again, it shows that a good movie doesn't need major stars to promise a good story. That Hollywood misses this so often says something more about the industry than those who write stories. Star power, in most cases, it what most movie center around and it as interesting to see one good movie where this was not the case.If there is one complaint to be made its that the ending left more to be desired. While it is expected that none of them would escape, the movie could have been given more of a solid ending. The discovery that Juno was having an affair with Sarah's husband before his death was rather obvious but did little for the story overall because we really don't know much about it before the end. It would have been good to know more of the background of this relationship if the director and writer wanted it to be a more important conflict between Sarah and Juno.A good movie if one wants a quick scare and a good example of how a horror movie should be made. 8/10",8,1,3,27 December 2006
The Happening," An underwhelming 'disaster' movie
","Humanity faces many dangers to its existence. War, plague, nuclear weapons, global warming, and a host of other problems haunt the minds of millions around the world. While the list is extensive as it now stands, M. Night Shyamalan believes he has found something else to add to our collective unease....And, in doing so, he and The Happening fall flat.Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a dedicated biology teacher in Philadelphia high-school. His life revolves around his students and his neurotic wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) which both provide for a stable, if perhaps rather uninteresting, urban life. With his close friend and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), Elliot has a comfortable life that is stable as it is predictable. Even rumors that Alama is unhappy with the marriage, rumors of course that Julian is more than ready to encourage to 'help' his friend Elliot, isn't enough to shake Elliot out of his self imposed scientific mindset which of course all high-school biology teachers rely upon.That is until something unexplained happens in New York City. Without warning, or explanation, dozens of people suddenly become disoriented as listless. Even more terrifying is that those affected begin committing suicide on a massive scale. Self inflicted gun shot wounds, impalement's, and throwing themselves off high rise buildings are but a few of the way that dozens, soon to be hundreds and then thousands, end their own lives. What's worse is that whatever it is that is occurring seems to be quickly spreading out from New York and affecting the entire Northeast of the United States.While no one has a reason or explanation as to why this is happening, Elliot, Alma, Julian and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) escape the city along with anyone else who can get out. However, they soon discover that there is no escaping from 'the happening' that is destroying the populations of some of the largest urban areas in the country. Abandoned in a small rural town outside the city, the four and the rest of the train's passengers discover that they are on their own and expected to find their own way through whatever it is that is forcing thousands to destroy themselves.The plot above sounds like an exciting thriller that would push the audience to be engaged with the plot and the characters who we would of course care about. However, unfortunately that does not happen (no pun intended). Instead of an intelligent plot and deep characters, The Happening is instead full of poor attempts at humor, bad dialog and unintentional laughs. It is explained that the plant kingdom has somehow decided to declare war on man and that by releasing a toxin in the air it has unleashed a weapon of mass destruction where there is no defense against. There is no nothing more dangerous sounding than the evolution of plants, right? The Happening centers mainly around Elliot, Alma, and Jess running from one field to the next while Elliot tries to find a scientific reasoning in order to keep them all alive. What this amounts to is running from the wind (how is that possible?) and staying in small groups because the plants 'know' where the larger groups are. As with all disaster movies there are encounters with those who don't want to help and desperate situations where the characters resort to things they otherwise would never have done. The problem is that once we know what is causing the happening to occur it all seems so futile and even amusing. The wind blowing in the trees? Well, that means your days are numbered.The Happening is a good idea that unfortunately had little to offer in substance and whether or not there was an intentional environmental message behind it is irrelevant. There are many things we need to worry about but thankfully plants trying to kill us with toxins isn't one of them. 5/10",5,1,6,13 June 2008
The Departed," Good thriller but not worthy of best picture
","The Departed creates the scenario of deception on two separate levels but involving the same group of people who, whether they know it or not, are on a path of destruction. With Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, and Martin Sheen, The Departed has an all star cast that creates a plot that brings one into a world of murder, lies, and deception that makes up Boston's underworld.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is used as an undercover officer to infiltrate the circle of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholoson) and to gain enough evidence to lead to an arrest. However, unknown to Costigan and his superiors, Boston's elite organized crime branch has been infiltrated by Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who while as a child gained the trust of Costello after the older man becomes a near surrogate father figure. When Sullivan becomes a Massachuchests trooper, he serves Costello loyally by providing what information he can to protect Costello's operation from the police and the FBI.The conflicts brought up by The Departed are many and often cross each other in their complexity. Costigan is an honest man placed into the role of a thief, liar, and even murderer while Sullivan is the criminal who is forced to play as the law. Over a year the two eventually realize that the forces attempting to protect and to destroy Costello are deeper then either could have realized. The love interest of counselor Madolyn, who neither Costigan or Sullivan realize has become involved with both of them, adds an extra layer of tension between the two. Much as in the fog of war, Costigan and Sullivan are two opponents who find themselves fighting but without a clear idea of who it is and even what it is they are struggling against.Now to the problem. The Departed was a good movie and was well written and directed. However, the title of best picture of the year does not belong to this movie for at least one good reason. And this is Jack Nicholson whose character more or less resembles the role he played in As Good as It Gets except that he murders people and sells technology to the Chinese. I could not believe that Costello, who we are to believe is this genius underworld criminal hated and feared by the police and those who know him, was really who he claimed to be. Often he comes off more as comic relief in his conversations with both Costigan and Sullivan. The character was unbelievable and because of this the award of best picture should not have been given.I would never say The Departed is a bad movie. However, I feel that the ultimate source of conflict, that is Frank Costello, was not strong enough or even reason enough for the plot that followed around him. The twists were well done writing was strong but these alone were not enough to make up for the character of Frank Costello. Costigan's and Sullivan's own conflict, while intense and well acted, were not enough to give such a high review and award.What should have won best picture? Letters from Iwo Jima.8/10",8,0,1,5 March 2007
War of the Worlds," 'Family Values' meets alien invasion?
","I must say that I am one of those people who is tired of seeing 'family values' thrown into every major conceivable plot. It is not that I am anti-family however, it seems that Hollyood today is set on making every movie a Hallmark Channel special plus whatever plot is being pushed in a movie. The Day After Tomorrow is a good example of placing an awkward 'family' twist and placing it into a plot it shouldn't really belong, at least in a major way. And, unfortunately, War of the Worlds makes the same mistake.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a somewhat dead-beat dad who can't really take care of his kids. While he plays the role convincingly, I am convinced that this was the wrong role for this movie. I am sorry, I watch a movie like War of the Worlds for destruction, terror, and more destruction. Not a dad attempting to redeem himself in the eyes of his spoiled children. This is where the problems of War of the Worlds being and, again, unfortunately do not correct themselves.Dakota Fanning, playing a young and impressionable Rachel Ferrier, is the second star of this movie. Though the youngest of the Ferrier children, she is the most memorable and most interesting. Through her reaction (and literally the expression of her eyes) do we feel the impact of the invasion. I can honestly say that Fanning played the most interesting character She was simply more interesting because her reactions, unlike the stale reactions of Ray Ferrier (more on this later) were more realistic for a situation like this. Had this movie been developed and centered mainly around her then perhaps War of the Worlds could have been a better movie.Justin Chatwin, on the other hand, plays Robbie Ferrier who is the traditional rebellious teen who doesn't want to listen to anyone. Dull and more irritating, Chatwin's character distracts more then adds. Had he been more of a side role then he would have been more interesting. But he's not and thats one of the other problems.Simply put, War of the Worlds fails because it's concept is placed more on this family then the actual invasion itself. We see more of Ray attempting to babysit his kids then the Aliens themselves. A frustrating situation because this is supposed to be a big CGI summer movie, or so I thought. We see Ray driving across the countryside trying to keep his kids calm while we have little concept of what else is going on around the world besides the sight of refugees wandering around. Then we see Ray run around with his kids from loud explosions and flashes though of course we can't actually see the real fighting. I felt that this was a play off M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' in that suspense was built because we couldn't see what was going on. Here it fails.At one point, Robbie is able to breakaway from Ray and attempt to join the US military in a pitched battle which of course turns into a fiasco. It appears that Robbie is burned to ash and that Ray must cope with losing a son and the emotional effects that always brings.Here is where the whole family plot of this movie could have redeemed itself. We are led to believe that Robbie is lost, one of countless, to the aliens. However, we learn that he is alive and well and has actually made it to the rest of the family which was what they were trying to do all along. Ray's fears are not realized and they can be one big happy family again.Sorry, this is bad writing and only deflates this movie further. Had Robbie not survived the Ferriers, along with most everyone else in the world, would of have had to struggle to rebuild their lives. It would have been a more memorable ending for Ray to explain to his former wife how their only son died while there is nothing he could do about it. That he was one of many to be sacrificed to a power and force they will probably never understand.However, again, this is asking too much.Is War of the Worlds a bad movie? No. What little we see of the aliens in their tripods, which are impressive, is enjoyable. The scenes of the tripods scooping up humans and vaporizing them is worthwhile, though again it would have been better if we could have seen more of it. And, despite the stale character of Ray Ferrier, his attempts to defend his family are admirable. Rachel is memorable for her reactions as is the rather out of place Tim Robbins who plays a man bent on fighting the war his own way. I wouldn't call this a waste, simply a disappointment.6 out of 10",6,2,6,1 July 2005
Hancock," A troubled hero discovers who he really is
","John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your ordinary superhero. Drunk, angry, and bitter, Hancock's actions are often as destructive as they are helpful. Los Angeles feels that having Hancock is more dangerous and expensive and it is understandable that most, if not the entire city, hates him. Hancock is more than willing to return the feeling even though he still tries to help (and fails badly).Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) is not a superhero but he is trying to save the world in his own way. A PR man, Ray spends his days trying to convince corporations that helping the world, instead of just trying to make a profit, is the right thing to do. The trouble is that of course no one listens to him and Ray is easily ignored.These two lives were separate and on different paths until one day when Hancock rescues Ray. It is then that Ray, through part gratitude, part opportunity, and part sympathy, decides to make it his mission to reinvent Hancock into a true hero that everyone will love. Of course, Ray's wife Mary Embrey (Charlize Theron) is not to excited about having the drunken Hancock around their house and son Aaron (Jae Head) but Ray has made his mind up regardless of her feelings.Hancock is a unique idea in that a superhero is held responsible for the damage and chaos he causes much as a regular person would be responsible. Hancock himself is hated, sued, and eventually threatened with prison because of the destruction he reaps across the city. Traditional superheros are often given free reign to do what they want to do but Hancock instead lives in a world where no matter what you do, good intentions or not, someone will always complain. Is Hancock a new classic for the superhero genre? I would say no because of a certain plot twist that turns an otherwise good idea in a melodrama that distracts from the good things, such as cynical humor and real character development, that the movie had going for it. The critics have constantly complained about this and they were right to make it an issue. I won't go into too much detail but everyone now knows that Mary herself is a superhero or at least has the same powers that Hancock does. This wasn't really a twist since if you watched the trailers you could guess that she would have something to do with the conflict of the story. The real problem is the strange 'myth' created to explain the reason why Hancock and Mary exist and how they affect each other. Was this needed? No, and it is tragic that Hancock decided to include it. The entire feel of the movie was changed and not for the better. I can only wonder why the writers and director thought this was necessary as if they didn't have a good thing going already. I suspect it had something to do with having an explanation for Hancock as well as to give the possibility of an enemy who he would have to face. The problem was that Hancock didn't really need any of these because it wasn't a standard superhero movie.Hancock is not a bad movie and there are some good ideas put into it. Jason Bateman is a face we need to see more often in major movies and hopefully Hancock will push his popularity higher. Perhaps him, more than anyone else, will be the one to benefit from the summer popularity of Hancock.7/10",7,1,2,5 July 2008
Lord of War," The morality of gun running
","What happens when an 'everyday' American decides to leave his boring existence for something more interesting, exciting, and profitable? Well, he becomes a gun runner of course! This is the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) who, if we are to believe him, is just a man doing his job like anyone else. Supplying guns to the world's dictators, tyrants, and rebel armies without the blink of an eye as if he were selling cars instead of weapons. An everyday job that he assures us that someone else would be doing if he weren't doing it. A point that he stresses throughout the movie and one that becomes the main moral point of the whole movie.Through their operations in Europe, the Middle East, Afganistan and other such places, Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) find fortune and even infamy. However, while Vitaly drugs himself out due to what is most likely a guilty conscience over the fact that he has aided in the deaths of countless people, Yuri finds himself drawn more into the world that smuggling and profit. It becomes him and soon he has nothing but the 'business' that he runs.This changes when he has the chance to finally seduce the woman of his dreams, Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). Having the money, the power, and the connections that he has, he has is able to convince her that he has the fortune that supposedly someone her of caliber deserves. Earning her love and marriage even though she later admits that she would 'rather not know' about what it is he really does to make his money. In a sense, she does what Vitaly does without the drugs. Ava would rather ignore the truth that the comfortable life she now knows is built on lies, deception, and possibly worse. Things begin to go wrong when Yuri becomes involved with Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker) of Sierre Leone. Also, the determination of young Interpool Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) brings in extra pressure which finally leads to the explanation of what Yuri really does to his then 'ignorant' wife Ava. The death of Vitaly at the hands of men loyal to Baptiste, and the loss of Ava, his son, and even his parents signals the near end of a life Yuri has struggled to maintain for decades. Only a sudden burst of 'support' from a unknown Pentagon official, who Yuri 'knows' through past dealings, is able to free Yuri from a life in prison for countless crimes ranging from smuggling to murder. Allowing him to continue his business of supplying weapons to those desire them in spite all that has happened to him. And here is where the moral of the story comes in. Even after everything he has witnessed, experienced, and lost, Yuri believes with all his heart that he has done nothing wrong. He is a businessman and nothing more. No thoughts of blood on his hands, or of those whom he has helped murder. And this is the point of Lord Of War. That is, there are those who really have no concept of wrong and right. Even when they have lost everything. 9 out of 10",9,1,2,17 February 2006
The Good Shepherd," A man who sold his soul
","Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon) is a young idealist who believes in America and its place in the world. He loves democracy and opposes anything that is a threat to his country and the way of life it has developed. Edward is true patriot who knows no moral barrier or cost that would prevent him from his duty. In him is an idealist to the utmost who is willing to sacrifice anything or anyone.And that is his problem.The Good Shepherd is a story about a man who sells his soul. Not to a religious belief, money, a woman, or anything that is physical or concrete. Edward Bell Wilson sells his soul to an 'idea' and he discovers that his choice has costs that he himself had not foreseen. In the end, The Good Sheperd is a tragedy for not just one man's life but countless others around him.Shown through a series of flashbacks staring from the early 1960's, Edward's story begins as a young student at Yale. After entering Skull and Bones, an elite club of spoiled students which allows him access to a close group of influential men, he finds himself offered the chance to to serve his country in Europe before America's entry into World War 2. Joining the 0SS, Edward enters the life of a spy and from there finds himself with a front row seat to the mid 20th century's most important events.However that is where the costs of his decision begin to mount almost immediately. Upon entry to Bones he meets Margaret Ann Russell (Angelina Jolie), a sister to one of his closest friends. A quick night of passion results in a pregnancy which forces Edward to sacrifice his relationship with Laura (Tammy Blanchard), a fellow Yale student, in order to marry Margaret. In doing so he loses perhaps the only woman he has loved and while finding himself in a loveless marriage which will have unintended consequences for the future. A pattern begins which will trap Edward and cause his relationship to his son Edward Jr. (Eddie Redmayne) to suffer. Edward sacrifices his personal love for personal responsibility but he remains distant from the reality that creates. The creation of the CIA by General Bill Sullivan (Robert De Nero) forces Edward into a world of fear and hostility between fellow agents, Soviet spies, and double agents. The overthrow of Guatemala ruler Jacob Arbenz, the failed Bay of Pigs operation, and the discovery of a possible spy within their own ranks draws Edward farther into the halls of power and international relations but also more away from his wife and son. He becomes a man with a mission but without a soul. He thinks and acts like a puppet whose strings are pulled from above while himself pulls those beneath him. There is no doubt or reason to believe that he is wrong or that he is acting in a way that is perhaps blind at best or morally empty at worst. He has become devoted to an idea and that idea is the CIA and the United States it attempts to serve.The greatest challenge to that belief is the discovery that his son's lover, a young Congolese woman, is a Soviet double agent who is perhaps responsible for the leaking of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Edward realizes that there no way he can allow that woman, who is now engaged to his son, into his family without the risk of more information being given to the Soviets. On her marriage day she pays the price of betrayal, without Edward Jr. knowing about it at first, after being forced from a plane during flight.It's this last move on Edward's part that reveals his true character more than any other action. Even as his son weeps in his arms at the news of his fiancée's death, he himself shows no real sign of remorse for the pain he has caused even if it was the right choice to make. He is a soldier and he knows what he must do, a man such as him is one who cannot be expected to do anything but what is expected of him. That makes Edward Bell Wilson, a man who can only see the world through the eyes of the CIA, a defender of freedom but also one who sacrifices his own without second thought.Is Edward Bell Wilson a good man? That is the question The Good Shepherd asks. The answer depends on who is asked and what that person values the most: freedom, love, or duty? 10/10",10,3,6,15 April 2007
Valkyrie," An historical drama that demands suspense but is unable to deliver
","Valkyrie is the story of the planned assassination of Adolf Hitler. Based on true events, as the movie reminds us, it the story of a missed chances, divided loyalties, devotion, and sacrifice. Unfortunately, Valkyrie the movie has trouble keeping up with the idea that these were men moved by desperate times to do desperate things in order to make sure their country survived. Part of the problem is that director Bryan Singer is unable to convince the audience to forget the historical ending of the coup leaders before the movie ends and thus Valkyrie is limited as soon as it begins. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a man who finds himself facing a war not only against the Allies, but also the Furher who he believes will destroy Germany. Every scene implies the sense of dedication Stauffenberg has to his country but also the tension he feels towards Adolf Hitler (David Bamber) and the officers responsible for Germany's defeats. After being wounded in North Africa, losing a hand, eye, and fingers from his one remaining hand, Stauffenberg carries a lasting memory and bitterness as to what Hitler has done not only to Germany but also to him as well as his family. A reunion with his wife Nina (Carice van Houten) and his children remind Stauffenberg what is at stake if Germany loses the war, a reality that seems very close to happening as the Allies move closer to Germany on three sides.Stauffenberg if recruited by Major General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) and General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) who are Wermarcht officers determined to replace Hitler. It is then that Stauffenberg soon takes over as the head of the operation to kill Hitler and to defeat the SS through an internal coup using an internal defense operation codenamed Valkyrie. If Hitler can be killed, and his circle of loyal officials and generals dealt with, then the war can be ended on honorable terms before Germany is destroyed.The problem is how to do this and this is where Valkyrie the movie is unable to deliver. Valkyrie is unable to build suspense in the plans to kill Hitler which is of course the core of what the plot is about. This is a major flaw despite otherwise good acting and excellent writing. We learn of the various ways this could go wrong and the various tensions amidst the coup leaders themselves who had different objectives and reasonings to kill Hitler. None of this, however, can support the plot if it lacks suspense which Valkyrie tries to give. Valkyrie spends most of its time showing the dedication of these men to their mission but is unable to make the audience really care. Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as Stauffenberg but he couldn't carry Valkyrie through. If more was spent perhaps focusing on his internal reasons for supporting the coup, and the fears he had for his family, then perhaps Valkyrie could have been more then what it was.A disappointing historical movie, Valkyrie does show that there were men who were willing to challenge Hitler even if it was during the years when Germany's defeat was unavoidable. The tragedy is that these few men were not enough to stop him.7/10",7,1,3,20 May 2009
V for Vendetta," 'MF' for Mixed Feelings
","After long delays and much hype, Alan Moore's impressive V for Vendetta has been released. Push back due to a main actor dropping out, and a host of other problems, V for Vendetta opened to an eager public wondering if this movie could live up to the standard given it. Also, would it be able to overcome the gossip and rumors that had been spoken of do to the problems with just filming it. Oh, and who can forget that Natalie Portman will have a shaved head? Will wonders never cease!? I cannot speak for everyone else since a movie like this will bring out different emotions and feelings over the portrayal of a 'terrorist' being a 'hero'. However, after several days of thinking upon V for Vendetta, and reading the graphic novel it is based upon, I have come up with my conclusions.Vendetta starts off with the brutal attempted assault on Evey (Natalie Portman) at the hand of the 'fingermen' (no pun intended). Government agents who enforce strict curfew laws and do other such draconian laws set up by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), who would win a Hitler look a like contest any day. When the fingermen are about to harm Evey, in comes a mysterious hero wearing a Guy Fawkes who of course saves Evey while beating up the fingermen.Evey, obviously taken back by a man who wears a mask, openly beats fingermen, and speaks in such a poetic way, learns that his name V (Hugo Weaving). Following him for a short 'engagement' she is stunned when the Old Bailey is destroyed right before her eyes. All the while V is conducting an 'orchestra' as music fills the streets of London on the very same loud speakers the government uses to inform the public of curfews.What happens next is a serious of further attacks on the state and those who harmed V in the past, the learning of what V's history is (though we never really know), the attempt of Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) to discover who V is and stop him while he discovers the truth behind the government and it's past actions, and the sudden transformation of Evey into a timid citizen into a freedom fighter with a shaved head. While this promises much, instead Vendetta fails and slowly comes to an uninteresting conclusion. Too much time is spent trying to portray an totalitarian state while not enough is spent showing how it is deal with. Most of V's actions, few that we see, are somehow supposed to topple a regime within a year. Again, seeing more of these actions and their means would have made this a bit more believable.Another factor which slowed the movie down in its plot was the 'torture' of Evey. Through a series of brutal interrogations, bad food, a note from a woman who was oppressed before she was, and eventual discover of courage Evey never knew she had, we learn that it was V himself was behind all of this. His attempt of showing that when Evey loses her fear, she gains strength. I understand the meaning behind this and what it was supposed to to do for Evey. However, being placed towards the middle/ending of the movie only caused it to lag. A better placement would have been to have Evey come to these conclusions much earlier without having the story go over much repeated information such as overcoming fear and holding onto freedom.In the end, V manages to strike a deal with one of Sutler's right-hand men who betrays the dictator to V's sense of justice. Of course, V then turns on this would be replacement and finishes off what we are to guess is the major leadership of the party and government. Parliament is blown up, everyone challenges the government, and freedom is restored even though V does not live to see the day.A moving story about freedom and oppression? I would have to say no. A plot drawn with not enough substance (Alan Moore might agree since he didn't like the movie) slows what could have been one of the better movies for 2006. It's not a bad movie, far from it. The acting is well done (especially Weaving's ability to speak in such a poetic way and in a convincing manner) as is the action sequences. Again, though, it proves to be nothing special. 6 out of 10",6,4,9,20 March 2006
