Miracle," Good movie, wrong title
",The title doesn't match the story because it's not miraculous given that Herb Brooks knew exactly what he was doing from having figured the Soviets out through extensive obsessive studying. That's why he insisted at the beginning that he was the man for the job; it's not like he winged it or just stuck with the same scheme the Americans had been using all along and somehow it merely finally happened.,6,2,5,8 August 2017
The Longest Yard," Overrated
","It's not funny, just silly. The humor's corny overall. I can picture a little kid having written this one. Adam's made funnier. It's not the acting, it's the dialogue and directing. Out of four stars, I'd give it one, for it's definitely sub-par. The original's better. The only good part is Here Comes the Boom. And I understand the ending's trying to make an @$$ of the warden but come on, it's obvious that even William Fitchner's character sure thought Adam Sandler was going for the gate to escape. ...And then he shoves the rifle at the warden upon the false alarm like he's such an idiot. The stupidest thing, though, is Adam deciding to stay in prison from a fellow inmate's insight. You don't throw your life away to metaphorically pop someone. You POPPED him, it's not like you negatively altered his LIFE. And how has it been worth 'every dam minute' of staying in prison when it's obvious he'll never change and isn't exactly crying about it every day? Your punch to his face he's clearly shaken off and forgotten about as easily as an itch that he simply scratched away.",3,1,1,3 September 2017
The Hangover," Hilarious except for a couple things
","Ken Jeong isn't funny. He's a former doctor and should've stuck to it. His humor's really corny, like a little kid's. Secondly, if Doug's locked on the roof of the hotel, why wouldn't he just keep yelling to civilization below? He would've been heard. Especially if a MATTRESS is hanging from the roof, it would cause attention/inquiry/investigation, not just ignored all day. My grand finale: why would he choose to cook in the sun for hours and hours when there are shady spots all over the place? It's not funny, it's just stupid and ridiculous.",5,1,1,10 August 2017
Gravity," Unrealistically thriller-typical
","I give this SOME rating for the acting and special effects. Now for my criticism: first, what keeps pulling George Clooney away when he's holding on by his foot? He explains that there's 'backspin'. I don't buy that. They're in SPACE. I think the script/dialogue is just making stuff up to get rid of him in order to have Sandra Bullock alone to make it more suspenseful. And of course the storyline would get rid of HIM instead of HER because it's even MORE suspenseful to have a FEMALE try to survive on her own than a male. You fear more for the character. Then, just because you successfully come back to the planet doesn't mean you're golden: of course she doesn't land in the middle of the ocean but conveniently right next to land, which makes up only 30% of the planet.",3,0,0,11 August 2017
The Impossible," Great story except for the end
","I give this one a so-so rating. The movie as a whole, up to the end, is excellent. The climax/end, though, is so typical and stupid. There's no reason for the oldest brother to close the curtain to give his mom some privacy before he wanders off and you knew that move would play a factor in a minute because of course the dad would walk by and not be quite curious enough to see who's behind it. Then, when the son sees his dad down below, walking away through the crowd, all he has to do is yell his name and his dad, along with everyone else, would hear him. Yelling 'Dad' would probably work, or even better, his name. He didn't have to keep wandering around the place silently until letting enough frustration build up in him to finally do it. Once he knows his dad's there, he should just start yelling for him, calling for him, and there would've been much less suspense and worry. That's just common sense.",5,0,1,18 September 2017
The Day After Tomorrow," The storyline could use some help
","Just like Dante's Peak, the climax is pointless. Dennis Quaid takes his buddies all the way out to 'save' his son and it didn't even really do anything but get one of them killed. And this is so thriller-typical!: Jake Gyllenhaal's babe cuts her leg, causing major infection, and when it jolts in sudden pain while collecting books from the shelf, the other girl asks if she's OK, to which she replies, 'Yeah, I'm fine.' You're NOT fine. You KNOW you're not. I'll never understand what the point is of characters ignoring their actual status and pretending to be 'fine' when they're anything BUT. They're just letting their problem snowball and in THIS movie, it would've KILLED her if everyone hadn't found out for themselves the hard way after awhile to then make a plan to get supplies from the passing ship. What's so hard or embarrassing about being forthcoming about your sudden health problem? Just speak!",4,1,5,8 August 2017
Alien," Outstanding idea except for a big flaw
","I liked almost everything about this movie. The build-up, suspense, effects, etc were terrific. Here's my problem: the stomach cannot be a womb. It's made to digest. It has ACID. What do you think causes heartburn? The stomach churns its contents like a washer. This is why males just aren't capable of reproduction, period. They don't have the bodily features.",5,0,3,4 August 2017
Elf," It was alright except for...
","the fact that Will Farrell's character is told at the North Pole that when he goes to civilization, if he sees gum on the ground or anywhere, don't eat it because it's not free candy; it's dirty. And then everybody cracks up, going 'Eeewww!' when he picks all the gum wads off the subway railing and eats them. Wasn't he just told minutes ago to not do that?",5,3,5,5 August 2017
Fargo," I love this movie, except for one thing
","This one problem isn't enough to bring my rating down from an 8 to 7 because it's not a big deal, I'm just saying: it occurred to me that Jerry just stopped by his father-in-law's office building to try to finalize the deal. So, how would his windshield be so iced over when he comes out? He doesn't work there--he works at the DEALERSHIP--so it's not like he was there all day with his car out in the lot for hours.",8,0,1,5 August 2017
The Thing," I like this one except for the beginning
","It's stupid how the wonderment of whether the U.S. just went to war with Norway after the opening shooting scene. Except for the guy who shot the foreigner through the window, they all could see how the foreigner wasn't after them, walking right past them with his rifle; he was after the dog. He'd even tossed the grenade away once he saw that the dog was around PEOPLE.",6,4,7,25 September 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," A big early flaw
","This is a very cool one except for a flaw early on. Shortly after they crash, the older sister sees a reflection of sunlight up on the distant hill and shows obvious concern and wonder but only for that moment, and then moves on and forgets all about it, which is pointless and unrealistic. She would speak up about it, not just keep it to herself in that moment and then forget about it. Later, the family keeps getting hints of a presence around (dog barking (the mom goes, 'Oh...there's...probably just some...rattlesnakes around.'), an obscene voice on the radio, and Bobby freaking out about their dad not back yet) and she's STILL forgotten about it. She even snaps at Bobby to get control of him, saying that they're out in the middle of nowhere, and then looks mesmerized with the expression, 'Are you serious...?' when he tells her they're not alone. During the part where she's watching the reflection, Bobby startles her as a joke and she gets irritated. What she realistically would then do is tell him to turn around and point it out to him.",2,0,1,14 August 2017
The Patriot," Waaaay overrated; why do you think Harrison Ford turned this down?
","'The Patriot' is hardly a 'patriot'. Even director Roland Emmerich admitted that the title doesn't make sense in correlation with the storyline since 'the patriot' is actually the least patriotic of everyone around him. He's the only one of the rebels who doesn't have any interest in fighting, being too much of a family man. Harrison called the storyline, when offered the lead role, some type of 'melodrama about one man's revenge'. It focuses too much on Benjamin Martin's personal revenge instead of the war as a WHOLE. Also, at the part where Tavington takes Gabriel prisoner to have him hanged, he never explains to Benjamin what 'the rules of war' are. When he asks him if he'd like a lesson about them, all that comes of it is Benjamin telling him that 'no lesson is necessary.'",3,1,4,13 August 2017
Collateral," Good movie except for one small thing
","I would've rated this one a 7 if it hadn't been for the beginning when Max is driving the woman. They argue over which route's the fastest way and he persuades her to trust him. When they get close, she goes, 'Go ahead, say it.' He asks, 'Say what?' She answers, 'That you were right.' He shouldn't ask that because it's a stupid question, because it's playing dumb. We all know what she means. Later, whether this is realistic or not is debatable: I'm just saying there's no point in the cops ordering Max with Vincent back to the garage immediately as they race off to the emergency call they receive because of COURSE he's not going to follow that order. The climax is stupid because it's too typical that the cell phone dies, and what Joe Schmoe is talking on the street corner in the middle of the night with a low battery? And just because the battery's low doesn't mean the line would break up as it doesn't have anything to do with reception. After Max shoots Vincent in the office, he quickly just grabs the girl and runs away to get away from him instead of sticking around to put him into submission and turn him in. Had he logically done so, the pursuit through the subway would've never happened.",6,3,4,3 October 2017
Aliens," Good movie overall; a solid sequel
","As I said about the first, though, a male cannot give birth. Also, the ending copies the first: it's assumed that the alien's left behind on the rock that blows up, so she's supposedly toast, but it turns out she somehow snuck onto the ship for more of a face-to-face confrontation with Sigourney. And just like in the first, she ultimately gets rid of her by forcing her out of the ship and into space.",5,2,8,4 August 2017
The Exorcist," Scary as hell, but...
","It's never explained why the Devil reacted violently to the tap water or didn't answer the priest about his mother's name, just vomited at him after a moment. And while it IS explained why he refused to pull the nightstand drawer out a second time, there's no reason for it--just do it.",5,0,10,15 September 2017
Alien vs. Predator," It was alright except for...
","Early on when the team finds the alien nest. They're all ready with their guns and go through too long of a premonition of the aliens about to jump out at them for it to be realistic that one successfully lands on the girl's face before she has time to react. And once that happens, how in the world would they ALL end up with face-huggers? That's a load of garbage. Also, the last predator had to catch and kill the alien that jumped out of the guy's stomach toward the end because the girl was too stupid to shoot him in his gut to kill it. She just walked away thinking she'd done a good job after the guy in his HEAD. Then, at the end, the predator never got face- hugged and just got the alien tail through his abdomen, so how would he have a live alien inside him? This is definitely a sub-par movie.",4,0,2,12 September 2017
No Country for Old Men," It wasn't that great, guys; a big early flaw
","No cop would ever just leave his prisoner on the bench in the lobby, handcuffed but not anchored to anything, and keep his back turned while he makes a phonecall. That's so movie-typical. Every thriller/horror that has a cop in the picture shows that scenario and no cop would be that dumb. It's common sense. Since this is, of course, how the movie kicks off and becomes a movie/story, it's not a good movie. Everything that happens thereafter (as in, 90% of the movie), shouldn't have. Even further, nobody being pulled over by a lit-up cop car would be so cooperative. For one, the guy knows he hasn't anything wrong so doesn't know why he's being pulled over. Secondly, the bad guy doesn't even remotely resemble a real cop. Third, a person would repel when the 'cop' refuses to explain, just insists he get out of the vehicle, and even does something so bizarre as to tell him to stand still as he puts a really weird device to his forehead. This is total movie B.S.",3,2,11,7 August 2017
Liar Liar," Not funny, just silly
","After quality comedy of Ace Ventura and Dumb & Dumber, Jim's trying to put himself into a role of a finally a NORMAL person but who's put into a SITUATION that MAKES him a goofball. The humor's FORCED, not genuine. I think the promotional line on this movie's cover 'up-from-your-belly laughs' is a bit of an exaggeration.",3,3,8,5 August 2017
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not as good as the first but still a solid sequel
","This was a really entertaining movie but it hardly follows the book. I like the MOVIE'S ending a little better than the book's because, come on, a real-life depiction of what it would be like if T-Rex were put into civilization?? Hell yeah! However,...I read the book, just yearning to get to that part,...but that's not how it ends. I understand the screen writer for this movie was pumping out the script as Crichton was writing his book, so it's interesting how the script ended up going off on a complete tangent.",7,10,43,4 August 2017
Dumb and Dumber," Hilarious but with a flaw
","Lloyd proves himself to be as literate as anyone else throughout the movie, reading to himself the flight status screens in the terminal, the note on the stall wall, and the famous 'Samsonite' tag. Then in the hotel bed, Harry asks him what's on next and he was going to look it up just as anyone would, both under the assumption that he can still read perfectly well. He suddenly can't make out a word, not even 'the', to save his life. So,...OK, he CAN'T read now; got it. Then later, as he leaves the hotel bar, he walks by the newspaper headline about landing on the moon and apparently can read perfectly well again.",6,0,2,4 August 2017
Jurassic World," It was OK; nothing special by any means
","My two biggest problems about it are: 1) the older brother being girl- obsessed in a really weird way (He's absurdly depressed about leaving his girlfriend for a little while at the beginning, then, all he does early on at the park is stare at other girls he likes and then smile when they eventually giggle at him staring at them. His little brother appropriately lets him know it's not going to do anything by him just staring, which makes them laugh and walk away. He gives his brother a sarcastic thanks and I thought, 'Well what do you expect? You weren't going to have anything going for yourself and it was for your own good. Either talk to them or don't; don't just keep staring at them like a total weirdo.' 2) It's obvious, at the climax, the huge main dinosaur they're after is some kind of raptor from her communicating with the raptors; you don't need to have Mr. Pimp Daddy be the one to figure it out while everyone else is clueless: 'I know why they wouldn't tell us what it really is.' (Gosh, ya think?) 'Why?' 'That thing is part-raptor.' (You're a quick one.)",4,3,4,7 August 2017
Mission: Impossible II," A big step down from the first
","I think the overall 6 rating's a little high: the plot's too simple, it's not a mind game, it doesn't require paying attention or any brain power, there's no twist, and it's just a bunch of pointless and unrealistic ram-bam action. Some parts even strike me as somewhat corny. However, it is, of course, entertaining; I'll give it that.",4,1,3,5 August 2017
For Love of the Game," I wish I could've given it a 7
","Great story line and acting. I like how the movie describes the realism of a major league pitcher: a fundamentally- fantastic player but with a far-from-perfect record. I like how the movie climactically wraps his career up after all the ups and downs he's been through with a potentially perfect game to show the world who he is. I would've rated this a 7 (a rating for a solid movie) if it wasn't for the following conversation Billy has with Jane. Jane: 'So, how does this work? When you're AWAY, I do MY own thing and YOU do YOURS? What I do has nothing to do with what YOU do and vice versa? And none of this 'Why didn't you call me?' crap?' Billy: 'You said that perfectly.' Then when they're away from each other, he becomes interested in having his masseuse over to hang out, Jane suddenly shows up and flips out, and he goes, 'Well what about the deal?' Jane: 'What deal??' Billy: 'Ya know, you do what you do, I do what I do.' Jane: 'You believe that??' She and the audience knew exactly what he's talking about because we're all watching the movie. Whether it's right or wrong is beside the point; she shouldn't have had that reaction, making him explain it, because we all know what he's talking about. A better dialogue would be to omit that and just go right to her coming back with, 'You believe that??'",6,0,1,4 August 2017
Taken," Great action; stupid characters
","The dad knows how messed up it is overseas and couldn't've tried harder to explain that to his wife and daughter, who couldn't've acted like more of jerks about being mad at him for not letting her go. They act extremely naive and the wife, who's already divorced him, punches him below the belt, calling him 'pathetic' before leaving him high and dry at the restaurant. When all's said and done, he doesn't react realistically coldly toward them like he should. He's way to soft. Why would the wife divorce him and get with some idiot instead who's as naive as she?",4,0,0,10 September 2017
Sinister," Very cool but needs improvements
","What's up with the lighting throughout? This family lives like bats. What kind of family with little kids eats dinner with only the table gathering lit? Everything around them is pitch black. The dad keeps searching the house in the dark and the little girl, early on, searches for the bathroom in the pitch black, then tells him she can't find it. Gee, I wonder why. No little girl would even begin to that without light on. Even at the end, back at their real house, he's working at his desk in the dark. It's apparently awfully hard in this movie for lights/lamps to light up a room; it's like reflection doesn't exist. And a cop wouldn't just so happening to be camped on the side of a countryside road in the wee hours of the morning in the middle of nowhere. Also, the mom repeatedly yells at the dad about living there being a bad idea and that they should leave, and then when the dad finally tells her she's right when burning the films, she's curious as to why, telling him he's scaring her. Very annoying. And typical. At the very end, what the deputy explains to the dad over the phone after some research shouldn't've been a shock because that's what the dad realized about halfway through as he abruptly hung up.",4,0,1,6 September 2017
Don't Breathe," Twisted and unrealistic
","The intruders' ability to live up to the movie's title is highly unrealistic. The man does all kinds of stuff that should startle them but absurdly doesn't. They remain freakishly silent. Of course they flinch but come on, even when the landline suddenly rings, which causes him to fire a bullet at the phone, which is near her FEET, they manage to not make a peep?? That's B.S. to the max. And what it all comes down to is that the movie's trying to make these people out to be the GOOD guys.",3,0,2,16 August 2017
The Green Mile," Great story except for one thing
","This would've gotten an 8 if it hadn't been for the warden's refusal to let John go upstairs to his wife. The warden explained earlier in the movie that she has a tumor in her head and is going to die; it's inevitable, barring some sort of miracle. Particularly when they bring big John over, all we hear from her up there in bed in pain and agony. She's in HELL. Therefor, it shouldn't matter to him WHAT John's planning to with/to her. Even if he wasn't there to help but do harm, what more pain could he possibly inflict her with? Even if he was there to KILL, he should submissively let him by because John's guess as to what to do with her would be as good as anyone else's and death would certainly end her misery. When the warden tells him, 'Don't you do it!' I chuckled, 'Why not? You're wife's in Hell, dude, with no doctoral hope of getting better. I of course know he's going to help her but even I didn't, go for it.'",7,0,1,7 August 2017
Scream," Stupid. 'Clever, hip, and scary' my @$$
","Great acting. Now for criticism: how many doors do the Beckers need for crying out loud? Why are they all glass and why so many windows? Haven't these people heard of curtains? A young girl would never leave every door unlocked when home alone and when she keeps talking to the caller, she goes around locking only random ones, every other. Not all. What's the point of that? It's when she's finally frantic that goes ahead and locks the rest, including the FRONT door! When she first locks the SIDE, we later learn that there are actually two side-by-side doors, only one of which she initially locks. And she doesn't have to keep answering his calls and talking to him when she's obviously annoyed and insecure before becoming frantic. This whole opening sequence is so completely unrealistic and stupid. When things are heating up half way through, the sheriff's talking to Dewey in front of the station. Dewey asks if there's any way that a cellular could've been cloned. The sheriff never answers that, just progresses to tomorrow being the anniversary of Mrs. Prescott's death. At the climax, Billy and Stu relish how they want their spree to end way too much and it's no wonder it backfires. This movie's definitely sub-par.",3,0,3,29 August 2017
Flight," Quality movie, but anything but realistic
","A jet could never successfully land like that; the miracle is such garbage. It's based on a past disaster that ended with the plane CRASHING, not crash LANDING. It happened in Alaska and nobody survived. It's annoying how, at the end, the female questioner took her glasses off, swung her aside, and looked diagonally up at the wall/ceiling in wonderment of what could possibly be said next after what she'd just read every time she read something. It got old fast.",5,0,2,14 August 2017
Final Destination," Decent but not solid
","This is a great idea but the part I don't like is at the morgue when examining Todd's body. The coroner explains that lacerations on his hands are from yanking at the wire that strangled him. Alex brings up a great point that he if he was yanking at the wire, he wasn't trying to kill himself--it was an accident. All that develops into is the coroner coming back with a weird remark that in death, there ARE no accidents or coincidences. Realistically, someone wouldn't have that reaction to a great point and I thought, 'Ok, could we quit being weird and acknowledge the point he just made? He was tugging at the wire, which means he didn't exactly set this situation up for himself. So how did this happen? It's bizarre. How can his death be explained?' This happened fairly early in the movie, which would've changed the storyline from there on had the coroner appropriately made a big thing of Alex's point.",4,0,1,9 August 2017
Draft Day," Another Costner movie I couldn't quite give a 7
","I enjoyed this one except for the part toward the end where the Jaguars' GM asks Kevin Costner what the deal is to Kevin's reaction of, 'What do you mean?' The Jaguars' GM goes, 'You KNOW what I'm talking about: what's wrong with Callahan? Why don't you want him?' I was like, 'Seriously. Don't play dumb just to drag the script out; we all know what his concern is because we're watching the movie.' Kevin then goes, 'Can't I be perfectly frank with you?' The Jaguars' GM goes, 'Well-...YEAH...' At that, I sighed and rolled my eyes, going, 'No, he wants you LIE to him. He asked you so you could blow smoke up his rear.' This is just like my review of For Love of the Game.",6,0,0,4 August 2017
The Martian," Overrated
","What this mostly is is watching Pimp Daddy Matt Damon eat. Scene after scene is him taking in his nourishment. There's not much to it. At least through the first half, which is all I watched from getting bored, when does he not have food in his mouth? Through all that, I shrugged and said, 'Ok...Does something ever HAPPEN in this movie?'",5,2,3,9 August 2017
