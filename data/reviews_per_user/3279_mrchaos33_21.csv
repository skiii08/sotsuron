Ali," Unsentimental Tribute
","Mohammed Ali is one of the most charismatic characters of the late 20th Century, and turning his life story into a movie must have been a daunting task. Ali was (and remains) a complicated man. He was the people's champion, who thought that African-American women who dated white men should be killed. He was an American hero who refused to fight in Vietnam. He was a devout Muslim who cheated on his wives at every opportunity. In short a fascinating, thorny force of nature who declared himself to be `The Greatest.' Director Michael Mann eschews regular storytelling tricks, opting for an impressionistic take on the material. Images fly past the viewer, moving the story along, but more importantly imprinting a sense of time and place that is palatable. Will Smith is up to the job of playing the champ in the charisma department, although lacks the stature to be completely believable as a heavy-weight boxer. All in all Ali is a fitting and largely unsentimental tribute to a man who lived his life in the public arena.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
The Ring," Not enough 'booga-booga'
","Remakes are a tricky business, especially if you are remaking one of the scariest films to come along in recent memory. 1998's Ringu is a masterpiece of atmosphere and psychological terror from Japanese director Hideo Nakata that became a sensation in Asia, spawning a prequel, a sequel and a comic book. It's difficult to describe the plot without giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that the story of a reporter named Reiko who investigates the mysterious death of her cousin, only to discover a videotape that kills people seven days after they have watched it will scare the pants off you. The American makers of the The Ring wisely chose to retain the best elements of the original story, but what they forgot to include were the thrills and chills. There are some minor shocks, and one sequence that will upset horse lovers everywhere, but the overall sense of tension that is so pervasive in the original is lacking. Naomi Watts (last seen in Mulholland Drive) is the best reason to see this movie. She's natural and believable, and even though she is in virtually every scene, seems underused. This whole exercise might have been more interesting if a director who specialized in making horror and suspense films  like M. Night Shyamalan or David Cronenberg  had been given a crack at the material.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Minority Report," Cerebral science fiction
","Based on a 1956 short story by sci-fi guru Phillip K. Dick, Minority Report is the first collaboration between two of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Tom Cruise and director Steven Spielberg. Best described as cerebral science fiction, the movie is a feast for the mind as well as the eyes. The script tackles complicated moral issues while astounding us with spectacular action sequences. Spielberg has created a dazzling future world of hard glass and talking billboards (conveniently allowing for shameless product placement in the movie), but doesn't get lost in the special effects and forget to tell the story. Tom Cruise plays police chief John Anderton, head of the Pre-Crime Unit. His specialty is using a series of high tech computers and three human precogs' to determine when crimes will happen, and stop them before they happen. Then one day he is accused of a committing a murder in the future, goes on the lam, and is hunted by the same people he once worked with. It's not really a `who-dunnit,' as much as it is a `will-he-do-it.' Cruise does a nice job of carrying the action, but it is Max Von Sydow as his friend and mentor Director Burgess who adds depth. Once again, after being nominated for an Oscar as the mute Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, English actress Samantha Morton proves that she can outperform most of the actresses in Hollywood, and barely say a word on screen. Minority Report is smart, action packed and thrilling fun. Not only one of the best films of that summer, but one of the best of 2002.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Finding Nemo," Eye-popping animation
","Fish aren't cuddly. The scales, the smell and the cold blooded nature of the species make them difficult to hug, let alone curl up with. That perception will likely change with the release of Finding Nemo, a film that will do for fish what Babe did for pigs. That is, make them seem like something more than just an accompaniment for French fries.Pixar, (in co-operation with Disney) the clever animators behind Toy Story and  Monsters Inc, are back with a story about a young clownfish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) who gets separated from Marlin (Albert Brooks), his over protected father. With the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a blue fish with short term memory loss, Marlin desperately searches for his son. In the process he learns about himself and love while risking life and fin to find his son. The story is typical Disney claptrap, a tale that hits the same emotional buttons that have marked kid's films since Bambi was a fawn. But it's not the story that recommends Finding Nemo and makes it the achievement that it is. The script is tight and quite funny (although in a more subtle way than previous Pixar creations) but it is the visuals that overwhelm. The computer geeks at Pixar have imbued their undersea world with such feeling and splendour that it is hard to believe it isn't real, that it is, in fact, nothing more than cleverly arranged binary code. The colours and textures of the sea literally come alive on the screen and show a real eye for detail. Particularly eye-popping is the jelly-fish sequence, a beautifully realized scene in which Marlin and Dory must navigate their way through a school of opaque stinging sea creatures.Albert Brooks heads the cast as Marlin. He's neurotic, not unlike many of the characters Brooks has played before, but is charmingly so. This may be his best role since Broadcast News. When he deadpans that, despite the name, clownfish aren't really all that funny, you know the part was written for him. Ellen DeGeneres brings considerable charm to the scatterbrained Dory, while Willem Dafoe and Geoffrey Rush also contribute voices.Finding Nemo is more than just a technical marvel; it is a computer animated film that transcends the animation to become a film which will engage the heart as well as the mind.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Insomnia," Up all night...
","Insomnia is director Christopher Nolan's first film since last year's Memento, and it is a stunner. In this remake of a Norwegian film made in 1998 by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, Nolan has cast three Oscar winners - Al Pacino and Hillary Swank play police officers chasing down a dangerous psychopath played by Robin Williams. Nolan set the film in Alaska, and makes good use of the location, particularly in the opening credit sequence as the camera follows a two-engine prop plane across the unforgiving jagged ice ridges. A foot chase on moving logs provides excitement, but the best thrills here are psychological. This is a film for adults. Insomnia is a serious thriller that relies not only on action, but on issues of guilt and morality to propel the story. Al Pacino hands in his best performance in years, although his accent seems to change from one scene to another. Robin Williams impresses, playing the homicidal Walter Finch with a chilling intensity that should forever put an end to the Mrs. Doubtfire typecasting pit he fell into in the 90s. Swank as the smart small-town cop delivers a multi-layered performance that is completely believable.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003

Blade II," Dark and Gruesome
","Darker and more gruesome than the original, Blade II delivers an intoxicating blend of horror, butt kicking martial arts and comic book sensibility. Wesley Snipes is back as the half vampire half human `Daywalker' whose life's mission is to hunt and eliminate the undead. Also making a return appearance is Kris Kristofferson as his sagely sidekick Whistler. Mexican Director Guillermo del Toro amps up the action, inserting incredibly violent, but entertaining fight scenes every ten minutes or so. The story is outlandish but remains true to the movie's comic book roots - which means it makes enough sense while you are watching it, but doesn't hold up to close scrutiny at the coffee shop post theatre.",Null,0,0,22 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Marked improvement...
","I breathed a sigh of relief after seeing Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones. George Lucas has made up for the sins of his past, redeeming himself for subjecting viewers to the awful Episode I: The Phantom Menace, a movie so bad I thought it might sink the whole Star Wars franchise. The latest instalment, I'm happy to say, is a marked improvement. It's not perfect, but at least Jar Jar Binks is kept to a minimum, and Yoda's transformation into a butt-kicking action hero is worth the price of admission alone. Torontonian Hayden Christensen is convincing as Anakin Skywalker, although falls a little flat in the love scenes with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Those scenes seem to be trying to emulate a 1930s mannered romance style of acting, but it doesn't really work here because there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between the two actors. The love story isn't the draw here anyway. Star Wars fans want elaborately staged action sequences, and in Episode II Lucas delivers. Early on there is an exciting chase through the night time skies of Coruscant, and the film's last 45 minutes have the kind of exhilaration and showmanship associated with the best moments from the original trilogy.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
The Bourne Identity," Brains and brawn
","This film version of Robert Ludlum's 1980 spy thriller is equal parts brains and brawn. Matt Damon, as John Bourne, a CIA black ops spy who suffers from amnesia and spends the film piecing together the last two weeks of his life, uses his intellect as much as his fists. This is a smart movie, made even better by some wise choices for director and star. Doug Liman, director of Swingers and Go brings a refreshing excitement to this tired old genre, and manages to deliver some unexpected thrills. Franka Potente (best known for Run Lola Run) as Maria, a young woman who unwittingly finds herself involved in international intrigue, hands in a star making performance. As a viewer her character is the only one in the film that we can relate to; she's an ordinary person put in extraordinary circumstances. Look for Clive Owen in a cameo as The Professor, a hired killer sent to assassinate Bourne. In his three or four lines of dialogue he talks about the moral quandaries of his line of work. It's a beautifully acted moment, and a nice twist on the usual killer-for-hire character.",Null,1,2,5 July 2003
The Italian Job," Good remake
","The Italian Job is a remake of a 1969 film of the same name that starred Michael Caine and Noel Coward. The cast isn't as upmarket for the re-make  we have to make do with Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham  but they do seem to be having a good time. Palindromically named director Gary Gray keeps the pace in high gear, staging an elaborate (and unlikely) robbery, a nasty double-cross and a sweet revenge story. Couple those elements with a wild Austin Mini (yes, I said Austin Mini) chase through the streets and subways of Los Angeles and you have the makings of a good lightweight summer heist film.",Null,1,2,6 July 2003
Spider-Man," Right balance between action and story
","I'm always wary of movies based on comic books. There have been good ones  Ghost World, Batman, Blade  but the track record is not good. Spiderman is one of the good ones, maybe even one of the great ones. Director Sam Raimi hit the right balance between action and story, between reality and fantasy. Raimi has a steady hand with story  just rent A Simple Plan if you're not convinced  and knows about action and special effects from his Evil Dead days. He has crafted an old fashioned super-hero movie that made me nostalgic for the days of Christopher Reeves as Superman. I would quibble with the decision to put a Green Goblin mask on Willem Dafoe. Why cover up his expressive face with a cheesy looking mask? Dafoe could have been more effective and twice as scary had we been able to actually see his face. Tobey McGuire is nails the socially inept Peter Parker, putting a human face on the superhero that is very charming.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Blue Crush," Wide World of Sports with dialogue
","No one was more surprised than me that I enjoyed Blue Crush. It is a by-the-numbers teen drama about three Hawaiian wahinis who have crappy day jobs to the pay the rent and support their surfing addiction. One of them, Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) was a child champion of the sport, but stopped competing when she was almost killed when she lost control of her board and bashed her head on a rock. Now after a break of three years she's signed up to ride the big waves in the island's largest surfing competition. She's in training until she meets a young, rich football player who sweeps her off her feet. Story wise Blue Crush falls flat when it is on land, but the surfing scenes are spectacular. There are a few little twists that set this apart from the usual teen fare - the girls have decidedly unglamorous jobs as hotel maids, and live in a grotty little shack - but don't expect to be wowed by the plot. Think of it as The Wide World of Sports with dialogue.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
Seabiscuit," A movie for adults
","In a summer brimming with high flying angels and gravity defying archaeologists comes a movie designed to appeal to that most neglected segment of the movie-going population, adults. Nothing blows up and there isn't a flaming helicopter or open running wound anywhere in sight. In an attempt at counter programming Universal has scheduled Seabiscuit to go mano-e-mano against drunken Caribbean pirates, scantily clad adventurers and three dimensional spy kids, hoping to bring in the parents of the kids who have been dropping their allowance money at the box-office all season.
Who knows, it just might work.  The last time I checked people over the age of fourteen enjoyed movies too.Seabiscuit is the inspiring story of a horse who became an American folk hero during the depression years. Everything about this movie screams prestige, from the Academy Award winning cast to the narration by PBS regular David McCullough to the sumptuous art design. Hell, screenwriter / director Gary Ross even used to write speeches for President Clinton! The result is a predictable, but likeable movie that demands nothing more from you than to feel better when you leave the theatre than you did when you came in. Based on a book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand, Seabiscuit reintroduces us to one of the great sports stories from the early part of the last century. There was a time when everyone knew the story, he was so famous in fact that on one occasion hundreds of businesses closed for half a day so their employees could tune in to hear Seabiscuit race against Triple Crown winner War Admiral on the radio. These days, though, because Seabiscuit didn't endorse Nike or Pepsi, his story has been largely forgotten. The film begins in the heady days before the stock market crash of 1929. Businessman Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) made his fortune selling cars, and promoting his vision of `the future.' After the tragic death of his son, the future doesn't seem so bright anymore. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is an outsider, shunned by most horse professionals because he believes in healing, not killing wounded animals. At a head taller than any other jockey on the horse racing circuit, Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire) is considered a fringe player, but he loves horses and prefers this life to the alternatives  starving on the streets or getting the tar knocked out of him in underground boxing matches. Seasbiscuit, an undersized horse of good breeding but little in the way of talent is the center around which each of these men revolve. Through hard work and care Seabiscuit is transformed from a candidate for the glue factory into a champion, and basking in the reflected glory are Howard, Smith and Pollard. Seabiscuit picks up speed in the middle stretch, after a slow first hour. Much of the opening of the film feels like a history lesson, disrupting the flow of the story. Not that you could easily derail this story. Ross has played fast and loose with the facts  for example, Pollard was actually a mean drunk, not the nice guy presented here  cobbling together a story that sometimes feels like Chicken Soup for the Equine Soul.
Inspirational messages tumble from everyone's lips, as though pearls of wisdom flow from their mouths as easily as turning on a facet and watching the water coming pouring out. The script overuses several of these nuggets  ie: `Sometimes when the little guy doesn't know he's the little guy he can do big things'  which only reinforces their corny sentiments.
If the dialogue seems stilted, the racing sequences certainly do not. Ross puts the viewer directly in the action in a series of beautifully realised shots that seem to be taken from the horse's point of view. In those days racing was a brutal sport where jockeys would punch and shove one another in mid-race. Seabiscuit does an admiral job of recreating the tension and aggression involved in the races with long shots that give the viewer the opportunity to follow the action without confusion.  In the end Seabiscuit is clichéd and predictable, but good work by Bridges, McGuire and Cooper coupled with the movie's indomitable spirit make it a pleasure that is hard to deny.",Null,0,0,29 July 2003
28 Days Later...," Believable characters in an unbelievable scenario
","28 Days Later begins with a great horror movie premise. A group of British activists free infected animals from their cages, unleashing a deadly `rage' virus on the human population. Twenty-eight days after the virus took hold of the city, a bicycle courier named Jim awakens from a coma, unaware of the devastation. In one of the year's best cinematic sequences, horror or otherwise, Jim leaves the hospital to find a deserted London. Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) infuses the shots of the empty streets with a sense of dread. As Jim wanders through the vacant Piccadilly Circus the feeling of foreboding grows as he realizes that something catastrophic has happened here. And that's just the first ten minutes. (The scenes of London's deserted streets were shot just after dawn on weekdays. Because of the traffic, they could only shoot for a couple of minutes each day. Crewmembers frequently had to stop and ask clubbers not to walk into shots.)Boyle deftly juggles two distinct ideas in 28 Days Later.  It is a full blown Halloween flick, complete with drooling angry zombies, (although hard-core gore fans will be disappointed, most of the horror here is psychological) but at its core it is also a compelling study of human nature and the will to survive. Each character is fully rounded, and none are superfluous in this tough drama. Selena (Naomie Harris), for example, isn't a damsel in distress, nor is she simply a hard-nosed zombie killer. She is a layered character, a normal person who is placed in an unimaginable circumstance and is dealing with it on an instinctual level. She isn't a killer, but she'll kill to survive. `Staying alive is as good as it gets,' she says grimly.Boyle (and screenwriter Alex Garland) give a wide berth to the stereotypical character traits found in horror movies  the screaming girlfriend, the witless teen, the gung-ho monster slayer  and instead concentrate on developing believable characters and situations in an unbelievable scenario. In addition to believable characters 28 Days Later also re-invents the cinematic zombie. Gone are the lumbering, `We're coming to get you,' living dead from years past. Boyle's ghouls move with frightening speed, hissing at the scent of human flesh, and attacking at random. These are the zombies that nightmares are made of. Shooting on digital video this time out, Boyle has left behind the visual showiness of Trainspotting and the austere picture-postcard look of The Beach, trading those in for a grainy, almost documentary feel. The jagged feel of the video gives the movie a sense of urgency and energy which seems appropriate for the subject matter. Unlike Soderbergh's Full Frontal this material actually benefits from the use of video.28 Days Later runs out of steam as the third act winds down, but up until its closing minutes it is as good as speculative fiction gets.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Men in Black II," Rent the original instead
","In most cases sequels are the work of the devil. It is rare that the second kick at the can compare favourably with the original, although several films have managed to muster up enough inventiveness to keep things interesting. The Bride of Frankenstein and The Godfather II are examples of movies that equal or surpass their namesakes. Sadly MIB II is no Godfather II, heck, it's barely Police Academy II. The first film was one of the funniest, original and entertaining comedies to come down the pike in quite a while, which makes the failure of the second one so much more profound.  MIB II seems tired  almost as tired as Will Smith's lyrics to the movie's theme song  and vaguely familiar, like we've seen it all before, only better. It's the dumb younger brother who can't seem to measure up to his older, brighter and better looking sibling. Smith and Jones fit their roles like finely tailored suits, but aren't given much to do. Even the jokes feel dated. When Frank the talking dog cranks the radio and sings along to Who Let the Dogs Out I cracked a smile, but wasn't that same gag in a car commercial about two years ago? The special effects are good just not that interesting. Only Smith's elaborate fight scene against a cloned flying bad guy is truly inspired. Keep your thirteen dollars locked away in your wallet, and rent the original Men In Black on DVD instead.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003

","8 Mile is a light-weight showcase for hip hop chart topper Eminem. This story of a downtrodden white kid the wrong side of town who dreams of being a rap star borrows heavily from Saturday Night Fever and almost every Elvis movie ever made. Can Eminem act? That's the big question raised by 8 Mile. Well, I'm not sure if he can act, it's too early to tell, but I can tell you he has charisma to burn. With his knitted brow and underdog stance he is electrifying on-screen. Think of him as a slimmer and shadier James Dean. Despite a clichÃ© ridden script and a really silly love scene Eminem emerges as a forceful presence. He may not be able to top this performance, but it will be a long time before we see another screen debut of this calibre.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Dull first hour... but then, look out!
","Many, many words have already been written about The Matrix Reloaded so I won't dwell on it here. I must admit, I didn't really understand the original Matrix, so it stands to reason that I'm not really in tune with the sequel. I'm not a big fan of science fiction, but I AM a big fan of good looking women who kick butt and blow things up, so I enjoyed Reloaded. After an initial big bang in the opening scene the first hour drags slightly, with long talky sequences involving Oracles, alternate worlds and other things I didn't really understand. But when it picks up, man look out. There is a wild sequence in which Neo battles hundreds of clones of the evil Mr. Smith and a twenty minute car chase that'll blow the back of your head off. The little boy that I keep hidden away deep in my subconscious loved that scene. Then it ends. Suddenly. Abruptly. It's a cliff-hanger that will either drive you to drink, or wet your appetite for part three of the series.",Null,0,0,22 June 2003

The true story of his life is hard hitting stuff, too bad barely any of the nitty gritty made it to the screen in Ron Howard's puffy bio pic. A Beautiful Mind cleans ups Nash's story, softening the edges and failing to provide any insight into the inner workings of this complex man. By the time we get to the third act things have degenerated into true Ron Howard hooey. The saving grace of this movie are the performances of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. They share real chemistry, and make for convincing viewing. It is hard to believe that this is the same actor who was brandishing a sword and fighting tigers in Gladiator.

The best bit of business is a running gag with a small cartoony animal trying desperately to store an acorn in his desolate glacial environment. The rest of the film seems to be trying too hard to capture the zany fun of Shrek, or the spark of  Monster's, Inc, but lacklustre writing and predictable situations cast a chill over the whole thing.

Signs," Everything happens for a reason
","Signs takes a great deal of time and creates a very elaborate context to teach us one simple, and not very original idea: everything happens for a reason. Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, a former minister who left the church after the tragic death of his wife. Everywhere he goes his former parishioners call him `Father,' even though he vows `not to waste one more minute of his life on prayer.' You see, Hess lost his faith when his young, beautiful wife was taken from him, cut down in her prime. When giant crop circles appear in his corn field and then start popping up all over the world, it seems his faith is to be tested once again. Are these bizarre configurations a hoax, or a sign that an alien invasion can't be far behind? Bet on the latter. When the tall green ETs do touch down Hess fights for the survival of his family, and learns more about the complex nature of fate. In the end he realizes that life is not just a series of coincidences, but a carefully arranged pattern that fits together like a jigsaw puzzle  everything happens for a reason. Director M. Night Shyamalan handles the material with his usual incredible visual style, but unfortunately the story is too thin to sustain interest. The aliens are not the focal point of the movie, but simply used as a plot device to help Hess learn about himself and his beliefs. Shyamalan has an almost Hitchcock-like ability to build suspense, unfortunately, unlike the late-master he doesn't follow-up the anticipation with any thrills. Signs is limp  all fore-play and no sex. If you're in the mood for an exciting alien invasion movie skip Signs and rent the 1953 Byron Haskin directed War of the Worlds, you'll have a better time.",Null,1,1,5 July 2003

Although Bruce Willis' (who actually manages to keep the smirks down to a minimum) photo is front and center on the movie poster, he doesn't have that much screen time, this is really Colin Farrell's piece. As the spoiled Yale trained officer he is intense and winning. There is more character growth here, particularly with Farrell and nasty Nazi Colonel Visser played by Marcel Iures, than in ten John Wayne war flicks. Hart's War is an interesting film, one that examines racism, honour and heroics.",Null,1,3,5 July 2003
