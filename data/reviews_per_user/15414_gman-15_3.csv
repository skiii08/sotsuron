Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great despite critics slams
","After hearing all the hype and reading critics reviews, I left the movie feeling exactly as I expected - great.  The movie was not the best movie ever made.  I never expected it to be.  I expected it to be a movie geared towards 9 year old boys.  If you don't put on your kid goggles while watching the movie, of course you're not going to like it.  Watch it from the point of view of a 9 year old boy and you'll love it.",8,0,0,17 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," just as I expected
","The movie played up to all my expectations.  After having heard numerous reviews and having read the book, I expected the special effects to be great, Jar Jar to be annoying and Darth Maul to be fascinating, but not having enough character development.  I do have to say that Jar Jar was not quite as annoying to me as everyone made him out to be.",8,0,0,30 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," not worth the hype
","The movie, while entertaining, was disappointing given the hype around it. Several have said this would be the 'picture of the year.'  I doubt it. While there is a lot to tell, the movie seemed to go for a long time.  The character development seemed a bit shallow.  The timing of events and moods seemed a bit off.",7,0,0,21 December 2001
