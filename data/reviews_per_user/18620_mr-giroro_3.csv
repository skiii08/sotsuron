The Equalizer," Hollywood Cliché Meets Random Violence of Asian Movies
","I watched this movie not in a theater but on a plane, and I am glad that I did. If I had watched it in a theater, I would've had been depressed for a long time.The story of the movie is extremely predictable--a former special agent meets a helpless girl, and he uses his superhuman ability to kill any bad guy who stands between him and the girl. Because this story has been used in so many movies, it seems making another movie based on the story is completely redundant. Yet, they decided to make another one, and this movie follows exactly the same cliché. The plot is as predictable as it can be.The character development is also extremely poor. Our hero (Denzel Washington) risks his life and breaks vow to his beloved deceased wife for a girl whom he barely knows. There is no chemistry between them nor any rational for his behavior. The movie is also filled with cliché characters--cold-blooded hit-man, dirty cops, underachiever who needs a mentor to name a few. The director tried to make up for the lack of an interesting story and memorable characters with gruesome action scenes that are directly imported from B-level Asian action flicks. Although Denzel could've simply picked up an automatic assault rifle dropped by a bad guy and shot down the rest of them, he chose to use construction equipment to do the job. He was even able to kill a highly-trained former Russian special force hit-man wielding a MP5 submachine gun with a Black and Decker nail gun in a cowboy style shoot out. This might entertain 12-year old boy whose brain is filled with nothing but testosterone, but it makes the movie extremely ridiculous. The action scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't take this movie seriously.In sum, this is a movie that does not have much reason to exist. You will feel that you've seen at least a dozen of similar movies in the past. Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",3,6,10,1 January 2015
Gravity," Are You Afraid of Saying 'the King is naked'?
","I watched this movie with a great deal of expectation because there was so much hype about this movie (not to mention the multiple Oscars it received this year). What I did not know was that I would have to endure the most excruciating 2-hours of my life. This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever watched in my entire life, right there with Swamp Thing or Mega Shark (SciFi channel original movie).As many reviewers pointed out, there is almost no story in this movie. The special effects are nothing to write home about, and the physics and science in the movie are seriously flawed in most parts (I have an engineering degree, so I know one or two things about the law of physics). It is also filled with so many cliché that it was really difficult to take this movie seriously.Further, the acting was so horrible that it was embarrassing to watch it with both eyes open. Sandra Block was usual herself--as annoying as ever. She continuously blurted out incoherent words. It seems that her acting skill has never improved since Speed.Also, it is extremely annoying to see the constant efforts of Hollywood to flatter Chinese (Did you watch '2012'?). In the end, it was the Chinese product that brought Sandra Block safely back to the earth. I understand that Hollywood needs to sell movies to China (after all, it accounts for more than 1/4 of the world population), but please stop flattering them. It is getting really annoying.I admit that I could encounter with a bad movie from time to time. Not all the movies can be like Shawshank Redemption or The Lord of Rings. I picked a wrong movie and wasted 2 hours of my life. It was my wrong-doing. However, what I cannot understand is the glaring reviews that this movie received by the critics and movie-goers alike. I do not rule out the possibility that I may be a stupid one, but it is a complete mystery for me how this could be considered to be a good movie. Is this a bad case of 'group think' in which everyone is afraid of saying the truth? Let me tell you something: 'The king is naked' and 'this movie is really, really bad.'",1,2,6,23 November 2014
Black Panther," A Big Budget 'Sharknado'
","This has to be one of the most hyped movies in the movie history.The acting and the scripts are so bad that it was embarrassing to watch the movie. The story is so boring that it was excruciating to endure the running time (I am not even sure if it had a story). The action sequences are so poorly done that it made Ultra Men (1960s Japanese movie for children) look good. For me, the gold standard for a bad movie is Sci-Fi Channel's Sharknado. To be fair, it is slightly better than Sharknado, but not so much better.It is apparent that Oscar and the Hollywood have succumbed to the political correctness. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this movie.",2,6,9,19 March 2020
