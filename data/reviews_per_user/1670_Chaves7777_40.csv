Vertigo," A Sad surprise
","I was so excited when i begin to watch famous Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'. For the critics that i have read, i think that this will be a good movie. Unfortunately, i think that i was wrong. 'Vertigo' give me a lot of surprises that i already expect. And all the suspense that give me was wasted in an awful ending.Of course that have good things, like the performances (Novak, Stewart and Geddes are great) and the cinematography are very special and really beautiful, without counts a good and captivating soundtrack. Unfortunately, i think that the suspense is well created but not well justified.While i wrote this commentary, i think all the people that going to hate me for saying this, but i am not sorry, because i love Hitchcock films (Im a fan of him) and i really think that 'Vertigo' is not his masterpiece. I think that '39 steps' or 'Rope' is much, much better that this.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",5,6,14,17 March 2007
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Mamma Mia : A good gay proud film
","The first thing that i saw of 'The adventures of Priscilla, queen of the desert' was the great 'I will survive' scene. 'The adventures of Priscilla, queen of the desert' is an incredible composition of different topics like gay proud, homophobia, ABBA music, and the being like you think.Although the plot doesn't express excellence, the movie has a rich expression. And that thing causes us happiness and sometimes sadness.Besides that i said previously, the movie also presents a topic that it doesn't intervene to homosexual or transsexual people. The election of roads, the election of life, the election of believe in yourself or believe in other people that not even knows you. Believe in the people you love.'The adventures of Priscilla, queen of the desert' is a comedy of music, dance, and pride.*Apologize for orthographic errors ... if there any",8,1,2,27 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," The story of a red dress
","We all have dreams. Very important aspirations for us. We all should make something so that our dream is made reality.''Requiem for a dream'' are bitter, quick, slow , imaginative and real. The cast, the music and the edition are excellent.Is a movie about desire, pain, delirium and madness.The movies that depict the drug addiction usually are not as strong as this. Let me take as example ''Trainspotting'', is a comedy and drama about the adventures of drug addicts. We can take too for example ''Christiane F.'', a movie of young drug addicts... ''Requiem for a dream'' is very different.Ellen Burstyn are a great actress, you believe her character and feel her dream, her solitude, her pain. I only saw once it to her in a movie: '' The exorcist''. Jennifer Connelly was another actress who i saw just in one movie: Labyrinth. The cast is fantastic.The final scene are the characters requiem... all we feel they broken dreams... and how they sleep with them until the sunrise. * sorry if i put bad words",10,2,4,23 October 2006
The Girl Next Door," Maybe you don't believe it , but... this is not a comedy!!!
","'The girl next door' is not a comedy, and this movie try to be a comedy, but it doesn't achieve it.'The girl next door' is a funny drama about the boys and the girls, the love and the sex, the lust and the innocence.Matt is a shy guy who found the perfect woman. Then he discover, she is not the perfect woman for him. Then he discover she is the really perfect woman for him.Really, is a delightful movie, with some very burnt ideas, but in spite of that, the movie survives thanks to the characters adventures.This is a drama, really to enjoy and laugh.*sorry, for mistakes in the words",7,2,3,11 November 2006
Finding Nemo," The future and past of animation
","I think that 'Finding Nemo' was a good work. Is fun, funny and with a beautiful message to the little ones. And the animation of course is excellent. But... where is the classic animation with we grow up? I mean... i'm not an adult yet, but still in childhood i live in all that beautiful fantasies of 'Snow White', 'Alice' or 'That lazy princess'. I remember when 'Toy Story', that if i'm not wrong was the first Pixar movie. Well, i think 'Toy Story' is excellent, an unforgettable movie. And i was really happy for the animation style. But now... i say this animation is good (please, don't misinterpret me) but... and the animation of ever? Now, the movies for kids are just with this kind of animation. A little number of movies take the old, beautiful and classic animation of all times.'Finding Nemo' talk about a disobedient little fish. His dad tell to the little that cant go to up... he don't pay attention to the advice and... well, you must see it. 'Finding Nemo' has all that a film for kids must have, funny characters (i love that little fish that forgets everything) and good teachings. I hope the movies do more of that... but the animation... well, this is other thing that the new technology makes... for good or for bad. What do you think? *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",8,0,1,21 December 2006
Constantine," Go to hell, to heaven and back to earth and just be there in your chair
","I have not read yet (But i want it) 'The Divine Comedy' of Alligheri (I hope that is the last name). But i know a little of it. And i remember when i heard for the first time 'Constantine'. I think that was another awful Hollywood horror movie. I was wrong.'Constantine' was maybe the most creative movie in years. Althoug that i don't know so much of the comic book, i think this movie rules. Of course that have mistakes. One of them is the special effects in the 'monster' thing. I was not scared for that. I laugh for it. But the real 'fear' and thrill was in the plot.I think that movies can make more stories like that. When begin to watch i thought that was another typical movie of Hollywood. But of course, there Hollywood movies that rules (I love commercial movies too, the thing i hate is the 'typical' thing), and i think that 'Constantine' is one of them. The story is full of genres and human fears that talk from monsters to faith. And that is the important thing... Faith. I love 'Constantine' for that. Because is a story that talks about of fears and thinks about religion, the death and the living, the fallen angels, God, Satan, and fight for the other person that we love.Another thing that i love of this movies is the characters. I think that Keanu Reeves is one of the characters of movies that i never forget. And of course, the Rachel character, the demon hunters and demons and angels.'Constantine' is not another stupid of the new horror era in movies. 'Constantine' is a must see. A real exploration for our faith. And, just like John Constantine, go to a chair and go to hell and heaven with him.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",8,0,3,2 February 2007
The Others," Please, don't read this if you have not watched the movie
","'The others' is other masterpiece of Alejandro Amen√°bar. Why 'Other masterpiece'? Just watch 'Open your eyes'. 'The others' is a really good horror movie.'The others' is a terrifying but philosophical trip through the questions of the man. I want to compare it first with the character of the beautiful book 'Rayuela'. This character reminds me a lot this movie. Because he is in a difficult situation. He doesn't know if he exist. Of that it is 'The others'. Is a Gothic tale with a message that makes us meditate.With great performances, 'The others' is a good horror movie, maybe is the best that have made lately.Alhough it has been very welcome, many also criticize it because it seems like a copy of 'The sixth sense'. Nothing more far of the truth. Because, 'The sixth sense' talks about simply the story of death people living with alive people. But with a different message.'The Others' is a good horror movie. You want other reason? Well ... here have one: Nicole Kidman* Sorry for mistakesPD: 'Rayuela' by Julio Cortazar",10,2,4,27 November 2006
Brokeback Mountain," A lovely look to love....
","In spite that 'Crash' snatch it the Oscar to Best Picture of the Year to 'Brokeback Mountain', this one has stood out more than 'Crash'. And actually, is difficult ask at this moment if this is a good thing, because, in spite that 'Brokeback Mountain' has a big quality, outstanding performances, beautiful music and a wonderful ending, 'Brokeback Mountain' it has been wasted and tired, and that removes certain charm.'Brokeback Mountain' is based in the story of Annie Proulx of two cowboys who fall in loved. The movie told us then, about Ennis and Jack (The two Cowboys)in the 60s. Without being known, the both must work in the called 'Brokeback Mountain' to care about a lot group of animals which must be there for its owner. We don't know nothing about this guys, and the movie little by little, going to told us they dreams and they fears. And how they going to find certain affection. The plot could be more simple if we ignore all the social topics.The movie was the sensation in almost all the world, but the thing that surprised me is if, in all the gay movies that exist, this is the best. I don't think so. I think that there are much gay films better than this. But in spite of that, of course, this one treat a different topic: The real love which born from our hearts. The performances are good too: Jack Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Larry Reese, Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway. But maybe the points that take our hearts are 3: The soundtrack, the photography and the ending. The music composed by Santaolalla is really enjoyable and memorable, gives it the essence of western that the film needs. The photography, or i better say the scenario is tremendous and natural, which gives to the film a warm, kind but biter air, a bitter aspect. Finally, the ending is a sad look of nostalgia, so hard that we feel the feelings of Ennis. And at the ending of that old clothes, and the closed door.This work of Ang Lee is incomparable -althoug not superior to others- that should, and surely going to be remembered for a lot of time.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",8,5,6,14 July 2007
Ed Wood," Steal graves never sounds so good
","The movies can be awesome, the movies can be great, the movies can be awful... and if we talk of awful movies, the man appears... Mr. Edward Wood. But, what the hell is Hollywood without bad movies?Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood' is maybe one of the best biographic movies about a man of Hollywood. And ...bad movies too. But the life of Edward D. Wood Jr. was this ... a life of fights and dreams ... and he don't pay attention to the critics for him. And that is why i love 'Ed Wood' and that iswhy i love to Edward D. Wood Jr. Because if you do the work for money,maybe you do a good movie ... but that movie is not yours... i from the people who gave that damn money. If you want to express and make art or anything that you want... no matter if tell you: 'That thing that you want to do is just trash' ... so what... if is your work ... and you do it like you want it, without damaging nobody... your work... no matter what say others is a piece of art.Tim Burton is one of the best directors that i have seen. 'Ed Wood' is great and fun... This is a must see.Now... go for you women's clothing and see it!*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any",9,0,0,29 December 2006
Taxi Driver," Yes ... I'm talking to you!
","I try to see 'The Last Temptation of Christ' but, i felt that the moment was not right, besides, it was very long and that time see something more easy, more 'light'. Like 2 years before i have the choice to see 'New York, New York' ... and at this time is a movie that i have not idea of why i don't watch it and i want to see. So, i love movies, and i don't know who is Scorsese ...i mean , his work? So, one day decided to see a movie which critics - seems to me- support and hate. 'Taxci Driver', that NY tale that we never going to forget, or well, not me.'Taxi Driver' is a tale about repression, about that human been who is bad for the same bad things that the human been do. The case here is about Travis, a Taxi Driver, who has a lonely life, and wants to stays busy working in his car, watching the girl he loves and dirty porn movies at the cinema. But, due to the circumstances, little by little, our character going to transform, not in a good way, although not in a worthless way. We see in the eyes of Travis the violence, prostitution and delinquency. As we see it for his eyes, we feel his own perspective of this things. This perspective is of disgust for the thing that he called 'filthy'. For other side, he is in loved of a woman who helps to a important politician. So, we find a man, at first, disinterested for the politics. Then, when his life turns violently by all this facts, his perception of life is centered in , what he same called as 'social cleaning' or something like that, and this is not good as he thinks, because is a confused been. This smell bad. 'Taxi Driver' is hard to forget for this (And more!).'Taxi Driver' treats an indispensable topic for a human been today, because the character of Travis is the clear portrait of thousand of confused people, like me and like you. Travis, is not a bad person, he has never been it. Travis - and i think that is the most importance topic of all - is bad for a society that turned him in this way. So, the blame of all is Travis? 'Taxi Driver' manages every indispensable topic of a society like this: Politics, sex, violence and corruption. the vision of Travis is really important and truly, cant be ignored. Besides to be one of the cinema characters that i never going to forget. All his perceptions are of a desperate lonely man. My God! How hard but wonderful this movie is.Robert De Niro (As rare ... Wonderful!), Cybill Shepard, Jodie Foster (After 'Bugsy Malone' of Alan Parker) and Harvey Keitel are the most important performances, all of it great. This, my first Scorsese movie tell me how good is the vision of the famous director. Written by Paul Schrader with a soundtrack that we cant forget - although that the ending don't convince me much. 'Taxi Driver' is that movie that we cant forget, and for this maybe turned to be in an instant classic. And for this, and to for its topic, i think that this is a wonderful movie that people should see for a best perception of society and recalled and famous message of 'The human been born free, the society corrupts it'.Another necessary masterpiece for our lives.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",8,0,2,14 June 2007

","Despite of the summary if you have not seen the movie yet, if you watch it, maybe you understand me.Lately, i have been finding new interesting movies. For example, for movies, 2006 don't was so bad, actually, there great movies. And then i find 'Little Miss Sunshine'. To begin i have to say: I'm in loved of this movie!!! 'Little Miss Sunshine' is the most imaginative movies that i have ever seen of the recent years. This movie has all that things that our eyes deserve. 'Little Miss Sunhine' told us the story of a family like any other.

But, not everything will be as easy as they think This dramatic comedy is fun and delightful until it finishes it drop, is a real masterpiece of modern films. The movie talks in a really spirited way, where we see a family that is sustained, no matter what. The movie begins with an introduction of each character. Their problems, their feelings, their dreams and the way of live in a plastic world, because 'this life is damn beauty contest'. We see love of characters, dreams of characters, problems of characters. We see that little Olive dancing and rehearsing with her grandpa. We see a real analysis of the fact of be a winner or a loser. Second by second, scene by scene, 'Little Miss Sunshine' touch our hearts with great messages for us. You must go for your dreams, of course you're going to fall, that is that make us humans. Be and go for all that things that you want, no matter if little plastic girls surrounds you.

And that is what 'Little Miss Sunshine' do with certain roguery and fondness. If you want to see, really an excellent movie... watch 'Little Miss Sunshine', after that, you will feel as an entire winner with a pleasant suffering.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",10,1,2,30 March 2007
American Beauty," The Beauty of the Ordinary thing
","'There is so much beauty in the world' and we live it. We live in a world with divine marvels, believing or not believing in a God. The beauty of our body, our hair, our eyes, our nose, our mouth, our hearings, our torso, our chest, our breasts, our navel, our vagina, our penis, our legs, our knees, our feet and our fingers, to name a little. The beauty of the birds, of the crocodiles, of the dogs, of the cats, of the lizards, the seals or the ants. The beauty of people that surround you and that they really love you, that appreciate you and that in some way they worship you. There is also one materialistic beauty that would be bad if we say that it is bad, but it is not necessary to give it so much importance. The beauty of the art and of the healthy expression. The music's beauty, the cinema, the painting, the writing. The beauty of your heart, of your brain, of your lungs, of your kidneys, of your blood, of your genes, of your bones and of your muscles. The beauty of the same life.What is then 'American Beauty'? Is a movie? Yes. Is a simple movie? No. That it is 'American Beauty'? It is the expression of the same life. Then it is that the ordinary thing is not as ordinary as many of us we sometimes believe... is more than that.*Sorry for any mistake there... well, if there any",10,0,1,16 January 2007
Disturbia," A Review: Disturbia
","Directed by D.J Caruso With Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Ann Moss, David Morse A rebel without a cause(LaBeouf), is locked in his home for being a bad boy in class -own reason to the death of his father -, he falls in loved but also he found that his neighbor is a mad killer ... and police don't believe him. After an impacting and effective introduction, it simply don't knows what it wants to be. There are really thrilling sequences - but few and unplugged to the premise and mood that Caruso has given. The worst is, funny thing, the better thing: The love story. If this were a romantic teen comedy, it would be superb, but at the hour you know it just was an excuse and not something real important. Is not that the two things can't be tied, but here it seems an independent thing from each other. Besides, you now you have heard this before from Hitchcock. If something is good, well, is Shia LaBeouf, who is at least a sweetie and charming but too a real good actor. Caruso takes his star for his next film, 'Eagle Eye'.",5,0,2,1 January 2009
The Exorcist," It's About Faith
","I saw this movie for the first time in my life like 4 years ago, the afternoon of Halloween. It was a hard experience, i was only 12. In spite of that, this was a unforgettable experience who makes me ask to myself. William Peter Blatty's 'The Exorcist' was and is promoted as the 'Scariest Movie of all Time!', and yes, is one of the scariest movies that anyone can see, but not in the way that much horror films make you fright, the real scary thing is about the spiritual, the good and evil, is about your believes.The story is about Damien Karras, a middle aged priest who live a life full of questioning, but he have some doubts about his believes and his life. For other side is the famous actress Chris MacNeil, who lives a divorced life with her child Regan. Something weird is happening to Regan. Her behave is a novelty, she never said bad and incoherent words. Never make strange moves and never feel harassed. Is she getting crazy? She needs a doctor? She needs a operation? I she possessed? ... Her mother don't think this things ... but something is happening and is really serious.Much who have live in that time or love horror films knows about this one. This film, although, is exclusive in the horror genre, because this movie not have the typical horror (Of course that have some gores and disturbing scenes) but is the meaning that give you the scare and disturbs you, at least for a little while, and this is the reason of why 'The Exorcist' is a must see. The movie develops each character in a psychological and spiritual way. The scare is their same frights, they same fears. Damien Karras have a spiritual problem, and this is develop more to any fact that happen in his life (The death of his mother, the solitude, the supernatural and question about good and evil), this is one of the most important characters (Even more than Regan). Is of course the mother of Regan (Fabolous Ellen Burstyn, if you remembered her in 'Requiem for a Dream') and the conflict of religion, she don't believe in God, but doesn't matter of that, she needs help. Is of course Regan MacNeill (Outstanding Linda Blair who appear then in spoof 'Reposessed' ) the center of the attention, where their action of possessed offers us a view of the evil represented in a body possessed by a supernatural force. And at least is Father Merrin, who is another perspective of view of religion and believes, that too reflects in Father Karras. Each of their feelings are essentials to understand, and most of all, feel this movie.Is the fight of good vs. evil without mercy, as is in real life, of course that 'The Exorcist' is about supernatural, but that is th question of believe in God or not. Believe in the devil or not. There is evil in the human beens, but is very worth to watch a supernatural view, that, of course, is the topic of much horror films, but here is an encounter between reality and fantasy, can you noted this in the views of Karras and Chris thoughts. And of course there is the religion, but Please! ,note that this is not a religious film is a spiritual film, the religion subject is another fact that is necessary to analyze as a Cultural phenomenon, but you have to know that the Religion represents faith and believes too. Is for this that 'The Exorcist' is a great must see movie. You don't have to love horror films to love this. It's a spiritual as disturbing experience that you never going to forget.'The Exorcist' was a phenomenon in 1973 as in it's re-premier in 2000 and undoubtedly, going to cause the same effect, not for a long time ... Always going to be remembered. After its original release, the film begin with 2 sequels ('The heretic' but that was just a waste of time and 'The Exorcits3' that was in a big part, better that 'The Heretic' of course), the third sequel was 'The Beginning', a prequel for the original film. And the success covers too in comedy field with marvelous, misunderstood 'Reposessed', with the same Linda Blair as a possessed married woman (This film is essential although you don't believe it, for Linda. This was an scape for the suffering that this movie made to her, maybe you heard about the this phenomenon affect too to it's young actress. She was damned for a long time named as a sick child, but you think again, Linda was very prepared for its character and 'Reposessed' was a scape for her, a way to laugh out the devil and all the suffering that she lives in her adolescence).This is not a film of fun, is a poetic but hard and disturbing which going to puncture you in your hide fears, and going to makes you wonder about your believes. You could find more disgusting films with more gore effects, but this is a horror film that, besides of scare you, that scare is a fear about question and believes.*Sorry for the mistakes ...well, if there any.",10,2,3,4 October 2007
Gone with the Wind," Scarlett. The spoiled girl of the movies.
","For me to see 'Gone with the wind' was very difficult. Because, years later, i pass TV channels and suddenly, i see the end. I say, 'well, i mean... maybe, the movie was not so good as they say'... Wrong!!! 'Gone with the wind' is maybe, the best movie about a civil war. The cast is great. Clark Gable is the arrogant Rhett and Vivien Leigh as the famous Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled girl of the movies. With the charming Olivia De Havilland, 'Gone with the wind' is a good tale of war, love and tears. This classic film was maybe one of the most difficult projects to carry out. David O'Selznick, the produce of this masterpiece, thought that the Margaret Mithcell's book it could not be. With insistence David O'Selznick decides to accept. For the cast, was put Gable in the act. But, Scarlett!!!. A quantity of actresses go for the character. For example, Diana Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball and Loretta Young. At the end, was Vivien, who was presented to Selznick by his brother, Myron Selznick. Vivien was daughter of a french man and a Irish woman as Scarlett, her character, was daughter of an Irish man and a french woman. Selznick with Gable, Leigh, a wonderful cast like Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hatie Mc Daniel, Thomas Mitchell and various directors as Victor Fleming , George Cukor, Sam Wood, William Cameron Menzies and Sidney Franklin made one of the best historical films of all history of cinema. A true masterpiece.And now i think that 'Gone with the wind' and her little character is inspiring. A life of battle, a life of war, a life of love. 'Gone with the wind' is one of those masterpieces that are unforgettable.* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",10,5,8,16 December 2006

Pi," The nature of mathematics
","*Please, don't read this commentary if you have not seen the movie yet Since little, i never like the mathematics. The movies is, have been, and i hope than still be one of my passions. When i was little, i thought that the mathematics don't give much to world and don't be necessary. Few years ago, i reflect of their importance in spite of my little interest for it. Max Cohen says for encouragement his rules and beliefs. The first one was 'Mathematics are the language of nature', the second one 'All can be explain or understood by numbers' and the third and last one was 'Nature has systems that can be represented' Max Cohen is the famous math of 'Pi'. Max was obsessed with the idea of found the mystery that revealed Pi. He has an hypothesis about the order and the secret that was hidden behind the numbers of the stock. His brain don't have any other obsession than that. He maybe is so close of found the secret... but there is people who is interested in that secret too. But his obsession make that his brain, that have all the answers and ideas, suffer.The topic of 'Pi' sincerely rouses me. And I am still bad with the mathematics. This movie talks, in a frenetic way, about the obsessions of the human mind and how can take to the limits in a bad way. In spite that the the filmography of Darren Aronfsky is not much, 'Requiem for a dream' (That have a lot of visual characteristics like 'Pi') and this one makes him one of the best director of today.'Pi' is a perfect analysis about the human mind. Their capacity of think and desire at the same time.*Sorry for the mistakes. Well, if there any.",10,1,3,4 March 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Perfect for Halloween ... perfect for Christmas ... perfect for kids ... perfect for adults ... just ... perfect
","I have always liked the work of Tim Burton. I think is one of the most imaginative directors. He had great movies (except 'Planet of the apes' and 'Sleppy Hollow').'The nightmare before Christmas' is the story of Jack, a skeleton who lives in Halloween town. But he is so tired of screams, ghosts and monsters. Suddenly, he discovers a new world for him. The Christmas town. Now he want live the Christmas too ... but the problems begin here. With the incredible music of Danny Elfman, the story of Tim Burton is one of the most imaginative tales of all times.With the wonderful ones Catherine O'Hara and Chris Sarandon, this lovely movie had certain characteristics imposed by various influences. For example, Vincent Price. The short 'Vincent' is an ode to his Tim Burton's inspiration. 'Vincent' uses the same techniques of 'The nightmare before Christmas'. I believe in that time nobody saw it come.The characters like Jack, Sally, the mad scientist, the faces of the mayor, the evil children's, the witches, Santa and the villain Oogie Boogie are unforgettable. The songs are sticky and beautiful too.So, before you will request candies, before you open your presents watch this movie first. This is a good movie. A movie for all.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any",10,2,3,29 November 2006
Mulholland Drive," This is the girl
","David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' is a confuse movie. So if you try to see it you have to think first in this: No matter if you see all the movie and you don't understand some points, is important that you know that you're not have the most super mind in all the earth to understand all the things in the act. Besides, this movie is for that... because is a mystery that you must resolve. For that reason, the director give to the audience Ten clues to discover the mystery.All that i say is enough to affirming that the work is maybe more than a masterpiece. 'Mulholland Drive' or (i write it just for curiosity) the Spanish title 'Sue√±os, misterios y secretos' (Dreams, mysteries and secrets) is a really an excellent film. Besides an amazing soundtrack. Other thing that i love of this film is the cast. I don't have any idea before watch the film that the beautiful Naomi Watts are the girl of the cover that i always see. Other person from the cast that surprise was the apparition of the veteran Ann Miller as the character of Coco.'Mulholland Drive' is a film that with all the glamour of the classic Hollywood, gives a story of personality, mysteries and all that the crazy and distinguished mind of David Lynch can give to us.* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",10,3,5,22 December 2006
The Evil Dead," Good try Mr. Raimi
","'The evil dead' is a movie of absurd horror. Is an imaginative but disgusting and bloody story of our hero in horror movies Ash. In a lonely cabin, in a calm forest there is a curse. A curse that won't stop until possess all that finds in the woods.The story, surpasses some limits, and that thing make the movie not comfortable. For example... i know in the story, the trees have power of anything... but, come on, a woman who is raped by a tree? I think is a little violent and (apologize for the repetition) not comfortable. It is a very creative, but not well presented story. Is a movie for those that want a good fright and to see blood until in the mat.In all ways, Sam Raimi makes an excellent work as director. And this movie are not so good, but is a rare and good experience if you want to pass a fright night with your friends.In spite of everything, this is a great horror masterpiece that it should be appreciated.*sorry me for any spelling error",7,1,3,15 November 2006
The Piano," A beautiful poem of music

A man who fall in love of her... and now she and he will live an uncontrolled adventure of passions, music and sadness.The piano in the beach, the woman talking with the music, her little girl dancing with her innocence and the man who found the love is how 'The piano' makes feel good, and the same times very bad.'The Piano' is a beautiful graphic poem of cultures, music and love. Is a story of surprises and feelings that neither the same spectator cannot control in the heart.* Sorry for orthographic errors",9,1,3,21 November 2006
Big Fish," A Story that you never going to forget
","And i say it for my own experience, because i see this movie i watched this movie more than two years ago, and in spite of that i can write this commentary without problem, i never going to forget 'Big Fish'Tim Burton surprise in each movie that he makes, sometimes for good ('Bettlejuice' 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands' and i hope that he do it again with the dark Sondheim's musical adaptation 'Sweeney Todd'), sometimes for bad ('Planet of the Apes' and 'Sleepy Hollow'). And without doubt of it and happy i can say that 'Big Fish' is, not only the best movie that he ever made, is too one of the best movies that i have ever seen and it probably (No matters if I'm going to a topic that is so discussed) one of the best movies ever made. The story of 'Big Fish', which was based it in the novel by Daniel Wallace, talk us about Will, who has lost affection for his father. One day, he receives a phone call from his family... his father is dying. He remembers then what was the cause of that lose of affection: Will hates when his father entertains all telling them all the stories of his youth. All of that stories are fantastic ones. Will hates it. When he was a kid he loves it. But now he hates it. When Will go to home again to take care to his father... he don't know that he is going to live the most big adventure of his life.Tim Burton's 'Big Fish' is a real nostalgic experience in a beautiful way (Few movies that i have ever seen, in spite that i have not seen much, makes that feeling on you, like 'Smultronst√§llet' by Ingmar Bergman, 'Meet me in St. Louis' by Vincente Minelli, 'City Lights' by Chaplin and 'Le Fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain' by magistral director Jean-Pierre Jeunet), makes it cares in the REAL facts that makes so important life. I talk about your father, your mother, your sister, your brother, your family, your family or the people who loves and you love too. 'Big Fish' is too a kind of time machine that returns us to that paradise of our childhood that much times we reject as adults. And in spite of that you'll be and adult, you can enjoy all that fantasy, all that story that, anyway, makes us human beens.This movie is perfect is perfect too in the direction (I think that if is Tim, is very obvious), the performances ( My God, what cast! Ewan McGregor who was too in 'Trainspotting' and 'Moulin Rouge!' 'Albert Finney' 'Billy Crudup', 'Jessica Lange' who was in 'Crimes of the Heart' , Helena Bonhan Carter who was too in 'Getting it Right' by Randal Kleiser, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi who was very funny here and in 'Ghost World' by Terry Zwigoff, Danny de Vito, Mattew McGrory who was wonderful as the giant, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai who was great as the paper of Ping and Ting, with other magnificent cast) and the scenario is real beautiful, in any detail. 'Big Fish' is a real masterpiece, not only of the contemporaneous cinema, too of the history of cinema. Of course is just my opinion, and its maybe that movie with a touch of fantasy, surrealism and at the same time about present time, where the human been makes a world of corruption, some people can shows that we can change it a little with a tiny piece of sugar of fantasy, we can change the world and our lives in an inexplicable way. Thanks Tim. You bring us that little piece of sugar of fantasy that we need. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",10,3,4,30 April 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Strange, beautiful and excellently made for an open and patient mind
","Undoubtelly, one of the best photographed movies of all time is Kubrick's masterpiece '2001: A Space Oddisey', but is maybe one of that masterpieces that much can see over and over again, and others not even finished in spite that know how much people and critic loves this movie.This Kubrick's movie is a beautiful show of a past and present human been for then going to our undeniable future, like a cycle, although that it could be a lot of other possibilities for it ending. Is a good and respectable opinion, no matter if was based or not in the book ideas. The film deals with the dawn of men, the apes, thing that reminds so much the Darwin theory i guess. The follow up to a world that not even today could imagine before seeing it. And its meaningful ending. But these three things are connected for an instrument, an element, that maybe could explain the continuity of the race, of future.I understand how people could be amazed in those times. Kubrick's manage of widescreen is very important, and here is not a joke! Just like in movies like Dario Argento's 'Suspiria', that could be an excellent example. You cant feel the exactly masterful feeling if your eyes don't note all the whole thing, and here in '2001' this happen, as one of these masterful (Sorry the word repetition) achievements. The shots of space are more than wonderful, are breathtaking! The music is more than appropriate, is perfect. But is of course slowly, and this is one of its achievement, but is a thing too that undoubtedly some people can take as the boring thing. The film is very slowly and full of silence, just like space is. But of course, although that this film never going to be dated (i think none film is) but people of today for example now is accustomed for other things, with more action and quickly artificial effects, and this movie is not like those. This one have such spectacular special effects, so perfect that you don't see any artificiality, you believe it. The use of colors, as its music, are more than masterful, are used for be hypnotic, just what this film deserve.In other situation, through the story of course appears too a topic that was handled perfectly just before in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', the technological domination, in this case our beloved infamous 'Hal'.This is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made, but is, a funny thing, not one of my favorites. Sometimes i feel it so hard to taking it, maybe for be so slowing, that is, like i say before, another great achievement. In spite of this, i think that is a necessary movie, where it seems that our humanity is driven mad, but the ending of this movie is a true that humans, being physical or spiritual, must to face for grow up. In some way, for good.PD: Althoug that this film don't is one of my favorites, and i feel the thing very slowly, i give it a 10, because the idea is giving impartial and veridical critics, the film is breathtaking and is excellently made. Maybe i could change of opinion, i think that this is one of those films that you must see and see again. Don loose it, and be patient, is worth it! And please, see it in widescreen! *Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",10,1,3,23 December 2007
Saw," The game of life. We're already playing it.
","'Saw' is to me an important success, at least, in Hollywood XXI century history. The horror genre, since here, begin a new era. But few win in originality as 'Saw'... well, maybe not in its totally, but explore a premise that has been treated through years in movies: The punishment of characters for their actions. Thing, that all we remember more from 'Seven'. But 'Saw and this one have differences.I say that is so important, that we still know the plot of 'Saw' -Maybe thanks to, if you not seen 'Saw', but you saw 'Scary Movie 4'... well, you know things too-: Two men wake stuck with their feet chained. They listen to the mysterious person who do this. But he don't want any kind of money or something like that, he want to play a game... My God, this thing don't seems to be nothing good. 'Saw' wins and fail in some aspects.'Saw' could win in, if some say that is not originality (Because saw 'Seven' before) win in storytelling and in technique. The movie is undeniably catching, as too a little graphic, but too enough, and that is a very positive point. The performances are perfect, because are very believable (Hard performances of Leigh Whannell - who writes the story too - and Makenzie Vega are thrilling and even touching). Althoug, i think that the plot is even more original that much people thinks, but in other hand, is too a little forced with its intention. And the other acknowledgment: the ending is chiller, frightening and surprising.I defend 'Saw' because is a new creative hope, that much after try to clone but failed terribly... this demonstrate that none genre is dead, as much people think of Musical and Horror genres... maybe, this only just begun.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",9,0,2,14 July 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Beethoven and ultra violence. Yes... of course its about our 'clockwork orange'.
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the most important directors of all movies history. He makes controversy since his 'Dr Strangelove' to its confuse 'Eyes Wide Shut', and films that we never going to forget like 'Lolita', 'Full Metal Jacket' (I Have not seen this yet) and famous horror classic 'The Shining'. But, without a doubt, 'A Clockwork Orange' can be called as its most important masterpiece. 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the most important critiques to any powerful division of the world. Home, politic, religion and morality are the central critiqued topics. All of this deceived by one of the most unforgettable and hated characters of movies of all time: Alex de Large.'A Clockwork Orange', based on Anthony Burgess, told us the story of Alex. He is a young guy like any of its age. Well, only that he don't like go to school, and instead of that, he decided go with his 'droogs' for milk-plus and at the same time to reserve forces for a night of ultra-violence, steal, rape and murder. But all change when Alex friends are unlawful with him. All is going to change? With a unforgettable Malcolm Mc Doweell as Alex, this futuristic propose of Kubrick is one of the most important works that i (Maybe every one) have ever seen. If don't is the 'most important' critique of society (For me, the best movie that critiques society and world in every sense is Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Sal√≤ o le 120 giornati di Sodoma') is one of the best that you'll ever find. Alex, is that sarcastic character who embodies all a society. A dirty, unlawful and unmoral society. A society that in all its division, has and own interest (Politics and religion). An abusive and vengeful society. A society where only the strongest survives. The weakest lives wretchedly. And a society that think itself that is changed for good ... but maybe its the same ... maybe worst.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",10,1,3,20 May 2007
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," If the walls could tell us the things that see
","I have seen few works of Pasolini and i have not liked as much as perhaps it should be. But 'Sal√≤ or the 120 days of Sodom' changes an entire thought that i had created of Pasolini.This unpleasant movie about the human coldness is based on a story written by Sade. The story is about four powerful and fascist men that, with four former prostitutes they kidnap a number of adolescent men and women to torture them sadistically.I didn't want to watch the movie the first time that the opportunity appeared, i decided that it was better to wait and to investigate to understand the movie well. When i saw it the impact was hard but not traumatic.'Sal√≤ or the 120 days of Sodom' can be seen by any person that wants to see it, this movie is not exclusive for intellectual people, but the person that wants to see it should investigate first about the fascism, of the life of Pasolini, of Sade and until the same Dante Alighieri. I think that if people don't take these steps first, the movie will be superficially view and it wont be seen by their meaning.This criticizes by Pasolini toward the war it is a perfect metaphor of the fascism in Italy and at the same time a summarized chronicle of what this artist lived time behind. It is a work that many times, for alone to see the superficial thing and not the meaning, is not well interpreted.'Sal√≤ or the 120 days of Sodom' is not a movie to enjoy, it is a movie to make us think on that sometimes us, the people, should be it that supposedly are, human. And this movie express this perfectly, doesn't care in the time that is.*Excuse me, for any error with the words",10,12,19,22 November 2006
Pulp Fiction," Just a good milkshake of $5 please!
","Much people love Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' and i don't blame them, the film has an unexpected way to show us a story of violence. 'Pulp Fiction' just have my attention for one thing... the character of Uma Thurman, that i think (please, don't blame me if i'm wrong) Tarantino adapt from Neil Jordan's 'The Crying Game'. But, this is not the Femme Fatale that we know in Neil Jordan's film. Uma Thurman represents a sexy lady. A lady with her black hair. A lady who want dance without stop. 'Pulp Fiction', i think, is an adaptation of all the violence of situations. Situations that is around us all the time... of course, with a little of fiction there. I confess the film cant be a favorite for me... but i admit is good made film. But a little excessive for nothing.After all the film works and has good thrills.*Sorry for the mistakes... well,if there any",8,1,2,15 December 2006
Army of Darkness," A review: Army of Darkness (1992)
","Army of Darkness (1992)** out of ****Directed by Sam RaimiWith Bruce CampbellAsh (Yes, from 'The Evil Dead') wakes up in 1300 A.D and now must recover the Necronomicon to save the city and back to its time. Disappointing third and last (It seems) entry in 'The Evil Dead' series which seemingly begins where the 'Dead by Dawn' ends. Not with the sweet Ash of the last entries, here is more rude, like a comic book hero. Great special effects, specially with the 'Jason and the Argonauts' look a like skeletons, which are, maybe, the best highlight in this movie. Kind of funny, but really inferior to great 'Evil Dead' and 'Dead by Dawn'. Get back in the woods.",Null,2,3,22 March 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Listen to the children's of the night: They said that love never dies!
","As a child, i remember how i look the adaptation of the famous novel of Bram Stocker - in spite that my first real vampire experience at that time was classic F.W Murnau 'Nosferatu'- by Francis Ford Coppola: Was a horrible for me when i see all blood extravaganza in the beginning as in the scene where the the wolf scape of the zoo and Lucy is bitten by the beast. Was really a shock experience. The other things that my mind reminds and since then remember always is that frighting and powerful music. Now, i saw it complete and the shock not was so different as i remember.If all don't know the story or if it is based in a novel written at the beginning of the XX century - based in a real character-, all of us know who is Dracula (Much of it thanks to movies), but few adaptation catch the real thing, that darkness that make Dracula so famous. The adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola is, in spite of an almost big down in a moment in its plot, one of the best that i have ever seen (I apologize that i have not read complete the book, thing that i going to do soon). Closer of be the perfect Dracula (The best that i have ever seen is, without a doubt: Max Scherck of 'Nosferatu'), Gary Oldman embodies the ghostly and seductive essence of his character. The part in the cast is great too: Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins, Bill Campbell and Edie Frost shines too. But maybe the most exciting and most characteristic that achieve the excellence is the image, the scenario, the colors and its music. The unforgettable -as a i say bellow- soundtrack is a real wonder. 'Bram Stocker's Dracula' achieves in that point, something that movies like 'Meet in St. Louis', 'Le faboleux destin de Am√É¬©lie Poulain' and 'Big Fish' do in color and texture -althoug don't in the creepy meaning- . In this way 'Bram Stocker's Dracula' is a real feast for our view.'Bram Stocker's Dracula' is a recommended movie, specially if you a good breathtaking vampire movie with great performances and great direction.*Sorry for the mistakes...well,if there any.",8,1,1,14 July 2007
Music and Lyrics," Way Back Into Love
","To have inspiration to compose a song is not something easy, but you can do it if you have the will and dedication to it. Since little, i always wonder how difficult can be to compose a song. I always imagine it, but always i think that was a hard job because mixed music with lyrics its not so easy ... but you can do it, and 'Music and Lyrics' proves it.This new romantic comedy work with the old new formula of big comedies of today, simply that it uses well, and it is not exceeded with it, like in much cases. 'Music and Lyrics' told the story of an 80s rocker in our days called Alex. He wants enjoy of success, he doesn't want that nobody forgets him. He must do something fast. He has a good offer by a new pop singer named Cora. She gives him the opportunity of compose a new song for her. But he should have the song in less than one week. He doesn't know how can do it. Suddenlly appears Sophie, a girl assigned to take care of his plants. She is very creative, and Alex need that creativity. So, Sophie decided, without any guarantee, to help him. 'Music and Lyrics' is an entertaining comedy, not the best in its kind, but surely entertain and makes us remember that sticky music. The movie counts with a great Hugh Grant as Alex and Drew Barrymore as our beloved Sophie. With other good performances we have too Kristen Johnston, Brad Garret and Haley Bennet.Are movies about rock bands and songs, but - at least me - i have not ever seen a movie about compose a song and its effects with the show business (Remember that 'Theres no business, like show business') and i think that is marvelous. Although that don't play much 80s music like i think, the soundtrack here is very sticky and fun, as much of the situations that sometimes are so touching. If 'Music and Lyrics' is another romantic comedy, is a good one, and an excellent choice to have some fun and tender situations.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",8,0,0,11 June 2007
Carrie," Revenge, sweet revenge
","I remember films adaptations of Stephen King stories like the crazy man in 'The Shining', the famous evil clown that represents the fear of the kids in 'It' and the most gorgeous 'fan' that all writer wants have in 'Misery' and all are good. But don't has, like that Cole Porter song 'thing' that 'Carrie' have.The plot is about a girl who have a bad mother, who don't have friends, who have bad classmates, who have a power. That power is the telekinesis ... and she is a good girl, but... 'Carrie' is not a regular movie, there is blood but not like a regular movie. The film, based in the first novel by Stephen King, was directed by Brian De Palma. I have not seen more movies of this director, i want get 'The Phantom of the Paradise', but 'Carrie' make me know that Brian De Palma is a good director. With the touching music of Pino Donaggio, 'Carrie' makes me scream ... but, like the film, is not that regular scream. Is a scream that becomes from my body. The movie makes you chills a lot ... besides has an impressive cast like Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen and Beety Buckley.Please, if you have not see yet, don't let anyone tell you about anything more of the plot ...when you see it, you know why.'Carrie'... you've got that thing...*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any",10,3,5,26 December 2006
Trainspotting," A temptation hard to resist
","It was very hard that 'Trainspoting' arrived to me. But, thank to God i found it.Is a silly but amusing story about a drug addict. He decided leave the heroine. But he doesn't know what waits him. Ewan McGregor has a great and unforgettable performance as Renton, with the others characters (Sick Boy, Diane, Spud and the abusive Begbie) makes this movie as a contemporary success.I had three favorite movies about drugs, and of course, the three movies have an impressive quality. But the three have a different quality. The expressive 'Requiem for a dream', the horrible but true 'Christiane F.' and this one, the rare, disgusting and surprising 'Trainspotting' Besides a spectacular soundtrack, 'Trainspotting' has an interesting story. A story, that makes you laugh. And laugh with meaning. *Sorry for the mistakes ... if there any",10,2,3,29 November 2006
Speed," A without stopping action baby!!!
","I don't hate action movies. But after all, like much of the horror movies, has a little and an uncomfortable clich√© of death and bombs. Bombs! That essential element in films like this... and then appears 'Speed', one of the most, i think, ingenious story of action in film of all times. 'Speed' told us the story of a policeman from SWAT unit, if I'm not wrong. There is a villain who want kill for money (theres a clich√©). With Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper as the bad guy, 'Speed' or the famous Spanish title 'Maxima Velocidad' is creative plot with a lot of twists. If you ignore the clich√©s of the action movies, this title can take you to a incredible experience of thrills.So, go to your Bus Stop and see it!* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",9,0,0,21 December 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best horror fantasy of the 80's
","'A nightmare on Elm Street' is one of the best imaginative horror stories of all the cinema history.It is also one of the few movies that expresses a magic story that scares and it moves us.Our heroine is Nancy. A teenager that begins to suspect of a malicious man that only exists in her nightmares and in that their friends. Now she has to stop it before he kill her.The tale is fantastic, but after all had some flaws. For example, the end confuse a little, because we don't know if Nancy survives or not.I think one thing, the end is good. Why? Because maybe Freddy is dead and this was the last nightmare of Nancy.Of course, i say this without taking into account the sequels.Well, perhaps it is a question for the spectator...this it can be a way that the public decides what wants that it happens to Nancy.Another thing... i love the performance of Heather Langenkamp *Sorry, if there any mistake or something like that",10,0,0,11 November 2006
Click," Good topic ... Adam Sandler's best performance ... typical realization
","Sincerely, i don't like the films of Adam Sandler. This is an exception, but maybe a wrong exception. Because the performances of 'Click' are great, maybe the best performance of Adam Sandler, the topic of the plot are fabulous and well made. Besides a nostalgic message. But in spite of that, the movie continues being the typical comedy. And this make just acceptable the movie.The story talks about the love of the family, the dominance of the work and the complications of the new technologies in a man. A man that after the ambition, he recognizes their errors. We all have a opportunity. This is the message of 'Click'. And is beautiful. But the film is typical, with new jokes, but the plot sometimes follow that thing of the new comedy films.But many people don't consider the movie is just comedy, is a drama too. Well, i cant say is a drama, but of course is sad and very touching.'Click' is not perfect, but is a good option to fun and have a beautiful message that makes think.*Sorry for any mistake... if there any",7,2,5,29 November 2006

","'Psycho' is good, 'Rear Window' is more than good ... but 'The Birds' taken all the applause.

'The Birds' tell us the story of Melanie, a beautiful girl that decides go to a little town. There, she met a man and his family... but suddenly, thousand of birds begin to attack to people without any explanation.Although the story can be a lost of time, thank to God is not. The story is very fun and thrilling, the performances believable (of course, the amazing Jessica Tandy is there), and the direction is so good. 'The Birds' is a different and bloody movie of situations a little illogical, because is a little rare that birds attack humans. But... well, i have not read the story yet (i don't even know if i can get it), but is a fantastic and good tale of horror.Watch then 'The Birds' a great Hitchcock classic.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any",10,2,3,30 November 2006

Well, i get happy when i knew that was a movie of a T.V series that i have seen since little, but... when i go out of the cinema was the same happy feeling? 'the Simpsons' begins as a T.V series in the early 90s. Since there has become as one of the most important success in T.V. All the world have been listen at least just once about the yellow family. Is intelligent series with interesting plots, created by Matt Groening and released by a lot of creative people,without count with that music theme that we never going to forget. The T.V series is the funniest and best t.V show that i have ever seen. And now, we got the film. Much Simpsons fans (As i am) wait, and wait, and expect that this movie don't be unfaithful to this expects. Today i see this movie. And although i think that this movie leave some empty spaces, much of The Simpsons fans will be happy and pleased.The movie told us another Simpson adventure (Just like any other episode after all, just than more longer). The Simpsons family receives from grandpa'a kind of omen. Marge is very worry for that, but Homer is worried too... but for Spider-Pig! In other side, Lisa Simpson is worried too for the lake, which is more polluted than before and can be a dangerous response to it. Springfield catches conscience (???) about the situation and decides to take care about the lake... no one can throw more garbage to this lake... but Homer... well, you know... Homer commits a big, big mistake.'The Simpsons Movie' have a good plot after all, which is important because carries a lot of important things that we don't know of the series. I get so proud any way when i watch the credits and found to all that people who work for this big project. Then i go out of the cinema, not so happy as i think, but certainly very pleased. Any Simpson fan going to love it, because after all is loyal with this. Althoug, i think that this film is lightly more violent than the T.V series, and i recommended it for persons from 12 years.This movie going to make you pass a good time after all, is funny and great, but i think sometimes that it doesn't make justice to a series of so high quality.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",8,2,7,27 July 2007
