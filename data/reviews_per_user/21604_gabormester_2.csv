The Blair Witch Project," Best comedy of the year
","I really wanted to like this movie.There were some scary parts, but the audience laughed during the film. Not a few people, but everybody. The biggest laugh were at the end of the movie. It ruined the feeling. Still it was way much better, than the Haunting.",5,0,2,6 January 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Too boring for an action-fantasy, too ridiculous for a drama
","This is probably the most overrated movie of all time. I did not like this movie at all. It had absolutely boring dialogs, thin story (could have been told in one hour) and the most unrealistic special effects ever seen. I could never understand those who love this movie.Want to see a true masterpiece? Watch Fight Club!2/10",2,0,1,25 May 2001
