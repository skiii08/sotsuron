Changeling," Great Period Film...Eastwood's Best Film
","Simply put, although it is like a Hollywood-styled melodrama, this film is superior to Clint's other masterpieces Million Dollar Baby and The Unforgiven which both won Best Picture and Best Director. Those films were more original and I think Unforgiven was his best, but in terms of film-making, not originality, Changeling is better. Great period-piece without CGI or other modern technologies require meticulous attention to details on sets and style of the period. This film succeeds in re-creating the 1920s (even if some details are not quite accurate) with terrific sets and cinematography. The script was excellent and acting was very good. Angelina isn't a great actress but she pulls off convincing scenes such as when she shows her discomfort, confusion and despair when she is alone with the boy Arthur or facing the corrupt psychiatrist. John Malkovich often seems forced and superficial in his acting, but here he plays a convincing role as a driven anti-corruption clergyman. There are plenty of films with missing children, murders, and abused women, but this film climbs a notch above an ice floe of penguins: films that are alike. The film strength is really drawn from its sense of hope. It gives and it takes like an action film with plenty of twists. You draw hope with the child off the train and then feel let down. You draw hope when Christine Collins (Angelina's character) gets a phone call from a friend and again, you feel her disappointment. Even though it is easy to know how a Hollywood-style melodramatic thriller ends, this film scores big with the idea of a mother's hope.",10,3,4,7 March 2009
Skyfall," Bond Full Circle
","Daniel Craig finally makes a Bond film worthy of Sean Connery, by general consensus the best Bond. To do that, the filmmakers had to go full circle for this film. Casino Royale was too serious; Quantum of Solace was just action; but Skyfall brings back the nostalgic Bond.The movie has its usual intense chase and fight scenes. Some casino gambling. The ending is intense as it gets. One of the strongest Bond endings.It's not without flaws. For example, the opening credits move the classic eye and shot trademark to the end. And the opening credits visual effects were confusing and not as fun as some of the cheesier but classic 60s and 70s Bond films. An unconvincing Komodo Dragon. And Albert Finney as an elderly Kincade shooting 'em up. The gorgeous Bérénice Marlohe is absolutely two notches ahead of Craig's companions, e.g, Eve Green in the Bond girl department. However, she is quite too expendable and Bond loses his female counterpart. Remember, Bond is supposed to get the girl. Don't confuse Eve played by Naomie Harris. Save that for a pleasant surprise. Javier Bardem is a great actor as the villain but he falls a notch short of his role in No Country for Old Men. He's a bit awkward in the entering scene. Is he a villain? Or a strange dude? The good thing is that as the movie progresses, Bardem gets better with his Silva character. Otherwise the acting was strong with Judi Dench as M and Ralph Fiennes moving in as the future man. Ben Whishaw as Q represents the thematic anti-technology that classic Bond embraces. As the movie progresses, the new Q realizes, technology isn't all there is.The movie is a bit like Never Say Never Again or Thunderball with questioning whether Bond is in shape, ready for action and deserves his license to kill. Or should he join AARP in the retirement home? Some things can't be measured such as the propensity and art for killing. One can see some influence actually perhaps from the pursuit of Osama Bin Laden. To remain hidden from American intelligence, he had to cut off modern technology. M16 has just that problem. And so does Bond. To operate covertly, technology must be the most advanced. But what if it is compromised. How do you remain hidden? Ninja-like. Bond-like. It channels Sam Worthington's character in Terminator Salvation or Woody Allen's Sleeper. It's the sometimes played theme: to infiltrate the enemy, you must have no name, no record. You need your Aston Martin and Walther PPK. Several criticisms pointed out they didn't feel the classic Bond. Perhaps they were not paying attention since the film deliberately brought back that especially with the classic Aston Martin ripping out of the garage. And this is the film that reveals Bond's parents, as Ian Fleming would have it at the Skyfall cemetery.The next mission leaves no electronic trail. But it can leave a paper trail or folder on the table for your eyes only. In that manner, it justifies the return to the classic Bond.",9,1,9,9 December 2012
Gravity," Visually Stunning, Laughable at Times
","Gravity is a beautiful film! It shows how far we've come in special effects. It portrays itself as a realistic film, that is, with realistic images of floating in space, flying through the atmosphere, etc. I can't decide whether this film is a 7 or 8.I think 7.5 just for the images in space, the curve of Earth, the space stations, the reflection off the glass, Sandra's breathing condensing on the glass, Sandra's effortless floating glide through the Russian and Chinese stations. Quite visually beautiful.But really, it is more fantasy than science fiction. I think I would have rate this higher (8.-8.5) if I knew to expect a fantasy film. But I feel a bit disappointed as many others. Almost none of the physics are real and it defies what really happens in space and defies NASA protocols. For accuracy, here's an astronaut's comments:http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/astronaut-fact-checks-gravity.htmlThe script from minute one was just bad at times. George Clooney trash talking and zipping around without a tether. He'd be released from NASA, never be allowed in space again. Acting by Clooney was actually better than acting by Sandra Bullock who more or less played herself. She is a bit kooky and she has a bit of her Miss Congeniality in her. George also played himself but somewhat had more charm than Sandra. Too much testosterone. However, the best moment was when Ryan Stone (Sandra) drifts off into unconsciousness and she imaginesor is it communication from the dead? It is a well-crafted touching scene with Clooney and Bullock talking. And then she talks about her daughter. The girl with one shoe, I believe she said. A statement on our mortality. Perhaps the best drama scene in the film.Definitely this film deserves the Oscar and BAFTA for visual effects and cinematographyand maybe a couple more. But Best Director? or nomination for Best Actress? It's an empowering film for a female lead. It empowers Sandra Bullock. And inspires many young girls to be an astronaut perhaps. Liberating and uplifting. But really, if you check the URL above, almost nothing would have happened. As pointed out, Sandra's character, Ryan Stone, would have never been trained in a simulator. Worst, Sandra doesn't quite portray a woman of confidence or science. Rather she relies on the manly Clooney coming to the rescue. Dr. Stone is more like Dr. Claustrophobic and Ms. Panic. She's not the composed, strong woman that a real astronaut probably would be in space. Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney would have never let go and leave her alone. There is no gravity acting on Matt in the scene where she is caught in the lines and he is holding on. It therefore kind of resembles joyride of 'Armageddon'. Yet Gravity is a better film.Gravity is a dramatic movie with little realism, but still plenty of fun. It actually reminded me of another extract-yourself-from-the-debris action movie, Daylight, with Sylvester Stallone. But Daylight has a remote likelihood but Gravity lacks most realism. That is why I laughed at Ryan Stone's eight or ninth time she should have died. Perhaps she is a Terminator? Never dying. A superhero. She needs a cape. Gravity ranks among the best films based in space but it clearly isn't 2001 or Contact. The latter film with Jodie Foster is much superior in script, acting, direction and even comes close with nice special effects. Gravity is a 7-7.5 and Contact might be 8.0-8.5. Gravity has nine lives. It's your day, Dr Stone.I wonder if Cate Blanchett or Julianne Moore might have been a more credible, calmer Ryan. I would have like a stronger woman in charge, more convincing as an astronaut. Just that the opening scenes and Ryan's goofy inexperience in space make her reminiscent of Miss Congeniality. Gravity might have been the best science fiction/fantasy film of the year. If only the plot was more realistic and script were better. Then it might deserve a spot as one of the best space films. But even with flaws, the visual effects rank it high among the very best if that's your piece of cake. For space films, it deserves a top 10-12 rank. For fantasy/scifi, top 25. But that many Oscars? Yes, we will be all asking that question ten years from now as there were many better movies in a strong 2013.",7,2,4,26 March 2014
The Expendables," Expendable, No Tough Guy Punch
","This could have been one of the ultimate guy movies. If so, Sly Stallone should have given up his director's and screenwriter's job...what was he thinking? It's as if Rocky Balboa himself wrote the script and directed...maybe with help from Mike Tyson. That is to say, it's written on a junior high school level. Considering the sophistication of action movies today, this film attempts to be a bit of an anachronism, a throwback to the 1980s to a Rambo/Commando tough dumb guy movie but in many ways, this film is worst. The saving grace is having the presence of Statham, Li, Couture and Austin. Jason probably has the best script and role. He shines as the gunner from the plane and as a tough boyfriend on the bike. Jet Li is the butt of sad, stereotype jokes with a silly name like Yin Yang and is badly utilized. It's a throwback to racist stereotypes from old Hollywood movies. Coulture has a nice fight scene at the end. And Austin was quite credible and fun as a baddie. To note, Terry Crews doesn't have a great role but his shoot 'em up is one of the fun parts of the film. Mickey Rourke does a great job acting as he plays a role similar to his Iron Man 2 role (as Ivan Vanko) but I wonder if his philosophical rambling makes any sense in this kind of film. For Mickey, it is one of his best character roles (with Iron Man 2). Lundgren just can't act and his role doesn't make much sense. Eric Roberts is overly played as the bad guy. As many point out, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis are very underused; I can understand Arnold might be too busy as governor to lend much more.Not only is the script really poor but the plot hardly makes sense. And although the action is very good, the camera work was mediocre. Back to the script: David Zayas plays a ridiculous role of dictator on an island that seems totally unrealistic. The connection between Sandra (played by Giselle Itie), the daughter of the dictator and Barney Ross (Sly) is awkward and out of the blue nonsense. Perhaps a few extra minutes connecting the two more emotionally might have made the film more credit. Otherwise the mission made no sense.OK to have an old-fashion movie and use no CGI, but at least have a credible plot and script. I would give this film a 3 if it had only 2-3 of the stars. But due to the fun part of seeing all these dumb muscles, it's a 4.5 but there's no category so 4...or 5 depending on my mood. That is, your average movie...but a waste of a cast. A decent movie to see on a rerun on a rainy day with nothing to do and you feel brain-dead.",3,2,7,8 December 2010
Interstellar," Muddled yet, well done Sci-Fi
","(NOTE: I DON'T CONSIDER THESE SPOILERS BUT SOME MIGHT, NO GIVEAWAYS, JUST DISCUSSION). A paradox. Christopher Nolan is like an Escher drawing or Rubick's Cube. But puzzles don't make great films. They make great puzzles. At 8.9 on IMDb (at this writing), Interstellar has to rank as one of the most overrated films of all time (e.g, The Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club). Overrated doesn't mean bad, BTW. Was it justifiable at $165 million? No. I actually rate this 7.5/10, a thoroughly enjoyable film, one of the year's best 10 films. And maybe among the best 25-30 sicfis of all time. It is actually superior to the critically better- received Gravity. So what's the puzzle this time?ANSWER: Love is the Sixth Dimension. Really, it transcends space, like gravity and time. Even the movie has a couple quotes that suggest it. Love makes the world go round. Preach, Nolan. What's great about the film? Excellent cinematography (9.5), strong acting (9.0, particularly by Michael Caine, Matthew McConaughey, and Jessica Chastain), great directing (9.5, this is actually one of Nolan's best directed films), great editing, great special effects, good soundtrack (not amazing but it certainly fits with the film). I saw Interstellar in an IMAX with butt-kicking seatsso I really did feel like I was taking off in a spaceship or I hit the ground when it crashed. So that clearly added to the fun!I would rank this as one of Nolan's 3-4 best films: The Dark Knight (rate 8.5), Batman Begins (rate 9.0+), Memento (8.0+). Inception (6.5) is vastly overrated. The problem is that Nolan has tapped into what fans like. Puzzles. He found that out with Memento and carried it a bit too far with Inception. So now he has a trademark. The film scored 73% on Rottentomatoes.comwhich is about where I would put it. Maybe it should be 80%-85%?The plot, despite some criticism, was inaccurate but solid fun. However, what hurts the movie (according to those who criticized it):1. Weak writing. The Nolans should have have a scifi writer and physicist join their team. I'll go over a few wormholesI mean, loopholes. 2. Length of the movie. At 168 minutes, it gets redundant. 3. Too much dialogue. 4. Couldn't decide what it wanted to do or say.Issues with writing (plot): 1. The issue of a world dying. Well, it starts off that way talking about failed crops and dust bowls but they don't get worstin the about 25 years time span, we still see crops and no one starving. Nolan needs to rethink how he would draw his future world. Just unconvincing. 2. NASA and farmers. The moon missions were claimed to be a big propaganda. So if they were, how does the government convince people to start traveling into space? That is, government has to convince people to do what they just unconvinced people. That doesn't make sense. Now it really becomes the big lie? The same as how Cooper and his daughter find NASA with coordinates. So if NASA doesn't want to be known, why the big floodlights and 'why are you here?' Realistically, they would send some local police to escort Cooper off the grounds. A better idea might be allowing Cooper to break in and get caught. Not NASA saying, It's us! How did you find us!' Rather silly. 3. Building on #2. So NASA realizes they have been caught by a farmer. So you invite the farmer to fly a spaceship? Silly. A more plausible plot is directly approach Cooper to work for NASA again. Or Cooper finding secrets and NASA inquiring hownot a trip and fall into the spaceship routine. 4. Blackhole and travel. So they really are going to explore a planet next to a black hole and dying star? Moving from an Earth that isn't dying to a dying star. Doesn't make sense. Along with that, how do you get transported from a black hole back to Saturn? It wasn't a wormhole. How did he survive in a black hole, how did he communicate? But I think the Nolans were confused themselves. They might have miswrote it and filmgoers just accept and try to explain why. Sometimes writer make mistakes. Like we always see a film with a goof. I don't have too much problem with the scienceor really stretch of science, but if you assume something can happen, than they need to stick with that and not change the rest. So it appears they confused the wormhole and black hole. Some people suggest 'They' created the portal in the black hole. But we later find out, maybe 'They' isn't 'They' so maybe Cooper created it. But how? If he and Murph were the originatorshow did it get there? 5. The first planet and water. Shouldn't TARS be retrieving the data? What's wrong with these people? It doesn't really flow. More like teenagers in a horror movie trying to get killed. Aren't you trying not to get killed? But then, horror movies would lose their victims. 6. Matt Damon. He doesn't make sense. I'm not sure if his character is needed. It was all of a sudden, mad scientist time. 7. Professor Brand's ego. It's stated he knew the solution but didn't want let others know since he wanted space exploration. Really? But he was a part of space-denying NASA? And everyone knew the world was dying? So what's not to say leaving Earth is a good idea? Apparently Brand wasn't convinced a dying planet was a valid reason to leave Earth. Confusing, I know. A flaw in the script. And realistically, a scientist would have reacted the opposite and seek to prove his solution works. But only in the Nolan world of puzzles.",7,0,2,16 December 2014
Salt," Tomb Raider meets Jason Bourne and no one wins
","Another entry into the superspy genre, this film stars Angelina Jolie who plays Evelyn Salt a CIA operative who gets framed or rather caught into action as a double agent. She eludes her American fellow agents, thwarts the Russian conspirators and smashes her way as a superheroine, superior to either JB: James Bond or Jason Bourne. Liev Schreiber is solid as her fellow agent in the CIA who sticks by her side. August Diehl is convincing as Evelyn's loving husband who never abandons her and changes her outlook on the world. Beware the superspy on a mission of vengeance! Phillip Noyce does a nice job of directing.So that's the good, fun news. The not-so-good is the weak script, weak plot and just unconvincing action. Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is a bit more convincing, more human character. James Bond made more than a few human errors as in his Quantum of Solace. But at least the action is terrific. Perhaps it reminds me of La Femme Nikita without the stylish director of Luc Besson and the vulnerability of Anne Parillaud. Only in the opening spy trade-off do we really feel for Evelyn. If it stayed more to that path, it would have made a much better film. The rest of the way it is a charade or worst, a farce. It's a fine movie to watch on DVD, not to pay $10 for the theatre but to pass a rainy day with nothing to do but watch a mindless movie with a plot retold a hundred times.I might give this film a 6 but it is so silly at times. Angelina's best action film was Tomb Raider. Here the writers decided it's Tomb Raider meets James Bond. Write a better script and give Evelyn a bit more vulnerability and we'll have an 8 of a movie.",5,1,2,4 January 2011
The Exorcist," One of the Greatest Horror Films
","A classic. One of the greatest 3-4 horror films of all-time and should be in IMDb tops 150-200 films of all time. Many people either consider this the greatest horror film of all-time but a few claim it doesn't hold up to time. Most classics don't hold up to time either mostly because of taste. Just look at art and music, which even more radically changes taste over the centuries. So some criticism is undeserved since the claim is its subject isn't believable or it can't capture the shock value of more gory or twisting plots. However, this film isn't really about twisting plots or simple gore. For its time, it carries a shock in the vulgar language spoken by the demon possessing Regan (Linda Blair). That's at a time when censorship was becoming more relaxed. It was a measure of the impact of the 60s to 70s transition in movies from Mary Poppins to Midnight Cowboy.The movie hails in realism and more psycho-drama than simple horror. Our two central stars are Regan and Father Karras (Jason Miller) who is a modern priest trained in medicine (psychiatry) with doubts as to his place in the church. Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, the expert in exorcism who maintains a semi-mysterious role. All three thespians were beyond excellent which adds to the value of a horror film. Lee J Cobb plays Kinderman, a police detective investigating a related possible murder, perhaps unevenly and unnecessarily. The weakest role is Ellen Burstyn's Chris McNeil who plays a histrionic mother. She overplays a somewhat spoiled actress who finds episodes of emotion rage unconvincingly. It's bizarre that Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for acting since it was far weaker than Blair, von Sydow or Miller. Nevertheless, the film is otherwise superbly acted. The real strength of the film is really the directing and cinematography combination. Forever etched in cinema is the classic scene when the shadowy figure of Father Merrin arrives at the house at night emerging from the taxi and under the fog and lights of the house. The opening excavation scene was beautifully done. Or the underrated shot of Karras's mother on Regan's bed or the shadow of the howling Regan (is that a creature) with the demon shadow. That combination of the skills of cinematographer Owen Roizman and director William Friedkin were brilliant. I find those types of artistic statements have greater value than the head-turning of the cursing Regan.I give this classic a 9.3 in reality but a 10 here to up the rather low 8.0 IMDb average which really should be more like a 8.2. It's embarrassing to see what's rated at 8.1-8.3: V for Vendetta, Pan's Labyrinth, Die Hard...some good and not-so-good movies, but not deserving to be among the top 150-200 films.",10,0,0,16 June 2016
Frozen," Hokey, Dated Disney Musical saved by Olaf the Snowman
","Heard so much about this movie so I decided to watch it thinking it would be marvelous. But it's really quite the opposite. I think it might only appeal to little girls but for no other reason than the two protagonists are two princesses, Anna and Elsa. That could make for a great premise. But.So here's where the movie fails. First the humor is weak. We have to tolerate the Swedish accented storekeeper Anna runs into. Or Anna'a awkwardness and ramble substitutes as humor. Along with the lack of likable animal characters, this film has none except possibly Sven the reindeer and the one saving grace, Olaf the snowman.Animation is very mediocre compared to what we see from Pixar (Disney!?) and Dreamworks. Add a weak script and way too many songs (about 5 in the first 20 minutes). If you don't have a good song, don't throw in 3 bad songs just for the sake of it.Finally its plot is something from the 1940s or 1950s.So it's 5 out of 10. 3 for Olaf.",5,2,4,11 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Solid horror film - but usual flaws
","What makes this flick good? Solid acting, directing and suspense. However, as with most sci-fi or horror flicks, it has the usual wonder-why-they-do-stupid-things moments. In fact the whole premise is the stupidity of not being able to fool or kill the creatures. Yes, you can shoot one with one bullet. Not so tough. And they hunt by sound, right. So if you throw a rock far off, you can do the old distraction trick. Why one has to scream and sacrifice one's life makes no sense. You can scream and then run away and fool the creature since it can't know your present position but has to go on to where it last heard sound. Can't even do sonar. That's less effective than little brown bats. Oldest trick in the book is to distract or fool the blind. So why didn't people do that? Maybe people are really dumb. Or the people who came up with the idea are not that bright. And finally, given the sensitivity to sound, yes, of course, that's must be related to the creatures' weakness. Why some military personnel or scientist didn't test and try to eliminate creatures that way. If such creatures really exist, they would have easily been eliminated. So like the usual teen horror movie, we have to question the weak premise of such creatures becoming a dominant specie. Can't happen, sorry, it doesn't make sense. Hence the whole film isn't believable. But who notices?",7,2,4,19 May 2019
Ip Man," Brilliant Martial Arts Drama
","I was very surprised how good this movie was as I randomly picked it from DVD rentals. Normally one does not believe the critics testimonials or taglines, but in this case, they were accurate. Ip Man is probably the best modern martial arts movie ever and surpasses Enter the Dragon (Bruce Lee), Legend of Drunken Master (Jackie Chan), Fist of Legend (Jet Li), etc. Why? Most martial arts movies are rated on their action. Not overall filmmaking. And I do mention modern (meaning taking place in the last 150-200 years)...not classic wushu movies (e.g., House of Flying Daggers).The film is about Ip Man, the founder of Wing Chun, who is a reluctant teacher but proud family man. The action soars when he is challenged by visiting martial artists or rival schools. Some movies are rags-to-riches but this film witnesses a hero born in affluence but drawn into poverty by war and misfortune. The drama soars when he labors hard under Japanese rule in order to feed his family. Or when he trains the factory workers to resist bullying gangs. It shows the human side of a martial artist who is humbled through a difficult war but protects his family and friends.The action is nearly as vibrant as Bruce Lee's or Jackie Chan's best. But this film surpasses them in cinematography, directing, acting and drama. The newer Hong Kong films, admittedly are better visual quality than the older films which were cheaply made. Donnie Yen brilliantly achieves the zen of acting in serious drama with his passion and calm something which Jackie Chan always seriously wanted to achieve despite his amazing comedic skills. Jet Li is a solid actor and Bruce Lee, although we respect him as a legend, wasn't a great actor. Instead Donnie Yen portrays Ip Man passionately as a family man with silent pride and inner strength.For action and Wing Chun, I'm no real expert but I've seen enough to know and I would rate the choreographed fight scenes as very good although maybe not as exciting as some other films. The most interesting fight scene was in the house with a rival teacher when Yen has to make a promise to his wife. Lightly but masterfully done. Having Sammo Hung helping out in the stunts and choreography is always an asset.Wilson Yip does a terrific job of directing if not at times a bit melodramatic but passionately done. Sing-Pui O does brilliant cinematography with subtle filter (more tastefully done than the blue of Underworld); Kenneth Mak recreates a beautiful artistic feel much like a traditional wushu film (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Kenji Kawai produces a wonderful soundtrack and Ka-Fai Cheung edits smoothly.Sadly it doesn't hit a heart in the west as it gather awards for best picture, action choreography and actor from the east. Most traditional awards (e.g, Academy Awards, BAFTA) don't know how to judge this type of film and competing in technical achievement or visual effects or choreography doesn't quite fit the western type (e.g., imagine comparing choreography of a musical like Chicago).As for the overall feel, it hits that wonderful, soaring note when you cheer for the underdog or the unstated hero. It's easy to stand up and cheer for this film, which is several times better than Rocky or Rudy. Several people criticized the film for historical accuracy but really, since when are movies that accurate? It's the storyline that grabs us. Real history sometimes is a bit boring. This film isn't.",9,1,2,9 March 2011
Prisoners," Possibly Best Film of 2013?
","Prisoners is a terrific maze of a thriller as the viewer is never quite sure of what's about to happen. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who has solved every case he's had. And this one is not to elude him but amazingly, he's hot and cold, off and on, and only solves the case with a bit of luck. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a man who will almost stop at nothing to find his daughter. His and Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) are fathers caught between desperation and loss of ethics. As vigilantes, they take twisted justice into their own hands. As one amateur reviewer here suggests, it is an unusual thriller clouded by moral ambiguity. However, I'm not sure if that is really the case, but rather how far are we willing to test morality and ethics.Acting is excellent by all major characters including Viola Davis who plays a distraught Nancy Birch, Maria Bello who plays Grace Dover, Melissa Leo who is excellent as Holly Jones, and Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones. Cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villeneuve is outstanding. Kudos to Roger who was nominated for an Oscar and this is as good as his cinematography in No Country For Old Men.Amazingly, Prisoners only received one Oscar nomination. But then many great films were snubbed by the Oscars. For example, Citizen Kane often rated #1 on many critics list only won one Oscar. Taxi Driver went 0 for 4 in wins and nominations, and Once Upon a Time in the West never received any nominations but among most critics, these films are among the best.Looking up some lists as for the best films of 2013, for example, the Huffington Post lists 17 films topped by 2) Gravity and 1) American Hustle. Gravity is a spectacular visual film with a poor script, average acting and weak plot as it defies every realistic scenario in space. It will fall into the Rocky category, a film honored by a clueless academy that should beg forgiveness. American Hustle is superior to Gravity but dries up a but at the end. I would place Prisoners at the same level, and perhaps even better than American Hustle. It is probably the best thriller since Silence of the Lambs and a remarkable insightful film into human ethics. Unfortunately, despite being in that category, it happened to be made in 2013 which, frankly, appears to be one of the strongest cluster of films, although, I would think many 9s but perhaps no legendary 10s.However, only a few graphic thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs or No Country for Old Men have ever been recognized. One wonders if being too graphic turned off Oscar nominations. Hollywood would rather have a clean sentimental screening, like Gravity or 12 Years A Slave. But as time goes on, this film should rise as a classic.",9,2,4,3 April 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," Uplifting, fun, one of the best animated films ever!
","REVIEW:This entry into 3D cinema is a wonderful adventure which has both elements of a traditional fairy tale and of a modern teen nerd story. It tells a updated version of befriending dragons, similar to The Neverending Story and Dragonheart. The animation is Dreamworks' best and sets very high standards with its complexities with dragon flight, fire-breathing, and nature (clouds, water, etc). My friends and I found it uplifting, funny and off-beat, not unlike Shrek. The voices especially those of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, and Christopher Mintz- Plasse were terrific. Hiccup and Fishlegs are refreshing, unheroic nerds much like Po in Kung Fu Panda.I heard the reviews which were generally very good but this movie exceeded my expectations in the first ten minutes with its dramatic opener. Aside from that, the soaring flight into the sky with Hiccup and Astrid was animation at its most majestic. The relationship between Hiccup and his father Stoick was the most endearing family relationship I've seen portrayed in animation. The lines for Hiccup, Fishlegs, and most of the other Viking teens was colorful, sarcastic and insightful. The lighting, color and cinematography push the boundaries and are unmatched in animation.If any shortcoming this film has, I thought initially the dragons should have been bigger and more scary, but that would have defeated the plot. Some people criticized the dragons but when you realize what the filmmakers were attempting, it made perfect sense. In fact, the variety of dragons was very creative as we are introduced to many of them. Toothless, although plain-looking was made to resemble a big black cat or panther. The idea of dragons as pests to dragons as pets defined the roles of dragons in this movie. CRITICS? Most interesting was Roger Ebert's criticism of the film. I don't think he actually watched it since quite a few of his comments were factually incorrect. For example, suggesting Hiccup used a cannon, that the adult Vikings rode the dragons or there was a final battle scene between good and tons of bad dragons. Those things never happened...uh, Roger.In addition, some people wrote in on IMDb. First, there's comparison with Pixar which many believe sets the standards. Second, there's complaints that the story is unoriginal and too familiar. I would challenge both. First, if you check the success of both companies, Pixar has 9 movies grossing over $400 million worldwide and Dreamworks has 8 movies grossing over $400 million. Second, the average Pixar rates slightly higher but I feel some of Pixar films are slightly overrated in particular Wally-E or The Incredibles (I know, sacrilegious to some). (On the other hand, I think Ratatouille is far superior to Wally-E or The Incredibles.) Some people find HHTYD theme of a son trying to please or fulfill his father's expectations as too familiar and unoriginal...but really, can you name a film that has the same theme? The most common movie plots and genres are: action thrillers, sexy murders, horror, superheros (why the Incredibles is less original), romantic comedies, fairy tale endings, sci-fi thrillers, vampire movies (as of late), westerns, musicals, sports movies, period romances and period actions (e.g., Gladiator)...well, I made my point. I think people think this theme has been often done, but it is only our own story at home (we all have families, right?) that makes it familiar. Besides considering films like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast...are those great animated films original? Clearly Dragons is refreshing and more original.THE BEST ANIMATED FILMS Dragon ranks as Dreamworks best along with Shrek. Right behind are Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Kung Fu Panda. It's in the class with Pixar's Up, Toy Story 3 and maybe Ratatouille. They rank along with the more classic greats as Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King or Snow White...or less traditional animated films like Spirited Away, The Iron Giant, or South Park. In short, How To Train Your Dragon ranks as one of the top 10-15 animated films of all-time.",10,0,0,9 December 2010
Inception," A Combination of the Matrix, Shutter Island and Memento
","I saw this movie with a big group of 10. I would guess the group's rating might be an 8.5, very enjoyable! Personally I was one of the 2-3 least gripped maybe because I've seen too many movies. The 9.3 rating on IMDb is enthusiasm in a bubble. And bubbles do burst. Those mesmerized will vote this film as fun as a roller coaster - pop entertainment but no masterpiece. That said, it is best to compare this as one of the latest rides in Universal Studios theme park rather than belonging in the halls of cinema's greatest films. For pure entertainment, Inception gets a 8.5 in an IMAX theatre so it really helped when they talked about a 'kick' and your seat gets a kick. Nolan tends to give us kicks for thought. Comparatively Nolan's Memento is a bit creative and the ending of the Prestige bizarrely entertaining and horrifying. In general, Inception has more firepower than either The Prestige or Memento. Its special effects and editing are exquisitely done and captivates the audience. So it is entertainment on high adrenalin.As a film, however, Inception is at times awkward and confusing. Perhaps that sets up the audience for the dreams. The reality check was the 747 and the totems the characters used. The script is generic and simple but there are psychoanalytic allegories. One of the screenwriters must have been a chess player since the whole mind game evolves from that and references to Robert Fischer, the prey of the mind criminals, could be mistaken for the American grandmaster. The idea of him seizing his father's empire (the chessboard and the desire to kill one's father, as in the Oedipus complex) is psycho-babble. Inception takes this theme subtly with the implicit use of Ariadne Ellen Page's pawn totem. The characters are all pawns in chess dream. We always speculate on dream control and whether falling means death. Much of the dream states are unimaginative clichés, however, the layering of them makes it interesting. Leonardo's last movie, Shutter Island, was a better blur between reality and fantasy. We see Inception as an intellectual challenge, but it is more a technical challenge which leaves the characters and the real story undeveloped. What is the real underlying story? I think it is Dorn Cobb's desire to reunite with his dead wife and with his children. In fact, given the brass top totem is not Dorn's (Leonardo's), but belongs to his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), one wonders at the end whether it is a dream or not. The mind crime was a dream and the reality was an ordinary man traveling to visit his family after his wife dies. Note at the end, none of the characters acknowledge each other. The only person who recognizes Dorn is his father played by Michael Caine. One could argue that they are trying to keep anonymous as Fischer is present. Or perhaps Dorn dreamt up the whole movie and only the end is the real part.Nolan is a great technical director, the special efforts are great and not overdone, and the movie grips the audience much like a roller coaster. But the script is a bit spotty, the plot perhaps deliberately muddled and the emotional story of Dorn and his wife doesn't quite unfold. None of the actors except Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon- Levitt really make the best use of their roles. Leonardo was solid but he's had better performances. Michael Caine's role is innocuous, but quite charming. Marion Cotillard is effective and plays a significant role but perhaps we could see more of her. Nolan surpasses Memento but doesn't match up to the Matrix which still holds the lead for mind-bending action-scifi. Regardless, as Alfred Hitchcock raised the mystery to an art form, Nolan pushes the complex sci-fi thriller. In the end, he isn't quite a master as Hitchcock, but he remains one of the finer directors today.",7,11,22,25 July 2010
Rango," Brilliant Animated Film Draws References from Classics
","Most animated films are made for families and children but here we see a rare film that almost falls into the art film category. Rango is a perverse, philosophical tribute to movie- making which can be difficult to comprehend. The references to other films requires viewing this gem several times but the humor can be a bit too sophisticated or vulgar for some. It's an existential film about chameleon finding who he is, if he is the hero and whether he has an identity in the old west, much like the Man With No Name, a tribute to Sergio Leone's films.The film is rich with references to other films. For example, some people point out the Ride of the Valkyries in the canyon with the bats as a tribute to Apocalypse Now or Ned Beatty's mayor is a tribute to Chinatown and the little girl who always asks questions is remotely similar to a character in True Grit. The tower in the town is a bit like The Quick and The Dead (which had the woman with no name seeking revenge as in Once Upon a Time in the West). The reference to water and control is clearly from Dune, another movie where water was a central theme (He who controls the water or 'spice'...)...and the walking cactus in the desert are reminiscent of the worms as well as water everywhere in the end...We get hints of the philosophy of the film when in the beginning, we realize our protagonist is a lonely, nerdy chameleon who first runs into the question of why did the armadillo cross the road. The Spirt of the West lies on the other side (and we later see he's incredibly close to a screen legend without a name). The alabaster carriage and golden guardians turns out to be hilariously something familiar to us (hint: Oscar and Clint). The dream images are like Native American soul-searching with the Great Spirit. And the image of the earth bugs carrying away Rango to the distant future might be a reference to visions of death, perhaps a bit as in Gladiator.Industrial Light & Magic did a brilliant job of animation with the details of shadows in the town and the desert panorama. The rich close-ups of the animal characters is a bit disconcerting. I love the rabbit with one ear or Spoons, the white rat with the strong cowboy accent. The close-ups of the ugly characters is a tribute to Sergio Leone who loved to zoom in on eyes and facial skin cracks. Perhaps the most film references, however, as to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. We see Rango's mayor is a cripple like OUTITW's Morton who competes with Jake the Snake (Henry Fonda). The black hat might be Lee van Cleef but easily Fonda's Frank. The scene in the bar where Rango finds his name is clearly a reference to OUTITW when Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain) meets Charles Bronson (Harmonica) and Jason Robards (Cheyenne). Lionel Stander's bartender was copied by the toady barman. The mayor makes references to the future, buying the ranch (owned by Beans who even has red hair like Jill McBain) and that Jake isn't a businessman but the last gunslinger is a reference to Once Upon a Time in the West....the characters and lines are quite similar. The drink sliding across the bar in the shadows was a reference to Cheyenne sliding the gun across to Harmonica. There's an interview by the visual effects director who actually mentions the numerous references and modeling after Once Upon a Time in the West. That movie, consider by many the greatest western ever made, was a tribute to many westerns that came before and also copied the classic westerns.This film is clearly for the film buff, but not necessarily for everyone. It's a rich comedy that has the depth of The Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane or 8 1/2.",9,0,1,16 July 2011
Centurion," Follows Gladiator in its fierce spirit with flaws
","The latest entry into the modern peplum (blood and sandals) film this film uses a bit of the Gladiator formula. The good news is that it doesn't overkill on CGI like 300. I'm still shocked how high 300 ratings are...really it's quite average but it appears to develop a cult following. Like some people consider McDonald's great food. Anyhow, like Gladiator, it deals with Roman legionnaires who fight for Rome although perhaps they'd rather retire and have a normal life with a family. Michael Fassbender and archrival Olga Kurylenko leads a strong, relatively unknown cast of legionnaires versus Picts. The plot deals with the massacre of the Ninth Legion and how it tries to rescue its general but instead is hounded by Picts bent on revenge. The film is Gladiator meets Deliverance as the legionnaires and their Picts enemies hunt each other to death. The acting and cinematography is very good. The films weakness is sometimes the action where the blood looks too bright like tomato juice. Aside from that, the action was fairly good and I think actually better than the over- CIGed 300. Neil Marshall was probably also rushed to finish this film on a limited budget. And the opening scenes which start off like an opera singer choking on a high note. It's a bit jarred at the start but as it gathers moss, it flies smoothly to the point. The final showdown isn't a big fight since the sides have been decimated but it leads to the end where futility in fighting for Rome is realized. Which is why I compare it to Gladiator. Its message is the simple life is more desirable than glory. Russell Crowe as Maximus loves his family and wanted to go home. Quintus Dias finds whats more important to him than glory.It looked like the distributors/producers couldn't market this film and panicked thinking it won't sell tickets at the theater. So it was sadly pulled to go to DVD. Not a bad film.",6,4,8,5 January 2011
Black Panther," Spectacularly Mediocre and now nominated for Academy Awards best picture??!
","Hard to really pick a rating for this Marvel entry. All the clamor about one of the best Marvel films fails to meet objective standards. But money talks, very loudly! BP had a production budget of $200M and a marketing budget of $150M. It's like spending a few million for a Formula One racing car but getting a midsize Toyota. Not to say it's a bad film, but it could be so much better on so many fronts. I can understand Oscar nominations for special effects, visual effects and makeup/costumes. All deserved. Maybe even cinematography.But consider several things: acting is very average, script is a bit on the weak side, directing is average. It's a very expensivemaybe abive average superhero flick. But money speaks and you can market a film. If you show it in every theatre and bring it to attention of Academy members, you win. For example, think about the success of McDonald's: mediocre food but outstanding marketing and presence. So everyone wants a below average burger. In today's world, sometimes we fail to think for ourselves.The cultural impact on black America is immense, but that doesn't mean it's outstanding. It's interesting as it creates a whole new world in Wakanda. Which is why some critics rate it highly. Much like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, it follows a spectacular imagination. And think of some films that did that and failed overall: The Last Airbender, has been the worst. But that's comparison with LOTR ends. The acting, script and directing in LOTR series was much better. I rate BP only a 4 but I could give it a 5, 6 or maybe a 6.5 at its highest. But given all the overly optimistic voting, I'm downgrading it.BP' cast led by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and Michael Jordan as Erik really wasn't strong except the female roles of Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira were stronger, despite average scripts. It's solid entertainment but not Marvel's best. By comparison of superhero films of the same period, compare Wonder Woman. It's superior in many ways except David Thewlis as Morgan/Ares or the supervillain. You gotta be kidding, right? Somewhat not convincing. Patty Jenkins did a better job at directing than Ryan Coogler. But who's paying attention?",4,8,14,23 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great Trilogy ends 90% great, 10% weak
","If you love visual effects and Middle Earth fantasy, this film is excellent. Casting, soundtrack, effects is awesome (the first really set the stage for the GREATEST adventure). For me Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Viggo Mortensen (Aragon) and Andy Sirkis (Gollum) were exceptional! The visual effects are stunning and it's fun to see orcs get slashed. We all have to wait a year to see each film which builds up the drama so maybe I was a bit disappointed by the ending which was ddddrrraaaawwwwnnn out. Great movies don't need long closure. They simply stand on their own. The last 20 minutes could have been condensed to 5 minutes. Just end with the coronation and Gandalf departing. Watching the hobbits go home and Sam getting married is anti-climatic like seeing an old Scarlett O'Hara in a rebuilt Tara surrounded by grandchildren. Or seeing an arthritic Lawrence of Arabia riding around a jeep in the end (doesn't a horse look better?). I feel the first, the Fellowship of the Ring was the best since it took time to develop a plot and characters and special effects were still terrific. There was suspense to the first movie which was absent in the last. I would have rated this movie a 8.5 or 9 but the last 15 minutes is a 3. That explains my 8 overall. I still really like most of the movie: I was just left a bit flat by the ending.",8,2,4,6 November 2004
V for Vendetta," Unintentionally Funny 1984-Type Movie
","I saw V is for Vendetta with a group of eight. We are the type who likes action and sophisticated films. This film did not make the cut; we came out laughing wondering what a waste of time. Overall, I think we thought it was a 4 of 10. I give it lower since it is a waste of Natalie Portman, John Hurt, and Stephen Rhea and lots of money. What makes it silly is that it takes a neo-Nazi totalitarian regime and gives it credibility in a future-England-like society. I can't see that happening. John Hurt was easy to see through as an evil prime minister. But can millions of people be that naive? Perhaps in a less sophisticated or educated society or a third world culture. But almost definitely not a modern western society. Terrorism conducted by V in his mask becomes justified to combat Nazi-like totalitarianism. OK, but conducted by a man who wears a silly mask? Is that truly credible? Brazil and 1984 (also with John Hurt) are far better films (and still not great films). Furthermore, the political monologues by V were not inspiring. It was like watching a clown trying to recite a serious Hamlet monologue. Hard to take serious. Even the cinematography is not particularly great but at least a bit atmospheric. The ending was downright silly as the climax builds up to a date to remember so the movie claims...but perhaps a date to forget if you watch the end...plain dumb. At least give the audience more credit for a believable movie.",2,4,8,6 December 2006
