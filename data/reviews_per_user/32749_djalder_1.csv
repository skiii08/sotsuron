The Perks of Being a Wallflower," the love we all deserve
","The movie version of the perks of being a wallflower almost perfectly resembles the book; not only in the plot, but the character development and traits, the setting. it was so surreal that it made me point out things that i had remembered from when i read the book, like, 'oh, yeah, they did the rockys horror movie show thing in the book' or 'yeah, how he loved his english teacher'. defiantly recommend it to those who have read the book.",9,0,0,12 February 2019
