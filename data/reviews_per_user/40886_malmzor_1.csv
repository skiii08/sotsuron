Sucker Punch," Decent action but not much more.
","I enjoyed this movie for what it was. I didn't expect an Oscar-winning story so I wasn't let down on that point. But when the title is 'Sucker Punch' you really cant expect much more than an action film whose main audience is guys between 15-25.As I am a huge fan of the visual style in 300 I thought that this would satisfy me as well. The scenes where they are in this fantasy world are nice too look at and all I still feel like it should have been more than the few times that they occurred. I also feel that the first of these scenes set the bar to high and the rest of the movie couldn't reach that level. But that is probably because I'm a huge fan of those kinds of movies.So for the plot, and I am trying to give away as little as possible. There are five girls trying to escape from a facility. I can't say much about the girls as they are all stereotypical and not original at all;1. The older one who needs to be the center of attention. 2. The younger sister of that girl who wants to make her own decision. 3. The new girl who is taking the attention away from the previous center of attention. 4. The two girls that does what they are told and isn't a major part of the story.Also you don't feel any connection to the characters. This is something I don't like in movies because when something happens to the character you don't care. The girls mission is to collect five objects that they will need to escape from the facility. It is when the girls are trying to collect these items that you see the action scenes. Sounds weird? Well thats because it is. As they are getting the items in real life we see it all happen in the main-character Ambers imagination. What you see in the fantasy represents things that actually happens, and because you know that it all her fantasy you can enjoy the action scenes for what they are and not think about how unreal they are. The villain of this story is Blue Jones played by Oscar Isaac and he does an amazing job. He is smart (but not too smart), cold-hearted, manipulative and creepy. He is definitely doing the best performance in this movie and I would say that he is one of the best villains I've seen in recent films. For the rest of the cast I really can't say that much. It's not great but it's not bad either.I know a lot of people will try to find some meaning in this movie, other than the fact that your fantasy can be a tool for coping great sorrow. But the story didn't touch me enough to make me think about it as the movie went on and trying to analyze the deeper meaning of Sucker Punch in after hand is probably a waste of time.If you have nothing better to do an evening and you just want to watch something fun I would definitely recommend this movie. But not more than that as it's not a movie you'll want to watch twice.",Null,2,4,4 August 2011
