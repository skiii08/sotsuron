Marie Antoinette," Lush Budget, yes; History, no way
","Few women have been so poorly served by historians or film makers as Marie Antoinette. Marie's life has become a clothes peg on which successive biographers & directors hang what they please. The 1942 Norma Shearer film misrepresents Marie as a high-minded queen, nobly dedicated to the subjects who showed their appreciation by killing her. (Based on a biography by Stefan Zweig, the film could not address Zweig's explicitly sexual theory for Louis XVI's failure to consummate his marriage for 7 years.) The 1956 French film 'Marie Antoinette,' with Michele Morgan, lacks analysis or explanation for what happens. 'L'Autrichenne,' with Ute Lemper, re-enacts the queen's trial; the dialog, from the trial records, is of scant interest. The best film to date is 'Farewell, My Queen,' a dramatization of events at Versailles in the days after the fall of the Bastille in July 1789. The ease with which Marie's attention wandered is made obvious, & the undereducated queen's failure to grasp what was happening around her offers the real explanation for the blundering that led her to the scaffold in 1793.Sofia Coppola's films have been noted for a lack of character development & a preferential focus on atmosphere. 'Marie Antoinette' bears out that observation in spades. Whatever chances to deal with the evolution of Marie's character after the Revolution's outbreak vanished with Coppola's decision to end the film with the royal family's departure from Versailles in October 1789. It is the one general truth shared by all historians that Marie achieved nobility of character only in the last months of her life, after Louis XVI's death in January 1793 and before her death 10 months later. Coppola evades precisely that period of Marie's life, and shows us only the whipped-cream years at Versailles. It isn't at all clear what we're supposed to take from this treatment. Marie, played with a limp if sweet rag-doll complacency by a nearly expressionless Kirsten Dunst, is sent aged 14 to marry the doltish heir to the French throne. This would never have happened had not Marie's older sister, destined for the King of Naples, died of smallpox. Their mother, Empress Maria Theresa, had to advance her 2 youngest daughters, the elder of whom went to Naples. Marie, the youngest, was moved to the square of the Habsburg chessboard originally meant for the new Queen of Naples, and went to Versailles. It was never foreseen that she would marry the future King of France, so she had been left uneducated for her lot in life.From a court that placed less value on formality than did Versailles, Marie disliked Versailles from the get-go. Formality is represented by the Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis, in an effective if overdone performance), who presides over the daily ordeal whereby Marie has to dress, from the skin out, before courtiers. Dunst manages to convey the real Marie's irritation at this duty but, eager as ever to obey as her mother told her to do, goes with the program. She eats in public with her husband, and properly attends the delivery of her sister-in-law, though it causes her anguish since she herself has not yet had a child.Coppola's hold on facts is slim. The sister-in-law who has that baby was the Comtesse d'Artois, but the film makes her the Comtesse de Provence, who was childless. We see 2 of Louis XVI's spinster aunts, Victoire and Sophie, but there were 3--the eldest, Adelaide, was the dominant one, & the real troublemaker who set Marie against Louis XV's mistress, du Barry. Marie had 4 live born children,of whom 2 died before the Revolution; we get 3 here, and only 1 dies.The acting is largely bland if not lackluster, seemingly in keeping with Dunst's blankly smiling efforts to be charming. Marie is largely controlled, or directed, by more assertive types, particularly Madame de Polignac. Much of what we see Marie do in this film shows her trying to meet others' expectations, not her own wishes; were it not for her brother Emperor Joseph's visit to Versailles in 1777, during which he lectured Marie and Louis XVI on the lack of activity in the royal bed, she probably never would have had a child. Coppola is evidently trying for humor by staging Joseph's lecture to Louis at Versailles' zoo, where a bull elephant gives a good imitation of the male human anatomy as Joseph explains how things are supposed to work. The image is too obvious and heavy-handed to work. The same is true of sequences showing ladies of Versailles learning to snort snuff (standing in for a substance snorted today), or passing around a tobacco pipe (standing in for something smoked today that is often passed around). This silliness reaches a climax with the notorious shot of Converse high-tops glimpsed during a sequence in which Marie and her friends sort through a selection of new clothing, asking 'Can we get this in pink?'Coppola was evidently trying to make Marie accessible, or relevant, by implying that she was like a modern teenager, obsessed with new clothes and hairstyles and experimenting with 'snuff' and 'pipe tobacco.' Hogwash. There can be no valid comparison between an 18th-century princess and a teenager today. To begin with, today's teenage girls are, we hope, more concerned with ways to avoid pregnancy. In Marie's milieu, young girls were traded among kingdoms to serve as wombs, and throughout this film we see Marie constantly badgered to produce a male heir for her husband. At least Coppola didn't try to work smart phones or MP3s into this film.The one redeeming point is that Copolla was allowed to film extensively in the palace of Versailles, at the Petit Trianon and its adjacent village, so we have some sense of how Marie lived there. But that was only a part of this tragic woman's life, which is ill served by Coppola's essentially meaningless presentation.",3,1,1,15 May 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," Leave your history books at home; then maybe you'll enjoy it
","In fiction and history alike, it's Anne Boleyn who gets Henry VIII & thus commands most of our attention. Philippa Gregory wanted to examine Mary's history, though her novel plays fast & loose with the facts of Anne Boleyn's ascendancy at Henry VIII's court. It's a decent enough yarn, but ends up serving Mary poorly. She comes off in both book and film as a passive woman whose family treat her horribly but, weak & pliable, she's always there to help no matter what they've done to her. As Mary's character is at the heart of Gregory's story, her passivity doesn't rouse much sympathy for herself or the film. Mary was, in fact, more adventurous than Anne--mistress of the French King Francis I in her youth at his court, & sent home for loose morals. Back in England around 1520, Mary attracted Henry VIII who, to camouflage their affair & likely to cover up her first pregnancy by him, set up her marriage to a gentleman of his chamber. Henry probably fathered both children Mary bore while married & she may have continued to service him while Anne was playing the virtuous virgin. After Henry married Anne, Mary met William Stafford, became pregnant & married him in 1533/34. She was exiled from court & never saw Anne again. There's plenty of spice there but Gregory's curious failure to address it--especially Mary's early experiences at the French court--leaves this side of Mary's character in darkness. The film, alas, does likewise. That said, the film is a sumptuous delight for eye & ear even if the writing is stilted and the acting uneven. Eric Bana's Henry is badly served by a poor script &/or lousy editing. (Comparison to 'The Tudors' is unfair; a theatrical film does does not have as much time as a TV miniseries for detailed character development.) As written & acted, Johansson's Mary is too passive, almost naive, to impress. The film really belongs to two characters. Kristin Scott Thomas, as the troubled Lady Boleyn, comments from the margins of the social fabric on the forces at play in the Boleyns' story. Of the film's performances, Scott's is the most likely to be remembered at awards time. Natalie Portman's Anne resents Mary's unexpected success with Henry, childishly tries to steal the spotlight with a secret marriage to Henry Percy, then uses all her wiles to take the king from Mary. Portman handles this with ease & assurance, and compellingly portrays Anne's despair as she finds she has cost Henry too much: he realizes the prize was not worth the chase. Indeed the strength of Portman's portrayal only further subverts the supposedly central role of Mary Boleyn and wrests control of the narrative from Johansson's character. Gregory's novel was clear that Mary was to be considered the 'other' Boleyn girl, but by allowing Anne to upstage Mary completely--or rather by having Mary allow Anne to do so--the film at least introduces a challenging ambiguity as to which sister really was, or should be regarded as, the 'other.' That ambiguity is, however, the only really challenging aspect of the whole production.",7,1,2,15 June 2008
