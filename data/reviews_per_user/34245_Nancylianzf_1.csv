Despicable Me 2," Shortly Saying: GO WATCH THE MOVIE PEOPLE!!
","This is gonna be a very short review.2 years ago, I watched 'Despicable Me' and I absolutely fell in love with every one in that family. After I watched DM 2, all I can say is you have to watch it!!! I gave it a 10 because 1. I love Agnes. 2. I love those Minions. 3. It's beyond just funny!! I was laughing the whole time with all others.The story itself is simple and not as good as its predecessor . Being a great success in the first one, Minions nearly become the biggest main characters and they are everywhere in this movie, so is that chicken (oops, spoiler).Anyway, it is deff funnier but not necessarily better than the first one. Hope you enjoy it!!!",10,2,3,6 July 2013
