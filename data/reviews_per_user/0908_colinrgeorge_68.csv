The King's Speech," Too Much King, Not Enough Speech
","It's easy to shrug off awards films when the season rolls around, and on the surface, 'The King's Speech' shows all the symptoms of shameless Oscar bait. It's a period drama loaded with stiff English accents, led by a cast of previous Academy Award winners and nominees. In all honesty, the average moviegoer doesn't have a whole lot to be excited about in Tom Hooper's new film, but those compelled by the idea of a character study detailing the relationship between King George VI (Colin Firth) and his impertinent speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) will find this an often lively and effective drama.The speech angle is an interesting distinguishment. Unlike many of the films that helped lend the genre its dry reputation, authentic atmosphere doesn't substitute for drama here. 'The King's Speech' works not because we watch a historical personage overcome a debilitating verbal ailment, but because we watch a human being do so. Colin Firth has received much kudos for his performance, but it's likely many honored him for the wrong reasons. Firth is excellent because he humanizes George VI—making him rounder than some haughty profile —not because he can act with a stammer.Rush plays his counterpart with absolute authority. We get a sense of the coddled life George leads as a prince, and the implicit respect he garners from the countless instructors he's worked with before. Logue, who operates out of the basement of his shabby apartment building, is the first to deny George (or Bernie, as he presumes to call the future king) special treatment. His cheeky remarks and irreverent lessons occasionally offend, and the nature of their relationship is often antagonistic. The one thing His Royal Highness can't argue with, however, is the results.The greatest filmmaking fault then, out of necessity, is that 'The King's Speech' must divide its time between these enlightening lessons and more typical period drama affair. The impending death of King George V and a scandal between Prince Edward and an American divorcée play major roles in shaping the narrative arc, though are significantly less interesting to watch. In merely retelling history, Hooper loses the character-driven force that makes the one-on-one therapy segments so special. Outside of Logue's office, 'The King's Speech' becomes just another stylistically restrained biopic.The speech lessons, by comparison, free the director up. Probably there is no official record of what was said between George VI and Logue, and the scenes are infinitely better for it. 'The King's Speech' is almost a different film when released from the short reigns of history. The two characters come alive, as does the camera-work, exclusively in these instances. The difference isn't jarring enough to make the film feel disjointed, but there is scarcely a memorable moment that doesn't involve Logue.On the whole, 'The King's Speech' goes above and beyond most uninteresting but extravagantly decorated period films. The performances elevate the material beyond biography regurgitation, and by focusing on his characters above the historical events they instigated, Hooper avoids the most popular pitfalls of the genre. Ultimately, his film is still one caught between two worlds, and the balance struck between them isn't always perfect. The great atmosphere he creates within the context of the speech lessons is his own antagonist—he can't match that energy elsewhere.But even being intermittently captivating, 'The King's Speech' is absolutely worth seeing. It's not exactly what I would consider award-worthy, but that seems to be the only context in which such a film will be seen by most. In all honesty, you'll be better off ignoring the hype and seeing the movie simply because it features an unusually intimate portrait of a king, and a compelling story of personal triumph.

Moneyball," Not a Homerun, Maybe a Ground Rule Double
","Take my review of Moneyball with a grain of salt. Its two-and-a-quarter-hour running time probably rivals the aggregate amount of professional baseball I've watched over the past three years – which is to say, not much. I'm not the target audience for any sports flick, but a great cast delivering an Aaron Sorkin script put me in the seats. On that level, Moneyball delivers.Sorkin has a knack for finding the humanity in black and white statistics. It's in part what made his telling of Facebook's success story (last year's brilliant, brainy The Social Network) so remarkable. A fitting – if inferior – follow-up, Moneyball is as much about business as it is about baseball. In fact, the thesis of author Michael Lewis, upon whose book Sorkin and co- writer Steven Zaillian sculpted the screenplay, is that victory on the field can be reduced to mere mathematics.Enter Brad Pitt as Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane. After being creamed in the playoffs, many of his star players pick up contracts with teams with deeper pockets. The truth as Beane puts it is that baseball is a fundamentally unfair game. Affluent teams can afford the best players, and subsequently win the most games and the most championships. But rather than accept the status quo, Beane hires Yale grad Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), and cooks up a way to build a team around underrated but undesirable players, like a pitcher with unorthodox form and a ex-star pushing 40.'We're card counters now,' Beane explains to his mystified staff. Moneyball plays almost like a heist – and cheating any flawed system is exhilarating to watch. The problems stem from elsewhere; the movie drags in its second half, lacking the concise narrative momentum of fiction. It's a problem from which many biopics suffer, and though Sorkin fares better than most, he doesn't have a David Fincher behind the lens this time around.Granted, director Bennett Miller is no slouch, having made his Oscar-nominated Hollywood debut with Capote in 2005. With Moneyball, Miller faithfully photographs Sorkin and Zaillian's script, but never elevates it. Pitt and Hill are empathetic underdogs, and their performances convey admirable depth. Still, even in their best moments, it's hard not to wish that more weren't going on on screen.Moneyball also gets bogged down by superfluous subplots like flashbacks to Beane's fizzled pro baseball career and his relationship with his twelve-year-old daughter. The sequences give insight into the inner workings of the character's mind, but seldom feel relevant to the main thrust of the plot. Especially when they beget a string of false endings that has the audience on the edge of their seats in the worst sense of the term.Those scenes don't sink Moneyball, but they somewhat stifle its potential for greatness. The fascinating premise, that computers can pick winners better than we can, is partially buried under content far less novel. I've seen enough strained father/daughter relationships, thanks. The film would likewise run thinner and healthier without Beane's trips down memory lane.But it still works. Probably the best indication of the film's merit is that it appeals to viewers with no vested interest in the sport. At its finest, Moneyball is about the deconstruction of baseball romanticism, with a straightforward exchange of ideas that feels almost documentary at times. Surprisingly enough, it's the conventional storytelling devices that feel sluggish, unexciting, and repetitive. Not the baseball.",Null,0,1,23 September 2011
Whip It," 'Whip It'
","'Whip It,' the directorial debut of actress Drew Barrymore ('Beverly Hills Chihuahua,' 'E.T.'), is a film about full-contact women's roller derby, populated by characters with names like 'Maggie Mayhem,' 'Babe Ruthless,' and 'Smashley Simpson,' but is unsuccessful in co-opting the gritty appeal of the lifestyle. The movie's breezy affability and charm are evidence of its artistic shortcomings, and for a film so forward with its girl power, my man-ass could stand to have been more kicked. I should be emasculated. The world of roller derby should feel coarse and uninviting or at best kinkily arousing. Unfortunately, 'Whip It' didn't really elicit any of those feelings in me.The film is frilly and formal, with a shopworn foundation that roots the narrative in the clichéd quirk of the modern independent romantic comedy, though the subject matter screams to be a rough-around-the-edges outcast. To be fair, there's a degree of intentional contrast to protagonist Bliss Cavender (Ellen Page, 'Juno') and her double life--pleasing her mother as a beauty pageant queen, and kicking ass as the Jammer for the last place 'Hurl Scouts.' But the opening scene, where Bliss appears before her mother and a mortified panel of judges with recently dyed blue hair, serves as a perfect metaphor for the film itself, in that its approach to the counter-culture is a surface-level aesthetic rather than a complete attitude. Blue hair is about as wild as it gets.'Whip It' does build kinetic energy during its lively roller derby sequences, with fast, free- flowing camera-work that highlights the good-spirited brutality of the sport. Jimmy Fallon is even amusing as commentator 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket. However, the exhilaration of these sequences is matched by the banality of the rest of it: girl falls for lead singer in indie band, has waitress job at quirky small-town diner with quirky shift supervisor, consorts with precocious teens, and comes home to semi-broken family. The Americana is almost suffocating.But removed from the context of the current cinematic landscape, there's nothing especially wrong with 'Whip It,' it's just not surprising. Ellen Page's performance is completely earnest and convincing (also not surprising), and the film has the best of intentions. Barrymore proves a proficient if inauspicious director, with enough talent to warrant at least another go around.Her debut film is well meaning and inoffensive, with the sort of genial conceit that even our enemies aren't so bad, and forgiveness flows as fast and as senselessly between the characters as white water. Even the scumbag indie vocalist whom Bliss believes to be double- timing her may or may not have been guilty, and her reaction to his attempt to make amends is disappointingly timid. The film is intended more as a lightweight, feel-good empowerment piece than a challenging or realistic examination of the subject matter, which frustrates me but may delight some.It's a movie for modern moms and daughters, which I don't mean to offer as passive aggressive sexism, as the film is perfectly entertaining for a gender-neutral audience, and its flaws aren't identifiable from a male perspective so much as they are from a unisexually artistic perspective. A great piece of art challenges the preconceptions of the medium, which 'Whip It' decidedly doesn't. Rather, the film celebrates the bond that exists between Bliss and her matriarch (Marcia Gay harden), individuality, friendship, and the classification of family. It's sweet and palatable to both rebellious, headstrong teens and stiff but loving parents, which is an admirable but unambitious accomplishment. If you want to make a genuinely challenging film about gender identification and roller derby however, you'll have to dispense with the niceties and the formula and throw a punch.",6,3,6,6 April 2010
Black Swan," A Swan Dive into Darkness
","Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' makes ballet cool—and if that isn't a Herculean feat in itself, I don't know what is. It also happens to be one of the best films of the year, featuring one of the best performances of the year. Natalie Portman will be nominated for her devastating portrayal of petite perfectionist Nina the ballerina or I'll pull a Werner Herzog and eat my shoe.'Black Swan' is cut from the same cloth as Aronofsky's 2008 film 'The Wrestler,' if at the opposite end. Interestingly, before either project was realized, the director was reportedly mulling a drama about the relationship between a professional wrestler and a ballerina. Somewhere along the way, however, that concept was split down the middle—and thank God. 'Black Swan' is brilliant, but it wouldn't necessarily play well with others.Like its predecessor, the film examines a physically demanding and widely unappreciated art, and though thematically similar, the two complement each other via mutually exclusive cinematic vernaculars. 'The Wrestler' is ultimately a safer film. Its emotional experience is directly conveyed via plot and dialogue. What Aronofsky attempts with 'Black Swan' is riskier: he plays genre Frankenstein, taking established themes and transplanting them into that which feels initially least appropriate—horror.Yet despite certain unmistakable cues, I'd hesitate to call 'Black Swan' a horror film. Visually, maybe, but John Carpenter insists 'The Thing' is a Western, and likewise there is more to 'Black Swan' than is aesthetically obvious. It probably best fits the psychological thriller mold, but as Aronofsky suggests through his manipulation of mirrors, it is not a film that ever casts a clear reflection. For me, that dichotomy is what makes it so fascinating and rewarding.'Black Swan' strikes an immediate haunting note that seems to grow louder with reverberation rather than quieter. In the first half, the director lays track work; in the second, he runs right off it. Nina begins her journey receiving the coveted role of the Swan Queen in a modernist production of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake.' Her practiced technique makes her ideal for the role of the goodly White Swan, but her lascivious director (Vincent Cassel) has reservations about her ability to portray her evil twin, the titular Black Swan—a character that embodies impulse and lust. Nina's process of unlearning takes her to increasingly dark, surreal depths.The final act of the film comprises the most riveting 40 minutes I've seen on screen all year, though 'Black Swan' is never the mindf**k some have improperly labeled it. Aronofsky deliberately builds atmosphere and anticipation toward a Kubrickian climax that is at once obvious and stunning. Tchaikovsky's score falls like an aerial assault, and that inherent theatricality collides with Aronofsky's narrative as they come to a dual boil.Perhaps best of all, however, is that for all the audacity on display, the director knows when to dial it back as well. The casting of Mila Kunis ('Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' 'That 70's Show') was idyllic. She plays a comic relief of sorts, with a comely, down-to-earth veneer but viperous eyes. Her performance is fantastically calculated—she provides derisive, but much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality.'Black Swan' is a wholly effective work born from the shadowy underside of the mind, anchored by a career-defining turn by Portman. It is a quick, impulsive piece, but it explains artistic devotion and the consuming nature of obsession as well or better than any film I've ever seen. In hindsight, it feels more characteristic of the filmmaker responsible for 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' than 'The Wrestler,' though the parallels between it and 'Black Swan' run deep.They may be cut from the same cloth, but the difference between the two is as stark as black and white. Hail Aronofsky, the Swan King.",9,548,771,18 October 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Tamer Tides
","Pirates of the Caribbean debuted atop a cresting wave, but after a hat trick of subpar sequels, this rickety franchise is all but shipwrecked. The fourth installment, On Stranger Tides, cements a downward spiral of diminishing creativity with Captain Jack Sparrow's most shallow adventure yet. Gone is director Gore Verbinski, whose surrealist sensibilities were the saving grace of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. His leftfield replacement is Rob Marshall, the man behind the Academy Award-winning musical, Chicago.Action is obviously not Marshall's forte, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to have expected better choreography. Marred by shapeless large-scale skirmishes, On Stranger Tides lacks the series' signature spunk. To that effect, personality walked the plank prior to the opening titles.Granted, the characters of the Pirates universe have always been archetypes enlivened by smart performances, but even the novelty of Johnny Depp as our ne'er-do-well antihero is wearing itself thin. Likewise, Geoffrey Rush trotting out his Barbossa doesn't deliver the same impact four times over. Other familiar faces appear throughout this overlong narrative, but On Stranger Tides is better defined by its absentees and new recruits.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are the most obvious examples. Axing their dull relationship is no great loss, nor is the omission of squid-faced antagonist Davy Jones. Pity their replacements are less interesting still. An aloof Penélope Cruz might be the most boring woman on the seven seas, and her romance with Sparrow is dead in the water. Don't even get me started on the courtship of the cleric and the mermaid, which sounds like the setup to a bad joke. Deadwood's Ian McShane turns in a compelling interpretation of the legendary pirate Black Beard, but is criminally underused.Weaving a tale that involves three factions pulling anchor to find Ponce de Leon's fabled fountain of youth, On Stranger Tides plays out like the world's most expensive snail race. And the audience ain't getting any younger. No epic is as simple as point A to B, but Pirates revels in getting sidetracked. Silly business like voodoo dolls, mermaid tears, and magic compasses needlessly postpone the endgame; 'It's not the destination so much as the journey,' Sparrow quips. I'd be inclined to agree if either were any fun.Of course it wouldn't be a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without CGI sea creatures and mystical trinkets, but both serve merely to inflate the plot — it's like catching a glimpse of the director backstage gesturing 'stretch, stretch!' Or perhaps it's proof of weak characterization that the inanimate objects prove just as interesting as our heroes.With a gray-brown pallet and precious few postcards to remember it by, On Stranger Tides is inconsequential even by popcorn standards. The franchise has become increasingly inaccessible, and while this fourth installment stands better alone than At World's End, there is little incentive for viewers not yet familiar with the wily charms of Jack Sparrow to care. Accordingly, attendance for the Pirates films continues to drop, though the 90 million Marshall raked in over opening weekend is nothing to sneeze at. Word is a fifth installment is already in the works.Realistically, Pirates won't stop until Disney runs it aground or Depp says no — and like any good captain with a multi-million dollar check in hand, he's going down with the ship.",4,3,6,23 May 2011
Sucker Punch," One Born Every Minute
","If the filmography of Robert Rodriguez were projected onto the wall of Plato's cave, the fever dreams of its sorry inhabitants might come out something like this. 'Sucker Punch' is an asylum for every unoriginal impulse that strikes director Zack Snyder's attention deficient mind. It is an unmitigated disaster of storytelling—thematically diarrheic with visuals to match. This hopeless post-'Inception' melodrama isn't based on a comic book like either of Snyder's previous efforts, but every genre cliché carries over tenfold.Like a pockmarked teen with an anime fetish, Snyder's convoluted revenge flick plays out with a cast of buxom babes who look as though they might bleed mascara when cut. Stuffed into absurdly tight-fitting outfits, gals with names like Rocket, Baby Doll, and Sweet Pea unload thousands of shells from their semi-automatic rifles and leap columns of flames in when- exactly-was-this-cool-again slow motion.The tiered fantasy worlds of 'Sucker Punch' might be exciting if they corresponded in any way to the next reality over. Probably the most asinine aspect of Snyder and Steve Shibuya's screenplay (I say probably because competition is steep) is that while our protagonist is fighting a 20-foot tall sourpussed samurai or fleeing a castle from an apoplectic dragon, we are meant to believe she is really—how should I put this—doing a sexy dance. A major structural component of 'Sucker Punch' is Baby Doll's escape from incarceration, a feat that necessitates trinkets such as a map, knife, lighter, and key, all of which are obtained by distracting their male overlords with exotic dancing.For every item on the checklist, Baby Doll gyrates—though while she cuts loose, she imagines she is annihilating clockwork Nazi soldiers in the trenches of a steampunk World War II, or tearing apart an android army on a futuristic bomb-strapped bullet train. The latter is set to a cover of the Beatles' 'Tomorrow Never Knows,' in which John Lennon once sang, 'Turn off your mind' and 'Lay down all thought.' Snyder seems to have appropriated that message quite literally.The bigger problem is that Snyder throws dramatic tension out the window by creating a fantasy world where nothing is at stake. The laws of these alternate realities are unclear at best, and the sequences themselves are purely masturbatory given that whatever happens is only loosely tied to the story we're supposed to be following. I might be more forgiving of that conceit if Snyder really wowed, but 'Sucker Punch' doesn't bring a single idea to the table that hasn't been done to death in movies or video games. Snyder does so much recycling that he ought to receive special commendation from Greenpeace.It's equally hard to muster up sympathy for his characters outside of their imaginary adventures. Snyder has a bad habit of using trauma as a binding agent between them and the audience; other than that Baby Doll fell under the shadow of an evil foster-father before imprisonment, there isn't a single reason why we should care about her. She is as devoid of genuine personality as the rest of the cartoon cast.'Sucker Punch' might have been a blast if the tone was more in line with 'Scott Pilgrim' or even 'Kill Bill.' Gratuitous action can be fun—just don't ask me to take it seriously. The worst of Snyder's misconceptions is that he can simultaneously blow **** up and pull our heartstrings. That he directs schlock under the pretense of style is laid bare in this, his first original work. 'Sucker Punch' is not only brain dead, it's contagiously stupid. It's a high school sophomore's juvenile doodles on an 82 million dollar budget. If Snyder's filmography were projected on the wall of Plato's cave, I think those poor bastards would welcome the first disorienting rays of sunlight and their freedom with open arms.",3,5,12,28 March 2011
Source Code," The Two Joneses
","'Source Code' isn't even vaguely plausible. I try not to overthink sci-fi spitballing, but even the most preposterous premises should adhere to an implicit rule set. Based on a screenplay by Ben Ripley, who previously authored two direct-to-DVD 'Species' flicks, this lazy follow- up to director Duncan Jones' understated 2009 character study 'Moon' is a major disappointment.Steeped in pseudo-science, 'Source Code's' biggest fault is its failure to adequately explain the parameters of the titular alternate reality experiment. Through vague governmental computer wizardry, Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is uploaded into the body of a civilian aboard an ill-fated Chicago-bound commuter train and tasked with locating a rigged explosive and its owner. To complicate matters, he only has eight minutes until impact and it's back to start.So begins a trial and error rescue mission—not to save the train itself, but to identify the culprit and avert a looming second attack. If you're already confused, don't sweat it—Stevens is too. After every botched attempt, he finds himself back in a dank isolation room harnessed into an enormous machine with a video link to his commanding officers. As he probes them for more information on his mission, he also pries out the requisite exposition about the tech.Long story short, Source Code isn't time travel. It merely relocates Stevens' consciousness into the lingering memory trail of the recently deceased. Cool, right? The problem is that such a heady concept immediately opens itself to a thousand potential plot holes. For instance, if Stevens is reliving the terminal eight minutes of someone's life, why can he exit the train at random when the body and mind he's sharing has no frame of reference for it? How does he even know what the passengers two cars over look like?Even if you buy into the flawed logic of 'Source Code,' the filmmaking just isn't up to snuff. Jones throws subtlety to the wind for this antithetical take on the genre he seemed so passionate for two years ago. He imbues the proceedings with a nondescript glossy veneer and achieves unanimously stilted performances from his cast. Character actor Jeffrey Wright comes away looking especially bad, but Gyllenhaal is also mismanaged in the lead.It isn't their fault; Jones lacks vision and Ripley lacks talent. The latter in particular seems incapable of executing on even his better ideas interestingly. By his hand, Stevens' lame bomb-sniffing stratagem boils down to blindly badgering suspicious-looking commuters and eventually lucky guesswork. Maybe some will respond to his common sense approach, but I much prefer watching characters more clever than myself weasel their way out of trouble. For all his military training, Captain Stevens might as well have been Joe Average Passenger.A far cry from the careful construction of Duncan Jones' offbeat debut, 'Source Code' is a discouragingly impersonal film shellacked with Hollywood disinfectant. Worse, it's plain bad science fiction. It's a halfhearted amalgam of films like 'The Matrix' and 'Inception,' hold the fresh perspective. Still, I'm not ready to count Jones out. The young director had a hand in fleshing out 'Moon,' and will hopefully creatively contribute more to future projects. However, as it stands, his first two features couldn't be more at odds. Taken alone, 'Source Code' is a misfire; given that it's the sophomore effort of so promising a talent, it's a major missed opportunity.",4,56,118,1 April 2011
The Hangover," 'The Hangover'
","Todd Phillips' 'The Hangover' is a concept comedy that presumes the idea of being so drunk you can't remember the night before is inherently hilarious, and so relies on the absurdity of its constituent scenes for big laughs. It's essentially a free pass for comedic situations, and the film feels all the more disappointing because of it.You know the premise; four friends trek to Vegas for a bachelor party they'll never forget-- cue the irony. They wake up in their suite the next morning to find the room trashed, a baby in their closet, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom-to-be, missing.'The Hangover' wants to be a character comedy, but our remaining three protagonists are too transparently archetypical to ever compellingly drive the film. You have Stu (Ed Helms), the high-strung, nerdy dentist with a bitchy girlfriend you know he's gotta dump, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) the fat, weird one whose oddball antics often feel forced, and Phil (Bradley Cooper), the self-loathing elementary school teacher and leader of the pack.The film's biggest woes are in its payoffs (spoilers ahead). Phil says he hates his life, he pays for the trip to Vegas with bogus field trip money conned from his students, but it's never addressed thereafter, and when he returns to his wife and child by the film's end, he's been inexplicably changed by the experience. Stu has it out with his bitchy girlfriend, but it doesn't become the debilitating power-shift that the film or the characters deserve. Worst of all, it's clearly established in the first act that Doug's stepfather's borrowed car is to be handled with extreme care, so when the crew speeds to the wedding with the beaten heap of the car's remains, we expect a climactic explosion that never comes. It's bottom-line lazy comedy writing.But ultimately, the movie wasn't written for snobs like me. It is its premise. If the phrase 'People act dumb when they're drunk!' sounds like an anthem to you, you'll likely to enjoy the film Phillips has crafted here. Comedy is the most subjective film genre, to the point where even theater experience and conditions play a large factor in etching an opinion. The Monday, mid-afternoon crowd of twenty may not have been the best litmus test for the successfulness of the film's gags, though the audience did laugh more frequently than I did.Still, 'The Hangover' has some inexcusable story problems, clichéd protagonists, and if you'll pardon the expression, a forgettable story. Recalling some of my favorite recent comedies ('Sideways,' 'A Mighty Wind,' last year's 'Tropic Thunder'), the stories are just as successful as the jokes, and if I'm not laughing, I'm engaged. 'The Hangover' is certainly good for a few chuckles, but offers little of substance beyond that, more akin to a stand-up comedy routine than a credible piece of visual storytelling.",4,0,4,6 April 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Drivel
","Paul W.S. Anderson directs what are essentially the world's most expensive fan films. A juvenile genre-meister, he indulges likeminded audiences to the best of his meager ability. He may have better intentions than a Michael Bay, or less pretension than a Zack Snyder, but he has none of either's cinematic audacity, and that's even worse. He has grandiose ideas, but not the slightest clue how to achieve them.So instead, he swills a bland pastiche that passes from the eyes directly to the cerebral outbox. Sitting through 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' evokes an atmosphere of weightless detachment, especially from his characters, who are human beings only in the physiological sense of the term. You also feel a sort of sleepy sympathy for Anderson himself, who's trying too hard to be cool, and stretching himself beyond his means in the process.But my sympathy for the man dead-ends there; 'Afterlife' is plain bad. When you get to the fourth film in a franchise like 'Resident Evil,' inspiration has less to do with innovative story than it does untapped locations. 'Where in the World is Milla Jovovich?' more or less describes the creative process, and this week she's in a jail and on a boat along the California coastline, where she meets yet another readymade team of post-apocalyptic survivors, and uncovers yet another marginal scientific abomination from the Umbrella Corporation.I don't know. Maybe I'm biased. In the interest of full disclosure, I haven't seen either of the middle two 'Resident Evils,' but the hate-sandwich formed by parts one and four make me more than a little suspicious of what's in between. Mostly, however, I take issue with Anderson because as a fan of the video games, I know exactly what he had to work with, and exactly where he came up short: everywhere. He doesn't get it; the influence of 'Night of the Living Dead' on the games of is obvious, yet his adaptations bear more resemblance to 'The Matrix' than anything. He might as well have remade 'Silent Hill' as a musical.However, like me, the studio granted him another opportunity based on two measly characters: '3D.' In a ceaselessly underwhelming film, one of the biggest disappointments of all is how underwhelming the use of said technology is. Anderson employs it as neither an over-the-top spectacle nor for subtle immersion. The effect is merely there, underutilized and as quickly forgotten as the images themselves.And Anderson is just warming up in the disappointment department. What quickly becomes apparent in 'Afterlife' is that he's incapable of or uninterested in self-improvement. In fact, if anything, my distant memory of his original film outshines this unnecessary addition to the over-dead franchise. Each of his lame action sequences is still gaudily accentuated by the usual suspects of technical gimmickry: slow-motion acrobatics, bullet-time, and of course, plenty of emo-rock accompaniment. And that's brilliant in comparison to the clunky, ugly, lifeless expository scenes that divide them. He's a filmmaker I can't even advise to play to his strengths.Still, I have no doubt that Anderson has a genuine passion for the properties he ruins. Flourishes from the latest 'Resident Evil' video game in 'Afterlife' are proof that the writer/director is first and foremost a fan—And that's exactly his problem. Anderson is delivering disposable fan service, a hodgepodge of inarticulate regurgitation, rather than a proper adaptation. With complete disregard for the intents of the original artists, he flagrantly reappropriates their work for his own silly operas.That stuff may fly at comic con, where everybody knows you did it in your basement with a couple buddies—But when a major studio sinks sixty million dollars on it, it just seems like a waste of money and everybody's time.",4,3,9,14 September 2010
Inglourious Basterds," 'Inglourious Basterds'
","'Inglourious Basterds' is a strange brew. Watching it with the misleading marketing in mind creates a sensation akin to downing a mild beer with the expectation of hard liquor. The flavor of Quentin Tarantino's latest is disorienting but familiar, surprisingly placid but intoxicating under the right palette.The marginal intellect of the director's early work has diminished recently in favor all-out genre exploitation, and though both 'Kill Bill' films are perfectly entertaining, they're undeniably shallow. And then there's 'Death Proof,' the novelty record of Tarantino's career. So if I suggest that 'Basterds' has substance, take it with a grain of salt, we're still dissecting a Tarantino film.Fortunately, the director has taken a giant leap back, which is a rare but accurate compliment. 'Inglourious Basterds' is a film of extended, often rich and engrossing dialogue, juxtaposed with the requisite deplorable violence. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine is front man for the predominantly Jewish-American 'Basterds' squad, whose sole objective seems to be snuffing as many Nazi lives as possible.And that's where the ads leave the film, which is thankfully short of its creative goal. The truth is 'Inglourious Basterds' is about the premiere of Nazi propaganda film in a theater owned and operated by a Jewish woman whose family was executed at the hands of the Third Reich and a particularly charming 'Jew Hunter' portrayed perfectly by German actor Christoph Waltz.There's already buzz for 'Best Supporting Actor' surrounding Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, which is interesting in the context of last year's nod to the late Heath Ledger as Joker in 'The Dark Knight.' Aspiring actors: be interesting villains! Waltz's performance is probably more award-worthy than Ledger's, but both are really triumphant cinematic baddies. The atmosphere when Waltz is on screen is thick and tensely palpable. He's responsible for the best moments of the film.Still, Waltz is hardly all the film has going for it. As usual, Tarantino has crafted a genre- defying collage of ideas that clash in a hip punk sort of way. Oddball comedy follows nail- biting suspense and precedes outlandish shootouts. Yes, the world of Quentin Tarantino is derivative, unfocused, and hyper-active, but the man is a mad chemist with the precise, pre- mixed ingredients for potent, pungent fun.It really is impossible to review the film without commenting on Tarantino's greater body of work or the man himself. There are three distinct stages to Tarantino criticism, and not everyone can make it past the second. The stages are as follows:1) 'That was bad-ass awesome, bro!' Stage 1 is a surface level response to sweet, awesome violence and a kick-ass soundtrack. You're a little bit interested in film, and mentioning that 'Pulp Fiction' is your favorite movie scores you art-house cred with that hipster girl in second period you think is way hot.2) 'I've always found Tarantino's work vapid and egotistical.' With more than a basic knowledge of film, Tarantino's inspirations begin to reveal themselves, and the director appears an unimaginative fraud. His work says nothing about the human condition, enjoyed only by bottom-feeding morons.3) 'You know, I actually liked Kill Bill.' You concede that Tarantino is a director of considerable skill and questionable taste who makes exactly the films he intends to. Their purpose is purely entertainment and, love 'em or leave 'em, are appreciable for what they are.But complaints of unoriginality and tactless pandering to style over substance took a backseat among the loudest and most harsh critics of Quentin Tarantino's latest, deriding the film for its disrespectful historical inaccuracies (big, big inaccuracies to be fair). Spoiler alert, Hitler gets whacked.So yeah, that never happened, but what does it mean? Tarantino offs the dictator almost as an aside, without suggesting what that supposition means for the canon of World War II storytelling or even, really, for the world of Basterds themselves. Inasmuch, the film does feel disrespectful and worse, indulgent, but only until you approach its hypothesis of an unannounced alternative reality from an artistic standpoint.Hitler is gunned down in his balcony seat at the movie premiere. Clearly, obviously, not the end that the real man met. Quentin Tarantino makes a greater statement (in a movie about a movie, no less) about historical fiction. What's the ratio of one to the other? Surely countless films purport themselves as historical dramas, but take as many liberties as service their narrative arcs. At the end of the day it's still a movie, and Tarantino just takes it all the way.He's hardly a Da Vinci or Duchamp, but history's most memorable artists have similarly challenged the public's perception of a piece of art. That's also not to suggest 'Inglourious Basterds' is a flawless film, as it suffers from occasional pacing hiccups and irksome stylistic inconsistencies. Still, it's an important film and unquestionably Tarantino's deepest work since, conservatively, 'Jackie Brown.'His take on World War II is entirely his own, and probably won't win over many second stage Tarantino critics. Ones and threes, let's have a beer and have some fun.",8,0,1,6 April 2010
Iron Man 2," This Iron Man is Dead Weight
","I was among many surprised by the first 'Iron Man' film—Though not at the quality of its content, but rather by the hyperbolic praise it inspired.Two years later, I approached its sequel with adjusted expectations. I don't hold the original in high enough regard to register disappointment here, but this follow-up choreographs a demented dance from the collective missteps of its predecessor. The sloppy superhero storytelling that seized the reins around the midpoint of ye olde 'Iron Man One' is in full control of this galloping horse and buggy, and it's a long, stupid ride.The nucleus of the problem is that our hero's alter ego, played winningly by Robert Downey Jr., is infinitely more compelling than that guy from the title. Everything interesting about Iron Man is on the interior of the suit, and Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire, disappears inside of it.Superman, Batman, and Spiderman—the undisputed triple-A heroes—all have distinct personas once they get into character; they're more distilled versions of themselves. Maybe there's something else to be said with a man whose true identity is anything but secret, but when Stark changes wardrobe, he leaves his soul on the vanity. Not only does he look like a robot as Iron Man, but he behaves like a children's action figure with limited functionality— You know, six points of articulation, few to no action phrases, batteries not included— Screenwriter Justin Theroux appears to identify this weakness, minimizing Stark's in-suit exploits, but heaping on extraneous subplot in its place.And those are the swirling protons and neutrons in the tempest of troubles Iron Man battles between the lines. Never mind that we have a great villain and a terrific performance by Mickey Rourke, let's have Iron Man fight a slew of robots—Or, I'm sorry, 'drones.' By the way, is there a duller word in the English language than 'drone?'Then add a throwaway 'didn't know my daddy' motif; the meddling foundation of the upcoming 'Avengers' film; the egotistical self-casting of director Jon Favreau as a disposable but oddly recurrent bodyguard (who also just so happens to have a fight scene alongside Scarlett Johansson); Stark's diminishing health; and his floundering friendship with buddy Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), and you have a film pulled in more directions than it has the means to navigate.The result is an impossible staircase of sloppily intersecting ideas and characters, with plot lines too thick to funnel into a single cohesive narrative, and too underdeveloped to be independently compelling. That 'Iron Man 2' survives at all is really a miracle, and great performances where they count are largely to thank.And yet I find myself once again in the confounded minority, bewildered by the wave of support the 'Iron Man' franchise garners. When it comes to this sequel, I can count the memorable moments on one hand, and I'm pretty sure they were all in the trailer. The space between is caulked with contrivance and overstuffed with plot elements that dilute what meager strengths it has.'Iron Man 2' isn't a disappointment; it's an undercooked, overblown cautionary tale of blockbuster film-making at its most mediocre. Adjust your expectations accordingly.",5,1,3,13 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Superfans Be Easy.
","Superfans be easy. If your barometer for measuring the success of Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation begins and ends with faithfulness to the source material, by all accounts it is one. If you can swing a bit of emotional transference, all the better — I suspect few who enter without a preexisting love for Katniss and Peeta will be moved by their exploits. This $78 million companion piece to Suzanne Collins' young adult novel isn't especially concerned with converting the uninitiated; it's about cashing in on a fertile franchise. Cha-ching!For the rest of you: Katniss Everdeen is a girl from District 12. In the future, America is divided into 12 districts under a totalitarian government. Once a year, at a grim lottery known as a 'reaping,' two adolescents' names are drawn to represent each district in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games. Katniss, 16, has survived several reapings, but when her younger sister's name is called, she volunteers to fight in her stead.Directed by 55-year-old Gary Ross, The Hunger Games isn't exactly brimming with angst and youthful energy. His craftsmanship is competent, but Ross puts too much pressure on the talent to sell Collins' world and contributes too little himself. Where's the scale? The novel pops with aesthetic opportunity, but Ross isn't visionary enough to really capture our imagination. District 12 is a destitute mining community that counts starvation and black lung among the leading causes of death. Show us that. By skimping on act one atmosphere, the director undermines the comparative splendor of the bizarre and extravagant capitol city.Ross routinely sabotages the emotional potential of Collins' story and setting. The reaping in particular lacks narrative punch. Ross adequately animates the flesh of the scene, but as a storyteller he fails to find the soul. On paper, a family is splintered and an act of defiant bravery instigates a Herculean trial. Ross puts the impetus on the audience to feel the weight of that choice — artistically, he renders the scene with all the gravitas of mild indigestion.And the cast — talented though its constituents may be — often feels curiously misplaced. Kudos to Ross for casting an anti A-lister like Jennifer Lawrence as his lead, but he negates any goodwill with clunky misallocations of more famous folk. Woody Harrelson sticks out like a sore thumb as drunkard slash mentor (in that order) Haymitch Abernathy. Harrelson's half- hearted take on the character plays like a spacey stoner from a bad SNL sketch. Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz are also underwhelming as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman and stylist Cinna, respectively.It feels like an eternity before the games actually get underway, and it quickly becomes apparent (this is a criticism consistent with the novel) that any illusion of challenging the preconceptions of preteen storytelling disintegrates. Granted, there's a bloody death or two, but mostly Katniss gets by with clever alternatives to direct combat — there's something distinctly Home Alone-ian about watching her drop a hornets' nest onto her would-be assassins. For Ross' part, he frames the action just inelegantly enough to obscure any offensive violence.Ultimately, what works about Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation are the traits intrinsic to the novel. A worthy premise lends a compelling backdrop to a young adult coming-of-age sci-fi romance whatchamacallit — and Ross borrows those ideas wholesale. It's all there. His is a relatively faithful transcription of the source material, and it's a shame he does so little to distinguish his version. He fails to replicate the emotional oomph of Collins' imperfect novel, and expands upon those imperfections with lazy visuals and uneven pacing. After all, when financial success is a certainty, there's little incentive for a director to think outside the box.Naturally, my complaints will carry little weight with the Hunger Games superfans, for whom this film was expensively and exclusively realized. If you count yourself among that elite group — read no further. This is your film. Enjoy it.",6,1,8,26 March 2012
Public Enemies," 'Public Enemies'
","Dillinger biopic 'Public Enemies' is an oddly disconnecting experience, and at two and a half hours, takes ample time to say remarkably little about the man, the Dust Bowl, or action film-making. Director Michael Mann's latest is a wet pile, a structureless mass with no discernible character arc and next to no story progression. The sequences are cyclical and redundant, and the performances are too average to elevate the material beyond its inherent mediocrity.Dillinger (Johnny Depp), the depression era Robin Hood, is written and performed like a thousand better period gangsters, recalling Warren Beatty's Clyde in Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde,' but without the interesting sexual apathy. Depp's Dillinger is one-dimensionally smug, and while effectively charismatic, never convincingly human. Opposite him is antagonist Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), the agent tasked with neutralizing Dillinger in the FBI's first war on crime. Bale has again been cast in a hyper masculine role, but does nothing with it. His performance isn't 'Terminator Salvation' bad, but Purvis doesn't pop. The bottom line is the script never feels as smart as the people it's portraying.The whole film is saturated with a sense of arbitrariness that makes even the shootouts dull, despite their volume screaming to a pitch that would make Peckinpah duck and cover. The sound is consistently inconsistent, in probably the single most embarrassingly unfinished mix I've heard in a major theatrical release. You can hear the chops in the sound bites, the level of ambiance rising and falling with the dialogue, and changing altogether between angles in the same scene.One of the more controversial aspects of the film's technical design was Mann's decision to shoot using HD video in favor of film. One can infer the intention was to imbibe the period piece with a modern feel, like Tak Fujimoto's work on the HBO mini-series, 'John Adams,' but the results here are nowhere near as successful. The whites are blown out and the darks are muddy and bland, and when combined with the shaky-cam action aesthetic popularized by the 'Bourne Identity' and its sequels, 'Public Enemies' becomes an ugly, disorienting mess.Ultimately, Mann's film is tedious, indulgent, and dull. There doesn't seem to be any singular thematic intention behind the piece, and it ends up being the sort of movie where you check your watch on a bi-hourly basis. It's a definite disappointment from the director who's previously proved adept in the action genre, and any given sequence from his 1995 film 'Heat' is more memorable than 'Public Enemies' at its best.Individual moments and certain scenes work well, but they never work together, and the film is an eternal thematic plateau. At the end of the day, there's very little to say about a film that says so little itself.",4,1,2,6 April 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," The Prince's New Clothes
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' is the sort of stupidly grinning blockbuster I might find intolerable if it weren't so damn silly. Nearly every aspect is misguided, broken, corny, or all of the above, and yet when brooding melodrama is the status quo for summer releases, it's refreshing to be able to laugh my ass off at the expense of a cheeseball like this.Of course, I'm beginning to believe its many flaws were predestined; it is a video game adaptation, after all—And according to Rotten Tomatoes, the best yet. That I'm inclined to agree, despite its stagey references to the high-flying acrobatics of its virtual progenitor, speaks volumes. If there's one thing the 'Prince of Persia' film does right, it's to downplay its video gaminess by crafting a story that isn't exclusively a series of action sequences (historically, the problem with these adaptations is that they're about as engaging as watching someone else play a video game).Nevertheless, there's still that wink and nod to the source material that I can't imagine even fans care about. It's as if, in adapting a book, a director felt the need to insert page-turn animations as scene transitions to remind the audience that his characters are adapted from a different medium. I don't care what it used to be; it's a film now.Appropriately then, even more so than the somewhat-popular game series, 'Prince of Persia' draws heavy influence from Disney's other live-action flagship franchise, 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' It's painfully obvious that Jake Gyllenhaal is meant to be a charming scoundrel in the vein of Jack Sparrow, but that character and performance are a tough act to follow, especially when you're doing the same routine.Characterization is generally uninspired in the film, ranging from one-dimensional (Gemma Arterton as a feisty princess), to cliché (Sir Ben Kingsley as the Royal Council with an eye on the throne—Oops, spoiler), to the chin-scratching ridiculous (Alfred Molina as an ostrich racing bookie). It makes for a film that's often funny in spite of itself, with earnestly delivered lines like, 'You can't organize an ostrich race WITH JUST ONE OSTRICH!' and curiously long reaction shots accentuating Gyllenhaal's bizarre facial contractions.But the Prince's ultimate failure is that his film, in its transparent attempt at cinematic junk food, critically ignores its plot, which is as cavity-stricken as a decaying tooth. Granted, it may not consist of a string of forgettable action sequences, but 'Prince of Persia' is instantly forgettable regardless because it never feels substantial, and its McGuffin—That is, the 'dagger of time,' which grants its carrier the ability to undo the present and travel a finite distance into the past—Is underutilized. In its stead are scenes chock-full of verbose and expository character herding devices, which for all their impatient roving, never manage to bring our heroes anywhere interesting or visually distinct. My whole experience with 'Prince of Persia' is sort of a beige blur.Had the film been cut drastically shorter and thematically simplified, there may have been a cute little family action film here, but instead, it submits to the running time penis-measuring contest; any title under 100 minutes need not apply. 'Prince of Persia' clocks in at just under two hours, and with so little narrative cohesion, it's not hard to start picking out the extraneous chunks. What you get is a messy and dissonant sword-and-sandals wannabe epic that carries not a single distinguishing mark.Well, there is the one. 'Prince of Persia' dares to attempt fun in an age of doom and gloom gravitas, and it succeeds—Albeit at it's own expense.",4,2,4,14 June 2010
127 Hours," Harrowing, If Nothing Else
","There is a threshold for single location films at which they overcome their self-imposed limitations, and though '127 Hours' rockets past that point, I don't think it ever transcends its premise. Danny Boyle is a great director, and this is a good film, but there's no getting around the fact that its scope is as limited as the resources in Aron Ralston's backpack.An adaptation of 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place,' Ralston's true account of having his arm lodged beneath a boulder in an isolated Utah canyon, Boyle's interpretation relies perhaps a little too heavily on the built-in adjectives like 'harrowing' and 'powerful;' he doesn't seem to add many of his own. The film is certainly more successful than this year's 'Buried,' in which Ryan Reynolds spends the entirety of a film trapped inside a coffin in Iraq, but then Ryan Reynolds is no James Franco.Franco's multifaceted performance really anchors the film and keeps it from becoming stagnant. The journey of his character, from devil-may-care adventurer to anguished prisoner, is kept in constant motion even though he is physically immobile. Franco embraces not only what makes Ralston heroic, but also what makes him human, and we need that accessibility in order to participate in the film's more brutal moments.And Boyle definitely doesn't disappoint in the intensity department. More so than any filmmaker in recent memory, he commands attention with his unflinching depictions of violence here. On the off chance that some aren't yet familiar with the outcome of Ralston's story, I won't spoil it—suffice it to say '127 Hours' is not for the squeamish. I consider myself among a generation of roundly desensitized moviegoers, but the way Boyle puts the screws to his audience during key sequences is undeniably affecting. Expect to do a fair amount of squinting and inhaling through gritted teeth.I only wish the film on the whole had the same impact as those isolated scenes. Boyle cobbles together what little conventional narrative he can from the five day ordeal, but it never fully ensnares. Flashbacks seem like a given, though the brief instances of escape we witness via dream or memory aren't especially interesting until they began mingling with Ralston's increasingly distorted reality. Even still, I'd argue Boyle doesn't dig deep enough into Ralston's deteriorating mental state—merely explaining the emotional impetus for his physical actions is about as far as he goes.Part of the problem may be the visual experimentation Boyle implements in the interest of keeping things fresh. It serves that purpose fine—'127 Hours' is a lively, energetic film in spite of its subject matter. In a way, however, the triptych music video approach feels like Boyle taking the easy way out. After all, the man is a master of genres; a greater feat might have been to capture the quiet desolation and solemnity of Ralston's trip through equally inauspicious filmmaking. It would never have been as exciting a film, but it might have been a better one.Don't get me wrong, '127 Hours' is still a terrific accomplishment, and one for which Boyle and Franco deserve joint recognition. It feels like a minor entry into the esteemed director's oeuvre, but the creative decisions he made (fault them though I might) showcase his ever- innovative eye for shooting and editing. The visceral impact of the images he conveys is unquestionably the foremost strength of this film, and it is that aspect that critics have already lauded and audiences will doubtless remember.The effectiveness of such scenes earn '127 Hours' an adjective like 'harrowing.' I just can't quite bring myself to call it powerful.",7,8,23,13 October 2010
Terminator Salvation," 'Terminator Salvation'
","McG's 'Terminator Salvation' is full of paradoxes, and not just the brain bending, time traveling, series continuity kind, but also the stilted decision-making, lapses in logic, flawed design kind. The director, most well known for the two 'Charlie's Angels' films, trades estrogen for an excess in testosterone, treating the 'Terminator' franchise as an exercise in antithesis.In fact, there's only about four women in the entire movie, none of whom are particularly flattering characters. The most likable by default is Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, resistance soldier and maybe-savior John Connor's pregnant wife, as she's given almost nothing to do. Then there's Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), the face of Skynet, so she's bad. Third and worst, though through no fault of her own, is Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams, whose arbitrary and apparently passionate attraction to a half-man/half- terminator turns her against her allies. Last is Jadagrace (?) as the young Star, a shy (or mute) little girl whose sole purpose seems to be projecting a lone beacon of cute onto the wasteland of washed-out deserts and deserted, leveled cities.Okay, there may be a couple more women here and there, but they're few and far between in this future dominated by grunting, screaming men. The story begins in 2003, with death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) being offered a second chance at life through cybernetics. Though he knows he should embrace death for the crimes he's committed, he agrees to sell the good doctor his body for a price--one kiss. He's then carted off and his sentence carried out via lethal injection in a scene ripped straight from 'Dead Man Walking.'Enter the future. 2018. Wright appears naked and conveniently near a man with just what he needs. Clothed, he begins his trek toward the nearest city, where he encounters Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and the ever-adorable Star. Since Wright has the technical knowhow to fix the duo's busted radio, they intercept one of Connor's transmissions and set out to find him.Meanwhile, the resistance is testing its latest weapon, a signal that powers down any terminators within its wavelength. The higher-ups are ready to launch a coordinated strike on Skynet when Connor learns from Wright that Reese (Connor's father, long story) has been taken prisoner and is being held at one of the targeted facilities.It's no wonder Bale freaked out at that Director of Photography in the infamous leaked clip a few months back, as nearly every one of his scenes necessitates one of maybe six permutations of anger. The character of Connor lacks depth on the page, but Bale's performance is bludgeoningly one-note, and in that way, perfectly matched with Worthington; the two speak almost identically. One particular shot of them nose to nose in interrogation makes this amusingly apparent as they volley gruff monosyllabic responses and spittle-projecting barks back and forth.The film also suffers from an antagonist identity crisis. Are we rooting for Wright, as he tries to escape from Connor? Are we rooting for Connor, who testifies to the worth of every human life, only to watch the generals with whom he disagrees decimated in battle? Or is it just the infinite waves of machines?McG clearly has a vision for the future of the Terminator franchise (Army recruitment video by way of the apocalypse), but 'Salvation' is blisteringly melodramatic and above all, commits the cardinal sin of summer action films--it bores. Things explode, and if the audience can keep track of who's fighting who or why, they certainly won't care on any intimate level. It's the equivalent of a two-plus-hour fireworks show, except the fireworks are only two colors, black and bleached-white.It's obvious every moment is designed to positively drip masculine coolness, but it often comes off like the kid in school who just wants to fit in and tries a little bit too hard. The film is terrified of letting itself be mindless fun, even for a moment, and so packs on the doomsday pretension. The work may be a step toward credibility for the auspiciously named director, but as a standalone piece, 'Terminator Salvation' is an indulgent, groaningly operatic mess that chokes on its own testosterone.",3,21,41,6 April 2010
500 Days of Summer," '(500) Days of Summer'
","The trailer for Marc Webb's '500 Days of Summer' goes out of its way to define itself as especially 'not a love story,' which I guess is arguable by some gimmicky perspective technicality, and the film and its creators clearly imagine themselves pioneers in the romcom genre, but are deluding themselves if they don't admit to their playful plagiarism of half a dozen better films.It's not that 'Summer' is an entirely derivative work, but when a film is touted for its imagination, call me old-fashioned, but I'd like to see something new. The story and performances are satisfying, but its impossible to hear the staccato, high-brow, third-person narration without being reminded of Wes Anderson's 'Royal Tenenbaums,' or ignore the similarities to Michel Gondry's 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' in its non-linear examination of a crumbling relationship, or even watch the film's exuberant park dance sequence without being distracted by its striking resemblance to a number in Disney's 'Enchanted.'The film relies on a few other pet peeve clichés, like a precocious eleven year old (Chloe Moretz) who coaches her grown-up brother, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), through his rocky relationship with Summer (Zooey Deschanel), or the ending. There's unquestionably more emotional maturity on display in Webb's film than in most PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedies, but its final moments are pure formula. It's not that Tom and Summer are able to reconcile; they aren't. The trailer said as much. But the popular, ludicrously sentimental and instantly unnecessary rule in ending a romantic comedy in which the love interests don't reunite is that the protagonist needs to meet someone else by the film's end, almost always tacked onto the last five minutes. And as if that wasn't sappy enough, Tom's new girl is eye- rollingly named 'Autumn.' Come on, movie. You were talking about real people there for a minute.But as I said, the film is halfway able to overcome its foundation of clichés mostly thanks to the stellar performances of its cast. Zooey Deschanel is adorable and completely believable as the sort of siren that would drive a guy like Tom out of his mind. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is charming and funny and never comes off as pathetic as the character easily could. The supporting cast, particularly Geoffrey Arend as Tom's buddy McKenzie, is spot on.Still, 'Summer' is atonal, perhaps from inception in its intention to create both visual metaphors for the sublimity of love and the unapologetic reality of loneliness, but the two worlds never cooperate for the artistic whole, effective as they may be apart. The occasional superfluous bit of narration, precedent-setting but decidedly uncommon fantasy sequences, textbook indie quirk, and non-sequential storytelling all ultimately distract from what would otherwise be considered an acceptable but utterly average love story. And let's face it. To suggest '500 Days of Summer' isn't a love story makes for a nice piece of sloganeering, but is as gimmicky and wafer-thin as the methods Webb employs to distinguish his film from the rest of the romcom crowd. It's a sweet, human piece of storytelling undone by its faux- ingenuity. Everything that distinguishes '500 Days of Summer' has been done better before, and while it's still worth a few healthy chuckles, the young filmmakers hardly make a name for themselves beyond copycats.",6,3,4,6 April 2010
The Expendables," Epically Awful
","I'm sorry, men of the world, but 'The Expendables' is a piece of crap. In fact, as a man, I'm a little embarrassed that this putrid, structureless, diarrheic pile entertained a single one of you. Without an ounce of artistry, Sylvester Stallone has essentially created 'The Twilight Saga' for men, and just as that series caters to a lowest-common-denominator teenage girl audience, Stallone deposits this Cro-Magnon mess for males, simultaneously juvenile and out-of- touch.The suffocating machismo of it all makes it tough to pick a place to start. First, the film is hideous. On a technical level, many of the shots are out of focus, smearing the ugly greens and browns into a muddy pastiche. The rest is soiled by awful CG that completely undercuts the entire eighties aesthetic. I'm trying hard to think of something less conducive to an action throwback than a half-dozen rifles with animated laser-sights firing bullets that spill digital blood—No luck yet.Even forgiving the film its bland palette, cinematographic shortcomings, and near total lack of practical effects, 'The Expendables' misfires on the single most obvious ingredient for exciting action—Compelling set pieces. It takes place, almost in its entirety, on a small South American island where there is a dock, a palace of some sort, and apparently nothing else. Those backdrops set the stage for some dismally choreographed shootouts where, despite the exotic locale and 80 million dollar budget, 'The Expendables' maintains a consistently amateurish feel.And for a movie positively brimming with A-List (or once A-List) action personalities, how about some personality? Ultimately, it doesn't even register that Stallone assembled such a dynamic ensemble—There isn't a single distinct personage among them. Sure, Jason Statham likes knives and Stallone prefers firearms, but that's about where the definition ends. Anyone could have played these nobodies, and it reduces what should be the film's sole distinguishing feature to mere stunt casting.Regardless, there isn't a flaw I've illuminated that would hold water if the film was even fun, but 'The Expendables' is truthfully one of the most boring of the year. Call me desensitized, but I can only see so many torsos explode, so many fatal stabbings, and so many explosions before I start to yawn and check my watch. Action only works when there's something at stake, and Stallone does his best Michael Bay impression in his flagrant disregard for that simple storytelling truth.Nothing is ever at stake in 'The Expendables.' Ever. Not one of the many protagonists is placed in even momentarily convincing danger, and with almost no story to back up the dreary killing, the action loses all dramatic impact. Stallone's assembly line slaughter has neither the gravity to make us care nor the creativity to make us squirm—Unless we're squirming out of anxious impatience.I'm not an idiot. I realize 'The Expendables' is more 'Grindhouse' than it is 'Rambo,' but it fails even as a disposable homage to eighties action. It might be a class reunion of sorts, but it's the kind where you end up sitting around talking about expired memories instead of making new ones. In recalling the cheesy charm of the decade that made him famous, Stallone could stand to do far more embellishing. He succeeds in making a film with an eighties mindset, but it's a hollow, lifeless effort that completely lacks the charisma that makes those films memorable twenty-some years later.Conversely, 'The Expendables' would be forgettable no matter what unfortunate decade birthed it. And yet, here in the year 2010, this is the number one film in America two weeks running—I guess I just don't get it. Everything I go to the movies for, and not just the frivolous stuff like story and character, is completely and entirely absent here.Men of the world, if this is really what you find entertaining, then consider this my resignation.",4,12,30,24 August 2010
The Way Back," Get Back
","In an age where the bankability of an adventure film is measured in gallons of oil exploded, Peter Weir's somber trek 'The Way Back' is something of a revelation. Unlike his last film, the rousing but decidedly Hollywood nautical yarn 'Master and Commander,' Weir dials back star power and technique until all that's left is an uncommonly naturalistic interpretation of the supposedly true events that led political prisoners encamped at a Siberian gulag to walk 4,000 miles to India and their freedom.First, a complaint: I don't mean to come off as a dick, but the fact that Weir preemptively dedicates this film to those men irks me. Not only because so much doubt has been cast on the validity of the story itself, but also because conventional wisdom would be to place that placard on the last spool rather than the first. It strikes me as a little self-serving to presume respect from an audience upfront for a struggle they haven't even seen yet, or on a baser level, to disconnect them from the story before it's even begun. I realize I may be belaboring a very minor point, but as with the superfluous historical preface and dodgy title card, 'The Way Back' and I got off on the wrong foot.Thankfully, there's no arguing with Weir's visuals. From the moment he drops us into the oppressive wind-swept Siberian winter, the director creates unparalleled atmosphere. From the suffocating soot of a hellacious mineshaft to the steep sea of dunes that comprise the Mongolian desert, Weir absolutely captures the mercilessness of his environments. That characters freeze and bake to death, or are reduced to near madness by hunger, underscores the mortal gravity of their journey better than most filmmakers manage.But what really sets 'The Way Back' apart is its humanity. Where many would settle for stifling melodrama, Weir finds a way to eke out a joke. Our companions are a good-humored lot in spite of the ubiquitous peril their mission entails. It keeps them sane and keeps the movie watchable. Jim Sturgess takes the lead as an almost naively optimistic outdoorsman, followed in tow by a battle worn pragmatist (Ed Harris), and a lone wolf with a knife to match—Colin Farrell in a surprisingly funny and endearing performance. The characters are our only recourse from the barren landscape, and they provide much needed color.In spite of their contributions, 'The Way Back' is still a long film. Perhaps even purposefully overlong; the way Weir depicts the cruelly relentless terrain would lose its impact under more constrictive narrative pacing. My only gripe is that the tempo Weir employs isn't always consistent. By comparison to our stint in the Siberian wilderness, the hike over the Himalayas feels like a disappointingly anti-climactic cakewalk, especially given that it represents the final threshold into India. The looming 133-minute run time doesn't make for 100% great cinema, but what Weir attempts is admirable despite the occasional missteps.'The Way Back' represents an endangered species of storytelling, and it's no surprise that it went largely unseen in its sparse theatrical release. The film is definitely not your typical thrill-a-minute actioner, but it delivers on the ever-important human element. Weir continues to solidify his status as one of modern cinema's most unjustly unsung heroes, and his latest towers above many of its more popular contemporaries.

The Town," Action for Adults
","Simple, focused, and perpetually entertaining, Ben Affleck's 'The Town' plays like the best Michael Mann film in years. It stands apart in the summer spectrum, maybe because the MO for action in 2010 seems to so heavily favor high concept; Affleck's second directorial effort is like a breath of fresh air.But how could he hope to score the fickle fanboys' attention without the dream-spelunking of 'Inception,' the gratuitous violence of 'The Expendables,' or the retro gaming nostalgia of 'Scott Pilgrim'? For one, he sidestepped those direct competitors by releasing his film on the very last Friday of the season. Second, he instilled the film with one vital element the other three lack: heart.Sure, 'Pilgrim' is a romance, but the relationships in 'The Town' resonate on a deeper level. Affleck plays protagonist Doug MacRay, a brilliant bank robber who becomes romantically involved with one of his prior hostages against his better judgment. Claire (Rebecca Hall) recognizes neither his face (which was masked during the theft) nor his voice. The scenario makes for an inherently suspenseful courtship, playing our desire to see a 'happily ever after' against our knowledge that Doug cannot sustain his lie indefinitely.Grounded by the simple, relatable contrast of Doug's optimism for a brighter future and his dim present, 'The Town' is free to alternate between elaborate heist sequences and intimate conversations. It works because Affleck understands what so few filmmakers seem to: that something real needs to be at stake for our characters. For Doug, it's his relationship. For his buddy James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), that risk is hard jail time; the character has already served nine years.We care about these people, and it is for that reason the action sequences deliver. There may not be anything as impressive as in the final forty minutes of 'Inception,' or as many explosions as 'The Expendables' was packing, or even the creativity of 'Scott Pilgrim,' but Affleck outshines them all with straight good storytelling and classic one-upmanship.There are three heists in 'The Town,' each more elaborate than the last. Costumes play a major role in all three, ranging from cliché (skeleton masks) to bizarre (nun habits) to ingenious (Boston police uniforms). In terms of suspense, Affleck expertly paces himself. The first heist leads to Doug's involvement with Claire, whose relationship ups the stakes for a considerably messier second outing. It devolves into a citywide car chase with the police and FBI in hot pursuit. The tension is ratcheted even higher for the final heist, which takes place at a locale described as the 'Cathedral of Boston' and concludes with the largest, most visceral action scene in the movie.My gripes are few and far between. 'The Town' does feel perhaps a little longer than it needs to, and the outcome of Doug's last job and his relationship with Claire feels somewhat inauthentic by comparison to the pragmatic whole. Nevertheless, neither issue amounts to more than a minor grievance, and Affleck concludes the film on a beautiful, somber moment that emphasizes his strength as a director.'The Town' is one of the most pleasant sleeper surprises of the year. Like Anton Corbijn's 'The American,' it offers a grown-up alternative to action, a compelling cast of characters, and confident filmmaking. That Ben Affleck, who was once a punchline in comparison to his accomplished buddy Matt Damon, has emerged so triumphantly as a director in the past three years is a development few if anyone saw coming. Both his vision for this film and his performance therein are incredible, and 'The Town' is the best, most compelling action film of 2010.Whatever project Affleck takes on next, his ability to perpetually entertain isn't going to expire anytime soon.",8,2,4,26 October 2010
Shutter Island," 'Shutter Island'
","'Shutter Island' is a schlocky, second-rate screenplay--which has the incredible good fortune of being directed by Martin Scorsese.A psychological thriller wasn't really what anyone expected from the acclaimed filmmaker, and although he sometimes feels lost in the unfamiliar genre, Scorsese lends a natural authenticity to the predictable plot and an earnestness to the would-be flat characters that salvages what might have been another 'Wolfman' for something half-way memorable. And, hey, he won his Oscar. What better time to branch out?The problem with Scorsese's experiment is ultimately that it feels safe, which is half a function of an unremarkable script, and half his unfamiliarity in directing horror. He approaches the genre in the way a famous baker might prepare a steak—He goes back to the recipe. Sure, he sears some effectives sequences, with palpable suspense and unsettling visuals, but it's missing those hand-written notes in the margins that bring you back for seconds.His take on the story, while infinitely superior to, say, Joe Johnston's, still isn't quite ideal, and he seems to cling to the familiar whenever possible. He has a tendency to play up the noir element, with a fetishistic infatuation for the fifties period trench coats and fedoras that Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffolo sport, and for conversations punctuated by cigarettes, with a performance vocabulary that screams of the gangster flicks he's known for. That 'Shutter Island' so clearly bears Scorsese's fingerprints is sort of the issue: a film about an insane asylum should be anything but predictable.But the director's successes should not be undermined either, and when 'Shutter Island' works, it really works. For instance, DiCaprio as Marshall Teddy Daniels suffers from a particularly disturbing recurring flashback (compelling perhaps because it wasn't spoiled in the trailer) that features the young man as an Allied soldier liberating a Nazi concentration camp. The grotesque imagery of the war blends beautifully with the heady horror, and the cinematography is so sharp that one might wonder why Scorsese has never taken on a war film.Scorsese also achieves some masterfully atmospheric scenes on the island itself. He has a way of making the omnipresent hurricane a character, and the way the rain beats against the windows and leaks in during the night is subtly threatening, ratcheting up the intensity that he skillfully pays off in exteriors. These great moments are hardly lonely, but even the director's eerie visuals and tight pacing falter by the final third of 'Shutter Island's' overlong 138-minute running time.The film becomes so suddenly talky and expository at its end that the whole thing almost capsizes under the weight. There is a twist, and you will likely understand it long before Scorsese is finished spoon-feeding you the solutions to each presumed non sequitur and tying up absolutely every loose end.But even though Scorsese is feeling his way through the dark in directing a modern psychological horror film, watching him work is still enjoyable, and I stress that the vast majority of the problems with 'Shutter Island' on the screen are problems with 'Shutter Island' on the page. Scorsese elevates the mediocre script into an above-average thriller that, if nothing else, is better than what's playing down the hall. Whether you enter as a fan of the genre or the director, 'Shutter Island' is a palatable film. Just don't expect to be hungry for seconds.",7,3,6,6 April 2010
Tangled," Disney's Mangled
","This is what you get for not seeing 'The Princess and the Frog.' Disney eschewed its revitalization of traditional animation for this forgettable CG adaptation of Rapunzel, which goes by the nondescript nom de plume: 'Tangled.'If the recent announcement that the animation giant is placing a moratorium on fairy tale films should come as a surprise to anyone, their position on the matter is telegraphed plainly into the first five minutes of their latest and last: modern audiences won't sit for straight- faced fantasy. The name-change alone underscores the corporation's feelings on the commercial viability of a tradition it once held proud.That willful dissolution of magic is a slap in the face to 'Snow White' or 'Sleeping Beauty.' 'Tangled' begins with striking imagery, but buries it beneath a sour, smarmy voice over by this year's prince-not-so-charming, Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi). As narrator, he cracks jokes at the expense of the archetypical framework—as if he doesn't, and we shouldn't, treat the story with one modicum of seriousness. Being cavalier about your own film isn't a great way to hook your viewers.Thus 'Tangled' is a disengaging experience from the outset. It downplays its fairy tale roots, but then never defies them. It disinterests us in its world, and then asks us to spend ninety minutes there. Worse, it suffers from sloppy characterization, including one of the single weakest antagonists in Disney history. Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel to Mandy Moore's Rapunzel, and neither has a lick of personality. The irksome Flynn is practically the only other human character, with the rest of the world being populated by nameless thugs and townspeople. When so much relies on so few, you'd think more attention would be paid to making them distinct.Essentially, Repunzel's sole remarkable trait is her magic hair, a plot device that is curiously ignored throughout the film. There are plenty of early gags visualizing how she manipulates it (for instance, in order to lift her mother into the tower), but it's clearly an afterthought as her adventure is set into motion. To illustrate, the princess emerges from a stream without any indication of the added water weight. She never once has her locks stepped on, snagged, or caught in a door. I thought this movie was called 'Tangled!' Having hair that long would be a major inconvenience, people!Maybe I'm splitting hairs (ouch); I probably shouldn't have expected anything more from 'Tangled'—it's the near unanimous praise I don't understand. The songs are lousy, the characters are dull (save for one spunky chameleon), and the story merely suffices (but then it's tough to break something that's survived hundreds of years). The film is so clearly catered to a younger crowd that my curmudgeonly opinion is somewhat irrelevant, but with Pixar managing year after year to satisfy the storytelling needs of both adults and children, Disney's 'Tangled' is an immediate relic. It's a film made for twelve year olds who need to be convinced that fairy tales aren't stupid and boring.'Enchanted' and 'The Princess and the Frog' were classic Disney films despite their flaws. Their creators clearly understood what made the studio in its prime so successful. 'Tangled' is a harmless children's cartoon, but it doesn't recapture any of the magic the company is known for. Instead, it takes a snide approach to the Rapunzel story while simultaneously contributing nothing to it. I may not be the target audience, but to quote an old friend, 'If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out.'",5,14,45,1 December 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Last Time's the Charm
","The sorry state of comic book movies is laid bare in Captain America: The First Avenger. The star spangled superhero hurdles higher than many of his peers, begging the question how he ended up last in the rotation. With the cinematic landscape cluttered with Hell-sent motorcyclists and Norsemen from outer space, could it be that Marvel sought to save the best for last? Nah.The studio's lack of faith in the character is apparent in the caliber of talent they put behind the lens. Director Joe Johnston (once of The Rocketeer fame) boasts a career blemished by Jurassic Park III and the toothless 2010 Wolfman reboot. Still more disconcerting is the track record of screen writing duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, best known for Disney's disastrous Chronicles of Narnia adaptations. If I were a betting man, I'd be out a few bucks this weekend.Fortuitously, Johnston's strengths cover Markus and McFeely's weaknesses, and vice versa. The authors offer a fertile narrative, and the director plants personality. He's summoned great actors for even his weakest efforts, and the cast of Captain America shines. An earnest Chris Evans takes the lead, supported by talents like Hugo Weaving as the villainous Red Skull, Tommy Lee Jones as himself as a general, and Stanley Tucci as a mad scientist in military employ. They obviously had a blast.But the captain's greatest boon is simply having been born a century ago. Set against the backdrop of WWII, the twentieth century aesthetic goes a long way in instilling the adventure with the magic most modern superhero pictures lack. It's somehow easier to suspend our disbelief when the storytellers rustle history's hair à la Indiana Jones. And when it comes to sense of humor, the fewer opportunities for Facebook jokes the better.Yet Captain America succumbs to its own set of shortcomings. For starters, Johnston's action is inarticulate. Many of the fight scenes suffer from klutzy choreography or are stylistically gimped by passé techniques like speed ramping. Markus and McFeely share equal blame for many of these uninspired sequences, which recast the captain as a personality deficient nobody shooting his way through dim corridors.But the most glaring flaw is Captain America's irksome link to the inevitable Avengers movie. There's nothing interesting about Marvel's obligatory nods to their other franchise properties — they come off like commercial breaks. And can we get a moratorium on Stan Lee cameos? It was cute the first half-dozen times, but by now their sole purpose is to uphold tradition and to farm further nostalgia for the work of the studio's once golden boy.Marvel evidently loves taking its audience out of the experience. They'd rather have people whispering to their neighbor than glued to the screen. This is especially annoying in Captain America, because for the first time since Iron Man, the audience is being treated to an origin story worth telling. And instead of letting that story shine in its own right, Marvel literally ends it with an ad.It doesn't upend the preceding two hours, but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth. If the studio weren't so interested in franchising, Captain America might be remembered as more than a mere prequel to The Avengers — and it might very well be better. The movie has a rare lightheartedness that's absent from the rest of the Marvel's autonomous efforts, and likely will be from their blockbuster crossover.Regardless of how it ended up last in the rotation, Captain America outshines even some of the higher seed heroes — pity it got ambushed by Marvel's marketing department. The film succeeds in spite of their routinely poor creative decision-making, but a more important question lingers. Did their ploy succeed in selling me The Avengers? Nah.",Null,0,12,25 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Deathly Hollow
","Even having read every 'Harry Potter' book and seen every 'Harry Potter' film, I still hesitate to call myself a fan. It isn't that I don't enjoy the world J.K. Rowling invented or the characters she created, but rather that my enjoyment of the series has always been transient. With sometimes years between each subsequent release, my memory of the litany of events preceding them is often shaky at best, and I've never felt particularly inclined to re-visit.Inasmuch, every 'Harry Potter' has been almost an insular experience for me. I enjoyed the film series as pure Hollywood spectacle, but have always felt their independent merits were questionable at best. In that regard (taking into account I haven't seen 'The Sorcerer's Stone' since I was in high school) 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1' may be the weakest in the series. Curiously, in others ways, it's the best.I love that director David Yates pumps the breaks for this adaptation—that he actually gives the material breathing room, allowing it to be more than a feature-length amusement park ride. On a technical and artistic level, there is a lot I admire about his team's work on this penultimate adventure. But at two and a half hours, covering only half a book, there's no getting around the fact that 'Deathly Hallows' is perhaps the least exciting and inherently least complete-feeling film in the franchise.I get it, Warner Brothers. Splitting the final 'Harry Potter' into two parts was a brilliant marketing decision. It's hard to lie down and watch a cash cow die, and I'm sure many consumers will even relish the grandeur of a two-part finale. From a creative perspective, however, Rowling's 'Deathly Hallows' might be the worst book in the series to divide.The bloated first half of her novel features a few action sequences peppered in out of necessity, but Rowling's authorial stalling is what translates most clearly in this film. Painfully little transpires, rendering probably the most faithful adaptation of her work as the weakest cinematically. Of course, Potter portrayer Daniel Radcliff and co. do as admiral a job as always in breathing life into the characters and humanizing the often absurd plot developments and plethora of plot-holes a magic world entails, but nothing can save 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1' from feeling like half of a story—or more precisely, one eighth of a story.Unlike prior 'Potter' outings, 'Deathly Hallows' also over-relies on the hunting of mystical artifacts. Major story arcs and characters are ignored in favor of horcruxes—trinkets imbued with pieces of Voldemort's soul that Harry must seek and destroy before their climactic confrontation. The titular deathly hallows are then yet another collection of requisite magic items; between the hallows and the horcruxes, 'Harry Potter 7' feels like one tedious fetch- quest.That may be enough to satiate some Pottermaniacs, but even having read every book and seen every film, I'm not devoted enough to the franchise to overlook that 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a shameless cash-grab. It's a film almost inappreciable when considered on its own, and unexciting when compared to its prequels. There is no reason Rowling's last 'Harry Potter' book (which is not the longest in the series) couldn't have been concisely and effectively wrapped up in two and a half hours, and asking audiences to pay twice for one film strikes me as more than a little unfair. 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a colossal tease—crippled on its own and treading water in context, its never more than half a film. It's only fair it get half a score.",5,34,50,22 November 2010
Hugo," Half and Half
","Who's the audience for Hugo? With roots in the fantasy/adventure genres and a comfortable color palette for the Harry Potter and Twilight crowds, 'preteen' seems a safe bet. But it undergoes a metamorphosis around the midpoint that fixed my posture and put the kids to bed. Not that I'm complaining.The two halves of Hugo are at odds. In the first hour, we meet Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield – the spitting image of a prepubescent Malcolm MacDowell), an orphan and wee tinkerer living behind the walls of a Parisian train station circa 1930. He lives only to wind the clocks and scavenge parts for his prized automaton – a wrecked robot with sentimental ties to his late father (Jude Law). A chance encounter with a young girl (Chloë Moretz) may be the key to unlocking the secret of his antiquated android.In the second, Scorsese taps his inner film buff. Enter French silent filmmaker Georges Méliès, whose spectacular oddball A Trip to the Moon features prominently. Hugo posthumously honors the artist's under-appreciated oeuvre, complete with stunning recreations of his avant-garde genre flicks. The also-underrated Michael Stuhlbarg plays film historian Rene Tabard, a champion of Méliès' lost legacy.Somehow, the story of a boy and his robot and the redemption of a brilliant, misunderstood artist mesh, if reluctantly. I can't feign complete enthusiasm for Hugo's by-the-numbers fantasy beginning, but loved the playful manipulation of art history it preceded. Conversely, I imagine the general audience will go for the 'Once Upon A Time,' but neither know nor care who Méliès is. Some may walk away none the wiser to the elements of nonfiction.Unifying Hugo's disparate halves are gorgeous storybook visuals bolstered by inspired use of 3D tech. Action sequences up the gee-whiz factor, but Scorsese's most compelling use of the gimmick is also among his most subtle; touches like adding the effect to Méliès' films has the revelatory effect of making history come alive. And it doesn't carry the stink of desperation that accompanies Disney and Star Wars' conversions. As a magician who embraced every trick in the book, Méliès would have loved 3D.Another constant is the caliber of the performances. The principals are solid, and Hugo is packed with veteran character actors who breathe vibrant life into their world. Folks like Ray Winstone as Hugo's Drunken Uncle, Ben Kingsley as a shopkeeper with a secret, Christopher Lee as a kindhearted librarian, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the bumbling station inspector help even the one-dimensional roles shine.Pushing himself while pushing 70, you have to admire Scorsese's dogged tenacity. The director won his long-belated Best Director Oscar in 2007 for The Departed, which seems to have freed him from falling into an Eastwood-esque downward spiral; first with the psychological thriller Shutter Island, and now with the unabashed fantasy, Hugo. That jarring juxtaposition is just one factor in obfuscating who its audience is supposed to be.Diplomatically, the new Martin Scorsese picture aims to please everyone, but divides more than it unites. Parents may be left twiddling their thumbs during the first drama-lite hour, and kids may nod off during the second half history lesson. However, for a particular breed of cinephile, Hugo is magic – a love letter to film from a master of the medium. Scorsese's adoration is tangible – not for Georges Méliès specifically – but for artists both great and small. It's sublime. It's beautiful. But bring a pillow.",7,2,4,6 December 2011
The White Ribbon," 'The White Ribbon'
","I'm not sure anyone knew exactly how to feel when the credits rolled and 'The White Ribbon' ended. Standing outside the theater afterwards, a woman asked me for a supplementary opinion. I hesitated before replying, 'It's one you have to sit on.' She seemed disappointed, either in the film or my inelegant response, and shuffled down the sidewalk. I honestly still haven't made up my mind on Michael Haneke's latest, which leaves not on a moment of epiphany or quiet resolution but at the height of uncertainty. Perhaps appropriate, given its thematic wallpaper of suspicion and doubt, but unlike 'A Serious Man,' which made an ambiguous ending absolutely incendiary, 'The White Ribbon' is never quite satisfying in its conclusion.Still, its palpable atmosphere and methodic pacing yield countless small rewards. There's a simple craftsmanship to Christian Berger's crisp black and white photography that lends the rural setting a muted authenticity, and Haneke draws humble, earnest performances from his cast that transcend the coarseness of his plot. The film is set in Germany just before the onset of the first World War, and Haneke paints the rural village of Eichwald as a crucible for guilt and cruelty amidst a series of malicious and unresolved crimes that turn the town against itself.The film boasts an impressive recreation of 1913 Germany on an aesthetic level, but Haneke's modern sensibility sometimes spoils the illusion that 'The White Ribbon' is classic film-making. For one, his poor use of voice-over sticks out like a sore thumb. It feels pointlessly neurosurgical for him to dictate the plot to the level of transcribing what has, is, and will happen in narration, especially when his characters and images speak so strongly for themselves. Secondly, his film has an off-putting frankness exorcised by several harsh characters that are so staunchly unpleasant and 2010-era transgressive that they seem misplaced in a period drama and even now feel hyperbolic. From the widower doctor who sexually abuses his daughter to the anonymous pummeling of a retarded child, Haneke paints his Hell in broad strokes.Mostly, however, 'The White Ribbon' plays like a mix of moody whodunit and bleak parable, which unfortunately never quite add up to more than the sum of their parts. There have been better films about the suffering we inflict on one another, just one being Lars von Trier's controversial 'Antichrist,' which is certainly no more subtle, but impressed me at least with the emotional gravity it wields. The bleakness of Haneke's film feels forced and dishonest by comparison, shoehorned into every corner of Eichwald under the auspice of a greater looming threat. That Haneke never reveals the culprit of the crimes is, of course, the point, but it leaves the finished film feeling slightly unhinged.What Haneke does achieve is a gorgeous, thoughtful, and well-paced mystery that's occasionally too cold and enigmatic for its own good. He plays with powerful concepts that he never quite tames, and they make their hurried dens in the wrong places as a result. 'The White Ribbon' is absolutely uncompromising in its refusal to defer to audience expectation, even at its own expense in delivering a rounded narrative. On a technical level, its execution is all but flawless, but its content is sure to polarize those viewers who submit themselves to Haneke's bitter meditation on malice, and who probably won't know how to feel when it fades out.It's one they'll have to sit on.",7,1,5,6 April 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," 'The Men Who Stare at Goats'
","No, it's not a Coen brothers film, but it does a decent impression. The marks are clearly visible, foremost being the casting of veteran leads George Clooney and Jeff Bridges, and a plot that follows their reliable 'Joe-Local-gets-in-over-his-head' template. The film finds release just a year after the Coen's own 'Burn After Reading,' and the good news is that 'The Men Who Stare at Goats,' is just about on par with their espionage comedy, though I don't hold either in particularly high regard. Despite the misleading stylistic similarities, 'Goats' was directed by a guy called Grant Heslov, who has a far more extensive resume as an actor than a director. He appeared in Clooney's 'Leatherheads,' last year and this appears to be the mutually beneficial returned favor.Clooney brings an oomph to the film that Bridges or Kevin Spacey or even Ewan McGregor couldn't alone, and the script trades him one of the more legitimately charming performances of his career. As Lyn Cassidy, self-proclaimed 'Jedi warrior,' Clooney partners with a small town reporter (McGregor), for an undercover psychic mission on behalf of a secret branch of the U.S. Army. Their adventure is interspersed with a history of the 'First Earth Battalion,' a regiment with a freethinking spiritual approach to global conflict, based on information pulled from the supposedly real biography (also titled 'The Men Who Stare at Goats') by author Jon Ronson. Experiments allegedly include, as advertised, the power to fell goats through channeled negative energy and the ability to pass through walls. The movie is prefaced with the phrase, 'More of this is true than you would believe.'The bureaucratic satire of the snappy flashbacks makes for considerably better comedy than the majority of the present-day sequences, which often stumble in shoehorning the amusing suppositions, characters, and gags from the precursor scenes into a narrative. The issue comes to a head in a generally misguided third act, which fumbles for dramatic and comedic footing, delivering a largely disappointing finale on both counts. Still, the movie is as easygoing as the new-age hippies it depicts, and as such, stands a difficult film to dislike.Where I do take issue with it, however, is in its depiction of Jedi ability. For the most part, the effectiveness of Cassidy's powers is a punch line, though I can imagine those who believe in the telepathic potential of the mind could read him at face value, pronouncing his psychic powers truncated by a hex cast by a rival solider. These sequences are left pleasingly ambiguous with two exceptions. The first is featured in the trailer, and the second I won't spoil.Cassidy and Bob Wilton (McGregor as the surrogate Ronson), are driving across the Iraqi dessert when Wilton calls out Cassidy for a peculiar upward squinting. Cassidy explains the behavior as 'cloud dispersing,' and we cut to an effects insert from Wilton's point of view as the heavenly mass quickly dissipates. As near as I can tell, whether intentionally or not, the shot suggests that Cassidy isn't crazy and that he is legitimately paranormally gifted, which kills the quirky suspense moving forward. Others have suggested the shot represents a natural dispersion, which Cassidy merely perceives to have caused of his own volition, but the speed ramping applied to the image suggests otherwise to me. The same sequence without that single shot could easily have maintained an intriguing open-endedness.The shot could hardly be said to spoil the film, which on the whole remains a fun, occasionally engaging diversion. My pre-existing interest in the strange is certainly a handicap not all audiences will share, and the proceedings favor subtle irony to joke-a- minute yuk-fests like this Summer's aggressively unfunny, 'Hangover,' which I never really get tired of bashing. 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' is an acquired taste to be sure, and even under the right frame of mind has its share of problems, but nevertheless offers an entertaining ninety minutes with some great performances and hilarious individual scenes.If the Coen brothers are inadvertently receiving credit for this film, they needn't be embarrassed.",7,2,3,6 April 2010
No Strings Attached," Nothing Attached
","Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants, and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. 'No Strings Attached,' the first of at least three 2011 films about non-committal sex (with 'Friends with Benefits' and 'Hall Pass' in hot pursuit), is only sparsely amusing and never insightful. Big surprise. Who would have guessed that a 64-year-old director would be the wrong choice for a movie about hip people half his age? 'No Strings Attached' might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it.Everyone involved has proved themselves elsewhere. Reitman directed legendary '80s comedies 'Stripes' and 'Ghostbusters' before churning out a string of stinkers, including 'My Super Ex Girlfriend' in 2006. Stars Natalie Portman (Emma) and Ashton Kutcher (Adam) are similarly defenseless against the lousy script. For my money, Portman still put on the best performance of 2010 in 'Black Swan,' and by comparison her turn here is particularly disappointing. Kutcher is the weakest link, but has consistently proved he can hold his own in otherwise lame duck comedies like 'Valentine's Day.'But between the bad direction, worse script, and lazy performances, 'No Strings Attached' is a triple threat. Its worst blunder is that Emma and Adam's relationship is unbelievable, and their chemistry is nonexistent. Fledgling screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether posits a female lead that flip-flops her stance on monogamy every two scenes, and Portman doesn't even attempt to sell it. Emma comes off pragmatic one minute and off her rocker the next. It makes less sense still given that her relationship with Adam isn't anything special to begin with. The B- romance between Greta Gerwig and Jake M. Johnson, friends of our principle couple, is actually markedly more naturalistic and compelling. It's a shame they're on screen so infrequently.Meriwether's script is also criminally overlong. Two-hour comedies need to die a slow and painful death; there's just no reason 'No Strings Attached' should exceed the 100-minute mark. What's worse, the audience has little expectation for when the film will end. More than once, a picturesque finale will align only for Emma to inexplicably get cold feet. Or Adam's father to take ill. The bait and tease might work if the better-late-than-never conclusion defied expectation, but in all likelihood you already know exactly how it will end. The biggest surprise is how much melodramatic filler we have to wade through on the way.'No Strings Attached,' like last year's mediocre 'Love and Other Drugs' articulates the pressing need for innovation in Hollywood's romantic comedies. Depicting a relationship built on causal sex isn't especially progressive, and Ivan Reitman isn't one of the directors I'm especially interested in seeing discuss sexuality. Then again, he barely clears his throat on the subject; for a film about sex, 'No Strings Attached' is pretty much sterile despite its R rating. Intellectually, the film is a solid PG-13. Our characters generally don't behave with the nuance expected of two 30-year-olds, and Meriwether relies on decrepit genre archetypes rather than cause and effect to progress the plot.All told, Reitman's latest is unworthy of recommendation despite falling short of being an outright waste of time. It does feature a few genuinely funny moments that help excuse its crippling formula, but it never asserts itself or challenges the classic romantic comedy blueprint as much as its premise might indicate. Reitman deserves a kick in the pants every bit as much as the genre.",4,37,49,30 January 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Geek Chic
","The levels of unreality are stacked so high in 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World' that it takes a certain head-in-the-clouds mentality to see over them. Fueled by graphic novel gasoline in a vehicle straight out of 'Super Mario Kart,' director Edgar Wright's third film (following genre parodies 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz') is a roaringly imaginative, high-octane action flick that may send unrepentant adults running—While treating the rest of the audience to a Neo Tokyo monster truck rally they won't soon forget.The premise is simple; it's the lightning-paced editing that's complex. Canadian slacker Scott Pilgrim (played by an uncommonly curt Michael Cera) meets the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). However, the scaffolding to her heart is fraught with as many ladders as a game of 'Donkey Kong;' he must defeat her seven evil ex-lovers in fight sequences that run a gamut of 16-bit references, from 'Street Fighter' to 'Mortal Kombat,' or it's game over for their relationship.Yet 'Scott Pilgrim' isn't a violent movie. The titular, twitter generation twenty-something bounces back with the resiliency of a Looney Toon after each subsequent pounding. And there isn't a drop of blood in the picture—Enemies appropriately explode into a shower of coins when slain. It's a creative decision pulled straight from the pages of the comic book series by Bryan Lee O'Malley (on which the film is based), but it communicates a poisonous message for advertisers and mainstream audiences with all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign: this is a niche movie if ever there was one.The box office returns said as much; 'Scott Pilgrim' will be best appreciated by those who have played 'The Legend of Zelda' and can pick out a stray sound effect from 'Sonic the Hedgehog,' but acknowledgement of such esoteric points of reference is entirely nonessential. My instinct is that almost anyone with an open mind will be equally swept up in the white-water current of a very fun film.The action sequences are a blast. Compared more than once to Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' (in which Uma Thurman stylishly exacts vengeance on five choice acquaintances), Wright's film is just as successful at innovating action. Each of Scott's bouts is accentuated by a unique gimmick—Chris Evans plays action star and evil ex Lucas Lee, who beats up on Pilgrim with his entire stunt team in tow; the ruthless Katayanagi Twins are dispatched via sound- wave avatars during a battle of the bands; Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh) is a vegan with telekinetic powers—The diversity of these sequences, beautifully, epileptically shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, keeps the premise from ever becoming stale.Where the film does falter, at least in comparison to books, is in its inability to genuinely evoke audience empathy. Partly, this is because six graphic novels are being sandwiched into a 112-minute film. Trimming the fat, inescapably, means nipping at the arteries of the books' heart. Wright was right to emphasize the kung fu over the lovey-dovey minutia, and in less altruistic hands, 'Scott Pilgrim' might have been pitched as a six-part franchise (God help us).Ultimately, your ability to connect with 'Scott Pilgrim' lies in your ability to detach yourself from emotional expectation. 'Cute' might be the best way to describe his relationship with Ramona, and the layers of nuance developed over however many hundreds of pages in the comics is largely absent in this adaptation. Still, it's not a problem so much as it is a trade- off, and though the balance could be better, Wright improves upon O'Malley's work just as often.Know going in that it's a movie about love, not romance. Know that the experience is more sensory, less sensitive, and you'll find plenty to marvel at. A kaleidoscope of brilliant brawling with visuals like a laser light show, 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World' is resplendent with newness in an age where comic books films are a dime a dozen and all either look like 'Spider-Man' or '300.'Its wily, unfettered charm will be lost on literalists. Wright's movie is a gee-whiz-wow-bang fantasy cartoon wrapped tight in hyperbole—And as the unrepentant adults disperse, the kids will rejoice.",8,1,10,20 August 2010
District 9," 'District 9'
","'District 9' has all the subtlety of an exploding carcass. Neil Blomkamp's UFO apartheid metaphor sounds in theory like the sort of relevant, sophisticated shot in the arm the science fiction blockbuster needs, and addresses some very important issues beneath the laser shoot-outs and gooey, extrapolating body matter, but suffers from ham-fisted pretension when digging below its surface.The film has smart people behind the lens but condescendingly assumes the other side their antithesis. The characters, especially our protagonist, government operative Wilkus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), lack dimension and rationale, presented as either broad caricatures of racist idealism or doe-eyed alien innocents. The audience, however, is guessed simpler still. The movie's humans have inexplicably learned to comprehend the alien tongue (and vice versa) but we're not even trusted to follow an English conversation with South African dialect without the aid of subtitles.The movie's delusions of grandeur are its greatest flaw, and like 'Paper Heart,' the documentary elements of the film supplement a thoroughly average narrative. Blomkamp's intentions may be nobler than those of comparable popcorn flicks, but the execution is just as forgettable, its impression just as transient. And though 'District 9' was advertised heavily as a documentary, the film itself is a mixed media experiment, unmotivated camera placement and all. Conventional action is shot in a hand-held documentary style, and any insightful social commentary is relegated to the back burner when things blow up, and they frequently do.'District 9' is not without its merits, however. The visuals are (usually) impressive, with the foggy, leering mother ship subtly creeping into the edges of shots, and convincing facial detail for the prawns. The effects falter only occasionally (in a 'Star Wars: Special Edition' kind of way) in wider shots where the aliens occupy the same space as the humans or we see their narrow, multi-jointed legs: they don't quite exist on the same plane as the rest of the world.Blomkamp's direction is stronger than his pretentious writing, and individual sequences excel at creating excitement and suspense. However, the oversimplification of the underlying message and the on-the-nose symbolism make most scenes too generic to be profound, and when an investigatory mistake begins transforming Wilkus into a prawn (a derogatory term for the other-worlders), the plot becomes less a detailed examination of an intriguing supposition than a hodgepodge of schlocky action sequences and allusions to John Howard Griffin's 'Black Like Me' and David Cronenberg's 'The Fly.'Based on the director's six minute 2005 short 'Alive in Joburg,' 'District 9' ultimately gasps for identity over the nearly two hour running time. With its smattering of documentary-esquire interview footage, conventional narrative sequences, and gory action, there's not a want for material so much as there is for thematic singularity. Employing a foundation more relevant than Campbell's mono-myth is a welcome template for a modern science fiction film, but 'District 9' brings as many clichés to the table as innovations.The film is by no means a poor way to spend a few hours at the multiplex, but is hardly the poignant masterpiece others have hailed it as.",6,2,4,6 April 2010
Bridesmaids," Brides and Banana Peels
","It's clear 'Bridesmaids' got greenlit as ''The Hangover' for chicks,' but to condemn it as such would be a disservice. The latest Judd Apatow Family Production is a savvy, character-driven comedy worthy of commendation in its own right. SNL's Kristen Wiig stars, having co-wrote the screenplay with actress Annie Mumolo. In a culture with great reverence for the pomp and circumstance of marriage, the pair dispenses a generous allocation of banana peels along the length of the aisle.It may not make for the most intellectual humor, but 'Bridesmaids' thrives on broad comedy by way of endearing characters and vibrant performances. Wiig plays Annie, the broke proprietor of a failed bakery whose best friend (Maya Rudolph) is engaged. Named maid of honor at the upcoming wedding, Annie is soon overwhelmed with all the inherited responsibility. She spars with bitchy perfectionist Helen (Rose Byrne) over bridal shower themes, bachelorette party locales, and naturally, bridesmaid dresses.Though the cast is rounded out by Wendi McLendon-Covey of 'Reno 911' fame and Ellie Kemper from the American 'Office,' the real standout is 'Gilmore Girls'' Melissa McCarthy as Megan, the 180-degree antithesis of class. Heavyset, hilarious, and not the least bit demure, she easily walks away with the movie. Whether she's accusing a seatmate of being an air marshal incognito, or bent over a sink in a compromising situation, the funniest moments in 'Bridesmaids' are almost exclusively hers.Not that 'Bridesmaids' has any shortage of funny moments. Some scenarios work better than others however, and at two plus hours, it's hard not to notice where it could use a trim. For all the positives Apatow doubtless brings to the production, he is a poor role model when it comes to maintaining an appropriate run time. Director Paul Feig is more directly to blame for not axing the most superfluous and least funny bits; Annie's portly English roommates spring to mind as characters whose absence might make the film leaner in more ways than one.The lack of focus keeps 'Bridesmaids' from achieving real staying power. Subplots like Annie's relationship with an Irish cop (Chris O'Dowd) — amusing though they may be —consume too great a slice of our time, and dilute what makes the simple premise so strong. Feig and Wiig are firing on all cylinders during the ensemble scenes, and I'm confident a better 90-minute cut exists somewhere in the folds of this wedding comedy, which has as many frills and puffs as even the gaudiest bride to be.'Bridesmaids' may not be one to have and to hold until death do you part, but it's still a saucy affair. Wiig plays a lovable loser and surrounds herself with some seriously funny ladies. Their performances alone carry most scenes. Coupled with a refreshing refusal to cater exclusively to the sense of humor of teenage boys, the film suffers only in setting itself too high a standard and failing to continually exceed it.Though the output is sadly less than the sum of its parts, there is enough great, boisterous energy on hand to make 'Bridesmaids' worth checking out, gender regardless. It's leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to personality, and its savvy, character-driven comedy could actually teach a thing of two to those clowns behind the ''Bridesmaids' for bros.'",6,2,5,17 May 2011
Drive," Intelligent Adrenaline
","After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality – humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality – is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.",Null,472,749,16 September 2011
Insidious," Spiders Among Spider Rings
","Hollywood horror films draw from a grab bag of assorted Halloween party favors, but amidst all the cheap plastic spider rings, director James Wan inserts a tarantula or two for good measure. His latest, 'Insidious,' takes a see-what-sticks approach that can sometimes be as frustrating as it is refreshing, but in a cinematic climate where scary movies are becoming an increasingly on-rails experience, every goose bump is worth its weight in gold (and I imagine it adds up).'Insidious' has plenty of genuinely chilling moments, and makes better than average use of the oft maligned 'jump scare.' The technique doesn't always deliver the desired impact, but that such instances are uneven in effectiveness is in a way an incredible asset. Emotionally, we're on our toes. Wan puts convention in a blender and the audience is often left reeling from the topsy-turvy inertia. That familiar horror guardrail is gone and we're left groping in the dark.Taking a page from Sam Raimi (not to mention title work more than a little reminiscent of his 2009 flick 'Drag Me to Hell'), Wan keeps us off-balance with unpredictable emotionality. Not every bizzaro changeup he pitches lands squarely in the strike zone—a bumbling pair of paranormal investigators falls flat on the comedy front—but by constantly upsetting our expectations, 'Insidious' picks a cerebral scab and burrows under our skin. A particularly inspired and disorienting soundtrack choice is the use of Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips,' proving perhaps definitively that nothing is more terrifying than a ukulele.Little unconventional details help too, and with credit to 'Saw' screen writing veteran Leigh Whannell, 'Insidious' makes some subtly interesting choices. For once, our parental protagonists, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne), are not the progenitors of an only child. Creepy kids are a genre staple, but by diffusing that cliché with siblings, Whannell opens himself to some less-traveled roads. Unfortunately, one of his most glaring oversights is underplaying that idea; in the inferior second half of the film, the other offspring essentially disappear.Or take, for instance, the critic's ace-in-the-hole: 'Why don't they just leave the house?' Like in 'Paranormal Activity,' Whannell explicitly explains that the demonic presence is attached to his characters rather than their homestead, but they hightail it out of there all the same. I can't immediately recall another example of haunted protagonists rationally raising stakes in the middle of the second act.It may seem insignificant, but it makes a big difference in a genre as delicate as horror, where the element of surprise is everything. If 'Insidious' were comprised entirely of offbeat innovations, it would be a perfect film. But just as often, Whannell lets convention get the better of him, or he piles on too many sub-genres—what starts off in 'Poltergeist' country winds up closer to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' if you can imagine that. The disparate elements clash and complement each other in equal measure.Spearheaded by Wan and Whannell, the 'Saw' franchise pushed horror in a new direction. 'Insidious' nudges it back. Inspired by classic seventies spook-outs, the filmmakers crafted what feels like Hollywood's most synonymous effort in years, imperfect though it may be. There are no hidden camera gimmicks, and absent is the also oft maligned 'torture porn' the pair popularized eight years prior. Instead, expect to be treated to the unexpected. True, the beats and 'Boos!' are familiar as can be, but when 'Insidious' jumps the rails, it's one hell of a ride.",6,2,7,6 April 2011
2012," '2012'
","Roland Emmerich gets his rocks off blowing up the world. Hey, whatever sinks your battleship. It's like the Tarantino foot fetish thing, you just have to shake your head and go, 'the guy likes feet.' But if destruction is Emmerich's erotica, then '2012' is a perverse shrine; it's disaster porn, a sweaty menage a trois of 'Dante's Peak,' 'Titanic,' and 'Independence Day.' '2012' distinguishes itself from those films only in its unabashed one-upmanship: bigger, louder, and more marginalized story.The marketing admittedly piqued my interest, I think because it seemed so simultaneously silly and audacious. Highway billboards and movie theater stand-ups depicted iconic human art and architecture being pathetically splintered, smashed, or washed away. I imagined the lunacy of the digital disaster film coupled with an absurdist futility. I wanted '2012' to be genre satire, an unrelenting gleeful cataclysm without redemption. In retrospect, it was not wise to expect these things from Emmerich.If anything, '2012' is torturously formulaic, layering state of the art special effects over the writer/director's decade-old story template. A renegade scientist discovers an inevitable global catastrophe, meets our always-noble president, and clashes with an evil cabinet member--it turns out 2012 is a whole lot like 1996. But perhaps most disappointingly, by any action movie standard, Emmerich breaks a cardinal rule: he never tops his first act. The five-plus minute sequence that arrives roughly forty minutes into the film involves John Cusack and company speeding through a crumbling Los Angeles cityscape by limousine and airplane while earthquakes topple skyscrapers and split the streets, swallowing countless fleeing innocents. It would have made a fantastically over-the-top finale, but Emmerich isn't content to simply shake things up when he could drown or pelt them with fiery balls of magma.The majority of the disposable plot actually revolves around the struggle to reserve space on one of several 'arks' being built in China to house the lucky few chosen to repopulate the dying planet. The general public is never informed of their existence, but attention rich and famous: tickets can be purchased for just a few million Euro! The third act of '2012' then takes to the open water and devolves into everything I didn't want it to be, namely a countdown-clock movie in which the resilience of human ingenuity and spirit ultimately triumph over avers--I'm sorry, I dozed off there for a second. Millions of people die in this film, so forgive me if John Cusack and his fickle ex-wife, son, and hat-loving daughter's survival aboard a ship loaded with billionaires and bureaucrats charting a course for the inexplicably unflooded African continent to, I'm sure, politely explain the concept of manifest destiny to any weary native survivors, fails to move me. Emmerich's ending is worse than cliché, it's insultingly euphemistic, backwards, and schmaltzy.Actually, the more I think about it, the more apt that porn metaphor becomes. It's not difficult to tell which scenes exist solely to progress the plot, and which scenes set the stage for ludicrous action set pieces. Seeing a hanger full of Russian concept cars is like opening a scene in a porno with two girls on a couch. Come on. The film's primary function, as with feature length pornography, also makes the running time completely unnecessary. You know why you're watching.As pure spectacle, '2012' occasionally succeeds, with some well-choreographed action sequences that straddle the fine line of utter ridiculousness and competently address their directive to entertain. The plot, however, is at best derivative and at worst short-sighted and masturbatory.Can't wait for the sequel, Roland Emmerich's 'Seamen.'",4,1,3,6 April 2010
Kick-Ass," 'Kick-Ass'
","The ultraviolent, postmodern 'Kick-Ass' is at the forefront of the comic book movie scene at a volatile turning point. The '00s were defined in no small part by Hollywood's Spidermen, Batmen, and X-Men, and until 'Avatar' rolled around, they were the box office champions smashing records every year. Now Raimi's 'Spiderman' has fizzled out and is being rejiggered by Sony, the 'X-Men' franchise has devolved into schlock, and 'Batman,' while healthy, represents the superhero sub-genre at its most pointedly operatic.'Kick-Ass' takes a fresh approach, smartly deconstructing comic book ideology in a meta- comedy that satirizes convention while simultaneously drawing from it. As a movie based on a comic book about comic book geeks, there's a degree of self-conscious irony to watching a fake superhero narrative snowball into a real one. It pokes fun at the melodrama of origin stories even as it unfurls its own. 'Kick-Ass' follows protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who's as big a dweeb as Spiderman's alter ego Peter Parker, but without the chip on his shoulder and radioactive spider bite. Lizewski is roundly average, and ultimately more believable than Parker; his superhero dress rehearsal doesn't end victorious in an underground fighting ring—It ends in an ambulance after being knifed in a parking lot. Undeterred, Lizewski tackles pet rescue and petty theft until a passerby records one of his more marginally successful street brawls on a cell phone camera, and his alias, 'Kick-Ass' becomes an overnight YouTube celebrity. His sudden prominence heralds dozens of copycat heroes, but even the progenitor finds himself outmatched by the likes of 'Big Daddy' (Nick Cage), and his deadly 12-year-old daughter, 'Hit-Girl' (Chloe Moretz), a character that truly tests the audience as accessories to vigilante justice. There's already controversy brewing, though personally, I find it a little hard to buy into the offense. The exponential brutality of the violence perpetrated not only against Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl later in the film, but more importantly by them, is appalling on some level, sure. But it's taken to an extent that's pure slapstick. At heart, 'Kick-Ass' is gory, bloody comedy. But a comedy nonetheless. Maybe it's all the more troubling that Hit-Girl's casual propensity for murder is played for laughs, but I think we laugh at Hit-Girl for the same reason we laugh at Bugs Bunny, even when he's got a shotgun in Elmer Fudd's mouth: it's classic comedic role reversal. Who doesn't want to see the wabbit humiliate the hunter? If anything, 'Looney Tunes' is less responsible in its depiction of violence because there's no consequence of the shotgun blast. Hit-Girl's action sequences are deliriously destructive, unbelievably graphic, and a hell of a lot of fun. And that's really what I love most about 'Kick-Ass.' Even (or especially) in the face of violence, it doesn't take itself seriously, nor would I argue it directly purports its characters as heroes in the traditional sense. No one seems especially concerned that they're held up as role models, and what's endearing, hilarious, and horrifying about their behavior shines through because of it.This is ballsy commercial film-making, which is likely why seven studios passed on the script last year. It takes risks that may alienate some in the mainstream, and its success has already been capped somewhat by the hard R rating, but I don't think 'Kick-Ass' is the sort of film that will go out without a fight. If not a huge hit like the PG-13 Spidermen and Batmen of years past, it's got real cult appeal, and because it's uncompromising in its premise—Even to a fault in the uneven gradient from reality to comic book reality, 'Kick-Ass' is the sort of film with staying power. And if this is where we're headed, count me in.",8,4,14,13 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," 'The Hurt Locker'
","'War is a drug.' So reads the quotation by American journalist Chris Hedges that precedes Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker.' The film has a clear thesis, but offers little of substance to extrapolate or back it up. The movie is remarkably effective on the gut level of provoking an emotional response, but relies on a few disappointing action clichés that prevent it from truly being the masterpiece others have been so quick to hail it as.The aforementioned quote refers to the bomb-diffusing, adrenaline-addled protagonist of the film, Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who deals so intimately with death in his day job, that everything else starts to feel a little bit dull by comparison. Or at least that's the idea. In execution, James comes off more as your prototypical action hero than the fascinating subject of a character study. He behaves like every other Bourne/Bond/Bay superman to grace the screen in recent memory, and the film declines to comment on this condition until the last thirty minutes or so, making what should be the core of the piece feel more like an afterthought.The pacing is unhelpful as well, broken up as the story is into isolated encounters that neither build in the traditional narrative sense nor offer more than a diverting peripheral glimpse into the lives of the characters. The sequences are so arbitrarily episodic that their order could seemingly be shuffled with little to no detriment to the comprehensibility of the story arc. Ostensibly, 'The Hurt Locker' is a film with a clearly defined beginning and end and enough style to keep what's in between from feeling stagnant.Sure, the bomb diffusion sequences are great. Through the use of ambient sound effects and hand-held camera work (a testament to its correct usage) with an almost Hitchcockian suspense-building prowess, Bigelow is able to masterfully pluck the audience's heartstrings like so many delicate red wires. It's a shame these refreshing, interesting, entertaining pieces of the film are undercut by its vacuous, nearly non-existent story.And though I'll champion the style in a general sense, the film's pleasing documentary aesthetic is blatantly violated in two auspicious moments, and as far as I can remember, only two. One is a Matrix-esquire dancing bullet shell that meets the sand in super-slow motion, and the other, a bomb exploding at an equally fast shutter-speed from multiple angles, letting the audience pause to consider the visual significance of watching the paint peel from the skeleton of a car or a dust cloud rippling in the blast. The moments are pure Hollywood and feel completely removed from the intention of the rest of the film.Perhaps the most profound moment comes toward the end, when James is confronted with the one, and really only, consequence of his actions, leading to the serious injury of a squad member. However, the implications are decidedly secondary to the film's conclusion, which has all the subtlety and self-aware military chic of an Army recruitment spot, which sabotages James' only meaningful character change and will likely send you out of the theater with a razz between your lips.So ignore the hype and the nonsensical title. If you approach 'Hurt Locker' looking for a little summer fun, the ingredients are assuredly there. Just don't let the art house fool you into thinking Kathryn Bigelow's latest offers much more than a few cheap thrills.If war is a drug, 'The Hurt Locker' is a placebo.",6,3,7,6 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon'
","It really freaked me out when I first realized celebrities were getting younger than me. Two weeks out from twenty-three, I'm already starting to feel like an old fart. And so, in the interest of open-mindedly embracing my juniors' most recent box office obsession, or at least in an attempt to distance myself from those who've congested the internet with second- hand cynicism, I offered the Twilight Saga two hours of my time. Now, I've never read any of Stephanie Meyers' novels, and I haven't seen the first film, so my litmus test may be flawed from inception, but I gleaned enough from 'New Moon' to not only catch up with its angsty supernatural love triangle, but also to deem it dead on arrival.Chief among its misconceptions, 'New Moon' is packaged as a blockbuster but deals heavily in the abstract. The heart of the film is loss and the desired effect should be a visual provocation of melancholy, but the story is often too silly (werewolfs) or too melodramatically pretentious (vampires) to earn the incessant pouting or self-pity of its egotistical protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). The film attempts her brain surgery with boxing gloves.This second installment in the series also presumes its audience is already deeply invested in Bella's relationship with the 109 year-old vampire, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), but as a stand-alone film, we're given nothing that suggests the legitimate profundity of their connection except for the sweet, clichéd nothings they whisper to each other, one- dimensionally enamored in such a way as to suggest that the feelings they share are much too vague to be accurately filed, 'love.' If anything, their relationship seems only to reinforce the high school stereotype of overeager hormones as a surrogate for genuine affection. And as for Bella's centennial significant other, what does her grating persona offer that eleven decades of other women hasn't? Furthermore, where does this relationship fall in regards to pedophilia?The film is further cheapened by its abbreviated visual shorthand for male attractiveness. Falling cleanly in step with the grand tradition of sexualizing women in boy's comic book films, The hunks of 'New Moon' (which would make a great 2010 wall calendar), add little more than perfectly parted hair and bare, toned abdomens to the proceedings. Exhibit A: one Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), teenage grease monkey, wolfman, and all-around studmuffin, with whom Bella seeks solace after being left by Edward. The movie plays itself as a reconciliation piece for the majority of the achingly insubstantial second act, with Bella learning to cope with heartbreak and carry on. Her maturation is completely undercut, however, in that she won't allow herself to view Jacob as a replacement for Edward, and in a narrow elusion of Shakespearian tragedy at the end (call it Romeo and Juliet and Dracula and the Wolfman), is happily reunited with him. The excessive, plodding character development is rendered entirely ineffectual because everyone ends up precisely where they began.--With one exception, which makes for perhaps the most ludicrously unnecessary cliffhanger in the history of franchise film-making. Bella wants in on the vampire scene, which like everything, Edward is moodily adverse to. In the final moments of the film, he agrees to grant her wish on one condition--her hand in marriage. Bella gasps, credits roll. I mean, shouldn't that go without saying? What else would this dunce call a life of eternal commitment? She'll swear her undying love and accept the curse of perpetual life, but has never considered the 'M' word? Are you kidding me?'New Moon' is a film that will be enjoyed almost exclusively by fans that are either too familiar or too enamored with the source material to judge it objectively. The premise seems to have potential as a bleak independent film, but these characters are marginalized to the point of virtual nonexistence. The emotional core of the film, its relationships, are unconvincing, and as pure spectacle, the action is unexciting. The themes have been more eloquently expressed in a thousand better films, and the visual effects have been surpassed by nearly every other major blockbuster this year. In short, 'New Moon' is a corporate impression of art that rings hollow with each simulated emotion. It exists solely to sell a label.So call me an old fart or take this review as further proof that you don't need to know the series to hate it, I can't disagree. Like an actual new moon, there's really nothing to see.",2,5,8,6 April 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'
","'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is hardly what I expected from the highest grossing Swedish film of all time. Maybe it's the graphic rape, I don't know—I was expecting something more commercial. The good news is that in such moments, 'Dragon Tattoo' is disquietingly powerful. The bad news is that they lie few and far between an otherwise mediocre mystery. Swedish actress Noomi Repace plays the eponymous lead, Lisbeth Salander, and brims with a badassery on par with Franka Potente of 'Run Lola Run.' She's terrific, but let me say this up front—The character and her performance are better than the film (or at least its second half) deserves.The first seventy-five minutes impressively juggle gritty, squeamish scenes of Lisbeth's abuse at the hands of her slimy probate and her subsequent revenge, with a straightforward, slow-paced thriller involving Mikeal Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a journalist convicted of libel, being privately hired to shed light on a long cold family kidnapping case. The two threads are remarkably dissimilar in theme and style, and it's a peanut butter and jelly situation for the film; they complement each other ideally, preventing the other from becoming tiresome.But as should be expected from a story with simultaneously unraveling plot lines, we soon reach their intersection, and although it's a matter of personal preference, for me 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' flounders once its characters coalesce. For starters, Lisbeth's infinitely more interesting arc (and consequently, its stylish flourish) is swallowed by Mikeal's when she becomes his investigatory partner midway through the film. The 'straightforward, slow-paced thriller' takes hold, with the odd addition of a buddy cop dynamic. Generations collide! Lisbeth understands computers and Mikeal has antiquated taste in music!It's a weird turn, and one I don't think 'Dragon Tattoo' really recovers from. The character of Lisbeth is far and away its highlight, and if anything, as the film progresses, her role becomes increasingly marginalized. She loses the snap and snarl that she has independently as she and Mikeal inevitably get intimate, and maybe for some, watching the two change each other as the case comes into focus will be the emotional apex, but I found it a disappointing detour. Lisbeth's act of unflinching vengeance early in the film is neither topped nor matched—She becomes more boring in Mikeal's presence.Maybe it's that a relationship in general doesn't feel convincing for so scarred a character. Certainly this is the implication of Lisbeth's interest in sex above intimacy, but it feels like a requisite development dictated by genre expectation rather than an organic attraction between the two characters. That she uses sexuality as a vehicle for self-empowerment is an interesting angle, but then I don't buy the legitimate affection later on. Lisbeth has a photographic memory and is haunted by her past—She isn't the sort of person whom I believe has a dormant tenderness.'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is long, and by the end of the engagement, I felt exactly what the dual story lines prevented me from feeling: tired. The wrinkles in the mystery aren't especially surprising, and the plot is stretched to the point that I'm almost inclined to forget what I found initially so compelling about the characters because where it takes them is so much less so. Lisbeth is fiercely independent, and watching her emasculate her pervert probate has a gratifying brutality that seeing her play second fiddle in a PI procedural couldn't hope to.My mixed feelings about the film make it difficult to consolidate a final score, so I'll leave it here: 'Dragon Tattoo' is a film I half-liked.",5,10,18,6 April 2010
Clash of the Titans," 'Clash of the Titans' (2010)
","'Clash of the Titans' is an unusual film to remake for a modern audience. I mean, how familiar is Joe Moviegoer with the 1981 original or Greek mythology on the whole? The answer is 'Not very,' and the producers know it. They've taken broad steps to protect poor Joe from the alienating Grecian polytheism and comfort him with an immediately recognizable protagonist. To the layman, and in effect, for the layman, they've dumbed it down.Sam Worthington is Perseus, which I guess is a big deal now that he's the star of the highest-grossing film of all time. And when you hire Sam Worthington, you get Sam Worthington. The '81 Perseus is aloof, oddly lackadaisical, with shoulder-length hair and a caring, inquisitive disposition. Worthington's Perseus is a buzzcut graduate of the Christian Bale/Batman school of acting. His dialogue is gruff, brief, and introverted, because coolness now is apparently inversely proportional to vocabulary and elocution. It speaks to a certain extent about the types of characters we hold up as heroes in our current social climate, but more so, it's a simple example of commercial viability over storytelling practicality. Worthington as Perseus is a carefully calculated business move, and the streamlining of his character is indicative of director Louis Leterrier's greater neutering of the myth for 13-year- old boys. After all, if there's one thing less cool than masculine eloquence, it's ancient culture.Damn the gods indeed. 2010's 'Titans' retells Perseus' story through a decidedly Christian lens. Mount Olympus has been downsized, and Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) essentially become surrogates for God and the devil. Most of the roles fulfilled by other gods in the original film have been reassigned to these two to keep things simple, which would be fine if they were interesting characters. Instead, a hunchbacked Fiennes rasps ominously at his brother, and Neeson sucks all ambiguity out of the king of the gods. It's worth noting that the original is far from a masterpiece, but the insecurities and petty vengeances of Zeus and his kin are among the more entertaining ideas it puts forth. The remake drops most of these characters and fits Zeus with a stoic (re: boring) gravitas, and a ridiculous set of digitally glistening armor.And I can complain until I'm blue in the face about the intellectual inadequacies of 'Clash of the Titans,' but it's surface level mistakes like bad costumes and poor action choreography that really kills the film. The '81 version is defined by its special effects and set-pieces, and the best we can do in 2010 is CG monsters and post-production 3D? The remake is everything an effects-heavy film shouldn't be: sweeping and grandiose at the expense of intimacy. I don't care how many scorpions you render or how big you've made the Kraken when I don't even understand the decisions your protagonist is making.But it's not like the remake ruins a classic or anything. The original has its share of problems, and one of the things the 2010 film does right is to kick the pacing in the pants where it needs to, leaving fewer sedentary dry spells than its predecessor. Regardless, I still hold the '81 version in higher regard because of its faithfulness in depicting the pantheon of the Grecian gods, and the charm and personality of its effects. The mythology is all 'Clash of the Titans' circa 2010 has to distinguish itself by, and it downplays that difference instead of embracing it. Splash bland action and unimpressive effects on that cinematic identity crisis, and even Joe Moviegoer will agree you've failed.",4,3,4,6 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," 'Paranormal Activity'
","'Paranormal Activity' presents an unsettling and uncompromising reality. Without the context of a hype-fueled theatrical release or reviews like this, a believer in the supernatural could easily perceive the found-footage aesthetic as honest documentary. After all, it was made for only eleven thousand dollars, features one location, and a principal cast of two. The print that ran at the Bridge for last weekend's midnight screening was even bereft of credits. Nothing betrays the internal logic of the film, which is pretty cool in a decade of increasingly glib, grandstanding splatter flicks usurping the once-credible horror name.Comparisons will inevitably be drawn to 'The Blair Witch Project,' or indirectly, 'Cannibal Holocaust,' which are suddenly hot commodities in genre film-making. Among the most successful viral marketing campaigns of the last few years are those for 'Cloverfield,' and 'District 9,' both of which experiment with docu-narrative hybrids, and have, along with the recent DVD release of Spanish zombie film, 'REC' (and its North American remake, 'Quarantine'), paved the way for 'Paranormal Activity,' which distributor Paramount has apparently been sitting on since 2007, to finally see the light of day, figuratively speaking.But 'Paranormal Activity' deserves to be seen on its own merit, and it delivers because first- time director Oren Peli has an intricate understanding of his audience. He establishes an intimately suspenseful atmosphere for his gradual exhibition of the paranormal, but anticipates the inherent silliness of the ghost story as well. The protagonists are live-in girlfriend/boyfriend Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), the former of whom has had recurring encounters with the otherworldly, and the latter representing the audience as a giggly, playful skeptic. It's Micah's idea to purchase a camera and document the ghostly goings-on (along with some not-so-noble, good-humored alternatives for the bedroom- mounted recording device), and it goes a long way in creating a convincing scenario for the audience.Watching the couple sleep has a voyeuristic creepiness in and of itself, but the repeated use of a single brilliant angle, almost like CCTV footage, which places the camera over the foot of their bed, with a clear view through the open door into the shadowy hallway, with a digital time readout ticking away into the small hours of the morning, and with the occurrence of exponentially spookier incidents, viewers' eyes are left darting to every dark corner of the frame in taut anticipation.I don't intend to part with any hard details about the film, as even its trailer can't help but give away a little too much of what is best experienced with a clean palate. The precognition of certain scenes may unwittingly trigger a subconscious calculation of the structure by what has and has yet come to pass, and that sort of spoils it. As for the conclusion, it suffices to say Peli saves his most genuinely frightening moment for last, and again, the more surprises you leave for yourself, the better.Despite the excessive praise the film has received from the press and bloggers, insofar myself included, there are two minor issues that keep 'Paranormal Activity' from receiving the fullest extent of my recommendation. First, the film is too long, with tension-killing exposition of relationship minutia that admittedly prevents the scares from growing stale, but wears out its welcome early on. The second is the occasionally questionable performance of Featherston. Neither issue has any serious adverse effect on film's accomplishments, but deserve mention nonetheless.Ultimately, 'Paranormal Activity' is a film that lives up to the hype as long as you don't buy into all the hype. It's a genuinely creepy, crawly little film that will likely disarm you if you're not bracing yourself for it. It's a terrific haunted house spook-out that will probably see wide release in time for Halloween. If not terrifying, 'Paranormal Activity' settles for shivery fun that'll give you goose bumps. And that's something I haven't gotten from a film in far too long.",8,1,2,6 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Ministry of Silly Hats
","'The Adjustment Bureau' is preposterous, and before you counter with 'Well, duh, it's science fiction,' allow me to elaborate. I'm down with the premise that mankind is safeguarded by an invisible shadow organization that dictates the paths we follow and the decisions we make— what baffles me is that they achieve these means through (spoiler alert?) magic hats. I wish I were joking. The single biggest misstep in this bungled Philip K. Dick adaptation is that the mystique of our antagonists is dispelled almost instantaneously. We get to know our aggressors who, as it turns out, are anything but aggressive. To compare genres, there's never been a great thriller where the detective in pursuit of a killer is 'just doing their job.' Passion breeds compelling cinema, and the paper pushers at the heart of 'The Adjustment Bureau' are supremely uninteresting.And despite the fact that they are explicitly 'not human,' a very human error sets the plot in motion. An Adjustment Bureau agent oversleeps (these guys sleep?), thus congressman and senate hopeful David Norris (Matt Damon) catches an early bus, bumping into a familiar comely Englishwoman (Emily Blunt) whom he was never supposed to see again. The film's saving grace is the pair's believable rapport, but after the forces that be repeatedly pull them apart, with sometimes years lapsing between meetings, it gets harder and harder to believe either is still carrying the other's torch.Then you get into the contradictions and lapses in logic so heady a concept lends itself to. The law that governs the Adjustment Bureau is foggy at best, and though they evidently think nothing of freezing time to manually alter the opinion of Norris' political adviser, they seem incapable of preventing the divergences Norris himself so frequently propagates. Why not squelch Norris' irksome infatuation through similar tactics? Elsewhere, the Bureau threatens him with a memory wipe, but repeatedly chooses to reason with him rather than to take more effective action. For as much as they make of their supposedly infallible plan—which looks a lot like the animated Marauder's Map from 'Harry Potter'—and the omniscience it grants, these celestial shepherds are about as dumb as sheepdogs.In the belated final act, Norris races toward the mother of all movie climax clichés—the eleventh hour wedding intervention. With his unrequited love set to marry another dude, Norris exploits 'The Adjustment Bureau's' two most ridiculous plot devices in order to intervene. First, he scores a magic hat, enabling him to access the subspace network that provides a series of shortcuts throughout New York. Second, he cloaks himself in a rainstorm, which like all water, inexplicably clouds the Bureau's ability to chart movement.It's a shame that 'The Adjustment Bureau' hangs its own proverbial hat on so many ludicrous details. The big questions it poses, while far from new, are well suited for a love story, and the directorial debut of screenwriter George Nolfi shows some promise. Unfortunately it's the writing that's at fault here, and while I can't speak to the source material, Nolfi's adaptation is rife with questionable choices. Potential squandered, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is cast adrift in sci-fi no man's land between good intentions and their eye-rolling realization.'Trust no one with a hat,' Norris is melodramatically advised. 'A Yankees cap, even a yarmulke.' No joke, if you can swallow a line like that—hat's off.",5,88,135,11 March 2011
Avatar," 'Avatar'
","Months before I had seen so much as a vague concept sketch for 'Avatar,' I remember hearing that it would 'f*** my eyeballs.' This statement was never employed in any official capacity by James Cameron or his marketing team, but rather coalesced online from Hollywood hearsay and snowballing hype. After all, this was the film Cameron, geek champion of the early Terminator franchise and 'titanic' personage behind the highest grossing film of all time, had been taming for decades, patiently awaiting the maturation of computer generated imagery and developing dual-lens 3D technology to realize his initial dream in all its stunning audacity.Well, the consumer-end product is much more subtle than the suggested act of ocular penetration would indicate. Cameron has indeed achieved a landmark in 3D storytelling, using the effect sparingly to enhance audience immersion rather than to superficially draw attention to the gimmick. Set against the risky backdrop of an epic sci-fi/action film, 'Avatar' mercifully resists the urge to send bullets or arrows whizzing through the screen, or to dredge the forests of Pandora past the fourth wall. Convincing three-dimensional depth of field is his greatest triumph, and Cameron crafts a world both vibrant and vivacious. However, outside the technical mastery and aesthetic perk, the world beyond my curiously uncomfortable plastic glasses quickly unraveled.To begin, 'Avatar' is beautiful to a fault. Cameron's Pandora, home to the peaceful, humanoid Na'vi and gobs of subterranean 'unobtainium,' which draw mankind and its drills, is described by militant antagonist Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as a perilous nightmare of a planet. 'If there is a hell,' he spits at a platoon of new recruits, 'You might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.' Sounds terrifying, Colonel, but the visuals never really live up to it. Sure, our hero Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) comes to odds with some of the less friendly wildlife, but the forests themselves are always teeming with phosphorescent flowers and rich foliage illuminated by striking filtered sunlight. The bottom line is that Pandora is too utopian to ever feel like a real place, especially in contrast to the gritty live- action segments. There's a degree of intentional juxtaposition there, but the gap is ultimately too wide for a single creative world to bridge.Besides being one-dimensionally wonderful, the design of Pandora's creatures and locales is seriously uninspired. As a love story, Cameron risks very little in making the Na'vi essentially nine-foot tall humans with tails, and the supporting creatures are textbook fantasy. You have your dragons, your (six-legged) horses, and your garden-variety re-imaginings of other familiar animals with supplemental eyes and appendages. Given that Cameron treats 'Avatar' as an exercise in world building, its here that his film most disappoints. Beyond the intriguing concept of inter-species connectivity, which allows the Na'vi to link physically and spiritually with the flora and fauna of Pandora, Cameron's creatures are gorgeously rendered but safe and boring.These predominantly aesthetic complaints may seem trivial in the greater context of the film, and to a certain extent they are, but 'Avatar' is an effects vehicle, and those elements should be supporting the merely serviceable story rather than detracting from it. 'Avatar,' for all its unoriginality, still succeeds as a high-octane blockbuster, far surpassing forgettable summer fare like 'Transformers 2,' or the sorry state of the Terminator franchise Cameron founded. His film is confidently constructed, immersive, and often enjoyable, if overlong and unoriginal. It manages to weave its tale using a compelling new technology without feeling like a glorified tech demo, which is an accomplishment in itself.'Avatar' may not be the monumental leap forward in storytelling some anticipated, but it proves 3D can be used for more than making an audience flinch. There's plenty to enjoy when you don't buy into the hyperbole, so mediate your expectations and let Cameron's latest looker do what it does best: fondle your eyeballs.",7,2,4,6 April 2010
Super 8," Gr8
","It's getting harder and harder to make movies like Super 8. Without the marketing muscle of a comic book superhero or a million dollar mug to slap on the poster, director J.J. Abrams gave the Hollywood bean counters dangerously little to count on. Even after Star Trek proved Abrams could direct the hell out of a summer blockbuster, the budget allocated for his pet follow-up is as diminutive as its young cast.There is one megaton name Abrams drops on the Super 8 one-sheet: Steven Spielberg. But then, even his involvement means little when stinkers like Transformers and Eagle Eye regularly reappropriate his reputation for their own nefarious purposes. Fortunately, Abrams' connection to Spielberg is more personal.Super 8 is a tribute to the early accomplishments of the famous filmmaker, and to his ilk who fell under the Amblin Entertainment banner in the 1980s. Abrams draws thirstily from their well, and precedes his film with that iconic E.T. over-the-moon title card. His contribution isn't quite the missing masterpiece many might have hoped, but it is a fun sci-fi throwback with modern flourishes and plenty of heart. Imagine that.Like Richard Donner's Goonies, the pint-sized protagonists of Super 8 are kids. Not the angsty teenage set that Twilight has cornered, but kids. Cute, flawed, and endearing, the cast and casting director deserves a lot of credit. Two of the youngest stars make their debut here, including Joel Courtney as Joe, a boy dealing with the untimely death of his mother, and Riley Griffiths as Charles —Joe's (token big boned) friend with directorial aspirations.Hence the title, a love of filmmaking permeates Super 8 — not just in Abrams' confident, informed direction, but among his characters as well. Set in the summer of '79, our heroes sneak out by night to shoot scenes for Charles' schlocky zombie detective short, The Case. Anyone who's messed around with a camcorder as a kid or endured an amateur film festival will immediately recognize the beats. Armed with approximations of professional equipment that would put my friends and I and our Mickey Mouse operation to shame, these characters are seriously creative. But then, being written by J.J. Abrams doesn't hurt.It's no real spoiler that Super 8 is an alien flick, and Charles' little project takes a dramatic turn when he records something he was never meant to see. A loosed extraterrestrial menace stirs up trouble in the close-knit community, but with the subsequent government invasion, the first act's micro-focus begins to blur. Spielberg's own E.T. benefited from an exclusively adolescent perspective. By comparison, Super 8 wanders.Though we're never parted from Joe long, the unfolding alien drama rarely meshes with the human story. Creature characterization should be married to his coming-of-age, but instead, exposition usually amounts to an isolated attack on a tertiary character. The scenes play well with suspense and camera trickery, but in hindsight, the plot is pretty much paused for action.Super 8 is still a summer movie to aspire to. Like Inception, it defiantly forgoes franchising in favor of an as-yet untapped creative reserve. Of course, Abrams draws from the same wellspring that Spielberg, Donner, and Dante drank from, but even when he borrows, he reminds us why so many films made for triple the price aren't half as enjoyable — heart. Call Abrams overambitious, but his is a story of love, reconciliation, and friendship. How exactly do you quantify that?",7,4,10,13 June 2011
Up," 'Up'
","'Up' may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us 'Wall-E' and before that 'Ratatouille.' 'Up' suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager 'wilderness explorer,' has stowed away beneath his porch.The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless 'three days' from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: 'Kevin' a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and 'Doug' a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.'Up' is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against 'Up' greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that 'Ratatouille' or 'Wall-E' were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission.",7,5,7,6 April 2010
Rio," Rio de Generic
","'Rio' is one for the kiddies, so you'll have to forgive this childless twenty-something for feeling at odds with the target audience. The theater was stuffed with tykes with mouths agape—whispering, screaming, and coughing. I have no idea if that means they were enjoying it. From an adult perspective, this anthropomorphic epic isn't necessarily a painful endurance test, but unlike Nickelodeon's 'Rango,' there isn't a single compelling reason to recommend it to anyone over the age of 12.The voice cast is unsurprisingly stacked with actors in vogue looking to score an easy paycheck. Jesse Eisenberg channels his innermost neurosis as Blu, our fine, feathered protagonist with a fear of flying. Leslie Mann plays his owner Linda, a bookish Minnesotan who is coerced into schlepping her beloved pet to the eponymous South American city in order to have him (ahem) mate with the only known female of his kind.If you've ever been subjected to children's programming, you may know the cadence that most of the cast adopts. Sentences delicately spill from animated lips with careful annunciation of each syllable, lest anyone fall behind. There are a couple of legitimately impressive performances, including Jemaine Clement of 'Flight of the Conchords' fame as a conniving cockatoo, and Tracy Morgan from '30 Rock' as an oversensitive bulldog. Rounded out by the likes of Will i Am and Jamie Foxx, 'Rio' draws from a pool of veteran vocal performers.And if the above talent didn't tip you off, I regretfully inform you that 'Rio' fancies itself a musical. Doubtless spurred by the success of 'Happy Feet,' every so often the characters break into exuberant song, which is even more grating than their unhurried dialogue.The archetypical adventure plays out predictably. Blu doesn't exactly hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his undomesticated mate—but the two are birdnapped and find love as they find their way home together. Granted, it's a proved template, but to use the oeuvre of Pixar as a counter-point, there's plenty of wiggle-room to establish identity within the stringent confines of a narrative 'sure thing.' Even when Pixar isn't pushing boundaries, its creative shepherds generally recognize the chasm that separates the kiddie crowd from general audience.Not that there's anything wrong with catering a cartoon to children, but even under those auspices, I can only recommend 'Rio' to, what, 15% of the population? Probably none of whom are reading this review. Parents have my condolences if they're dragged to this utterly uninteresting animated flick, though history is fraught with worse cinematic prison sentences.It's hard to outright hate 'Rio' given that I am almost two decades the elder of its target audience, and childless to boot. Thus, my window into its appeal is either long-since closed or not-yet open. As a fan of animation, however, I can safely assert that grown ups need not apply. If readymade heartstring pluckers like lost pets and orphans get you all gooey-eyed, maybe 'Rio' will speak to you—but my sense is that most of us are calloused to such obvious emotional exploitation.As for the twelve and unders—their reaction was tough to gauge amid the chorus of whispers, shrieks, and hacking coughs. They all pretty much sat still and watched the damn movie. That must count for something.",5,1,7,19 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," 'How to Train Your Dragon'
","Dreamworks has been getting better, haven't they? Overall? They've certainly learned from Pixar that a little bit of heart goes a long way in animated children's film-making. Unfortunately, a little bit of heart is all you really get in their latest, the Norse coming of age comedy, 'How to Train Your Dragon.'The film is split into two tonally distinct sections: an intimate and charming boy-and-his- dragon friendship fable, and an exceptionally dull gladiatorial adventure film. It seems like nearly half of the running time is swallowed by a series of dragon defense training sequences with our hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), wowing a gaggle of cartoon stereotypes with his ability to tame the ferocious beasts without violence. There's seriously so many of these scenes that I keep thinking the name of the movie is 'How to Tame Your Dragon.'The arena stuff doesn't do much to carry the plot; it just sort of peripherally shows the practical application of learning the softer side of dragons. And because the plot isn't really being advanced (the young Vikings are being trained while most of their village is out searching for a dragon hive), gags substitute for story, and wit is not the film's strong suit. Honestly, most of the characters feel shamelessly yanked from an animated who's who of the last decade. You've got the bickering siblings from 'The Incredibles,' a protagonist not unlike Linguine of 'Ratatouille' fame, and a couple of Shreks thrown in for good measure (or maybe that's just the Scottish accent). The supporting cast ultimately dilutes the simple maturity of film's central friendship, and sucks 'Dragon' dangerously near the 'Shark Tale' sinkhole.It's sort of like 'Up' and the talking dogs. When you have something powerful, stick with it. Not every animated film has to be a 3D action/effects spectacle. Maybe this is a little greedy, but I'm not interested in going timeshare on 'How to Train Your Dragon.' Give me 'Old Yeller' or give me 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua.'Fortunately, it's more the former than the latter. As kids films go, you could do a lot worse, but the divide that makes Pixar Pixar and Dreamworks Dreamworks is still firmly inset in 'Dragon's' design philosophy. Pixar transcends the idea of making children's films, where Dreamworks embraces it, and while that's terrific for the target demographic, I don't think mom and dad are going to have as good a time as they did watching 'Finding Nemo' or 'Monster's Inc.'But Dreamworks is getting better at keeping the whole family entertained, and 'How to Train Your Dragon' is among the very highest echelon of the studio's animated work, which probably partly accounts for its overwhelming praise via Rotten Tomatoes. Objectively however, it doesn't quite know who it's trying to please, and settles for a 'some of the people, some of the time' scenario that left me intermittently yawning. At its heart, there's a timeless companionship—It just sometimes gets lost in favor of disposable entertainment.And that may be a backhanded complement, but it's a complement nonetheless. 'How to Train Your Dragon' is entertaining and sometimes touching, but doesn't quite overcome its kiddie stigmata, and the ADD child in me has already moved on.",6,2,20,6 April 2010
Thor," Snor
","'Thor' operates under the mistaken assumption that Thor is cool. Marvel's unsolicited film adaptation makes no attempt to entice an audience that may yet be unfamiliar with this benchwarmer hero. Peter Parker was a dweeb; Bruce Wayne lost his parents; Clark Kent was abandoned at birth; great comic heroes have compelling origin stories. Our introduction to Thor is as a spoiled warmonger about to ascend to kinghood. Why are we rooting for this guy, again?Pitting your audience against the protagonist is something a filmmaker the caliber of a P.T. Anderson can pull off, but I'm pretty sure we're supposed to like Thor. Maybe we're supposed to sympathize when daddy takes away his mallet, but once the eponymous meathead is booted from his cushy Asgardian throne, he crash lands on Earth as a colossal buffoon. See Thor get tased. See Thor smash a coffee mug while a glib teenager uploads a photo to Facebook and you'll have an idea just how low the comedy here is flying. Watch your heads.'Thor' treats Thor with such undeserved adulation that reducing the thunder god to a punch line in the second act comes like a bolt from the blue. Following a foundation of pretentious melodrama set in a Seussian CGI metropolis, even the more successful attempts at humor later on play foreign and weird. And just to keep the audience on its toes, the tone wobbles wildly to and fro like a pair of burly Norsemen on a teeter-totter.I've got nothing against flawed heroes. Thor's arrogance might have helped make his story worth telling. Instead, the filmmakers (with credit to no less than five writers) waste two hours attempting to redeem him in the audience's eyes. Still, the real problem is that the character is uninteresting. It's more than possible some of the nuance of the comic books has been lost in translation, but I can't think of a single trait that makes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) appealing.The same goes for the rest of the cast. Natalie Portman plays a scientist who ought to be studying the mysteries of her missing personality, and Stellan Skarsgård plays her mentor, an equally pale placeholder character. Rounding out their misfit team is Kat Dennings, whose character description might as well read: 'Social media junkie; loves her iPod, and whatever else those damned teenagers are into nowadays.'The aesthetic of 'Thor' is as bland as its players. Director Kenneth Branagh, best known for his Shakespearean endeavors, takes a 'broken tripod' approach to directing this summer tent pole. He has cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos frame half his shots diagonally in lieu of investing in a coherent visual style. Branagh is elsewhere absent as the shepherd of his cast — otherwise proved performers mumble their way through the movie.As if Thor didn't have enough shame to contend with as a D-list superhero, his big screen debut is similarly underwhelming. Instead of making a case for the character, Branagh and a gaggle of screenwriters cement his lame duck status in this bludgeoningly boring popcorn flick. Even undiscerning cinema-goers looking for little more than a two-hour refuge from the summer sun have better choices available to them. Comic book aficionados likewise have no shortage of spandex to look forward to in the coming weeks.After years of warming the bench, Thor finally got called into the big game, only to slip up and sustain a career-ending injury on his first play. That's gotta hurt.",Null,0,2,12 May 2011
Zombieland," 'Zombieland'
","I'm going to begin adversarial and maybe we can meet in the middle. I didn't love 'Shaun of the Dead.' There, I said it. Those still reading can only imagine my reaction then to the 'Zombieland' trailer, which on every significant selling point seemed identical, without the novelty of having done it first. My primary objection to this burgeoning 'zomedy' genre is that its sense of humor hasn't been transgressive enough to match the post-apocalyptic setting. 'Shaun' set every precedent for 'Zombieland' to be a cutesy, inconsequential comedy chock full of gimmicky jabs at the expense of horror convention.So I hunkered down in an irritable cynicism when the film began building a catalogue of positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, Facebook feeds, and second-hand conversations all seemed to suggest my prejudice toward the film was unfounded. I saw it last weekend as part of a triple feature and was, admittedly, pleasantly surprised. It turns out 'Zombieland' does employ a cutesy, inconsequential narrative, but its emotional and comedic core is every bit as distinct and charming as that of 'Shaun of the Dead,' but which, as I admitted, I didn't love to begin with.The screenplay for 'Zombieland' is rife with seasoned surface-level details like zombie safety regulations and an intriguing character name template, but has a great big undercooked pink center. The structure doesn't have the snap of 'Shaun,' and the plot often feels tertiary to the disposable gags and the 'wouldn't-it-be-cool' set pieces. Certainly aimlessness is an appropriate feeling to elicit for a scenario in which any 'save-the-world' opportunity has long since expired, but it comes at the expense of the film feeling underwritten. As near as I can tell, three things happen over the paltry eighty minute running time: boy meets girl, boy and girl travel to surprise celebrity cameo's house, boy rescues girl from amusement park. And those aren't acts, they're scenes.Fortunately, the screenplay accounts for all but one of 'Zombieland's' most-rotten blemishes. Besides green-lighting the irksome giant text espousing every survival tip that floats or crumbles or unfolds distractingly amidst several scenes, first-time feature director Ruben Fleisher performs his duties admirably in bringing the film to life, though was blessed by the natural chemistry of his leads. Woody Harrelson stars as Tallahassee, the Twinkie- obsessed badass, while Jesse 'For-The-Last-Time-I'm-Not-Michael-Cera' Eisenberg portrays the swooning, rule-keeping wimp, Columbus. 'Zombieland' works as often as it does because of the classic dynamic pairing of these two.But I think the primary reason Fleisher's film has been so commercially successful, having already made back its 23 million dollar budget twofold, while other recent horror-comedy hybrids like 'Drag Me to Hell,' and 'Grindhouse' have underperformed, is that his directorial sensibilities skew so comedic. A zombie may trigger a 'Boo!' orchestral spike every so often out of obligation, but the undead don't pose any serious threat until the amusement park finale, and even then, 'Zombieland' settles for a crowd-pleasing comedic outcome rather than what's logical, mature, or interesting.Nevertheless, I was won over, if just barely. 'Zombieland' contains plenty to chuckle about, but its tonal levity unfortunately extends to the storytelling itself, and the credits roll leaving a sensation of benign indifference in their wake. To bring it back to fan-favorite, 'Shaun of the Dead,' which is a better-made film, unquestionably, it's my heretical opinion that 'Zombieland' is just as funny. The films actually oddly compliment one another in their very English and very American takes on life after the living dead.And for 'Zombieland,' what's more American than the sequel? Bloggers are already atwitter over early talks of a follow-up, and as much as the idea disinterests me, I guess I have to give this one the benefit of the doubt.",7,1,2,6 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'
","Ignore the wet tendril snaking its way down your neck, it's only your liquidized brain. 'Transformers 2' is only half way over; you won't need it anyway.'Revenge of the Fallen' is huge, loud, and meaningless. After an entirely overlong and comparatively jokey first act, the endless string of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot level fight sequences will beat your consciousness within an inch of its tolerance. Your eyes will glaze over, unfocus. Is director Michael Bay an artist, a con artist, or a hypnotist? Is there some deeper creative implication behind the trivialization of human (and I guess robot) worth? It's unclear how many people die in the film, but there is a clear lack of sympathy, or even fetishistic pathos to the destruction. What transpires enters and leaves the frame leaving no impression on its viewer whatsoever.The film is in turns harmlessly dumb summer action fare, and more troublingly numbing and nonsensical. It's an impenetrable spectacle, a two and a half hour kaleidoscope shifting every permutation of guns, metal, and girls. Bay is a hypnotist, but not akin to, say, Godfrey Reggio, the director of the non-narrative documentary 'Koyaanisqatsi,' but rather a figure unparalleled in film-making for his ability to induce a disconnected vegetative state amidst flying iron fist fights, interplanetary espionage, and rippling firestorms.The film feels in many ways as though it takes place during one continuous explosion. There are maybe fifteen minutes of hard plot that get stretched, slow-moed, doubled back, and reiterated over the course of the film, and still come out making something less than sense because our protagonists, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) are being hurried from set piece to set piece faster than the speed of logic.Worst of all, 'Transformers' is not only desensitizing, but is a dangerous template for future 'family' action films. The colorful characters and the innocent source material make it seem a safe bet for little Joey, but the film earns its PG-13 rating and then some. There's an unspoken sexual frustration behind the joke writing, explicitly of the most juvenile variety, which I suppose, when examined, fits well with the overall aesthetic, given that the film is little more than a 200 million dollar realization of a thirteen year old's classroom doodles.There's nothing remotely resembling substance in the picture, and the mind-meltingly repetitive action choreography coupled with the ludicrous running time (its biggest fault) prevent the film from passing even as pure fluff.But ultimately, these criticisms can be applied generally to the modern blockbuster, and perhaps it's somewhat unfair that 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' happens to be the vehicle to weather the brunt of them. It's just as intellectually flaccid as last month's 'Terminator Salvation,' but if the box office numbers are any indication, it has much broader commercial appeal. It's an easy punching bag because it exemplifies so many of problems with films of its kind, and after a retrospectively decent first installment, there's no justification for how stupid and stupefying the film is.So when the credits finally roll and you pinch your temples as you stand up to leave, just be sure not to slip on your brain on the way out.",3,2,7,6 April 2010
Inception," 1% Inception, 99% Perception
","With 'Inception,' Christopher Nolan doesn't necessarily raise any big questions—He's more of an exclamation point guy. Shame on me. I don't know why I ever let myself believe that the giant summer blockbuster from the director of 'The Dark Knight' would be anything other than an action movie first and foremost. It was an error of judgment on my part, and one I don't intend to hold against it.While not entirely absent, the cerebral drama I thought I paid for rode along the margins. Nolan, who beyond 'Batman,' also directed 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' among others, is great at dialing back the complexity of his narratives to their most accessible level. This means 'Inception,' particularly in its first half, leans against a scaffolding of exposition, on which characters glassily explain how the business of dream invasion and information extraction works, right down to its subtlest intricacies. It can easily become grating, but the transparency of the writing is somewhat forgiven by the strength of the performances, and the not-so-insignificant fact that it exists purely to deliver an incredible, uninterrupted finale. Honestly, the sooner you stop expecting 'Inception' to challenge you, the more you'll enjoy it.It's hard to say on first viewing whether any of that exposition could be cut without compromising audience understanding of the events that unfold—Essentially 'Inception' is a reverse heist film, with a crack team of dream spelunkers (Leo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen Page) attempting to 'plant' an idea in the subconscious psyche of the heir to a corporate mogul's empire (Cillian Murphy)—But even at his most condescendingly explanatory, Nolan runs at a brisk pace; he forgoes atmosphere in favor of adrenaline.And there I do take issue. Maybe I bring my own dream experience into the equation, but when I remember my dreams, I more often recall abstract feelings than concrete cause and effect. Conversely, it seems Nolan's dreams are all about events—Meetings, kidnappings, James Bond compound infiltrations. It's all very exciting, but not as emotionally transporting as I would have hoped.But then it's not Colin George's 'Inception,' and my dreams run antithetical to Nolan's greater intent. His film isn't faux sci-fi gone sour, it's a smarter than average thriller, and taken in thriller context, its unquestionable genre elevation. Here Nolan not only crafts visually distinct, memorable action scenes, but he understands that those scenes carry weight only because of their context to his characters' journey.Precisely for that reason, the opening of the film did little for me. It makes all the sense in the world to begin with an elaborate dream sequence gone awry, but without immediately knowing what's at stake, we have no reason to root for the characters or care about what they're doing—Beyond the fact that it all looks gorgeous. Nolan finds his footing when he introduces Page as DiCaprio's protégé, and as an outlet for the exposition, she keeps the audience in the loop. Granted, it's not the most elegant solution, but without it, 'Inception' runs the risk of spiraling into entropy.Simply put, it isn't the sort of film that deserves to be critically scrutinized, playing just a few short weeks after Shyamalan's snoozy 'Airbender' and barely a month removed from the inept action comedy, 'Killers.' By no means a perfect film, 'Inception' is damn near the perfect summer film, and during an unusually tepid season, it's exciting just to see someone brave enough to get into the water.And Nolan puts his head under. It may not have been the revelation I stupidly expected, but 'Inception' backs up brawn with brains, and that's what the director does best. Whether he's working within the guidelines of comic book canon or acting as the architect of his own worlds, he doesn't necessarily innovate—But he always reinvents. Exclamation point.",8,2,6,20 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," 'Sherlock Holmes'
","'Sherlock Holmes' by way of Guy Ritchie sounds about as good a pairing as Michael Bay and the Old Testament, but the director's mainstream sensibility and testosterone-infused filmography color a surprisingly inoffensive adaptation, thanks in large part to the charismatic performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, respectively. I have a hunch that longtime fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's intrepid detective may be put off by Ritchie's brawn over brains approach to the material, which paints its protagonist as ostensibly an Indiana Jones, but the film suffices as harmless fun if not a serious head scratcher.Action invariably supersedes mystery, and unraveling Holmes' latest case leads to fisticuffs more often than not, but purists needn't worry that their hero has been stripped entirely of his intellect. Even in one of countless gratuitous fight sequences with 'Matrix'-esque speed- ramping, Ritchie's Holmes is always portrayed as a thinker. He carefully calculates the impact of each of his blows, instantaneously deriving the quickest route to his enemy's defeat before its painful execution. The screenplay employs this method of doubling back on a scene to reveal the product of Holmes' clever schemes throughout, heightening sequences that might otherwise consist of purely expository dialogue.Where I do take issue with the film, however, is in the mystery itself, which never packs the sort of revelations the genre typically needs to. The plot is centered on one Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), an occultist and murderer who is sentenced to death by hanging, only to return from grave shortly thereafter. Perhaps I pack my own skepticism in this interpretation, which is partly why I don't consider it a spoiler, but it was always clear to me that Blackwood was an illusionist. His feats of supposed magic don't seem incredible enough to not have a rational explanation, and as a result, the disclosure of their orchestration is less surprising than merely satisfactory. Fortunately, the sequence of events that lead Holmes to this predictable discovery is less transparent. In fact, often the contrary, though perhaps more due to staccato pacing and thick accents than legitimate intrigue, but it's nevertheless more fun to be one step behind Holmes than one in front.Still, the film has plenty more going for it to make it worth a family or friendly outing. Hans Zimmer provides a memorable score, and the production design creates a surprisingly authentic turn-of-the-century London, especially in comparison to other big-budget period blunders like Peter Jackson's 2005 adaptation of 'King Kong,' which took at best a half- hearted approach to recreating the thirties. Ritchie's team impresses with moody interiors and muddy streets only occasionally blemished by over-indulgent CGI cityscapes. The chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law compensates for a disappointing script, and keeps the film from feeling like a slog.'Sherlock Holmes' is neither a triumph nor a disaster, and while 2009 may have brought us plenty of better blockbusters, it delivered just as many worse. 'Holmes' has enough charm and wit to recommend for an impromptu cineplex Saturday, especially heading into what looks like a tepid January. It turns out the world-class sleuth and Guy Ritchie make a decent pair after all, and with an ending that clearly assumes a sequel, the greatest mystery is not if they'll re-team, but when.",6,1,2,6 April 2010
The Blind Side," 'The Blind Side'
","I'm no sports fan, so I suppose 'The Blind Side' was already fighting an uphill battle for my praise. I dislike the film, but not because the characters are interested in things like high school football, college football, and video game football, but because they exist in a world without lasting consequence. That John Lee Hancock, the writer and director, wants to deliver an upbeat, entertaining film proves his Achilles' heel; he omits clear dramatic potential in favor of sitcomy euphemism.His breezy plot, based on the true story of a Baltimore Ravens defensive lineman, whisks conflict aside for 'Big Mike' Oher (Quentin Aaron), who lumbers his way from kindly mentor to kindly mentor, without any indication or expression of the hard life he's led. The film unfolds almost serendipitously for the teen, who is enrolled in private schooling, gets taken in by a wealthy southern family, gradually wins over his teachers, receives a brand new truck as a birthday gift, and is on the fast track to play football for 'Ole Miss' University. In short, it's hard to feel bad for a guy that has so much going for him.I don't mean to undermine the personal tragedies that the real life Michael Oher endured, but we really never get a visceral sense of that reality in the film. We meet Big Mike well after the majority of his neglect and trauma has occurred, and he really hits a terrific string of luck. He isn't the victim of any direct prejudice in his seemingly all-white southern suburb, and the kindly family that takes him in, led by headstrong matriarch Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), seems to adapt to his disruption of their family dynamic instantaneously. The tiresome thesis of the film is that the Tuohys are just really great people.This makes for a surface-level heartwarmer, and I suppose audiences shouldn't be ridiculed for appreciating the film on that criteria, but to me, what's missing underneath is all the more apparent for it. Hancock would have done well to introduce us to Big Mike at the gritty bottom: one of twelve children of a crack-addicted mother, in turns homeless, under foster care, and a struggling student in a revolving door of unsupportive schools. Being taken in by the Tuohys would make a better midpoint for Michael's story, and provide a better sense of the dichotomy of his two lives.If only by narrative necessity, Hancock eventually throws in isolated sequences of hard drama, but which have almost uniformly negligible impact on the story. For example, Big Mike totals his new truck with Leigh Anne's son in the passenger seat--the paramedics show up, they wheel out the stretcher, and it turns out everybody's fine. The following scene plays out as though the crash didn't even happen. Or later on, the NCAA suspects the Tuohys of forcing Ole Miss on Mike after a heated vetting, which leads him to a brief identity crisis (even though he's always been fiercely loyal to his foster parents)--after which he decides he wanted to play there all along.These internally-resolved conflict blips are so lonely in the cheerful world of the film that they draw attention to themselves by sheer contrast. Admittedly, I prefer Hancock's optimistic storytelling to an excess in melodrama, but it leaves 'The Blind Side' starkly overlong and unsatisfying. The film depicts the great things that happen to Michael Oher without providing the context that makes them meaningful. Hancock is under the bizarre assumption that Leigh Anne Tuohy is his protagonist, and the film is more a tribute to the family that hosted Big Mike than the man himself.I'm no sports fan, but you don't need to be one to call Hancock out. 'The Blind Side' is a bust.",4,3,5,6 April 2010
Rango," Of (Anthropomorphic) Mice and Men
","Anthropomorphic animals are the bread and butter of the animation industry. Ever since Walt Disney found a cash cow in Mickey Mouse, the medium has tickled audiences with talking critters that span the breadth of the animal kingdom. But Rango, the titular chameleon of Gore Verbinski's cartoon western, is something of an anomaly. The gangly, photorealistic bipedal lizard didn't graduate from the 'Bambi' school of cuddly creature design. Voiced by Johnny Depp in rare comedic form, the character is defined by beady eyes, a sharply crooked neck, and a gaudy Hawaiian T-shirt.Refreshingly, Verbinski doesn't constrain himself to Pixar's particular reality. The brilliant Disney-owned studio has set the gold standard for computer animation over the last 15 years, capitalizing repeatedly on an effective storytelling formula that put a magnifying glass over insects, fish, and rats, among others. Any of those films could be retitled, 'The Secret Life of _______.' Competitors followed suit, with 'Madagascar,' 'Bee Movie,' and a slew of other me-too efforts.'Rango' turns the overcrowded genre on its ear. Despite being gaspingly more realistic- looking than your average doe-eyed Disney endeavor, Verbinski's flick doesn't stage its critters in a cartoon facsimile of the real world. Instead, the film takes place in some skewed dimension wherein humans exist, but might as well not save for their ever-present eco- footprint. The film is scaled to fit its characters and can't be bothered to stop and explain the origin of its windswept desert town in miniature. It's easiest to think of 'Rango' as a modern (comedic) western in which the constituent players just happen to be scruffy rodents and scaly reptiles.The world and its inhabitants may be grimy, but what makes 'Rango' such an endearing experience is its irreverent and offbeat sense of humor. Verbinski, who cooked up the story alongside screenwriter John Logan, borrows a page or two from the Coen brothers; Rango's faux eloquence is reminiscent of Nicolas Cage or George Clooney's character from 'Raising Arizona' or 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' respectively. It shares their dry wit and a surrealist dream sequence reminiscent of 'The Big Lebowski' too.Those qualities highlight that 'Rango' is not a movie especially geared at children. From its litany of literate film references including 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Chinatown,' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' to its seriously scary baddies, the film rejects kiddie convention outright. Younger or more sensitive viewers may be frightened by Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), a venomous villain with a six shooter for a tail, and parents might object to the mild swearing.But by my estimate, 'Rango' is a near-perfect kids' film. Looking as far back or further than the Grimm brothers' macabre fairy tales, the impulse to shield children from potentially off- putting content is a relatively recent development. Verbinski runs the entire emotional gradient here, exploring moments of loneliness and fear as well as adventure and jubilation. Important themes all in the human psyche. Of course, much of the humor will go over the heads of young audience members, but the copious slapstick certainly won't. In the end, it should play well to just about everyone.That is, everyone who's in the market for a conceptually challenging cartoon. 'Rango' is unwieldy, occasionally unfocused, and also the first great film of 2011. The anthropomorphic animals that comprise its world are less a reflection of the Mickeys, Bambis, and Nemos of years past than of the Waynes, Eastwoods, and Fondas. Verbinski, who famously teamed with Disney for their 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, steps out of their shadow for one of the most clever, fun, and original animated epics of the 21st century. And with the sequel to Pixar's least loved film on deck for this summer, our favorite Hawaiian shirt-wearing Chameleon may need to don a tux this time next year.",8,1,4,9 March 2011
Despicable Me," Call Me a Cynic, But I Liked It!
","Never one to pass up a good cinematic curmudgeon, maybe I was predisposed to enjoy Universal's 'Despicable Me.' I mean, when it comes to off-brand animated entertainment, ass-kicking Pandas and pet Dragons only take me so far—It wasn't until Russian supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) put his adopted children to bed in the hollowed-out casings of 'probably' inactive bombshells that I finally felt like the target audience.Ever since animation studios began better emulating Pixar's secret sauce, they've met with varying degrees of success in combining raw, gooey emotion with their signature lighthearted recipes. 'Despicable Me' grapples with it, and though it may be one of the most consistent examples yet, it's still about as nuanced a dish as macaroni and cheese — which, fortunately for me, I've never outgrown.However, of the two conflicting senses of humor at play, there is one I absolutely have outgrown. Rarely has a family film so distinctly set aside its kids' humor from its more mature fare; In 'Despicable Me,' it's a difference personified. Gru's subterranean lair is crawling with his 'minions,' little, yellow jellybean-like creatures who make butt jokes and slap each other around. They're cute purely for the sake of being cute (in effect, a sort of artificial cuteness) and anytime they're on screen, the comparable intellect of the rest of the film is suffocated by indecipherable high-pitched chatter and broad gags that make vaudeville look like the Divine Comedy.The good news is that the minions are never on screen for particularly long, and there are a few laughs to be had at their expense when they become the unfortunate casualties of Gru's experiments. Conversely, most of film's jokes have an avant-garde sensibility that jived better with me; Gru must acquire a loan from the 'Bank of Evil' in order to fund his diabolical scheme to shrink and steal the moon. Coupled with a 'Spy vs. Spy'-esquire kinetic goofiness, it still averages out to be a fairly funny film.No surprise, a lot of upper-echelon voice talent is involved, and I remember being impressed months ago at the wall of names that played after the teaser-trailer. Admittedly, I haven't been the biggest fan of Carell's work since he left 'The Daily Show' back in 2005, but he doesn't distract as Gru. He plays well off of a cast eerily similar to that of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall:' Jason Segel as his nemesis, Vector (who is, interestingly, another supervillian —'Despicable Me' doesn't have a hero); Russell Brand as an elderly inventor by the name of Dr. Nefario; Kristin Wiig as the proprietor of the orphanage from which Gru adopts three young girls in a ploy to infiltrate Vector's fortress.But perhaps most interestingly, 'Despicable Me' has some of the most easily-missed cameos in the history of animation. Danny McBride plays Gru's neighbor with a line and a half of dialogue, and Jemaine Clement from HBO's 'Flight of the Conchords' (apparently) voices one of the minions. Other than stacking the deck as an advertising vehicle, it seems pointless to pay such funny people for such inconsequential roles.But I think their presence signifies, if nothing else, that 'Despicable Me' is a project worth being attached to. It may fall back on certain cyclical annoying tendencies, catering occasionally to lowest-common-denominator comedy (the avoidance of which even the best emulation of Pixar hasn't managed), but the world of the film is comically rich, and no amount of disposable, annoying minions can wreck that — though not from lack of trying. The heart of the story, Gru coming to begrudgingly love his adopted daughters, may not win any prizes for revolutionary storytelling, but it's well executed and 'cute' in a legitimate way.As something of an amateur curmudgeon myself, please disregard my smile.",7,10,16,13 July 2010
The Woman in Black," Horror by the Book
","Recipe for a Hollywood horror flick: pick a screenplay with a vaguely creepy-sounding title like The Woman in Black. Be sure the writer included one or all of the following: portraits with the eyes scratched out, little kids' drawings, antique toys, etc. Next, shoot everything at half exposure. Then pick a quiet weekend to release and collect your fifty million dollars. Repeat. It's a racket that works like a charm, and isn't going away until the audience does.The Woman in Black stars 'Arry Potter 'imself — Daniel Radcliffe — as Arthur Kipps, an adolescent English estate lawyer bound unluckily for a haunted house in the boondocks. Kipps' job is on the line, which accounts for his eager beaver attitude upon arrival, and dogged insistence on seeing the property, even against the behest of, oh, everyone in town. You know where this is going.Once inside the isolated island manor, Kipps can't seem to get any work done. A typical sequence of scenes plays out with the protagonist sitting down to study a stack of documents and being immediately distracted by some foreign sound or supernatural happening. And then the investigation's afoot; jump scares abound, though they fall too formulaically to conjure much anxiety or subsequent shock. After all, scares by appointment aren't very scary.The screenplay is particularly disappointing given its author, Jane Golden, who spun genre into gold with Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class. Too dour to pass as a throwback haunted house flick, and too clichéd to surprise anyone, The Woman in Black is caught in the nebulous nowhere between fun and frightening. Even if her writing were stronger, however, there's no guarantee it would be spared the blunt hand of James Watkins, a director with the finesse of a steamroller.He brings not an ounce of aesthetic originality to the table, imbuing the movie with the same ugly, washed-out palette of six dozen other studio horror failures. The technique is intended to foster a mood, but it's a cheap substitute for good old-fashioned filmmaking. Mood isn't achieved in camera — it's an aggregate of art direction, camera placement, performance, music, etc. The obvious digital look of the film also hampers the believability of its period setting — the turn of the century never looked so bland.Performances add little life to the landscape. Daniel Radcliffe manages not to embarrass himself, and that's being generous. Frankly, it's tough to buy the Hogwarts alum as a dad when he's been playing a teenager for ten years. It's equally tough to imagine him a widower, as he broods with all the emotional turmoil of an Olsen twin. Ciarán Hinds plays Kipps' sole confidant in the haunted hamlet, and fittingly enough, delivers the film's sole compelling performance. Still, his character never goes anywhere, a waste of Hinds' talent.Effective horror is contingent upon a willingness to take the audience outside its comfort zone, and The Woman in Black is too creakily formulaic to creep us out. Because Hollywood is a business, it's more desirable to greenlight a derivative script and hire a yes-man director than to risk something edgier that might not pay off. The cycle continues. The Woman in Black follows that recipe to a T, but there's something lost in translation. Maybe the recipe wasn't all that good to begin with. Maybe the whole cookbook needs to go.",4,18,32,3 February 2012
Toy Story 3," Sweet Sorrow
","Great. Another funny and heartfelt animated adventure from Pixar. Throw it on the pile. All sarcasm aside, 'Toy Story 3' is the latest brilliant release from a studio whose creative Gatling gun has yet to fire a blank. Maybe not every cinematic shot they've taken has been a dead-center bullseye, but everything they touch falls somewhere on the gradient of good to great, which with eleven films under their belt, is certifiably ludicrous.And since Pixar debuted its first feature, the original 'Toy Story,' in 1995, its storytellers and artists have not only refined and mastered their craft, but they've done so without failing or having to repeat themselves. Sure, Disney forced their collective hand four years later into doing the follow-up, 'Toy Story 2,' but now over a decade later, the studio is dropping its first voluntary sequel.Maybe because 'Toy Story' was such an important part of my childhood, and probably because I grew a lot in the four years separating it from its successor, I never shared the fondness I had for the first film with the second. That likely accounts for the pre-release uncertainty I felt towards this newest installment; I didn't want to risk the disappointment of another fun but frivolous caper. Fortunately, 'Toy Story 3' almost immediately dispelled my doubts. It combines the rock- solid dramatic core of the studio's recent work with the classic atmosphere of adventure and clever comedy the two prior 'Stories' are known for. It's a match made in heaven, and though 'Toy Story 3' feels slightly redundant of part two at its foundation, the added emotional weight of the toys' uncertainty that they even have a caring home to return to raises the stakes considerably.Part three also benefits from feeling more intimate, and consequently, more focused than the trilogy's middle chapter. 'Toy Story 2' was an addition to 'Toy Story' in every respect; new protagonists, and more action at a larger scale. 'Toy Story 3' begins by stripping away many of the series' established plastic personages because their owner, Andy (who has aged almost in real time between the releases of the three films), is preparing for college and has outgrown them. The cast is comprised of the best of the best (and Jesse, but whatever), though the narrative focuses squarely on Woody.As such, not all of the toys' stories reach individually satisfying ends, but as a unit their curtain call is bittersweet and touching. It is, after all, a film about growing and letting go, a more melancholy motif than some might expect, though Pixar has famously refused to shy away from so-called 'darker' themes. What's genuinely surprising is that the studio made the third 'Toy Story' film a vehicle for that ideal set. It's a thread that finds the gang donated to a local daycare (which eventually becomes a prison-break scenario), and making one last trip home.Really, when the worst thing you can say about a film is that a few of its jokes fall flat, you likely have something pretty special on your hands. That 'Toy Story 3' also concludes a trilogy in such fine form makes it all the more a standout. With it, Pixar have proved once again their unrivaled integrity as a production house not only capable of creating compelling stories, but of franchising those stories in a way that respects and complements the original work. 'Toy Story 3' is arguably the best of the lot.In the coming years, Pixar has at least two more sequels planned, first for 'Cars' in 2011, and then for 'Monsters Inc.' the following year. If it was ever a concern that the studio was creatively stalling or financially motivated to revisit its established worlds, 'Toy Story 3' should put those fears to rest. In fact, we better make more room in the pile.",9,2,3,22 June 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," 'Fantastic Mr. Fox'
","Wes Anderson's 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a different breed of animated film. It bares a disarming emotional maturity coupled with a sweetly mischievous cartoony vitality that both renews my faith in Anderson as a director and reaffirms 2009 as a hell of a year for animation.Things were admittedly getting rocky between the indie auteur and I. 'The Royal Tenenbaums,' the perfect nexus of Anderson's flamboyant cinematic technique, borderline obsessive-compulsive art direction, and satirically bourgeois humor, was proceeded by two films with all the technical and artistic flare of his best work, though his families of dryly depressive characters, often portrayed by a stock catalogue of recycled actors, began feeling increasingly redundant and masturbatory. His follow-up to 'Tenenbaums' was 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,' a puzzlingly defended film distinguished by breathtaking visuals, smarmy caricatures, and unrepentant vacuity. 2007's 'Darjeeling Limited' surpassed that film in substance, but Anderson still felt like he was running on fumes, incapable of a single wholly original character or relationship. For his grandiose symmetrical photography and audacious camera-work, the guy could be a dead ringer for Kubrick if his stories were up to snuff. Anderson needed a change, and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is everything he and his audience could have hoped for.It's not just that the film revels in gorgeous traditional stop-motion claymation, rich with its tactile textures and charmingly rippling fur, or the magnanimity of the miniature set-pieces, or backdrops lit with the deep auburns and siennas of perpetual sunset. 'Mr. Fox' has a story, and a pretty good one at that, courtesy children's author Roald Dahl, adapted for the screen by Anderson and Noah Baumbach. The director's meticulous perfectionism actually feels more at home in the world of animation, which from inception presents the heightened reality he strives for. The dolly shots and intricate sets suddenly service the storytelling rather than primp Anderson's aggressive showmanship.But contrary to what the exuberant color palette and genial clay critters might suggest, 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is not really a film geared to young children, though they'll no doubt appreciate it for the animalistic silliness and amiable pace. Rather it's the subtext, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his midlife crisis, which will resonate most with adults. The film has a surprising amount to say about our own animal nature through the anthropomorphizing of its critters, who will frequently drop their civilized countenances to hiss or snarl or gobble down food, but which somehow makes them feel all the more relatable.Case in point, Mr. Fox gives up his danger-prone life of killing chickens to raise a family (taking up a more pedestrian gig in the field of--gag!--journalism), but finds himself drawn back to his life's modus operandi for 'one last big score.' Dahl and Anderson are not afraid to portray unpleasantness, nor do they gloss over the fact that Mr. Fox does some not- especially-nice things to the birds he catches. The film never talks down to a potentially younger audience, and the difference is immediately refreshing when compared to children's films that are merely content to cast nasty creatures as pleasant surrogate humans.'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the deepest animated movie of the year, and I think the best, if only by a hair. 'The Princess and the Frog' is a serious contender as well, though being a fairy tale, it often doesn't pack the punch or offer the rewarding surprises Wes Anderson's film does. It actually shares more in common with Spike Jonze's 'Where the Wild Things Are' than this year's Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks efforts. 'Mr. Fox' is more effortlessly charming and poignant that that commendable film, and holds its own among the year's best live action as well. It's a film that pairs adventure with a markedly fresh family drama, tenderness and love with the unpredictable and the untamed.In short, it's a wild animal.",9,0,1,6 April 2010
RED," Reclining Extremely Disappointed
","'Red' is bland. Jilting its vibrant namesake, director Robert Schwentke's pallid comic book movie is about as exciting as a grayscale rainbow. It's a self-celebratory slog and one of the longest hour and fifty minutes I've spent at the movies this year. In my defense, its trailer was a calculated work of CIA-level deception—each moment is expertly chosen to give false impression that the whole is mindless fun. But mindless fun is only half right.There's next to nothing to say about a film this unremittingly boring. I'd stop just short of calling it a failure, but the most incredible thing about 'Red' is that such a lackluster script attracted such high-profile talent.The cast, including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Mary Louis-Parker, along with Karl Urban, Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, speaks for itself. That's part of the problem. 'Red' relies too heavily on big names to make the material pop rather than directly addressing the many problems with its confusing, amorphous screenplay. Surely it seemed like a pretty safe conclusion—I'm as surprised as anyone that a film this stacked could be so completely devoid of personality.Then there's the not-so-insignificant fact that our leading man is the most uninteresting person in the entire film. Black ops superhero Frank Moses never lives up to his reputation— pity Willis doesn't supply his own. His character is meant to be a 'romantic' at heart, but his relationship with dopey civilian Sarah Ross is just as unconvincing. Moses isn't a compelling protagonist—and he's shown up repeatedly. First by Malkovich as an LSD-warped CIA retiree, but also by Freeman, who is in the film for maybe a combined ten minutes.I'm not gunning for Bruce, though. 'Red' is an amalgam of creative failures in which his is the very least offensive. It was never going to be a great film given the inept writing of Jon and Erich Hoeber, though under Schwentke's direction it isn't even passable. He attempts to pawn 'Red' off as disposable entertainment, but reneges on the 'entertainment' part. It's the type of movie that squeaks by on a slow weekend, but would have been justly ignored had it been released three months ago.Even its music is egregious. Not since Soderbergh's 'The Informant!' has a film been so tonally altered through soundtrack and score. Composer Christophe Beck imbues each languid scene with a false sense of energy—be it bouncy, comedic accompaniment or nondescript action orchestral—but he fails to make a case for them. In fact, his music underscores the dichotomy between sound and sight; he makes us acutely aware of what we should be feeling, but aren't.Collectively, 'Red' is one massive miscalculation: criminally overlong and underwhelming given the caliber of talent on hand. There's no reason why this shouldn't have offered the same breezy fun as 'The Losers' and 'Knight and Day' did earlier this year, flawed though they were. Schwentke attempts to mend a Humpty Dumpty script by infusing it with style and enunciating its humor, but the former comes off as gimmicky and the latter is a series of embarrassing air balls. Joke upon joke was met with stifling silence from the crowd.'Red' is one of the most colorless films in recent memory. In it, the acronym 'R-E-D' stands for 'Retired; Extremely Dangerous,' but I've come up with an abbreviation that far better describes the experience: 'Reclining; Extremely Disappointed.'",4,10,18,25 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Deathly Hollow: Part 2
","'It all ends.' So reads the succinct tagline for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Capping a decade and eight blockbuster adaptations, Warner Bros. and director David Yates have finally put the franchise to bed. This is Potter's final hour, but is it also his finest?Depends on who you ask. It's a criticism J.K. Rowling superfans may never understand since the Potter films are tailored to them, but the franchise is neigh impenetrable to the layman. Creative sovereignty is secondary to providing a faithful if mechanical visual companion to the source. Consequently, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 isn't even half a story. There's no beginning or middle — the entirety of the two plus hour runtime is one drawn-out ending.Often that's an exciting feeling. Deathly Hallows' upbeat action sequences outpace many of its predecessors' — a magical bank heist and a Peter-Jackson-sized skirmish at Hogwarts Castle broaden the scope of the series. Others disappoint. What should be the climactic culmination of a 20-hour epic arrives without the exhilarating catharsis its audience deserves. Standing at 10 paces, Harry and his nemesis cross wands, sans emotional stakes. The archrivals spar simply because they're destined to, and the outcome will surprise no one.Sandwiched between action and more action are dense expository scenes. When we last left Harry, he was hunting horcruxes ('Pieces of Voldemort's soul,' he helpfully reminds us). With three of the elusive artifacts still left to unearth, he, Ron, and Hermione have plenty of scrounging to do before their much-advertised and inevitably underwhelming confrontation with the dark lord. The way that series screenwriter Steve Kloves artlessly espouses these crucial bits of info is telling — he could care less whether we follow him because he's following a blueprint.Still, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is superior to its predecessor if only because it contains the bulk of the book's action and the characters' overdue closure. There is likewise little fluff, especially compared to the middling middle Potter flicks — but at least Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire didn't ask anyone to cough up extra to see the ending.Dividing Deathly Hallows into two films was a brilliant marketing strategy, but one bereft of creative merit. All of the Potter films suffer to an extent from their unwillingness to embrace a fundamentally different storytelling medium, hoping instead to appease fans by cramming in as much exacting detail as will fit. And that's fine if you view the two billion dollar movie franchise as a visual supplement to the novels, but their standalone worth is negligible.Hollywood's Potters do a good job of making flesh Rowling's beloved characters and their ever-evolving universe. Removed from the cultural phenomenon of her writing however, they are shallow, mediocre fantasy films cluttered with unnecessary detail. Some would utter an unforgivable curse at this suggestion, but Harry Potter would have made a better trilogy — there, I said it. I just hope you witches and wizards appreciate the irony of burning a Muggle like me at the stake.Much of the positivity toward Harry Potter can be traced directly back to J.K. Rowling's writing from the generation that grew up reading it. None of the adaptations are bad enough to undo the goodwill she accumulated, but none of them stands independently either. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 stumbles with the right idea — to send the franchise out with a bang — and it does rank among the more enjoyable installments for sheer leanness. Whether or not it's Potter's finest hour is irrelevant; when it all ends, the films are only secondary.",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
50_50," Drama, Comedy Split 50/50
","50/50 is the anti-MOW. Hot off the festival circuit as the much buzzed-about 'cancer comedy,' its hype doesn't tell the whole story. Directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness), 50/50 is a dynamic blend of offhand humor and compelling character study. Just don't go in expecting one or the other.Loosely based on his own experiences as a twenty-something cancer survivor, screenwriter Will Reiser assembles a flawed cast of characters for his retelling – himself most of all. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is not a take-charge kind of guy. He greets his diagnosis with cynicism and reclusiveness, and at his age who can blame him? Holding his life at arm's length, he severs ties rather than strengthening them.It's a notion that Levine actually undercuts. Whether it's his direction or just the conventions of a hero-narrative, Adam frequently comes off better than he deserves to. His cancer gives him carte blanche to abuse and ignore his friends and family, and it's important that those unflattering traits get their due. The cathartic climax is about tearing down those walls.Levine is more forthcoming with the foibles of other characters. Seth Rogen plays Adam's pal Kyle, a predictably crass and outgoing foil to Gordon-Levitt's narcissistic introvert. Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes away looking particularly ugly, and is admonished by Kyle in one of 50/50's funniest scenes. Anjelica Huston and Anna Kendrick play Adam's overprotective mother and fledgling therapist, respectively, and Philip Baker Hall makes an appearance as a fellow cancer patient with an affinity for pot.Rounding out the cast is Serge Houde as Adam's Alzheimer's-afflicted father. Unlike Adam however, his condition seems superfluous, occasionally lending 50/50 the maudlin air of an issue film. Which is odd, because elsewhere the filmmakers strive to remove sentimentality from the equation. In fact, the nitty-gritty of Adam's treatment is relegated almost entirely to off-screen action. The film focuses instead on the impact it has on his life. Consequently, and in the interest of levity, the threat is diluted.In that respect, 50/50 isn't even about cancer. The common storytelling mistake, as Reiser sees it, is treating the disease as subject; Reiser's subject is himself. Cancer is just the shitty thing that happened to him. The film begins like any other buddy comedy, and initially feels stilted because of it. Even the obligatory reveal and diagnosis of the disease comes across awkward. But it gradually builds into something significant.The beauty of 50/50 is in the way its characters behave and bounce off each other. There's no bromance a la I Love You, Man – the friendship portrayed by Gordon-Levitt and Rogen is subtler. Adam's eventual turn from reticence to reliance makes his transformation as a character more compelling than his struggle with cancer. After all, it's not about that.I don't envy the marketing team tasked with selling 50/50 to the general audience. Cancer isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser, but you can't bill it as a comedy without being at least a little disingenuous. Resier and Levine's film delivers a unique hybrid of emotion and entertainment that tries, not always successfully, to pave new territory – which is admirable in and of itself. Whether 50/50 is remembered more as a cavalier drama or dark comedy remains to be seen, but you can bet it won't go down in history as another after school special.",Null,3,6,30 September 2011
Get Him to the Greek," Poorly Structured; A Different 'Greek Theater' May Have Helped
","Until this past weekend, I'd never sat through a film as literally the only audience member. So that's new.Granted, it's been nearly a month since the initial release of 'Get Him to the Greek,' and admittedly, the screening was before noon on a Sunday, but it's an experience that couldn't help but enunciate exactly how often I wasn't laughing. The silences practically echoed.However, the scenario was hardly the film's sole detractor; the Apatow-produced comedy was, in many ways, the polar opposite of what I expected. From a structural standpoint, I anticipated there being a harder driving force; I thought the plot—Which sees Russell Brand reprising the role of debaucherous rocker Aldous Snow from 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'— would consist of a series of escalating outlandish and out-of-hand party sequences with the omnipresent ticking clock to keep it dramatically grounded.But if anything, 'Get Him to the Greek' is not only pointlessly cyclical in how it stacks its scenes, but cause and effect are tossed clear out the window. The gist of it is that the irresponsible Snow must be chaperoned (Cue Jonah Hill as record company intern Aaron Green) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles for an anniversary concert in 72 hours. Writer/director Nicholas Stoller sets up countless potential snags for Green, such as Snow forgetting his commitment altogether, and the duo running impossibly late for their flight, but renders nearly every plot device irrelevant within ten minutes of its introduction. There's no potential for suspense when resolution is always a few easy lines of dialogue or a scene transition away.'Will he make it?' should be the audience's imperative question, and I mean, of course he will, but it's like Stoller isn't even trying to make us squirm. Then again, his script is so heavy with missed opportunity that frustration and boredom may produce the identical effect.And just when his story should be roaring to a climax, it all but sputters out. Our heroes make it to LA with time to spare, which they then spend mending spats with their significant others—A transparent and lazy attempt at adding depth to this lightheaded farce. It allows Snow to have his obligatory existential crisis before the show—Only to be reaffirmed by Green, acting for the first time, as a friend.This has grazed into spoiler territory, I guess, so let me pitch you a better ending while we're here. After much trial and tribulation, Snow and Green arrive at the venue with moments to spare. The lights are down; Snow steps on stage and belts out the first song. He is met with the rousing applause of just a few hundred fans. Reality check. Now he can have his existential crisis. In finally coming to terms with his diminishing career, his friendship with Green is made all the more poignant, and his comeback single (which the film already goes out on) is all the more triumphant.It's not hard to rewrite a film that so narrowly jukes its own potential. I sought out 'Get Him to the Greek,' even four weeks late, because I was sold on the trailer. The premise is strong, and the Brand/Hill combo under the Apatow umbrella seemed like a sure thing. The bottom line is it's not all that funny; but even more disappointingly, its narrative backbone is flimsy. If a great story had been locked in, and had I felt even momentarily unsure that he would be gotten to said Greek, those echoing silences might not have mattered.But when I'm not invested in the story, and I'm not laughing, I become painfully aware that I'm the sole occupant of a silent two hundred seat theater.",4,9,20,29 June 2010
Fast Five," Cars, Muscles, and Muscle Cars
","Forgive my ignorance of the 'Fast and Furious' films. Believe it or not, this fifth installment is the first I've seen in its entirety. I could generally care less about car culture and only just learned how to change my own oil. The closest I come to drifting is in 'Mario Kart.' I am not the target audience. But as the producers have apparently exhausted street racing tropes, they've pimped the franchise out to the masses. Color me impressed, it actually works.'Fast Five' may be brainless action, but at least it's the type that revels in its own ridiculousness. The genre has lately fallen into a self-serious slump, teeming with stern- faced heroes who don't enjoy saving the world one bit. Conversely and to all appearances, Vin Diesel and company couldn't be having a better time tearing up the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Sometimes a fast car and a toothy grin is all you need.Director Justin Lin obviously appreciates the simple and satisfying marriage of physical stunt work and compelling cinematography. Granted, it's no master's course in action filmmaking, but his use of the camera to transfer momentum is undeniably effective. Particularly impressive are his opening and closing chase sequences, in which he employs CGI sparingly in favor of real vehicles and visceral wrecks. Smartly favored in the trailer, 'Fast Five' is bookended by an hour of easy escapism.The problem is everything in between. No one was expecting Shakespeare, but Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan should have at least dog-eared the bit about brevity being the soul of wit. At two hours 10 minutes, 'Fast Five' is longer than it has any earthly business being. The bloated running time allows for some presumably obligatory street races and more tiresome exposition than you can shake a stick shift at.Hours seem to wither away in a dimly lit garage where story beats are spoon-fed to the audience. Get on with it; 'Fast Five' is a 'one last job' heist film with few surprises. Whole swaths of the story could be cut—they exist solely to justify more drag races, fistfights, and shootouts. Morgan also relies on cheap, microwavable drama in his peripheral storytelling: an unexpected pregnancy and leftfield romances add little depth to the proceedings. Having his characters emote plays to nobody's strengths.Thankfully, the charisma of the cast buoys any less than Oscar-worthy performances. Diesel comes off surprisingly empathetic as the muscle-bound mastermind of the hundred million dollar heist. Along the way, he spars with a gargantuan federal agent played by The Rock, and calls in help from a colorful cast of returning characters, including an ex-rival (Paul Walker), his sister (Jordana Brewster), a smooth-talker (Tyrese Gibson), and a safecracker (Ludacris).Despite its lulls, 'Fast Five' kicks the summer off right. With more judicious pacing, it might have been the perfect Saturday afternoon snack, but junk food necessitates a conservative serving size. Lin's overlong film is fortunately punctuated by the sort of tangible high-octane action that has become a rarity in the age of CGI superpowers and spell craft. Even if you're as unfamiliar with the franchise as I was yesterday, you'll likely find this fifth installment immediately accessible and intermittently fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with my 2001 automatic transmission Toyota Camry.",6,1,2,4 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Eclipse By the Numbers
","Hold on a second, what happened? Where am I? Suddenly, I've seen not one but two 'Twilight' films, and what's more, I actually have something positive to say about this one. Ahem —'Eclipse' is 100% better than 'New Moon,' a film I initially scored one star. Make of that what you will, mathematicians.Like many males, I'm an outsider on the Stephanie Meyer phenomenon. I haven't read her books, and I laugh derisively at the cardboard Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner chilling outside the local record store (though maybe I'm just jealous no one will pay $29.99 for a life sized stand-up of me). Regardless, last November I decided to give the series a chance to win me over. It did not.However, the improvements this third installment wields over its predecessor are immediately apparent. For starters, Chris Weiz, who directed 'New Moon,' along with the equally contemptible adaptation of Philip Pullman's 'The Golden Compass,' abdicated the director's chair to David Slade, helmer of 'Hard Candy' and '30 Days of Night.' Slade seems an unusual choice, and one, I can only assume, was made with the intention of casting the 'Twilight' net clear across the gender gap, coaxing more teenage menfolk into the seats by way of grittier, more competent action. Also, more of it.Still, 'Eclipse' is anything but action-packed, and most of the time it feels as if the script is working against that goal. Slade can class up the werewolf on vampire (on vampire) scuffles till the bats come home, but nothing can change the fact that his film is founded on one of the most unnecessarily redundant screenplays in cinematic history. In fact, so little happens in either of the latter two 'Twilight' films that most of 'New Moon' could be stricken from the series, and would be better for it.But instead, we've got star-crossed lovers Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) picking up precisely where they left off, or maybe even earlier. To summarize: Bella wants to be a vampire; Edwards wants to be married—You'd think they'd reach common ground at the 'eternity' part. But while their apparently passionate relationship is at loggerheads, Jacob T. Wolf (Lautner) is determined to thwart the union and win over Bella, who seems more uncertain than ever which monster man she's more interested in.And that's the big problem with Bella Swan. She's portrayed as supremely desirable—Despite her conspicuous lack of personality. She's billed as a hero, but is largely incapable of enacting change on her surroundings. She is disingenuous with both of her would-be supernatural suitors, and is childish, arrogant, and hypocritical. Edward, Jacob, listen carefully... YOU'RE BOTH TOO GOOD FOR HER.But in the escalating farce of their one-upsmanship for her love (with feats that range everywhere from charming to psychopathic), Jacob literally carries her into one of the worst romantic plot devices of all time:You see, there are these other vampires. Bad ones, like the kind from every other vampire book. They want to kill Bella for something or something, so she must be spirited away to the safety of a mountain cliff (????). The vampires can, I guess, smell other vampires but not werewolves, but they can also smell Bella. So she can't go to the top of the mountain alone, which again, is the most logical place to hide (????), and Edward is powerless to help Obviously, the only viable option is for her to be carried there—By none other than an extremely shirtless Jacob. Let me tell ya, Washington state's never been so hot!Plus, once there, Bella, Jake, and Eddie all spend the night in a tent together (even though we're led to believe she only needs to be hidden for the duration of a battle that won't occur until the following morning). Despite the fact that everyone knew they would be camping on the peak of a snow-covered mountain, Bella is under-insulated and freezing in the middle the night. What can Edward, with his cold vampire's blood, possibly do except allow the hot- blooded Jacob to cuddle his fiancé back to warmth?The transparency of every motive is proof that no matter how far the film-making in the franchise comes, the quality of the stories remains along a single horizontal plane with a whole lot of headroom. Slade brings the series another step closer to credibility, but based solely on the adaptations (which I know some of the novels' fans have shunned), 'Twilight' is adolescent drivel, a projected paperback romance lost at a costume party—And this brainless two hour third attempt is too much mash, not enough monster.Never mind the mathematics. The numbers are in, and any way you spin them, 'Eclipse' is an improvement—Pity it's still a net loss.",4,7,9,14 July 2010
Moon," 'Moon'
","Helium-3 provides something like seventy percent of the Earth's energy, and Lunar Industries has a corner on the market. Their profit margins must be huge too, since overseeing the mining operation on the moon's surface is apparently a one man job. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who's coming into the home stretch of a three-year haul when he starts to feel physically and mentally unwell. His condition is only compounded when he discovers the body of a man bearing him more than considerable resemblance outside the station.'Moon' is an earnest, almost postmodern science fiction film with good intentions and some great ideas. Director Duncan Jones' story is thoughtful but not dense, and though he occasionally stumbles in translating his ideas to the screen, he's crafted a compelling anti- blockbuster worth the price of admission.The world of 'Moon' is largely homage, lovingly cobbled together from shards of sci-fi greats. GERTY, Bell's robot assistant (voiced by Kevin Spacey in an uncommonly quiet performance), is HAL 9000 by way of emoticons. Bell's hallucinations recall Tarkovsky's 'Solaris,' and the sets fall somewhere between 'Star Wars' and Ridley Scott's 'Alien.' Everything has an appropriate matte sheen to it that pleasingly disregards the recent SFX trend to over-shine. Though there are a few effects shots in the film, including one that almost perfectly recreates Dave's psychedelic voyage at the end of Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey,' the exterior moon sequences were shot using models, and the film's aesthetic feels all the more consistent for it.The greatest flaw of 'Moon' is not necessarily its early plot twist, but rather the way it knowingly strings the audience along in another direction beforehand. The film travels the comfortable path cut by so many established science fiction films that when it swerves off- road, the viewer is uncomfortably jarred. Jones is a little dishonest in depicting Sam's plight, and so the moment of revelation is met with distrust instead of the desired, 'Ah ha!' It's only a brief detour, however, and once the cards are on the table and the plot continues to unfold, all is more or less forgiven.That's really the worst of it, suffice it to say 'Moon' is never particularly challenging. It might be because the film deals in so many degrees of familiarity, or because the Bells' scenario, when revealed, plays out relatively without incident. It's a subtle shade of good, though doesn't take us where truly great science fiction does: where no man has gone before. Jones has a lot going for him, and Rockwell easily carries the film, playing his part(s?) expertly. The cinematography is fluid and unobtrusive, and yet 'Moon' is somehow less than excellent.'Moon' sounds incredible on the page, and occasionally is on screen, but mostly settles for offbeat and interesting, which is still a welcome alternative to pseudo sci-fi garbage like 'Terminator: Salvation' or 'Transformers 2.' It's an interesting companion piece to 'Star Trek,' which was equally successful on the other end of the action spectrum, if a bit riskier in concept for a mainstream popcorn movie. Jones' film is an enjoyable but ultimately safe take on the genre that pays off to an extent, but will leave those hoping for mind-expanding science fiction revelry wanting.",7,1,7,6 April 2010
The Runaways," 'The Runaways'
","'The Runaways' isn't much of a film, but it has so much damn style that it's hard not to be intermittently enthused by music video director Floria Sigismondi's music video of a movie. Her chipper cutting and blisteringly upbeat Joan Jett/Runaways soundtrack makes, on one hand, for spontaneous and thrilling tour sequences, which on the other, emphasize how hopelessly average the narrative around them is. Sigismondi has worked with the likes of Sheryl Crow and David Bowie, and understands the symbiotic relationship between sound and image—The problem is that when the film rolls sans tunage, she can't quite find the rhythm.I suppose she didn't have the best script to work with, and as she's also credited with the adaptation of Cherie Currie's book, I'm inclined to blame conservative manipulation of fact in her writing before her direction. Knowing literally nothing about the Runaways as a band going in, I couldn't care less if 'That's how it happened.' In truth, I found their rise to superstardom in the first act of the film fortuitous to the point of contrivance.The truth may be stranger than fiction, but watching characters I met ten minutes ago immediately succeed isn't endearing, it's alienating, especially in proximity to yet another groaningly caricatural cinematic businessman. You've got Giovanni Ribisi in 'Avatar,' Jon Bernthal in 'The Ghost Writer,' and now Michael Shannon in 'The Runaways,' all in the span of, what, four months? Hollywood, I get it. Corporate guys are weasels. Even your corporate guys. With the omission of Jeremy Piven, I just don't find it funny or compelling anymore. It's cheap, lazy character writing.But Shannon's performance in 'The Runaways' is a minor gripe compared with its overall insubstantiality. The band biopic is nothing new, and while I commend Sigismondi for not watering down the sex, drugs, and rock and roll to cater to the sort of PG-13 audience that would eat up anything Kristen Stewart is doing by peripheral association, her film is still intellectually immature and fundamentally broken.For starters, Stewart as Joan Jett has every reason to be our protagonist except a book deal. Cherie's got a louse of a father, a strained relationship with her sister, and a burgeoning singing career complete with a trendy drug habit. Really, movie? The 'price of fame' angle? Give me a break. The family stuff should carry weight, and doesn't, because the bulk of the film is bubblegum, which I'm perfectly content to chew. Just don't tell me it's a three-course meal.'The Runaways' is overlong. Its second half, which sinks into the band's inevitable downturn of fortune, comes to a screeching halt to flesh out story bits that I didn't care about to begin with. Sing that 'Cherry Bomb' song again.The problem is there's no reason to care, and entertainment value alone doesn't cover for the obviously weak story. And if the story is weak, as I suspect it is, because it's based nearly to the T on the honest to God truth, then with all due respect, it doesn't make for great cinema as is. Aspiring biopic writers, here's a tip: lie a little.It's ultimately character that begets emotional gravity, not an event itself. Pill popping, drunkard dads, and band infighting don't amount to a hill of beans unless I really care about who those people are.Sigismondi's film is strung up on the rack and pulled from both ends until its neither frenetic rock pic nor indie coming of age story, which is a shame, because the former is executed so well. When the music stops, it's all too clear that as far as drama goes, 'The Runaways' is an absentee.",5,4,14,6 April 2010
The Social Network," With Friends Like These...
","The genius of 'The Social Network' begins with the story that inspired it. The tagline on its poster, 'You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies,' perfectly conveys the inherent dramatic irony; royal narcissist Mark Zuckerberg is today the champion of the web's most popular socialization tool, Facebook.It's rich soil for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who imbues the material with his signature wit and a searing theatricality. Frankly, I'm not concerned with what small liberties his brilliant script took along the way—Not that even the most obscene inaccuracy could stymie the momentum he builds. The film is guiltier of embellishment than falsification, a crime for which he and director David Fincher should be awarded our highest praise. Fincher knocks this one out of the park with confident cinematography, nuanced performances from his cast, and layered storytelling that lends the film its surprising depth. On its surface, 'The Social Network' is funny, brisk, and compelling, but underneath, it's near rotting with angst. Its moodiness and purposeful visual melodrama are its most unique assets. Fincher approaches the story from the position of Zuckerberg himself, striving for the honest emotional experience of each scene, with all the grandiosity of a nineteen year old's perspective. To the layman, that means he finds a way to make sitting at a computer, or having a conversation in a crowded nightclub seem invigorating and fresh.'The Social Network' is immediately in contention as his best film, but as much as Fincher brings to it, the lion's share of the Mark Zuckerberg experience is etched in the long, perpetually unsmiling face of Jesse Eisenberg, who portrays him in the film. Eisenberg has a history of taking on lighter roles in comedies like 'Zombieland' that has prompted some to unfairly label him 'the poor man's Michael Cera,' (though the comments seem to stem from Cera bashers themselves—There's no pleasing those guys). Eisenberg's turn here should slap the cynicism from any remaining doubters' mouths. He owns the role; the callous calculation, the condescending sense of humor, and the introverted inner pain are expertly realized, and yet the true testament to Eisenberg is that Zuckerberg at his worst is a character impossible to truly hate.And Eisenberg is matched by a cast of equal talent; Andrew Garfield plays Facebook's co- founder, Eduardo Saverin, and Armie Hammer plays both of the Winklevoss twins, who together bring suit against Mark for intelligent property theft. The beauty of each character is that despite their muckraking in the deposition room, which acts as a framing device in 'The Social Network,' none ultimately feels like the antagonist. As with the best cinematic scuffles, we identify with both sides.But as beautifully as the stars aligned for what is insofar the best film of 2010, 'The Social Network' is somehow more than the sum of its parts. Its underlying themes of capitalist corrosion and the price of success are made all the more poignant given the age of its participants. Fincher has jokingly referred to the film as 'The Citizen Kane on John Hughes movies,' but he honestly isn't far off. Young love, rebelliousness, arrogance, and burgeoning identity play major roles in shaping the behavior of Sorkin's characters.And yet, for all their bitterness and hostility, 'The Social Network' is still an exciting, encouraging film. Somewhere beneath the veneer, alongside the greased cogs in its innermost workings, the power of Mark's idea gestates. Facebook, as silly and as trivial a subject as it may seem, is for many an essential communicative hub in their day-to-day lives. Watching Zuckerberg succeed beyond his wildest dreams, literally bringing strangers together while pushing his friends away, paints an oddly optimistic portrait.The future for the internet generation seems bright in Fincher's mind. Even as we make the gradual shift to living our lives electronically, even when we're polluted by a consumer culture, and even when we lose sight of our humanity, some kid can still change the world.",10,2,4,1 October 2010
The Fighter," A Fighting Chance
","It's easy to take a film like David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' for granted around award season. It's minus the panache of the year's other heavy hitters, and fills a comfortable 'sports drama' niche. O. Russell's film may very well be among the ten best picture nominations announced next month, but it doesn't have a shot at the title—which is a shame, because it earns greatness in its own right.'The Fighter' isn't the best film of the year, but it features some of the best characters and performances of the year, wrapped in a familiar but accessible underdog story with plenty of fresh hooks. Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale as boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward's crack-addicted brother, and rightly so. Even among so talented an ensemble, Bale shines in his transformative turn, once again whittling himself down to little more than a human wireframe.Bale probably receives too much credit for his wild weight swings, which have the tendency to upstage merely passable performances, but his talent as showcased in 'The Fighter' is incontrovertible. This is best Bale has ever been, juggling pathos with a sense of humor I presumed lost after 'American Psycho.' If 'The Fighter' takes home one award, it'll have Christian Bale's name on it.Bale is so vibrant in his role that it's easy to forget to mention the strength of the rest of the cast; Mark Wahlberg contributes his best performance in years under O. Russell, whom he's collaborated with before on 'Three Kings' and 'I Heart Huckabees.' As an artist, Wahlberg may be guilty of poor taste more than anything else, as he has consistently proved more than capable a performer in the right hands. The same boyish naivety that made him a perfect fit for P.T. Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' shines through in 'The Fighter,' which along with his physical formidability make him both believable and easy to get behind.If I have a gripe about the casting, Amy Adams might actually be a bit too attractive as Ward's love interest—a small town bartender and college dropout—but her performance sells it. Also fine are Ward's destructive family, including Melissa Leo as the totalitarian matriarch, who's followed in tow by a gaggle of her fiercely protective daughters, and Jack McGee as the working-class dad who seems consistently out of his element among all the aggressive estrogen.'The Fighter' is a terrifically acted film, but its real strength comes from the way its characters drive the story. Much of the drama comes from Ward's poisonous relationship with his mother and brother (his manager and trainer, respectively), and his having to break free of their manipulation and neglect is a decidedly unorthodox angle for a sports flick. Those relationships motivate the narrative, and the result is a drama that runs like clockwork. 'The Fighter' is engrossing, unpretentious, and an immaculate crowd-pleaser.O. Russell and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema ('Let the Right One In') deserve recognition as well for giving the film its distinctive visual flair. Of particular interest is the style and method by which the pair chose to shoot their fight sequences, which achieve some of the best faux-broadcast mimicry I've ever seen. The effect is initially so convincing that I assumed actual footage had been integrated from Ward's fights—until Wahlberg stepped into the ring. From there, the camera-work is kept tight and effect is satisfying and visceral.Buzz films like 'Black Swan' and '127 Hours' will likely dominate much of the awards dialogue in the coming months, but 'The Fighter' deserves a fair shake as well. Unlike last year's condescending 'Blindside,' David O. Russell's sports drama isn't exploitative, nor is it only receiving praise in the context of its Oscar-caliber performances. 'The Fighter' is absolutely worth seeing, and not just for Christian Bale. It could be a contender.",8,2,2,20 December 2010
Up in the Air," 'Up in the Air'
","The problem with films hyped as award vehicles is that you watch them differently. I didn't have the opportunity to see Jason Reitman's 'Up in the Air' on the festival circuit, so my interpretation comes pre-masticated by critics who heralded it as the film to beat come Oscar season. Those accounts peeled back the layers of genuine surprise I might have felt in the theater, warping the profound into the expected, and left me with the pit. Forgive me if I'm playing catch-up.It's not that Reitman's third film, following 'Thank You for Smoking' and 'Juno,' is outright disappointing. On the contrary, 'Up in the Air' has vivid characters, fine performances, and a timely, good-humored recession-oriented story. In short, I agree with most of the praise the film has garnered, so why do I have this inclination to shrug it off as merely 'good?' I think because it simply failed to surprise me. So in the interest of salvaging the opinions of future viewers, I intend to part with as few hard details as can be spared in the following paragraphs. I hope for this analysis to be the perfect mediation between your expectations and what is often a frank and charming, if formulaic, comedy.The pieces are all in place. You know what to expect from a George Clooney performance, and with 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' still playing theatrically, you needn't look far if not. He plays Ryan Bingham, a jet-setting corporate lay-off guru whose cherished lifestyle is threatened when an overeager young businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) devises a revolutionary video-conferencing system that will allow Bingham to work from the last place he would ever want to--home. The screenplay presents a straightforward, nearly transparent story, which is fortunately vitalized by the likes of Clooney and his love interest (Vera Farmiga), under the amiable sway of Reitman's direction. The narrative rigidity jiggers with the pacing later on the film, however, with false endings and climaxes that betray the structure of the rest of it. But unlike the Coens' 'A Serious Man,' which easily shoulders a jackknife narrative that keeps its audience entertained and guessing, 'Up in the Air' doesn't feel like a deliberate build, it feels, maybe appropriately, lost.Regardless, to harp only on its structural shortcomings is to ignore the film's most important aspect: its timeliness. As a cinematic snapshot of 2009, nothing else really comes close, and that's a big reason why it's a front-runner on so many best-of lists, my own (probably) included. What does it mean to lose your job? What does it mean when the guy who told you that you lost your job might lose his job? These are the themes scratching below the surface of 'Up in the Air,' but which unfortunately never penetrate in any immediately meaningful way. Rather, they render the film a shorthand for our recession, our attitudes, and our relationships now.Ironically, it gets to a point where I have to agree that this is the film to beat come Oscar season. I'd like to say that slathering it with superlatives on the merits of cultural relevance alone would be like giving 'Crash' an Oscar just for addressing racism. But oh, wait.It isn't just social context that makes 'Up in the Air' look like a best picture to-be. Like 2007's 'No Country for Old Men,' or 2008's 'Slumdog Millionaire,' Oscar will love Jason Reitman's latest because it's a safe, inoffensive choice. I'm gonna go ahead and call it. It's not as violent as 'Inglourious Basterds' or as contentedly anti-commercial as 'A Serious Man,' and though I would not be so pretentious as to suggest any of the above winners are unworthy of consideration in a discussion of great film (except 'Crash'), the important, polarizing masterpieces that challenge convention are rarely, if ever, afforded cinema's highest honor. It's the broad strokes of vague emotion and unanimous praise, however reserved, that means pay dirt.'Up in the Air' is a perfectly fine film, well above average, smartly cast, and consistently enjoyable. It never sticks more than a trembling finger outside of the box, but does well with an established formula in painting a postcard of America at its least assured.I wouldn't call it a great film, but it's a significant one, and one I fully expect to hear read aloud this coming March 7th. But then again, it has one last chance to surprise me.",8,1,2,6 April 2010
