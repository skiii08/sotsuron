Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A multi-layered and fun first act of a growing space opera.
","Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is a ground-breaking, must-see film.  Whether or not you are a Star Wars fan, you will miss out on a great film experience if don't see it on the big screen.  In case you have heard critics bashing it for lacking certain dramatic elements, or hard-core fans bashing it for lacking the 'magic' of the originals, let's put it in perspective...Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is like the first act of an eventual six-part work of art.  Many critics seem to have overlooked this fact, and are quick to point out the shallowness of the characters and the lack of a smooth-flowing story.  It also contains one too many bathroom jokes, choppy editing, self-indulgent use of CGI, and somewhat annoying inconsistencies (for hard-core SW fans) with the previous Trilogy.  All bad points to be sure, by any film-goers standards.However, that is not what The Phantom Menace brings to the growing space-opera, or movies for that matter, as a whole.  In and of itself, TPM is an excellent setup, story-wise, for FIVE more chapters of a saga as well as an exciting and fun action film.  No film that I can think of, especially in the sci-fi/action genre has ever been able to pull off such a feat.True Star Wars fans will watch with first-timers a two-hour escape into a new universe.  We see the Galactic Republic brought to life in beautiful shots of Coruscant, Naboo, and even desolate Tatooine, shedding light on what Luke, Leia, and Han were fighting so hard to restore in chapters IV, V, and VI. Creatures buzz with life, even the overused Jar Jar Binks, and at times, it is difficult to tell what is real and what is not in this film. (95% of the movie is computer-enhanced imagery.)The audience is taken into a galaxy far, far away that has all-too down-to-Earth conflicts.  Greed and the lust for power _begins_ to threaten a peaceful galaxy defended by the Jedi.  I was particularly impressed by the acting out of this conflict by the new cast.  Liam Neeson plays Qui Gon Jinn, a maverick knight who discovers Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy who has superior talents.  It will be fascinating to see how this boy becomes the evil Darth Vader in parts II and III.  Natalie Portman brings a strong performance as Queen Amidala, and Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  On the Dark side, Ian McDiarmid plays a subtle and manipulative Senator Palpatine.  The ultimate scene stealer is Darth Maul, played by martial-artist Ray Park.  You will not be disappointed with this villain, even though he only has four lines!Without spoiling the film, I would have to say that the final forty minutes of TPM are more action packed, better-looking, and exciting than the climaxes of the original Trilogy.  While ROTJ had three sequences, Menace has four:  a ground battle for Naboo, a space battle that displays Anakin's abilities, a three-way lightsaber duel between the ultimate good (teamed-up Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan) versus the face of upcoming evil (Darth Maul), and a unique Queen-led mission to reclaim the throne.The film ends with everyone wanting more, much like when the curtain goes down on the first act of a fantastic play.  What will happen as the events of acts II and III unfold?  Go into Episode I with this frame of mind, and admire what a truly clever and entertaining movie it is.",9,0,0,27 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Refreshingly charming, but frustrating (spoilers)
","Peter Jackson's _LOTR:TFOTR_ is mystifying, charming, and engaging, yet frustratingly lacking in character development, in establishment of setting, and in passage of time as the film progresses.  As a film fan, but not a Tolkien fan, I recommend it for the sheer scope and magic of the film, but definitely do not expect it to be the best movie ever made.  You will be taken to a different world and believe you are there, but you will also be left wondering what the heck is really going on with the characters. Luckily the themes of good versus evil, and how one should handle power are not lost among the jumpy plot and poor pacing. The good:  Art direction.  I found myself blown away by the fusion of New Zealand landscapes and CGI work.  The mines of Moria were incredibly 'realistic', and I felt so drawn into the movie in parts like Lothlorien that I forgot that I was in a theater.  The sound is excellent throughout, and every establishing shot is like a painting.  The acting is great and believable. The bad:  Pacing.  The first half of the movie drags and spends too much time with setting up things.  The Ringwraith chases seemed disjointed and somewhat pointless.  More of that time should have been spent exposing the real threat of the Ring's power.  Suddenly, we're in Rivendell, and voila! the fellowship is formed.  No backstory for Legolas, Gimli, or even Boromir, and as soon as the fellowship is formed, it seems to break up, weakening the drama.Still, this film is without a doubt the best of 2001, and may quite possibly be the best fantasy film ever made.  For comparison, it beats _The Phantom Menace_ in overall storytelling, and ultimately, the LOTR trilogy shows promise that it may surpass SW Episode's 1-3 in overall quality.",Null,0,0,28 December 2001
The Matrix," A Stylish, Thoughtful, Revolutionary Film
","_The Matrix_ isn't just a good-looking cyber-thriller.  It is also unique filmmaking.  The Wachowski brothers have invented a style of sci-fi/action that will change how directors tell stories and choose shots for years to come.  If anything, see this movie and be absolutely blown away by how perfectly it is put together.  It actually won four Academy Awards, and deservedly so!Much has been said about the story and symbolism of this movie.  The most important theme in the movie, in my opinion, is the idea that an individual's free mind can and should determine their reality rather than the oppressive, external forces that try to control it. 
Overall, the film maintains this idea without being boring.  The acting is surprisingly good, and the action sequences are original and dynamic.",Null,0,0,4 April 2000
