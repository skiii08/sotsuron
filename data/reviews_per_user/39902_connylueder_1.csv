Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The greatest Star-Wars-film I have ever seen!
",I have seen this film in cinema at least 7 times. This is my favorite Star-Wars-film of all 4 films. The story is great and the special effects are fantastic. The characters I liked most were 'Jar Jar Binks' 'Queen Amidala' and 'Darth Maul'. The fighting scenes are choreographed very good. Everyone who reads this go see the film!,10,0,1,27 January 2000
