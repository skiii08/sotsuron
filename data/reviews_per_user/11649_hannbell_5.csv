The New World," Really Enjoyed
","I'm watching The New World because I'm taking a history through film class in school. This was one of the movies we watched together as a class. The New World is a story about Pocahontas and the settlers in Jamestown. It focuses a lot on John Smith's and John Rolfe's relationship with Pocahontas. The film follows them through when they first met and all the trials and conflicts they had to face. We watch the settlers land on the American soil and their very first interactions with the Natives, or in this film, the 'Naturals'. It shows us John Smith's journey as he lives with the Naturals and learns their ways, then it shows us all his trials once he returns and is elected the new president of Jamestown. The film displays both the settlers views and the Naturals views to the new changes of America, it helps us get a perspective of both sides, the differences and similarities and their opinions of each other. 
The filming in this movie was really high quality. The filmmaker added different angles than what we are used to but it all flowed together very well. There was a lot of great editing and very good definition and it was obvious the film was made fairly recently. There was also a quite recognizable actor, Christian Bale, who we know to be quite famous in this era. 
Most people are educated on the story of Pocahontas and we know that some of the events in this story didn't quite line up with things we've heard before. For example we know that Pocahontas never sees John Smith again once he leaves. We also know that Pocahontas is a lot younger than she is portrayed in most of the films about her. Aside from the Disney version of Pocahontas, I've never seen a film about her or about Jamestown. However, I did get to visit Virginia this last summer and on our way to Williamsburg we got to see the exact spot the settlers landed and we were able to drive through the area Pocahontas and her tribe once lived. 
A few things I really liked about this film is that John Smith wasn't portrayed by the typical blonde guy, giving him darker hair made him seem tougher and gave him an image as if he's been through a lot. The filming used while displaying the Naturals normal ways was so serene and peaceful, I really enjoyed those certain shots, especially the ones shot of Pocahontas in the fields from time to time. There wasn't a whole lot of dialog in this film I noticed, but it is still fairly easy to follow the storyline and that was something I particularly enjoyed. One thing I didn't like, however, was the way they made it seem as if Pocahontas didn't really love John Rolfe and had no desire to marry him. It seemed as if she was just marrying him to please him, this may actually be the case but I would rather have her love the man she is marrying and sharing a child with.
This film was one I really enjoyed. I love history and watching it portrayed in a way such as this film makes it even more interesting because it shows us the perspective that other people have of the story. Although I liked it, I probably would not watch it again. It was quite long and not something that would be entertaining more than once. However, I would like to watch more films made by this director, he seems to have a good taste in what people like and there was a lot of aesthetic appeal to it.",8,1,1,3 September 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Stream South American Getaway on Spotify
","I really enjoyed watching this movie, it reminded me of the old cowboy shows that I used to watch with my grandpa. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is about a pair of friends who rob trains and banks with their gang of criminals. However, once they start to be followed by an unknown group they have to run away. Butch and Sundance separate from the gang and run to South America with Etta Place (Sundance's girlfriend) where they team up with a few people and rob banks until eventually they get caught and supposedly killed. We see them go though all the trials of living a life of crime during that time, but also how easy it was to get away with it. This movie was a good source of history for Utah and the infamous criminals that roamed around. My favorite part about this movie was the friendship that you could see between Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, they really were best friends, at least portrayed in this film. I didn't really like the part at the end where we aren't sure if they died or not, but that's how the actual history of it goes and it's kind of sad. I enjoy movies about history, and this is a story I've been interested in for awhile, so if this director makes more films like this, I wouldn't mind seeing them. The filming was just like any other movie I've seen, there wasn't anything too spectacular about it that made it stand out to other films but its pretty cool to know that some parts of it was filmed in Utah.",8,1,2,5 November 2018
The Alamo," Stream Deguello De Crockett on Spotify
","I watched this movie for my History Through Film class at school. This movie is about Davy Crockett and his men fighting the Mexican soldiers led by Santa Anna because Texas wanted independence from Mexico. Although they didn't win the battle of the Alamo, it became a symbol of the dedication and strength America had and they eventually won their independence later. There wasn't anything I noticed that made me question the historical accuracy. I think the movie was well-made, it depicted the trials pretty well and had some intense scenes during the battle such as continuous stabbing. However, I half enjoyed this movie. My favorite part was when Davy Crockett was going hard on the violin in 'Deguello De Crockett'. There were quite a few parts that were pretty boring and it got kind of confusing so I zoned out. The acting was really good though, I feel like the actors really got into their characters and portrayed the emotions really well. I don't know this director or any of the other stuff he's done so I don't think I'll watch anything else from him. I haven't watched any movies related to these events and I've heard of the Alamo before now but I never quite knew what it was.",6,0,1,9 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman is an ICON.
","This movie is amazing because I love Wonder Woman and it's one of my favorite superhero films. I feel like anyone who watches this movie will really enjoy it because it has so much action and emotion, the fighting scenes are really well executed and super intense. This movie has such a good storyline too and it makes you feel so many emotions. It's about World War 1 and how they overcome the war with the help of Wonder Woman. Even though it's fiction it's still really inspiring. We see a lot of the trials that people had to face during the war, and not even to the full extent of their hardships. This movie was a good source of entertainment because many people love superheroes. My favorite part about this movie was the main character played by Chris Pine because I love him and he's a great actor. There is no part in this movie I didn't like because it's just that good. I love superheroes so I like to watch other movies like this one. The filming was pretty great, they got all the scenes just right and especially the fighting scenes, those were my favorite.",10,5,7,24 November 2018
Cinderella Man," Creed?
","This movie was really good. I didn't get to watch the whole film but from the part that I saw (the end) I really enjoyed it. It's such a good story of the underdog making a comeback and taking everyone by surprise but it also really represents how the Great Depression took a toll on people. The movie shows Braddock's family go through the typical trials of the Great Depression and hitting rock bottom after all his success fails him, then we see his claim to fame and how all his friends and family rallied around him as he did so, however, it took a toll on his wife who didn't want him to fight in fear he would be killed during the championship match against Baer. I really liked the good feeling of the movie when the person everyone wants to win (the underdog) finally does, instead of dying. I don't like watching fighting but it's a key scene in this movie so I watched it anyways. I've seen a few movies by this director and I've loved them all, they're all very appealing and have good story lines. I would definitely watch more movies by this director.",9,1,1,4 December 2018
