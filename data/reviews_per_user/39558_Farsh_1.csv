The Blair Witch Project," Come on, die - who cares?
","I went to this movie with great expectations, although a friend of mine warned me she fell asleep when viewing it 'and I never fall asleep'.Well... I can understand why she fell asleep - if I weren't so irritated by the fact I paid 9 US dollars to see this piece of crap (sorry for my language, but it still upset me...).The main problem I had with the movie is the script, or rather the characters. To me they where exactly how I imagine American college students - spoiled rotten little kids. In short - I lacked the most significant factor for making a good movie - I had no identification with the protagonists. I was completely indifferent to their destiny, and since the end of the movie is known from the start I found myself sitting there and yearning for their death so I could go home.Second, basically I like the idea of mixing media - film and video, but I think that when you mix film and video it should be to create a new theme for the film, the style should add something new to the film. This is not the case here (as opposed to 'Run Lola Run' for example) - the mixture has no value of its own (at least I didn't see one)Third, is this movie supposed to scare us?? Come on! Am I supposed to scare because I hear some knocks and the kids become hysterical? Please!Fourth, one thing they accomplish is the look and feel of a student film. I was amazed, though, when I saw the credits - so many people for this? They could have taken 5-10 film students and do just the same thing.",Null,0,0,26 September 1999
