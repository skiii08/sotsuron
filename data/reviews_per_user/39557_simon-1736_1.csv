"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Rotten
","I have followed the career of Simon Pegg for a number of years from his stand skits on the Steve Coogan tour, to Spaced to Hot Fuzz and yes, he is a fine talent. But I will never forgive him for putting me through an hour and a half of unadulterated, mediocre dross that was Run Fat Boy Run.Run Fat Boy is a poorly acted and directed Brit Com that only serves to perpetuate racial stereotypes and an abundance of clich√©s. The jokes are appalling and regardless of the fact that this is clearly 'a bit of fun' the standard of the writing was insultingly bad.David Schwimmer should Schwimm all the way back to New York because if this blight on our culture is anything to go by his ambition to be a Director are completely misguided.No surprises that this waste of time did not Run and Run.",1,17,30,29 April 2008
