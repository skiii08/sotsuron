Howl's Moving Castle," Art at its best
",Its so refreshing to know that almost all of the Ghibli movies hold kind of a reputation of being best. All of the movies from this studio is like in a competition.,8,0,0,24 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," The Horror!!
","Everyone attached to this movie is now a grandpa. Including Lawrence Fishbourne. Love the use of haze and smokes, almost gave a dream like trance. Many people talk about Brando and his performance, but without Martin's monologues viewers are just gazing at the screen hopelessly. My favorite Coppola movie.",9,0,0,18 April 2020
Spirited Away," My first Studio Ghibli movie
","This was my first ever Hayao Miyazaki work. It was magical to be frank. So many feelings at once. Sometimes too artsy, serious, wayward.",8,0,0,23 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Hollywood Love
",Its actually a love letter to the old hollywood which is more or less gone. In the age of streaming services going into the cinema is profane. Just like the reality altering ending.,9,1,7,18 April 2020
Heat," Palpable tension
",This movie is fueled by the driving force of the lead actors. Pacino and De Niro was both great. Even Kilmer shines like diamond in some scenes. watch out for the shootout scenes they're gems.,8,0,0,9 April 2020
Princess Mononoke," Primal movie
",Top notch action. Just wanted to say that. The plot is really tight-knit. Little humor is needed. At times the plot is dark like really dark. Which climaxes into brutal action.,8,1,1,24 April 2020
