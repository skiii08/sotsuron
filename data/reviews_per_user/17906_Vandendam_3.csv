Saturday Night Fever," Is it wrong?
","I'm born in 1993, but i love this damn movie!
John Travolta acting skills are almost perfect in this movie!
You can believe everything the guy says!
I even think it's strange that i like this movie but i just can't help it.They take you on a journey of just a guy that can dance like nobody does. He has a low paid job and parties in the weekend.
That makes this movie such great! People not always wanna see, superheroes, guns, and cars!
No, this is a story about a normal guy that has problems in his life and the only thing he is really passened about is dancing and he want to change his life with it.",9,0,2,16 June 2019
Troy," Sun, sun and sun!
","When i saw this movie, i was still very young!The sun was always shining in this movie and my mom back then was in love with Brad Pitt like all the other woman in that period.The fights were good!
The acting was great!
And don't forget the sun!",7,0,1,16 June 2019
Scream 2," Not much to say
","The Scream movies will be in our minds forever!It's not that they were wonderful, but they were at that time and still even to this day one of the best slasher movies ever made.If someone ask you for a good movie, you can always say.... Go watch a SCREAM movie!",6,1,2,16 June 2019
