Million Dollar Arm," Touching and Entertaining
","This film is based on the true story about Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, two young men from India who leave their homeland after winning a baseball competition. I'll give you a slightly different perspective, since I am not a sports fan. However, I value and appreciate a good movie with a sports theme when I see one (i.e. Glory Road, The Blind Side, etc), especially when it is based on a true story. This is one of them. I loved it. SPOILER When it comes to the try-outs for a chance to win thousands of dollars and a trip to America, thousands pitch for the cameras but don't make it. These young people might not have any 'hope' of making it, but they try it. They give it their all. They have fun. A few make it to the finals, showing they have talent. Many showed potential but only two passed the test. It's what happened next that affirmed this was a good movie - that moment when something happens to your emotion button and tears flow. I could only imagine what it might have been like for the families of these two young men to bid farewell. Disney et al gotcha! This was nicely done. But that's not what this movie's all about. There are several important themes - sports, politics, relationships, greed, naivety, etc - that happen throughout the story, and then they all come together. And the humour is great. One thing I would have liked it to see Rinku and Dinesh in a real game as part of the movie. Just don't leave the theatre as soon as the movie is done, as there are some film footage and photos of the real Rinku and Dinesh. That is always a bonus in a movie like this. It's a good movie worth seeing.",9,10,16,17 May 2014
