The King's Speech," mixed bag
","The award season brouhaha seems focused on Firth's performance, and excellent though it is, I find it less characteristic and affecting than his turn in Ford's 'A Single Man.' Like 'The Queen' from four years ago, the British royal family is again the boat on which Britain attempts to take Hollywood. But 'The Queen' was a far more affecting film. Perhaps this is because 'The Queen' was so much more enigmatic, while 'The King's Speech' obvious: the king's doll-like daughters greeting him with 'Your Majesty.' Need a more obvious way to communicate the king's entrapment? The cruelty of the Duke of York's brother. The footage of 'ordinary people' wincing at the king's stuttering. The cheap suspense created by Bertie not listening to his recording of 'To be or not to be' until much later. All these are formulaic, and Hollywood formulaic, employed because the the filmmakers seem afraid that we would not be able to empathize with the character's speech impediment problem. But by overdoing it, they achieve the opposite.This isn't to say that there are quite excellent moments. The fog-drenched streets when Helena Bonham-Carter, as 'Mrs. Johnson,' seeks out Lionel. The amplification of the stutter in the very first scene. The dinner during which the previous king dies.The standout for me in this film, however, is Geoffrey Rush. The camera doesn't lavish nearly as much attention on him as it does on Firth, and Rush doesn't get a breakdown scene late in the movie to show off his acting chops, as does Firth. But Rush embodies all the contradiction in the film's supposed theme of an 'unlikely friendship' between men of drastically unequal ranks. Whereas Firth ultimately seems energized and, indeed, two-dimensionally happy with his kingship, Rush's last address to his one-time patient is an enigmatic 'Your Majesty.' Does he admire what he's made, or does he now feel more than ever the disparity in their power? I think also to the expression Rush gives us when his oldest son announces news of WWII - how does Rush think of his 'friend' who has the power to send his son to death in war? It is Rush's quiet performance that leaves the maximum dramatic impact, which Helen Mirren had done four years ago by walking down a hallway in Buckingham Palace with a five year old's confusion on her royal face.",6,42,60,27 January 2011
Incendies," Promising, but disappointing
","The beginning was marvelous. You could tell this came from a play, because the weight of everything hung from words alone - the incredible malediction the mother pronounced on herself, and the contrasting reaction of the two children. Now that I think of it, there are elements of a fairytale in that beginning, present in the task set before the children much as Aladdin is sent for the lamp or Cinderella to clean, and this may - if not justify - provide insight to the structural failures further on; but, as I said, the latter half of the film is a disappointment.'Incendies' is about a brother and sister, twins, who are sent by their mother via her will to search for their father and their brother. This journey reveals, via flashback, the mother's ordeal in an unnamed Arab conflict (Christianity vs Muslim, as usual), and is capped by the revelation that the father and brother are the same person. War is so horrible that it causes even this sort of thing to happen, but whereas the mother can't survive this last atrocity (the realization makes her literally will herself to die), her children can live on.The message, as it were, is all well and good, but the film as a work of art that clarifies life by being an artifice doesn't work for me. It's not that characterization in itself is missing: the children are flat (flatter, at least, than Nawal, who isn't exactly a masterpiece of characterization), and that's kind of an empty promise on the life after war, isn't it? Aren't they just two springboards that serve, in the story, solely to dig up the past? Towards the end, characters such as the lawyer are mobilized like chess pieces, and we find out that Nawal was almost a mythic figure in the jail, 'The Woman Who Sings' -- some sort of superhero. Things fit together too well, a bit like Nawal's outfit, with her rather stylish jeans and jacket; indeed, the revelation at the end, with the silly bit of dialogue from the brother ('One and one... how can they make one??'), couldn't transcend its tawdriness. It's like Disney meets Oedipus Rex.The movie was still entertaining and had moments, of course, of grandeur. But ultimately disappointing. Glad I saw it on the plane.",Null,5,14,30 August 2011
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," sublime
","There's a telling moment towards the beginning of the movie. Shu Lien is riding through the crowded streets of Peking, when her eye is caught by a little girl forced to perform tricks for the crowd -- holding a stack of bowls on her head, while lifting her legs over her shoulders. We've only Shu Lien's lingering, inscrutable glance that tells us that this woman warrior is seeing herself in this little girl -- and will soon see another trapped performer: Jen.Ang Lee's direction is, at times, achingly beautiful, but without the obvious self-awareness of Wong Kar Lai's shots. He lays out each scene so that the positions of the window, the table, the characters seem almost incidental and paratactic -- but it's also inconceivable that they should be any other way. I have seen it, Lee seems to say, and I am laying it out for you as a precise offering.The precision allows for an incredible number of 'issues' and 'subplots' to bubble beneath the surface -- which ranges from detective story (who stole the sword?), revenge drama (Li Mu Bai's master), to romance. But the underlying core is, as with all of Ang Lee's films, the tension between different orders of life, and how that resonates with each of the characters. Take the story of the film's arch-villain, Jade Fox, for example. Ostensibly she desires power -- killing the head of Wudang to gain the kung fu manuals -- but what undoes her is her longing for family, the core of Confucian values; she sees Jen as her daughter, sister, even spouse; the betrayal she feels when Jen turns to Li Mu Bai motivates her vengeance and downfall. That Jade Fox, the character on the farthest fringes of society, should embody so much desire for traditional values (framed by the irony of her serving as Jen's family 'nurse' for so many years) creates a subtle circularity that feels strangely Buddhist. Indeed, the 'letting go' stressed by Buddhism informs both the characters and Ang Lee's direction: Jen lets go of her ego and purges herself in that final act of sacrifice; Li Mu Bai releases his own ego by trading his life for a too-late confession of love; and Lee, by drawing on the wordless ballet of martial arts choreography and stunning shots of the Chinese landscape and subtle, unforced character studies, allows the film to breathe and become the masterpiece that it is.",10,1,2,8 April 2009
Mulholland Drive," dream on awakening
","This is one of those films that, to me, is seminal with regards to the definition of a feeling. What 'actually happened' and who each character is or what each scene 'means' is unimportant. (I also think that the plot is not at all complicated -- there's really a canonical explanation for it already.) The scene with the strange man on the throne, who is he? Well, he's the strange man on the throne who is there to be strange, to induce the feeling of strangeness and uncertainty and fear. That man doesn't have to be anything more; Lynch has no obligation to spin each character into something the viewer can safely understand.And the feeling that comes out of this movie is incredible. There are very few films that so purely and honestly convey a feeling -- I would include 'The Piano' and 'Crouching Tiger.' Lynch doesn't get as good as this -- I consider his latest effort, 'Inland Empire,' as a rocket that never got launched. But here, all the pieces come together: the camera movements that aren't only original and breathtaking, but weighted with an intent that is rivaled only by Tarkovsky's; the performances that seem completely natural; and the beautiful soundtrack with those achingly long sustained chords.",10,5,8,3 May 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," archetypal
","The opening shot establishes how Forman understands this story. We see sunrise, the natural world, a car drawing in and bringing a man into the story and the ward. This isn't a story about the plunges in and out of madness a la more recent treatments of the mind; madness here should be understood not in the biological sense; the madness that matters is the lack of human spirit. McMurphy is the human spirit, the vitalizing force, the Christ figure who exists so that we may all go on. This is an archetypal story, and notable cinematic treatments in this mold include 'Cool Hand Luke' and the well-loved 'Shawshank Redemption.' It's interesting to note that King's treatment of Shawshank was very similar to Kesey's novelistic treatment of Cuckoo -- the narration occurs from the POV of the non-Christ figure. Where Forman encounters difficulty, in my opinion, is the transition of the narrative angle from McMurphy, who dominates the film, to Chief, who is his spiritual heir. However, the lack of a clear frame also gives Cuckoo its power: the pieces are clearly laid before us without the safety of the frame. Heart of Darkness comes to mind as a piece that does well in blurring the narrative frame; Keats's La Belle Dame Sans Merci in poetry. This is one of the reasons why Cuckoo is stronger than Shawshank as a film. Also, it is a tragedy.Cuckoo is a tragedy because Billy's death in the end is the result of least utility, just as R&J's deaths were and the double suicide of Antigone and Creon's son. McMurphy's demise is not so tragic -- he is the Christ-figure. Cuckoo is also a tragedy because Billy's death occurs from human hubris: if Ratched had stepped down, if McMurphy had not been so insistent on his domination of men -- a domination we agree with, but a domination nonetheless.Again, Forman is less concerned about madness than about the usage of madness here as an allegory for human lethargy. And the movie shouldn't be overly contextualized in either the sensationalist reading of state mental institutions that was popular in the 60s and 70s, nor as completely as a power play between Ratched and McMurphy. This is an allegorical, archetypal story, and it is both fitting and ironic that it is the most shamanistic character in the film who inherits the earth from McMurphy.",9,1,4,20 April 2010
