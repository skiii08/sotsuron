United 93," A skillfully constructed, gut-wrenching reminder
","United 93 is a respectful, objective portrayal of heroism, fear, and humanity. Peter Greengrass carefully stayed away from overdoing the drama or putting any one person on a pedestal. He simply takes the viewer into one of the most horrible events of American history, reminding us to never forget. I have never had the physical reaction to a movie before as I did for this one. I often get 'caught up' in a movie... this one made me feel as though I was on the plane, having to make the decision to give up my life to avoid further tragedy. The nice thing about United 93 is the absence of any celebrity face. This movie is proof that good movies can be made without any big names or faces to draw us in. I was able to believe in the movie more fully because I felt that I knew the people - they are my neighbors, my co-workers, the people I pass by every day. That is something America can believe in as a movie.",10,2,8,29 April 2006
