Casablanca," Casablanca- the Patriotic story
","One of the greatest films of the 40's and one of the best American films of all times. This film gives you the view of WWII no body else can. From the little city in Morroco the story of Rick the bartender gives you the best story of life outside the U.S during the early years of WWII. I'm talking about WWII, but once you start watching this film you wouldn't be so sure if it really is about a war, a relationship, or fight within a war. This film can't be put in as just one genre because there is just so much different events happening nobody could put just one genre on this film.This classic film gives the viewers everything you can want in a film. The film is mainly filmed at night meaning there is a need for lighting that is practically done perfect for every scene. The acting shows great chemistry between the main couple that really only has chemistry in flashbacks. The photography is done so well for dark scenes and even give you scenes from France that make you feel like your in France while the war is only miles away you feel like your there. This film was done as an A film and I agree that it is and found no problems with the editing or any other part of the film.This film was intended to be a patriotic film, but today people who haven't seen would not know just by knowing the name of the film. This film takes the audience to the safe areas of the war and shows them how everyone in the film is affected by the war. The famous scene done with the two anthems being sung at the same time was done to predict the outcome of the war. In Ricks bar the German soldiers begin singing their anthem, but Rick gets Victor a man that was from France began to sing the French anthem and got the entire bar to sing along and got the band to get even louder, in which overpower the few German soldiers. As the film continues the German soldiers around the bar become more aggressive and show Rick that even though he is neutral they aren't afraid to stop him, but when Rick allowed Victor to sing the anthem really showed that Rick had picked a side and was going by it.This film was put out in theaters before the war ended and became a very Patriotic film for just Americans and anyone else supporting it. This film was seen as a normal film to the creators but the viewers saw the film as one of a kind and really was in a way propaganda against the Germans in WWII.",9,2,3,14 April 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," A sad time
","The film that takes you into the eyes of the family that has lost everything and is trying to create a new life. This is a film that I found does have good cinematography; not just that it is in black and white but it is just used a lot better.The story itself is just a sad story of a family that is just trying to get a life of their own and really anything they do just doesn't work for them. There is so much doubt in the film and on top of that doubt they are poor. Moving to California for a new life wasn't exactly working, but the film does show that family was the one thing they still had.I myself just saw this as a very sad story as others are but this is a first for me that a film with this kind of story doesn't give me an exact ending or make me think everything will be happy in the end.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
The Graduate," The right generation
","When I look back at this film one thing I hear about it is that Dustin Hoffman was too old to take the role, but I myself thought he took the role and made it himself the graduate and acted the perfect way for the film. With the awkward moments between his neighbor Mrs. Robinson who he thinks one thing, but she says another he reacts so nervously and red that it is funny.The film that is surrounded by a man that just graduated college and his only friends at home are his parents friends. So what is he to do when he wants to be alone...drive off in his new car with his neighbor that turns into something more than what he was looking for.The film that shows the old generation doesn't belong with the young by showing the many times Ben meets with Mrs.Robinson, but once he finds a way to date her daughter he begins to see his world in a better and brighter way. The only thing is he has to get rid of the older generation not letting him be happy with the woman he loves.This film uses music very strongly to set the scenes for the perfect moments that will happen. Keeping the audience glued to the story. This film uses many darker scenes to show very little but sets the scenes like that perfect for the moment like that. The most camera-work used in this film is the moving camera with the car following the car as if the audience was in the car with Ben.",9,1,1,9 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Not just a simple musical
","I call this film not just a musical because it is so much more than that. It has its musical moment, but it takes the viewers through a big part of history in film. Actually the film tells you the way musicals were created and not through some musical piece to show it.The actual story of this film is when sound came to movies... what a great invention to the film industry. Not everyone said that when it was created and became a needed thing for film not wanted. So the studios that have sound will be more popular what about the others. Well the film takes you through the struggles of adapting to sound and since it wasn't exactly a success at first something needed to be done.The musical isn't just about singing in the rain it creates a whole different story about a famous actor who thinks he can act as a silent actor but is challenged when he has to use his actual voice. Also is challenged by a woman who said he isn't a real actor without sound, which begins a little love story that brings the audience through the back doors of Hollywood. Of course there are musical moments but it does help give the film a better atmosphere for the film and keep it up and a more positive setting for viewers.",8,0,1,7 May 2014
Psycho," Great Horror
","Alfred Hitchcock at his best with horror is this film right here Psycho. With a story that takes you through a dark humor and many other dark qualities the film holds.The camera-work of course holds to Hitchcock's best ways in which there are some sky shots from the camera, but of course his most famous is the shower scene that is so broken down that it was shot perfectly to show every angle and what was happening.The story of woman who steals a whole lot of money and then takes you around to a motel. Still you are thinking of something that will happen and the opposite happens. Maybe murder is expected but getting rid of all evidence that is something different.With black and white this film is done do great that you have to notice the great camera-work with it. It holds onto the horror in the film and actually enhances it all the way to the end if you want to call it an ens.",9,1,3,9 May 2014
