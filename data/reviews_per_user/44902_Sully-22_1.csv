The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed
","This movie was a huge disappointment.  It infuriates me that it is making millions as a low budget film.  I almost asked for a refund, which I have never done before.  There is nothing frightening nor intriguing about this movie...amateurs screaming and cursing over who lost the map for 30 minutes...give me a break.  I kept looking at my watch as I could not believe the absence of horror and suspense...finally, the last 10 minutes. This isn't even a rental...wait for it come on television and then have it on in the background.",1,1,3,16 August 1999
