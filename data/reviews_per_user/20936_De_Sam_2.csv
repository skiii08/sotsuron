Sucker Punch," A defence for ambition in filmmaking
","There has never been a better example of the need to have as little prior knowledge before watching a film as an indispensable requirement to enjoy said film. Firstly, try for a moment to imagine having heard none of Zack Snyder's ridiculous notion that Sucker Punch is an empowering feminist work; it increased the scrutiny regarding the plot devices he used, which led to all those who rightly deemed that revenge rape story lines are completely unrelated to female empowerment. When just viewed as a story on its own, then I feel most fail to see the balance (or at least as close as you can get to that concept given Snyder's aesthetic) Sucker Punch achieves in addressing topics of abuse in all kinds without shying away from the consequences and without exploiting the acts themselves to generate interest. In short, I had no problems with the story or in the way it was portrayed.In addition, a lot of viewers have complained about the covers of some of their favourite songs, ranging from the Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams, Björk's Army of Me, Queen's We Will Rock You the Pixies' Where is my mind and the The Beatles' Tomorrow never knows. I for one hold no strong feelings for the original versions of these songs (would even go as far as to say those last two are better than their original versions, mainly because I dislike the Pixies and Beatles) and was pleasantly surprised by the apt selection of accompanying tracks to the varied action sequences.Lastly, I saw the director's cut, which is mandatory for an ambitious and indulgent film such as Sucker Punch; if you go hard, than go all the way (the closest comparison I have in this regard is the overly absurd 功夫 (Kung Fu Hustle)). Maybe this version is more clear and understandable than the theatric version as I had no problem discerning the plot and all the thematic subtexts in one sitting.I do have the feeling at times I was watching an extended in-game cut scene, but I did not mind it at all, because this lend itself to exploring a range of video game staples, namely Nazi Zombies (thanks Call of Duty: World at War) and a variety of Japanese anime tropes (especially the excessive panty flashing in the first action sequence).If I had to summarise, I immediately accepted Snyder's intend with Sucker Punch and he had me intrigued from start to finish. Blame my soft spot for convoluted and pretentious story lines that thrive solely on minimal information delivery, because I quite liked the ending as well",8,2,4,30 July 2017
The Birth of a Nation," The Racism cannot be excused
","Film is an art, and Griffith was the pioneer of this vision, he saw himself as a great genius and the 'father of narrative cinema'; when he left American Biograph after his film Judith of Bethulia he went to Hollywood and put an advertisement for himself in the paper that contained a list of all his previous films, he was certain a studio would recruit him.This complacency is also on show in the very first shot of the film, namely the trademark outline for the text, containing Griffith's name in the upper-right and -left corner and his initials on the bottom. It is quite evident he loves himself very much.I see a lot of reviews here trying to justify the racism in the film by saying that in 1915 everyone was racist. Then how come the film immediately sparked protest after its release? The NAACP was successful in removing some of the racists parts of the film; it was cut from 1544 to 1375 shots. Because Griffith made the film without a script and those cut scenes were destroyed, we can only guess what other ghastly things were on them -the fact that the extremely racist South Carolina Parliament scene was not cut, does make me wonder just how bad those removed takes were.In typical Griffith vanity, he felt attacked and violated for the public had stained his genius and masterpiece. He went to make a whole three-and-a-half film to vindicate the 'Intolerance' of those who opposed his racist depictions. The audience did not like this unsubtle message and Intolerance became one of the biggest flops in Hollywood history (the fact that it was such a complicated film for the time was also a big factor, but just let me believe in this delusion of poetic justice).It the sneering tone or the rating did not convey it yet, I absolutely loathe this film. The depiction of Afro-Americans as uncivilised, alcoholics, rapists and other depictions you would assign to the concept of untermenschen, makes my blood boil. There is a big difference between denigrating a group of people (as the Indians have been subject of in many Westerns) for the sake of the narrative and the way Griffith denigrates a whole social group (believing in the separation of the human race in 'sub-races' is in itself racist). The only time Afro-Americans are portrayed as sympathetic is when they are submissive; Griffith states this as 'the Aryan birthright' of the white South.The worst part of Griffith's film is the revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States, he has Afro-American blood on his hands. This fact in itself is enough for me to give this the lowest rating possible. I do not care for this 'encyclopaedia of what film was capable on a technical level', if Griffith had not made this film another director would eventually have mode a similar film, one I would have actually been able to enjoy.",1,5,14,15 October 2015
