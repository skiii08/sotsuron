Ford v Ferrari," Better if You Know Cars
","My wife and I both did genuinely enjoy this movie. The story is great, acting is good, and you really do feel for the characters. My main recommendation is to watch it with the subtitles on as the accents make it challenging to follow at times. Also, someone who appreciates cars a bit more than myself may find themselves even more invested in the film.",7,0,1,28 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than I Remember
","In watching these with my wife (who has not seen them before) I found myself surprised by how much more I enjoyed this episode compared to the last time I viewed it! Jar Jar is still the worst part of this film, and the action is fairly tame, but this film does excellent at world-building. I know the politics is one of the main reasons why people don't care for this movie, but with both my wife and I studying politics and government in school, we found we enjoyed learning about the political issues taking place in the Republic.",7,2,3,5 January 2020
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Better than Expected
","I usually do not care for these types of family drama comedy movies but I found this one surprisingly enjoyable. Steve Carrel does great in this role and it suits his comedic timing. I would recommend it to others.
Though, the subplot with the babysitter felt a little unnecessary.",7,2,3,7 February 2020
The Irishman," Surprisingly Engaging
","I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I was shocked after I started watching it that it was over 3 hours long! It was slowly paced, and the dialogue was somewhat difficult to grasp. BUT... the movie never stopped being engaging and fascinating to watch! I was drawn into this world of mob bosses and organized crime and found myself constantly curious about what I would find in the next scene! Honestly, my only complaint is the sheer length - though, I cannot think of any scene one could cut out.",7,1,8,19 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Fine Conclusion
","I personally enjoy this one the most of the original trilogy. My wife, who is watching these for the first time, is finding them quite underwhelming. To be fair, as she pointed out, the original movies provide very little context for what is actually taking place in the Star Wars universe at this time, which makes it more challenging to follow without fully exploring all the additional media.",7,1,1,2 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fan Service Movie
","While the movie is entertaining on its own, and has some visually stunning moments, it does little to stand out from any other action blockbuster. The movie truly falters in the way it is obviously built around moments of fan service and nostalgia, rather than a truly unique story that adds to the Star Wars universe.",6,8,13,5 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Duller than I Remember
","In watching all of these with my wife, who has not seen them before, in order of how they are made, I found this my least favorite so far.It feels out of place and the aesthetics differ significantly from the other movies. The pacing is slow, and Anakin is far more annoying and sociopathic than I remember.There are some highlights, such as the Dooku/Yoda fight. But there is little holding this movie together.",5,0,0,11 January 2020
Mamma Mia!," Is probably a better stage play
","My wife and I were in the mood for a movie based off of a broadway musical and neither of us had seven it yet. I found it very average. The story was okay, but the songs felt like they got in the way of the movie.
Highlights included Meryl Streep's and Colin Firth's performances, and the interactions between the three potential father's. Issues included the musical numbers awkward placement, and Pierce Brosnen's singing.
The movie is probably better appreciated by ABBA fans.",5,1,3,18 March 2020
The Favourite," It's okay
","It's not a movie for everyone, and for me it seemed rather difficult to follow.",5,0,1,24 December 2019
1917," Great Visual Storytelling
","I wasn't sure what to expect from a WWI one-shot movie, but I could not take my eyes off the screen! The storytelling is incredible and shows the effectiveness of showing a story rather than telling it.Please note, while the movie is labeled as being a 'one-shot' film, there are a few places where the cuts are noticeable.",8,0,1,13 January 2020
Hercules," Okay, but in a good way
","It is certainly not the strongest movie of the Disney Renaissance (or of Disney movies in general. But what it lacks in story and a main character, it makes up for with a few very good songs and one of the best Disney villains! I do recommend it for Disney and animation fans, though, it is unlikely to become your favorite animated movie.",7,1,2,22 March 2020
Joker," Technically Excellent
","This movie does everything right when it comes to telling a story via film. The cinematography, score, acting, editing, and storyline are all excellent! The main reason I am not giving it a higher rating is because I found it hard to enjoy. To be fair, the movie is not intended to be a joyful experience. It feels uncomfortable on purpose. For me, personally, that keeps me from wanting to watch it again,l. For others, that might make it a 10/10 movie.",8,3,4,18 April 2020
Parasite," Great Story Telling, but Best Picture?
","The story telling, and general themes of the movie work and are worth its praise. However, I don't see how it won best picture with other aspects such as cinematography being good, through not amazing.The movie is enjoyable, though not for everyone. There are some light comedic moments, introspective reflections, and evening some thriller surprises. The movie works, but I can't say it was the best picture I saw from 2019.",7,1,2,9 May 2020
Marriage Story," Technically Excellent, but not a Feel-Good Story
","This movie can be tough to watch at times as it presents a very realistic look at divorce. The acting is excellent, and everything technical about it is spot on. It does not end on a happy note; instead it ends on a 'meh' - which can be very true to life.",7,1,2,26 April 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Pleasant Surprise
",I didn't know what to expect going into this movie but I was happy with what I encountered. The most impressive feature is the acting skills of the child actors.,7,0,2,20 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Has Not Aged As Well
","Watched this with my wife (who has not seen it before). It is okay. I can certainly appreciate it in it's time, but this film in particular has not aged well - even when compared to episodes five and six (which are excellent!)Nevertheless, it is certainly still worth watching, and is probably the best film to start with.",6,2,5,27 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the Better Episodes
","Watching these with my wife (who has never seen them before). Episode V is certainly a step up from IV. However, it's paced a lower slower than I remembered. Unfortunately, the pervasiveness of State Wars in pop-culture does take away of the intended surprises of discovering who Yoda is and the relationship between Vader and Luke. Nevertheless, it is a good film.",7,1,1,29 December 2019
