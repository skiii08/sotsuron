3:10 to Yuma," Would somebody please get Christian Bale some Ex-Lax, OR.........
","Bad guys smart, good guys dumb, and pusillanimous.If you like actors who sound like a caricature of Clint Eastwood, i.e. constipated, then you'll love this movie.And if you like Hollywood's view of the good guys (the US Military) as indecisive, weak, pathetic, pleading and/or corrupt, and surprised by everything the bad guys do, then you'll love this film. After Russell Crowe is captured and the buffoonish good guys are escorting him through the desert, Crowe SURPRISES them all by suddenly trying to overwhelm the posse. Luckily for them they had a 14 year old along to rescue them. Yes, yes, yes, the good guys are all too moronic to predict an escape attempt by a mass murderer. Now the amazing thing is that the good guys once again fall asleep at the wheel and Crowe escapes after the group is attacked by Apaches. But wait, it gets even better. Crowe is later captured by Forrest Frye (who plays a marshall) and it is then that the weak kneed Christian Bale, after proving his indecisiveness for half a film, swings into action and beats the crud out of Frye and his buddies. Absurd? Yes, but remember, this is Hollywood and they can't imagine good guys with any courage. At the point when Crowe's gang rode into town and the only person who saw them was the 14 year old, I couldn't take it anymore. It was time to say good bye to another Hollywood pile-o-schlock.",3,2,7,25 January 2008
