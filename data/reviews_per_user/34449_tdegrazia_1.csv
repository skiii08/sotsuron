It," I was lied to
","To explain this low score, I need to start by describing the situation. My boyfriend and I were planning a date night and he asked me what movie I wanted to see. I told him Ninjago since the kids I work with have been talking about it a bunch and he said, 'interesting choice. I think we will see it.' I parked the car while he bought the tickets so imagine my surprise when we walked into a theater playing It with a capital I, not Ninjago. It was NOT THE MOVIE I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING NOR WAS IT A MOVIE I WANTED TO SEE. This movie was full of scary clowns and children dying. Terrible. Would not recommend.",1,2,17,28 September 2017
