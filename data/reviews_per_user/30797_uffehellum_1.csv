National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Cute little chick-flick for the very simple minded
","The acting is quite OK, but they don't have much to work with. I hear the script writers are on strike.Several places the narrative goes overboard, in the form of fake dialog that really serves as not-so-subtle reminders for the viewer who may have less than 5 minute attention span.By all means, do something else while watching the film; you may have time to read a good book during the quiet parts.How many times do you need to be told that the steering wheel is in the wrong side in London? If you feel like blurting 'Thank you!' after a couple of times, you probably will get very annoyed before the film is over.The hypocritical correctness reaches nauseating levels at least twice. When the good guys have to sacrifice a member to escape a trap, they are magically able to substitute a golden icon. Next time, the 'word of honor' of our hero is good for about 60-90 seconds only. He conveniently has to help his parents, so he can sacrifice the bad guy, and his promise to assist evaporates the exact moment the door slams shut after him.The the copy&paste jobs from old James Bond films is like watching a five year old copy Mona Lisa. But I was amused by his butterfly and champagne hidden under the dry suit.On a big screen, it is unbearable how the most trivial little puns are repeated and exaggerated, much like when a little kid tells a joke.Very pretty film with very little content.",4,2,4,11 January 2008
