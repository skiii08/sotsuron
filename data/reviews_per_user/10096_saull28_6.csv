Requiem for a Dream," Psychotically awesome
","Well written and developed, tells the truth about the use of drugs and the consequences, great movie, truthful and to the point, without nice transition and lies, but like it is, Brave Approach to Depression which turns into Addiction; if you are an addict go to a rehab centre, but it's not the rehab procedure is the attitude of the patient to want to recover and stay sober, resolve the traumas, and build a life, also what we eat depresses us, because animal products=tortured animals, become Vegan, but poverty, crime and greed has roots in Capitalism, which is a childish approach to Reality as a game, instead of an Adult's matter, the inability to share and trust with respect, fairness and egalitarian attitudes to not be Stupidly Selfish, to be a globalist and not tribalist, so People are our 'tribe', Earth our Country and Do Good to others our Religion/Belief",10,0,1,25 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disney Star Wars Episode 2, A New BS
","Episode 1 was 'Episode VII'. As another review tile, Disney strikes back, what a piece of crap, horribly done, this is a kids movie for 8+ years up to 12, everything is made of inflammable fragile exploding material, laws of Physics are different on that Galaxy, maybe because it's far far away? Someone said Mediocre, please, don't insult mediocrity, I'd give it 0/10 if I could. I probably won't see Episode IX, I can say with confidence that the Saga is dead as it was intended by the first trilogy that was made, for a young adult audience.Now why this BS happened? money, Star Wars become popular, now kids of 4+ have a smart device with access to the Internet, and probably the ones that will go to the movies as some market research report might have said, so they focused on the most profitable demographic and age group, well they can count me out, for good",1,5,7,10 January 2018
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs was the typical childish egomaniac asshole 'genius'
","If you're truly enlightened, you realize it soon in your life, but if you're a great human being, you remain humble about it and that's ironically the crow of great people IMO, they could be show-off pathetic and ridiculous clown like Steve Jobs but they don't, because they're emotionally smarter than that, they take things in a simple way, and I think that's so because they care more about humanity and be in harmony with humans sharing whatever talent each can contribute to our species than playing the 'I am the unacknowledged genius' victim crap, the guy was a ruthless ars-hole so I'm glad he died from Cancer, he deserved every bit of it; eat crap and die ars-hole!",1,24,61,13 October 2015
Joker," Idiot
","That should be the title, the worst possible situations solve the worse way possible, over and over, and this what people like? no wonder the World is the piece of crap that is today and going worse by the day, we deserve to be extinct.",1,8,18,17 February 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," How dumb you have to be?...
","To think this is in anyway healthy and sustainable, so eventually leading you to happiness? To think this is most women want to be treated? Wow, I'd think that this level of production, would have the money to hire good writers, and do something tasteful, seductive and romantic, something couples are actually about, but no, is the moronic, simplistic, VULGAR, sexual attraction and nothing else, is this the level of emotional intelligence of USA? I really hope not...",1,3,4,9 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It didn't disappoint as I expected to be crappy
","This critic may contain spoilers, so if you haven't watched the movie don't read it, from this point on is your responsibility, you have been warned.Better computer graphics, the only thing that was better, the rest was 3/10, for every 3 things you could find goo there was 10 that were bad. J.J. Abrams was a disappointment on Star Trek with flashy horizontal lights and shinny camera takes that add nothing to the plot except cause some seizures on epileptic people and leave you blind for 3 seconds, really cheap trick, and so it was on this movie, cheap un-creative takes and poor scenarios, the bursting of lights was so exaggerated the light sabers look like cylindrical fast-moving lava lamps, same for the fat ultra-fast shots from guns, it is not a plasma gun is a laser-like gun, the light should be cylindrical, clean and elegant, not more distorted than on the previous movies. The story line was boring, simple and ridiculously dramatic, mediocre acting, really sad and painful too watch a saga become just another boring Sci-Fi movie. The training level of the dark-side would have been much greater than untrained light-side force user and the fight went like 2, 7 year old kids, fighting with wood sticks, and no use of the force in interesting ways, pathetic. So many millions and JJ Abrams missed the hole point, the guy is there to make a cheap 3rd trilogy to make money not to continue a interesting story line and legacy, the guy is a horrible amateurish director; point was, to continue the study and use of the force like the Episodes IV-VI, or make it 1 hour longer, I wouldn't have minded as long as things get interesting and more story line in the movie, but that movie wouldn't be interesting even if it was 5 hours long. but it has a 8.8 IMDb rating, really this new generation doesn't have a clue what imagination is.",3,18,24,27 December 2015
