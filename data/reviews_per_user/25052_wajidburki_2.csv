Lucky Number Slevin," A Stylish Flick!!!
","I just saw the film and I must say this is the best movie of 2006.A case of mistaken identity lands Slevin(Josh Hartnett)with the job of killing The Rabbi's(Ben Kingsley) son.The Rabbi is The Boss's(Morgan Freeman)gangster rival while he owes The Rabbi $ 33000.He is also being pursued by GudKat(Bruce Willis) and he is also under watch by Detective Brikowski(Stanley Tucci) while helping him along is Lindsey(Lucy Liu).Directed by Paul McGuigan whose previous movie Wicker Park was no where as good as this one.Josh Hartnett is brilliant in his role promising more movies for him.Bruce Willis as usual was brilliant so was Stanley Tucci.Ben Kingsley did his thing.Morgan Freeman for me was not up to the mark,he was just OK.Otherwise its a brilliant film.Fast paced,edgy,slick,stylish.You name it.A must see movie.",10,32,65,25 June 2006
Saw," An Amazing Movie
","This is probably the best movie I have ever seen.Its got style,suspense,certain amount of blood,basically it has everything.The movie starts with Adam(Leigh Whannel)waking up in a bathroom chained to pipe,opposite to him is Dr.Gordon(Cary Elwes)who is also being held captive,between them is a dead man(Tobin Bell).Gordon has only one way to escape,kill Adam by cutting of his foot and crawling to the gun in the dead man's hand,oh and he has only until 6 on the clock to do it or his wife and daughter will die.Director James Wan and write/actor Leigh Whannel have together created a clever film which leaves you tuned in to the very end,from the moment the movie starts with Adam waking up to the shocking end.The movie also stars Danny Glover Detictive Tapp and Ken Leung as his partner Detective Sing.The best actor for me in the whole movie was Leigh Whannel as Adam.His yells,screams,dialogs all matched the situation and his expressions were also good.Cary for me was a bit annoying at times but he too pulled of a decent performance.Ken Leung was good while Danny Glover was just pathetic.The movie also grossed $112 million worldwide while it cost just $1.2 million dollars to make.The last 5 minutes of the movie really shook me up.It is a must see movie,you cannot miss it.",10,0,1,21 June 2006
