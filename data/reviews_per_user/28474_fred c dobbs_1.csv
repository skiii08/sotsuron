The Blair Witch Project," rotten!
",the only scary thing about this piece of crap is the price of admission. this 'movie' rates along side of 'plan 9 from outer space'. i tried to stick with this assinine film but couldn't waste anymore time on something as bad as this.  i walked out of the theater along with several others. this is not even worth seeing when it makes it to tv.,1,1,3,24 August 2003
