Insidious: Chapter 2," A truly shockingly awful film..laughable
","I saw the first and thought it was good, this however is simply a prime example of the crass commercialism of the film industry.Every person involved in the making of this film should hang their heads in shame. Every 30 seconds your TV volume will jump 300 decibels as yet another inane shot of a window breaking, ghost appearing out of somewhere or door slamming will occur.The script is so clumsy im sure it was written by a 12 year old.My favourite scene to emphasise just how bad this film was is the bit when the two ghost hunters are in the van and agree that no safety word will be given to whoever his name is as they will know when he will be in trouble. Whoever his name is then has a 3 minute conversation with an evil spirit ( yawn ) but wait the two others only come to his rescue when they hear he has a knife!!! Gadzooks!! Insulting really.Good luck if you like it, you're keeping talentless morons in swimming pools and wild egos...As for the actors, their lack of professional integrity surprised me..",1,31,53,18 January 2014
