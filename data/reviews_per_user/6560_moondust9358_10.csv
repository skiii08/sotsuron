Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely amazing.
","I just finished watching REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, and all I can think or say about it is ... wow.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is about four people and their battles with drug addiction. Sara (Ellen Burstyn) is hooked on diet pills, and Harry (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are all addicted to heroin. These four addictions spiral so out of control that all four people have to either go to astounding lengths to keep them up, or face dire consequences.But take into mind that this movie is not for everybody. It's very intense, depressing, and disturbing. On the other hand, though, it teaches a lesson about drugs that I don't think can ever be replicated. The strong performances are what really bind the movie together. Burstyn and Connelly especially, and Wayans was a real surprise in that he actually can act, and well too.The direction and imagery is unlike anything I've ever seen. I watched the edited version, and even that was pretty hard to handle. Incredible ... but not exactly something I want to see again.A sheerly amazing movie that nobody--I repeat, nobody--should miss. 10 out of 10, without question.",Null,0,1,14 June 2003
The Ring," A mixed bag.
","Everyone seems to have mixed feelings about THE RING. Some (like me) think it was pretty damn scary. Others think it was pretty stupid.THE RING is modeled after a Japanese horror film called RINGU. (It's supposed to be better, check it out.)After the mysterious death of her niece, Rachel (Naomi Watts) starts trying to unveil the mystery. She finds and watches a videotape that, seven days after you watch it, will kill you. From there, she also finds the tragic story of the Morgan family. Rachel is determined not to die, and does her very best to figure out the videotape.Does she? Watch the movie.The videotape itself is pretty disturbing ... a bunch of random images is what you see at first, but as the movie goes on, you begin to piece together those images with parts of the plot. The only thing that kind of annoyed me was that, when one of those times comes, when something about the videotape begins to make sense, they show that part of the videotape and don't let the viewer figure it out for his or herself.Anyway, this movie is sort of more of a psychological horror--if something like this really happened, you'd be pretty scared. Admit it. I would give THE RING an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,14 June 2003
The Exorcist," Not that scary ...
","I'm sure that when THE EXORCIST came out in 1973, it was a pretty scary movie. But, in my opinion, it does not stand the test of time.As everyone knows, THE EXORCIST is about a little girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who becomes possessed by the devil, and how it affects her and her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn). Now, as frightening as that thought is, the movie is still not very scary. Things such as thick pea soup standing as vomit seem almost laughable by today's standards. There are those few classic scenes though--the head-turning, the exorcism, and the death of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow)--that remain timeless and brilliant. And, in the newer version, the spider-walk sequence, which certainly stands out in my mind. But other than that, there's not much to say as far as scare factor goes.However, that's not to say that it isn't a good movie. A movie doesn't have to be scary to be good (however, it being a horror movie, that's kind of the expectation). The acting, plotline, and characters are remarkable, and the makeup used on Linda Blair when Regan is possessed is exceptional. Those things make the movie pretty believable, and when you think about it, if this were to happen, you'd be scared s***less.This is the classic horror movie that will always hold a high place in the world of movies, even though to some (like me), it might have lost its scariness. Still, though, a very good movie. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,14 June 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Not all it's cracked up to be.
","WO HU CANG LONG (or, its more recognizable title, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) is basically about a man named Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) who has three goals to make before he retires as a martial arts teacher. The first is to profess his love to Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh); the second is to avenge the death of his teacher; and the third is to give his sword, the Green Destiny, to a new owner. However, before he can do much, the Green Destiny is stolen by a mysterious figure. Then there are many subplots, involving romance and things like it.The three lead actors (the two already mentioned, and Ziyi Zhang) are all terrific. The martial arts scenes are ... obviously fake, but awesome nonetheless. The China scenery is very nice, and it's actually pretty nice to watch it with the subtitles. If you watch the dubbed version (which, by the way, was done excellently), it sort of ruins the China feel of it all.But ... but but but ... this film is certainly not deserving of ten Academy Award nominations, and certainly not 'the best film of all time.' In my opinion, it is a good film, but not great. Nothing too special. Entertaining, but nothing much more. A 7 out of 10.",Null,0,1,17 June 2003
Mulholland Drive," Honestly, the most confusing movie I've ever seen.
","MULHOLLAND DR. is one hell of a confusing movie.The plot is as follows: A woman named Rita (Laura Elena Harring) gets into a car accident, but doesn't die. She ends up stumbling (literally) to an apartment where another woman named Betty (Naomi Watts) is house-sitting for her aunt. Rita can't remember who she is, or what happened, or anything, and Betty helps her to figure it out. They have lesbian sex. Then everything shifts and they've lost me.The first half of the movie is fine, it makes enough sense, and I was able to understand it. Then about halfway through, people start switching names, and I have no idea what's going on. Honestly, most people, like me, don't have the attention span or patience to try and figure this movie out. They really don't.On the one hand, the very end of the movie is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. At least see that, you'll probably p*ss yourself. And then we can all have a good laugh.MULHOLLAND DRIVE gets a 6 out of 10 from me. It's too damn confusing.",Null,0,1,14 June 2003
8 Mile," '8 Mile'
","Besides being a fan of rap, I really liked '8 Mile.'Let me say that, first of all, if you're not a fan of rap, you probably won't enjoy the movie very much. Many of the best moments are when Jimmy Smith Jr., aka B-Rabbit (played by Eminem), is engaging in rap 'battles.' Outside of that, the movie, honestly, is kind of boring. It basically shows the lifestyle of Eminem's character: going to work and almost getting fired a couple of times, breaking up with and having encounters with an ex-girlfriend (Tarryn Manning), meeting a new girl (Brittany Murphy, ick), fighting with his mom and her boyfriend, as well as rival rappers in the city of Detroit. But through it all, all he really wants to do is get a deal as a rapper, and he shows a tough shell, but has a soft spot inside for his baby sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield). The movie is basically a bunch of trials and tribulations, but it does not disappoint.All of the actors are in a range from alright to awesome. Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, and most of the supporting cast has good moments and alright moments. Eminem is really good in his debut film role, which was sort of surprising--he really pulled the movie together. There are quite a few funny moments, and the film really delivers the atmosphere of Eminem's character's lifestyle.Plus, to be totally superficial, Eminem is in it. Need I say more?Not one you should miss, but if you do, you'll survive. 8/10.",Null,0,0,9 August 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Better than the original ... ?
","I may be alone on this, but I actually think THE MATRIX RELOADED is better than the original.First of all, the plot of this one is confusing, just as in the original. But this plot is a little less confusing than that of THE MATRIX. Anything that involves less work from my brain is good for me.Second, more action. THE MATRIX had some good action scenes, but THE MATRIX RELOADED's action scenes blows those out of the water. The scene where Neo fights the Agent Smith clones and they just keep on coming, and the car chase on the highway are definite standouts. Those two scenes are just amazing. I'll admit, THE MATRIX was a little boring for me. THE MATRIX RELOADED held my interest the whole way through.My sentiment is definitely not going to be that of everybody. But my personal opinion is that THE MATRIX RELOADED is even better than the original, because it is less confusing and with much more action. You won't want to miss it. But, of course, you have to see THE MATRIX first. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,15 June 2003
Psycho," Brilliance.
","What can I say. Alfred Hitchcock was a genius. This has to be one of his best works.PSYCHO is about a woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who, instead of depositing some money like she is supposed to, takes it for herself and goes on the run. She feels as if she's about to be caught, so she checks into the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). During her stay there, she is murdered. So is the detective who comes searching for her. Nobody can figure out what happened.PSYCHO is one of those rare movies that is near-perfect. Hitchcock can create such suspense in a way that no one else can. All of the acting is supreme, and the plot is just remarkable. It's a little confusing at first, as you wonder who the murderer is, but it is entirely cleared up by the end. That's refreshing amidst movies like MULHOLLAND DR. and MEMENTO, that leave many loose ends for you to tie up. PSYCHO does not do this, which I liked about it. And the ending ... absolutely gave me chills.10 out of 10. One of the best horror movies of all time.",Null,0,1,14 June 2003
Bruce Almighty," Is Bruce really so almighty? (Spoilers)
","BRUCE ALMIGHTY is by no means a disappointment. Given that it stars Jim Carrey, you expect it to be funny and entertaining. And it is.The movie is about a man named Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) who is ultimately unhappy about his life and is giving up on God because of the way his life turned out. But then God (Morgan Freeman) brings him up and basically says, 'Think you can do better? Give it a shot,' and gives Bruce his powers.Bruce does a lot of things to fix his own life, first, but then the pressures of everyone else's lives start to get to him. He then gets dumped by his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), and wonders if he can handle all of God's responsibilities or not. That's all I'm going to tell you.Ultimately, a good movie. Lots of funny moments and an interesting plot. It has your typical cheesy, predictable romance subplot, of course. And overall, I thought, the movie is preachy. It just is. Lots of good performances and jokes, but the preachiness of it is pretty annoying. Still though, not a bad movie at all. 7 out of 10.",Null,0,1,15 June 2003
Amélie," Amelie indeed.
","LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMELIE POULAIN (or just AMELIE in America) is one good movie. It is about a French woman named Amelie (Audrey Tautou) who is trying to improve the lives of others around her, by matchmaking, playing tricks on her neighbors, befriending lonely people, and so on and so forth. While doing this, she also improves her own life in certain ways.AMELIE is truly great. Audrey Tautou is simply wonderful and charming as the protagonist, and most of the secondary actors are good as well. There are many genuinely funny moments, such as the fish scene. Heh. And the film's atmosphere and directing is truly unique. AMELIE just has such an innocent and funny air about it, which is really refreshing. The French is great to listen to, as well. It definitely should've won Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars last year. AMELIE gets a 9 out of 10 in my book.",Null,0,1,17 June 2003
