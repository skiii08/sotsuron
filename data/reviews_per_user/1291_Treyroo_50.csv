Moneyball," Math and baseball together
","With the best players playing the right way, a team is assured a victory. But if the best players are too expensive, do you simply take who you can get and give in? Or have you been overlooking quality players simply because conventional wisdom said you should?Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) is General Manager of the Oakland A's and after losing the last game of the season against the Yankees, three of his star players leave for more lucrative contracts. He'd hoped to match their offers, but the owner couldn't afford it. Then, while looking for a trade at the Cleveland Indians' headquarters, he noticed his counterpart appeared to be taking direction from someone he'd never seen before. After the meeting he approaches Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), the one person he didn't know in that meeting who seemed to be calling the shots. Brand and Beane soon have a rapport and before long Brand is Beane's second-in-command despite serious resistance from the rest of the staff in the Manager's office who feel Brand is a threat to the team and the game itself.Sabermetrics has had wide-reaching and long-lasting effects on the game of baseball from supposedly ending the Red Sox losing streak to posthumously exonerating fabled great 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson. The story is interesting and Jonah Hill acting way outside his comfort zone is, to say the least, adequate. Brad Pitt also plays his part well as he often does, regardless of the material. That said, at two hours and thirteen minutes, the film feels too long. I don't say that because I believe all movies should be shorter than this, but I do believe this one should've been shorter.",7,0,0,24 November 2012
The Avengers," Great
","You're larger than life. You have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet. Then the world finds itself in peril and to save it, you'll need to join a group of people just as unique as you if not more so. What do you do?S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is overseeing a top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract. The experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode. In actuality, it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) to emerge. It's almost immediately clear that S.H.I.E.L.D. is outmatched and what's worse, the supervisor of the tesseract project Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and experienced covert agent nicknamed Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) became mindless drones under Loki's (Hiddleston's) command. Once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on, Fury (Jackson) calls Agent Natasha Romanoff also known as the Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) to recruit one member of The Avengers. The Avengers Initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film, but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative. Romanoff (Johansson) is next seen in India resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo). Banner (Ruffalo) has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the American government, to remain calm, to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as The Hulk. Next to be approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. is Iron Man, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the character's third major film). The last member left to recruit is Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans), more commonly known as Captain America. When they're finally brought together, Banner and Stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and, in so doing, locating the enemy. When that's accomplished, they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Loki's brother.Now, I was not really a fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, nor was I altogether pleased after seeing Thor. As for Bruce Banner's larger half, perhaps it's impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that I wouldn't like. First there was the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana film, then the Edward Norton film, both of which I enjoyed. Still, I did like Ruffalo. Also, Thor, Captain America, and the Black Widow made individual contributions to enrich the story. Hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as Chris Hemsworth, but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial, he is truly terrifying. I can't comment on whether the 3-D effects added anything, as I saw it in 2-D, but regardless, The Avengers was incredible. The one thing I might say was lacking was Iron Man's best friend James Rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name War Machine. We caught a glimpse of that suit in action in Iron Man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and I thought the film was worse off for it. Still, very exciting, highly entertaining, and one great ride. See it.",8,2,6,24 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Fair enough, for a fourth installment
","Free of his debt to Davy Jones, we join Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in the process of rescuing a trusted shipmate from the Royal executioners. When that fails, the crown attempts to coerce him into setting sail for the fabled fountain of youth. However, while Jack is in possession of neither ship nor crew, (and the film is without former cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who elected to pursue other projects) Sparrow's captors are under the impression that he has a ship and is presently amassing a crew. Sparrow investigates and discovers someone impersonating him for their own purposes. A woman, of all things. In fact, a woman from his past by the name of Angelica (played by Penelope Cruz). Clearly the story is complicated and the viewer is asked to make many accommodations where plausibility and time are concerned. That said, it's a well-executed successor to the three previous films, the action is entertaining and the cast is, for the most part, more than adequate. A great time at the movies.",7,0,1,24 November 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Surprisingly good
","Imagine yourself on the eve of your first day of high school. If you'd prefer not to, I get it, believe me. What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of. There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it greatly and encourage others to see it at their earliest possible convenience.",8,4,8,31 January 2013
Source Code," Time-bending thriller
","'Suspension of disbelief'. It's an agreement between viewers and the people who take it upon themselves to entertain us. We all know its fake but put that aside for the short time they've asked for our attention. In this latest Jake Gyllenhaal film, that agreement is stretched to its absolute limit and for some, beyond. Gyllenhaal plays army captain Colter Stevens who's suddenly found himself on a train across from woman who keeps referring to him by another name. Additionally, she's talking to him as if she knows him. After a relatively short time the train meets with a catastrophe and Stevens is in a confined area staring up at a monitor being asked to explain the events. Still struggling with memory issues, he's given the assignment, 'find the perpetrator', and returned to the same situation. This series of events occurs several times in a way that would more likely remind many viewers of Vantage Point, assuming there are many people who saw it. That said, it isn't intent on inspiring a debate on the time traveler's paradox or parallel universes. It's a whodunit adrenaline ride made to entertain and it does just that.",7,0,0,24 November 2012
Skyfall," Best Bond Yet
","A hard drive containing the names of undercover agents embedded in terrorist organizations is now up for sale and you suffered a near fatal injury trying to stop it. What would it take to send you back into the fray? Money, love, fear?James Bond (played by Daniel Craig for the third time) and fellow MI6 agent Eve (played by Naomie Harris) have tracked a thief carrying a stolen hard drive with confidential information to a train. After an exhausting chase and an epic amount of destruction, Bond and the thief are locked in a physical struggle. With the thief in her sights, Eve (Harris), on orders from M (played by Judi Dench for the seventh time) takes the shot, misses, and sends 007 plummeting to the water below while the hard drive and the thief are lost. M (Dench) is summoned before a government committee where one member, Gareth Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes), encourages her to retire. While en route to MI6 headquarters, their servers are breached and, while M watches helplessly in traffic, their offices are destroyed killing several agents. Bond, having taken his fall from the tracks as an opportunity to retire, learns of the attack while watching television in a bar. His return to government service is typically atypical. He breaks into M's home, reports for duty, and asks how he can be of service. Before returning to duty, Bond must submit to both a physical and a psychological exam. Despite failing both, a desperate M puts Bond back in the field, for lack of a better idea. This being a Bond movie, there is, of course, a great deal more to the story. The moment we are introduced to the true villain, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) marks the Bond series' return to cinematic greatness. Bardem is truly terrifying and every time you think you've figured out his master plan, he shocks you. The introduction of Ben Whishaw as 007's liaison to Q branch breathes new life into an element of the franchise that I assumed had simply been abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn. I understand that many Bond fans saw Quantum of Solace as a failure. Putting aside the fact that I was not one of them, this is easily the best Bond film since Craig assumed the role of lead actor, in my opinion. No fan of the franchise should miss seeing Skyfall in theaters. It is brilliant.",8,2,9,7 December 2012
The Hunger Games," Highly entertaining
","Surrounding the capital city of a nation in ruins, are twelve separate districts that are all over-populated by desperate residents. How do you pacify such angry citizens? Simple: Reality television. No, not Jersey Shore, something much worse. Or better, depending on how you look at it.Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence of Winter's Bone and X - Men: First Class) is a skilled tracker, hunter, and survivalist who lives in the impoverished District 12 where most earn their living in the mines. Her mother (played by Paula Malcolmson) has been struggling since her husband died, leaving her to raise Katniss and her sister Prim by herself. Katniss (Lawrence) is sixteen and a close friend of Gale Hawthorne (played by Liam Hemsworth) who dreams of running away. Every year, each of the twelve districts randomly selects two children (one boy and one girl) or 'tributes' no younger than 12 and no older than 18 and Gale (Hemsworth) believes he's dodged the bullet as long as he can. Still, when the tributes are selected, Gale is spared and so is Katniss. But when Prim (Katniss's sister) is chosen. Katniss volunteers to take her place. Making her and Peeta Melark, (a baker's son portrayed by Jess Hutcherson of Bridge to Terabithia and Journey to the Center of the Earth) the candidates for the 74th annual, winner-take-all, death match known as The Hunger Games. Held in the Capital, The Hunger Games are broadcast live to the entire nation. Each participant is trained, sponsored, and ranked and then locked in a massive, futuristic Coliseum with remote control hazards, predators, and cameras hidden throughout.Now, this was a much-anticipated film. I was greatly intrigued by the trailers, but Twilight was also much-anticipated and no matter how much love it gets from the audience, I haven't even been able to sit through the first installment. Then, I saw the generally positive response from critics and took it upon myself to see this highly entertaining, dramatic effort and I urge those out there who haven't seen it to do so at there earliest possible convenience. This is a great film.",8,1,5,24 November 2012
Argo," Affleck is now 3 for 3
","A hostile nation is holding 52 members of the embassy staff hostage. While the majority of the State Department is focused on those hostages, six members of the embassy staff have sought refuge with the Canadian ambassador. How would you get them out? Could you get them out?Thanks to the U.S. allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in America, the Iranian people storm the American embassy on November 4, 1979. The staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files. The majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed. The State Department begins planning a rescue and asks the CIA to consult. It's abundantly clear to the Agency's 'exfiltration' specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat. As a lead actor, Affleck has had some notable flops. Gigli and Surviving Christmas among them. As the director of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo, however, he is now three for three. You should definitely see this movie.",8,3,6,6 December 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Funny the way it should be
","Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell) is happy in his marriage and dotes on his two children. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is dedicated to the pursuit of one-night stands with beautiful women. And Hannah (Emma Stone) is a soon-to-be lawyer in love with a man who her best friend believes is beneath her but who Hannah (Stone) is genuinely hoping will propose. But Weaver (Carrell) is blindsided when his wife of more than 20 years, (played by Julianne Moore) confesses she's been unfaithful and wants a divorce.We soon find Cal Weaver living in an apartment spending an inordinate amount of time at a local pickup joint drinking heavily and repeatedly stating the particulars of his wife's infidelity to the establishment's clientele. This puts a serious crimp in Jacob's evening and so he offers his advice and services as a life coach, of sorts. Meanwhile, he's made several overtures to Hannah only to be rejected every time.I'll admit, there are few moments where the characters find themselves in situations so embarrassing, that I can't bear to watch. That said, this is easily the best comedy I've seen this summer, and perhaps this year. Good premise, great characters, and amazing twists you do not see coming. Loved it.",8,1,2,24 November 2012
Ted," Hardly profound, yet brilliantly funny
","Have you ever had a friend who held you back? Someone who encouraged you to blow off your responsibilities and abuse drugs? What if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be? What would you do?John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film. Not particularly intelligent, mind you, but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star? Shakespeare? I won't say it's perfect; it isn't. I will say it was worth the price. See it.",7,1,3,24 November 2012
Horrible Bosses," Hilarious
","Nick, Dale, and Kurt are all years into their careers and have found themselves in an all-too-common situation. They hate their superiors. Nick (Jason Bateman) works for someone intent on keeping him under his boot till one of them dies or ruining his career should he ever decide to quit. Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), after his longtime boss, a man he genuinely liked and respected, dies, is working for his boss's unqualified, obnoxious, drug-addicted son (Colin Farrell). Dale (Charlie Day) is a dental hygienist whose boss (Jennifer Anniston) is sexually harassing him in addition to molesting her anesthetized patients. Drowning their sorrows, they all ruminate on the idea of how much better their lives would be if their bosses were dead. Next thing they know, they're devising a master plan with the help of a 'murder consultant' (Jamie Foxx) whose real first name is barely mentioned and whose nickname is an expletive. Saying anymore about the story would give away too much. While the top-tier talent is relegated to the antagonists, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis bring the most to the film, comedically. And the writers, one of whom has a near-forgettable role as a co-worker of Bateman's character, should be congratulated. This is easily the best comedy of the summer.",8,0,1,24 November 2012
Life of Pi," Wonderous
","What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator. We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.",8,4,8,20 December 2012
21 Jump Street," Irreverent and hilarious
","What happens when you take an overweight, intelligent, socially awkward 'adult' and put him in the same police academy with same emotionally stunted athlete who made his life miserable all through high school?Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) had dyed-blonde hair and braces in the twelfth grade so, naturally, when he attempted to ask out his high school crush, he choked and was shot down anyway. While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because 'the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago'. Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is cliché, is fantastic. If you haven't already, see this movie.",7,1,2,24 November 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Not great
","After a brief opening sequence revealing a startling find in the Arctic, we find ourselves taken back to the height of World War II. A Nazi officer (Hugo Weaving) and his men lead a raid in order to steal an object of great power and mystery. Simultaneously, in NYC, we see Steve Rogers (played in 98-pound-weakling form a la Benjamin Button by Chris Pine). Rogers (Pine) is being denied the opportunity to serve his country in the military due to various physical issues. Not long after this, however, a mysterious man (Stanley Tucci) offers him the opportunity to be a part of the Army's new super soldier program. And, with a little delay, Captain America is born.Having never read the original comic books, I can't speak to their endearing qualities. And their timely inception no doubt did a great deal to inspire its readers, but the tone of the film is campy, and I don't believe it was meant to be. In addition, Pine (Captain America) doesn't really have the gravitas to pull of the role. I liked him and his co-stars in The Losers, and he was near brilliant in the irreverent, tragically-underrated masterpiece Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, but both those films had there roots planted in comedy.

Trouble with the Curve," Not Eastwood's best, but nod bad
","Your one surviving parent is slowly losing his sight. You have a very difficult relationship and, at the same time, are coming to a turning point in your own career. What do you do tend to, your career or your family?Gus Lobel (played by Clint Eastwood) is a scout for the Atlanta Braves and has resisted the change occurring in his business and the world around him with every fiber of his being. While his immediate superior and longtime friend Pete (played by John Goodman) values Gus's opinion and defends him against his detractors, one of them is Pete's boss and Gus's ultimate superior. That man, Pete Silver (played by Matthew Lillard) is determined to fire Gus even though he is completely unaware of Gus's failing eyesight. To Silver, a man who relies on statistics and equations over experience and first-hand observation, Gus is a relic of a time gone by. Gus is given one chance, scouting a highly-coveted player in North Carolina, to prove his value to the organization. Pete worries about his friend and so, behind his back, he contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams). Mickey is a lawyer on a partnership track in a prestigious firm with a pressing case on the horizon. She's been told that her handling of this case will determine the outcome of the upcoming partnership vote. Still, despite a strained relationship between the two of them, she chooses to go to her father's aide in rural North Carolina and work in her hotel room and over the internet. When Gus informs Mickey that his eyes are starting to fail him, she begins taking an active role in her father's scouting trip. A task she is well-suited for, after a spending a large portion of her formative years by her father's side on scouting trips. In addition to colleagues Gus has known for many years, there is Johnny Flanagan, a relatively inexperienced scout who Gus recruited into the major leagues and who later suffered a career-ending injury. Johnny (played by Justin Timberlake) thinks of Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor. Some who thought little of the film even took great joy in the very idea of Eastwood's retirement. I was not among them. I won't say this is better than Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby, it isn't. Still, it's an enjoyable film about the endurance of family that also manages to incorporate some timeless wisdom regarding the quintessential American sport. The budding relationship between Mickey and Johnny isn't given as much time, though that's probably for the best.",7,5,8,24 November 2012
Kung Fu Panda 2," Po is Back
","In this animated sequel, we rejoin Po (Jack Black) and the Furious Five in the routine rescue of a small village being stripped of any metal in their possession. While success appeared a forgone conclusion, something Po observes on an opponent leaves him dumbstruck and sends him flashing back to his childhood. Outraged by his combat failure, the Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) inform him that he is not to join them in their duties. Elsewhere, we learn that the party behind the plundering intends to use the metal for raw material in a weapon; a weapon that 'stops kung fu'. Upon hearing that it was a panda that nearly thwarted the effort, he's noticeably unnerved. The reason being that a soothsayer forcibly assisting him long ago told him that a panda would be his undoing. Meanwhile, Po has returned home to his father to unravel the mystery. I don't know if I was expecting a second film after the first one, and it would stand up on it's own without one, but I enjoyed this sequel immensely. The origin story, the identity struggle, the final confrontation and most of the intervening events are highly entertaining. A worthy follow-up.",8,0,1,24 November 2012
Warrior," Better than I ever would've expected
","What happens when you have two separate underdogs fight each other in a winner-take-all competition? You end up hoping neither one of them will lose. That's the situation in this thoroughly engrossing mixed martial arts film. Something I never thought I'd say after teen-filled drama Never Back Down released in 2008 that used unlicensed MMA bouts as a backdrop.Brendan Conlon (played by Joel Edgerton) is a man who gave up fighting professionally for his wife Tess (played by Jennifer Morrison) with whom he now has two daughters. Tommy Riordan (played by Tom Hardy) left home with his mother to escape his father's abuse and joined the Marines after she passed. Brendan (Edgerton) is now staring at a debt he can't overcome thanks to his mortgage and goes back to professional fighting in the form of parking lot bouts with inexperienced opponents. And when a video of one of these bouts on the internet is seen by his boss (Kevin Dunn), the principal of the high school where he teaches science, the winner-take-all event is his only hope to avoid foreclosure and relocation. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, made a promise to the family of a fallen comrade and intends to keep it no matter what that might mean for his competitors. That includes Brendan who is only revealed to be Tommy's brother well into the film.I'm not really a fan of MMA. I had a passing interest in boxing at one time, watching it that is, but it passed. That said, a well-made film can make any sport, with the exception of curling, seem interesting. And while some may see the release of this film as being too soon after the critically-acclaimed 2010 Mark Wahlberg film The Fighter, or as some sort of Rocky rip-off, I see a well-made, well-acted, realistic film about two men determined to fulfill their obligations the best way they know how.

Is there one?Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) is co-owner and writer for Millennium magazine and has recently suffered a professional setback that could bankrupt him and his publication. An unscrupulous man with alleged criminal dealings has won a libel suit that might end his career. Soon after, however, Henrik Vanger (played by Christopher Plummer) makes him an offer.

The family that lives on the same large estate they did during the disappearance and somehow manage to avoid speaking to each other. Blomkvist is promised a substantial salary in addition to evidence that will bring about the demise of the man who brought the libel suit against him. When he asks if he might employ a research assistant, Vanger's (Plummer's) lawyer recommends the woman who did the background check on Blomkvist before they hired him. A troubled loner with a peculiar appearance by the name of Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara).Now I have no doubt that the books on which this film and its 2009 Swedish language predecessor were based on are better than the movie. Not because I've read them. In actuality, I haven't read a book since high school. But since people who do read the books first ALWAYS say that the book is better, then it must be the case. It couldn't possibly be an effort on their part to sound and feel superior. Putting that aside, Craig as Blomkvist was a surprisingly wise choice and Plummer, along with others, make for an intriguing, albeit despicable Vanger family. But the real star is Rooney Mara as the brilliant, beautiful, and unstable Lisbeth. Despite a few small roles in other films and guest appearances in numerous television series, Mara's most recognized for her performance in The Social Network. That role was child's play compared to Lisbeth. This is truly a breakout performance that, one would hope, could bring a slew of bigger roles and a long successful career.",9,1,4,24 November 2012
Bad Teacher," Unoriginal
","She's a teacher and she's bad? Genius! How'd you come up with that? Give that man, or rather those men, gold stars. Yes, it took two men to write this script. And the result? I almost feel stupid typing it.Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey. An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fiancée calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in 'different' movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependent on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've passed this sort of thing. Lowest common denominator drivel.",5,2,6,24 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Awesome
","Can you reboot a franchise that once held the record for largest opening weekend in history? Can you create something original using a character who was first introduced to the world in 1962?Peter Parker, age 4, (played by Max Charles) is playing hide and seek one night when he discovers someone has broken into his father's study. His father, Richard (played by Campbell Scott) sees this and takes some important papers, his wife Mary (played by Embeth Davidtz) and his son to the home of his Aunt May (played by Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). Peter is left in that home for his own safety and never sees his parents again. At least a decade later, Peter (played as a teenager by Andrew Garfield), is being bullied by an athlete named Flash Thompson (played by Chris Zylka) and has a crush on a student named Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone). When Peter returns home at the end of the day, bruised and beaten by Flash, he finds papers in his father's briefcase that show he once worked with a man named Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans). Connors works at a company named Oscorp, so Peter disguises himself as an intern to gain access to the lab and, hopefully, Connors. Little did he know, the tour for new interns was led by Gwen Stacey. She knows immediately that the ID badge that Peter's wearing belongs to someone else, but allows him to continue on the tour regardless. Peter sneaks away from the group and finds a lab filled with genetically-modified spiders that are producing biocable. As is often the case with people who bother animals for no reason, Peter gets bitten. Security eventually finds him and escorts him out of the building. While on the subway, he discovers that he gained far more than knowledge from his visit.Now, I saw the 2002 Spider-Man film starring Tobey Maguire and the 2004 sequel. I liked it initially, but over time, I grew tired of it. I thought 2004's Daredevil was a much better film, despite mixed reviews from moviegoers and critics. Not to mention, I believe Kirsten Dunst gave a less-than-stellar performance as Parker's love interest, Mary Jane Watson. Not to mention the irony of having blonde Kirsten Dunst dye her hair red to play Mary Jane Watson and then having redhead Emma Stone dye her hair blonde to play Gwen Stacey. Forgetting all that for a second, this was a much better film than the one we got from Sam Raimi. Director Marc Webb and company have created something with a much darker, more serious tone, a better story, and a solid conclusion. I enjoyed this film very much.",8,2,4,24 November 2012
The Usual Suspects," Amazing
","You know 'the one that got away'? Everybody has one. For most people, that would refer to a failed romance. For your avid fisherman, it would refer to a fish. To law enforcement professionals, what do you think it means?The film begins on a ship in San Pedro Bay. One man, Dean Keaton (played by Gabriel Byrne) is sitting down and informs someone who proffers a generic 'how you doing, Keaton?' that he can't feel his legs and identifies him as Keyser. Keaton asks the man what time it is and, after answering, the unidentified man shoots him in the head. Said identified man then ignites a trail of gasoline that causes the ship to explode. Cut to a deposition where Roger 'Verbal' Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) explains that the events were the ultimate result of a lineup in New York. Dean Keaton (Byrne), a former police officer and a 'white whale' of sorts for Special Agent Dave Kujan from the U.S Customs Bureau (played by Chazz Palminteri) is arrested in front of potential investors, thwarting his foray into legitimate business. Another criminal, Michael McManus (played by Stephen Baldwin) is arrested in his bed and doesn't bother to open his eyes, let alone stand up or run, when the police break down his door. His partner, Fred Fenster (played by Benicio del Toro) is arrested on the street and does attempt to evade arrest but the attempt itself is rather feeble. Todd Hockney (played by Kevin Pollak) is working on a car in a garage when he is arrested. The police inform him that he is under arrest and Hockney, not very concerned by the presence of the police, reaches under the car for a rag to wipe his face. The police draw their guns, he wipes his face and asks, 'Are you sure you brought enough guys?' We are then shown the lineup and the interrogations that followed. Back in the present, the boat Keaton was on is destroyed and anyone who was on it is dead, or are they?I love, love, love, this movie. Spacey as Verbal is amazing. This is one of those occasions where I have no problem with the awarding of an Oscar. Baldwin was never this good before and, to my knowledge, hasn't been since. The story requires constant attention and, at the same time, only serves to set up the twist at the end. Palminteri's character is relentless in his pursuit of Keaton and the result of that dogged pursuit is a major moment in American cinematic history. Other critics, among them the late, lamented Roger Ebert, were not fans of this film. While I don't wish to disrespect them, they could not be more wrong. If you haven't seen it, you should. Right now.",9,1,2,12 May 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Hilarious
","Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a role you never wanted to play? Constantly subjected to scorn and ridicule simply for performing the only task available to you? What if you could change that?Fix-it Felix Jr. has been a popular game in Litvak's for years. The hero and titular character, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) has a magic hammer that can repair any damage done by the game's villain, Ralph. When the game is over, Felix is given a medal while Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is tossed off the roof by the tenants of the building he failed to destroy. When the arcade closes and the game is turned off, Ralph returns to his home atop a garbage heap in the nearby dump. For recreation, he visits Tapper's, a vintage game that assigns the player the role of a bartender. Also, upon our introduction to the story, Ralph makes his first visit to a support group for video game villains. Among the villains in attendance at Bad-Anon, we see M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter (voiced by Gerald C. Rivers and director Rich Moore respectively), a ghost from Pac-Man (voiced by Kevin Deters), and a zombie (Raymond Persi). During that meeting, he announces he no longer wants to be a bad guy. With the 30th anniversary of Fix-it Felix Jr., the tenants throw a party and 'forget' to invite Ralph. Ralph crashes the party, in every sense of the word, and leaves soon after. Before he's left, he vows to return with a medal, something denied him by Felix and the tenants of the building he destroys. He seizes the opportunity to travel to a new game, a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, when a character from that game passes out in the bathroom. While at the center of Hero's Duty, Ralph is overwhelmed by the violence in modern games and refuses to heed the orders of his superior, Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch). Once the arcade closes and the game ends, Ralph decides to forgo the usual hurdles of Hero's Duty and steal the medal typically awarded to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted. I will say that, as a fan of old-style video games, I would've preferred seeing the character of Ralph travel to more than just the two different games besides his. Regardless of my criticisms, Wreck-It Ralph is hilariously entertaining and fun for viewers of all ages. Check it out.",8,0,1,25 November 2012
Bridesmaids," A lot of laughs
","For everyone whose life has hit rock bottom, or so they thought, we have Annie (played by Kristen Wiig). Working as a jewelry store clerk after suffering a massive business failure and living with two very, to say the least, eccentric fraternal twins despite being chronically late with the rent. Meanwhile, Lillian her best friend (played by Maya Rudolph) is engaged and to a man she's deeply in love with who makes a great living. And as her beast friend, Lillian enlists Annie to act as her maid of honor at her wedding. It's at the engagement party where Annie first meets Helen Harris (Rose Byrne). Helen's husband employs Lillian's fiancée and has become strangely close to her as a result. The other bridesmaids provide little more than comic relief while Helen, who plans on the order of a Martha Stewart clone on steroids, is the antagonist as she seems intent on usurping Annie's role as maid of honor and Lillian's best friend which, given Lillian's impending change of address, appears to be a position that will be vacant soon enough. During all this, Annie's romantic life is complicated by a waning entanglement with a man whose interest in her is mainly physical and a relationship with kind and respectful police officer whom she met thanks to a long-broken taillight. The story isn't all that interesting and the fact that only the audience sees things from Annie's point if view is near infuriating, in my opinion. That said, Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne and company are hilarious as the events depicted, though some seem meant to make the viewers cringe or test their gag reflex which runs counter to my personal taste. Funny, entertaining, and that's about it.",6,1,4,24 November 2012
Django Unchained," Very Entertaining
","What would you do to rescue the woman you love? Fight, maim, kill? What if, after doing all of those things, the one true test left was holding back? Could you? Would you want to?Less than a decade before the Civil War, Django (a slave portrayed by Jamie Foxx) is being escorted, in chains, by his masters, the Speck brothers. They are traveling through a remote, wooded area when they encounter someone unexpected. Their unexpected company is former dentist, Dr. King Schultz. Schultz (portrayed by Christoph Waltz) is looking for a slave formerly owned by men he wishes to find. The slave, it turns out, is Django. The Specks have no intention of surrendering Django to the doctor and make that point very clear. The doctor then kills one Speck brother and leaves the other alive but seriously wounded. Schultz (Waltz) then informs Django that if he can identify the men he's searching for, whom Schultz is hunting in hopes of securing a bounty, and aid in their capture, Schultz will grant Django his freedom and give him $75 and a horse. Schultz also reveals that he despises slavery as a concept. Once the men Schultz was after are found and dealt with, Schultz tells Django that, as he has never given anyone their freedom before, he feels a certain responsibility. The two men become colleagues, hunting fugitives for money. In addition, the former dentist offers to help Django find the one thing he really wants: his wife Broomhilda. Broomhilda (also a slave, portrayed by Kerry Washington) was named by her original owners who were German, like Schultz. She was left scarred by her owners, who were also Django's, and then the two were auctioned separately. After a few inquiries, they learn that Broomhilda is now in the possession of well-known plantation owner and Francophile Calvin Candie and residing with Candie on the plantation counter-intuitively referred to as Candie Land.While some people worship Tarantino's body of work, generally speaking, I can take it or leave it. I didn't like Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, thought Inglorious Basterds was decent but overrated, but loved Jackie Brown. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, has proved his skill time and time and again and, while not every film he's appeared in could be considered quality, the fault rarely, if ever, lies with him. As for Waltz, it is refreshing to see him portray a character with redeeming qualities and he does so very well. DiCaprio, contrastingly, tends to play characters that are, or are at least meant to be, likable. Despite being well-mannered, Calvin Candie is anything but. Even so, his performance is masterful. Critics who dislike this film have come at it from both sides. Some take issue with the film for not depicting slavery seriously. Others see the depiction of Caucasians as villains as the continuation of some sort of disturbing trend. Of course, the fact that Christoph Waltz portrays one of the protagonists would seem to contradict that but, why let logic interfere with an argument? As for what I think, those who suffer typically deserve it and slave masters are shown as vicious because, more often than not, they were. I liked this film and I can't imagine why those who can see this film with an apolitical eye wouldn't.",8,0,1,27 January 2013
Drive," Wheelman extraordinaire
","Precision driving can mean the difference between a long prison sentence and a clean getaway. For the right price and with the right connection, those are services you can obtain once and only once and Ryan Gosling provides them.Starring as a character that is never given a name, Gosling works as a mechanic for Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston) who also allows him to use vehicles brought to his garage for servicing for his illicit activities. In addition, he does the occasional bit of stunt driving for Hollywood films. Not to mention the fact that Shannon's (Cranston's) associate Bernie Rose (played way against type by Albert Brooks) is considering a proposal Shannon made to have Driver race professionally with Bernie (Brooks) as their benefactor. Things appear to be going swimmingly until Driver offers assistance to a neighbor being coerced to perform a robbery. The neighbor, Standard (played by Oscar Isaac), was recently released from prison and fears what his associate will do to his family. A family that Driver became quite close to in the time between when he met them and the day Standard was released.The violence is a little gruesome, and the surreal nature of a character with no name is something that didn't actually strike me until after I left the theater. That said, the story is interesting, the performances spectacular and the general feel of the film is right on target. It is light-years ahead of films like The Transporter that seek to turn their characters into superheroes.",7,2,3,24 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Not a Bourne Movie
","What would you do if the American intelligence community was hunting you? Would you surrender or simply find a dark hole to hide in? Aaron Cross, the main character of the film, doesn't have those options.While the Central Intelligence Agency is in turmoil after the release of confidential Treadstone documents, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is an agent of Treadstone's successor, Operation Outcome. Cross (Renner) is on a training mission in Alaska and arrives at a remote cabin to rendezvous and restock on medications he's taking for reasons that we're not made aware of. In the cabin, he meets another agent named Number Three (played by Oscar Isaac). Their ultimate supervisor, Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton) decides Outcome and the agents in the program are a liability and send a predator drone to destroy the remote Alaskan cabin while activating kill switches in other operatives stationed around the world. After removing his tracking device, Cross force feeds it to a wolf that had been stalking him for reasons beyond understanding and begins his quest for more medication. Elsewhere, at a pharmaceutical company's headquarters, a gunman murders all of his coworkers, with the exception of Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) and then turns the gun on himself. Shearing is understandably shaken after watching one of her coworkers murder all of the others and goes home. The Agency sends a team to Shearing's home to assess her mental state, and assure themselves that she won't reveal confidential information. At least, that's how they got in the door. Once inside, however, they reveal their true purpose, eliminating one more witness who could testify about Outcome. Their attempt is thwarted by Cross and, next thing you know, he and Shearing are on the run together.Now, during press interviews for The Bourne Ultimatum, Matt Damon said that, while he might reprise the role of Jason Bourne sometime in the distant future, he and Paul Greengrass might have to call the next one The Bourne Redundancy. After seeing this film, I believe that should've been the title. Renner had already established himself as an action star and Rachel Weisz is capable, as always. That said this movie takes all the loose ends tied off by the previous films, unties them, and leaves even more simply to allow for the possibility of a sequel. Unless and until Greengrass and Damon reunite for a new film, I'll consider Ultimatum the last film in the Bourne series. Skip it.",6,0,2,6 December 2012
Lincoln," Daniel Day Does It Again
","You make it your mission to rid your nation of its most shameful human rights violation. While fighting a war to achieve that goal, you're simultaneously trying to pass legislation in furtherance of that goal. What if you fail?Abraham Lincoln (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) has brought the south to the edge of defeat in The Civil War but has yet to pass the thirteenth amendment which will outlaw slavery and involuntary servitude. He feels that he can't end the war without first passing the amendment. His cabinet, in contrast, feels they will not be able to pass the amendment if they are not trying to end the war. His Secretary of State, William Seward (played by David Strathairn) tells him that peace and the amendment are mutually exclusive. Debates among congressmen rage on the floor on a constant basis with arguments in favor of abolition being voiced by Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens (played by Tommy Lee Jones) and arguments opposing abolition coming from Fernando Wood (played by Lee Pace) and George H. Pendleton (played by Peter McRobbie). Behind the scenes, operative William N. Bilbo (played by James Spader) is constructing backroom, and in some cases backwoods, deals that will ensure anyone who may vote for the amendment will and anyone who won't will abstain. As far as any struggles Abraham Lincoln is dealing with in his home life, his son, Robert Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Joseph Gordon- Leavitt), has abandoned studies at Harvard to join the Union army. His mother, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Sally Field) is foursquare against the idea of her son going to war, as she is still dealing with the loss of two sons. Edward Baker Lincoln who died in 1850 and William Wallace Lincoln who succumbed to typhoid fever one year prior to the Emancipation Proclamation. I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this movie. Some actors simply play themselves while answering to different names and others disappear into a role. Where Bruce Willis is the former, Daniel Day-Lewis is most definitely the latter. Makeup or no, this is not an actor's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, this is a brilliant man transforming himself into the most courageous politician this country's ever known. Likewise, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a man even more devoted to the cause of abolishing slavery but far less concerned with matters such as tact and courtesy steals every scene he is in. There is no justification for foregoing this movie for this long but, if you haven't seen it yet, you should. It is brilliant.",9,0,2,25 December 2012
Brave," Highly entertaining
","What if you'd been told your whole life that you were destined for something you didn't want? Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first- born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Café. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music. I will say that the ultimate consequence of the main character's actions leave a little something to be desired. Still, a great time.",7,2,3,24 November 2012
Here Comes the Boom," Kevin James scores
","You've been doing the same job for most of your adult life and stopped making an effort a decade ago. Then you hear the news that someone who's been doing the job even longer and still makes an effort is about to be fired. Do you let it happen?Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) is a 42 year- old biology teacher. Ten years ago, he was given a Teacher of the Year award but when we join the story, he's sleeping late, making little or no effort in the classroom and seen as an embarrassment by the principal, Mr. Betcher (played by Greg Germann). When Betcher (Germann) catches him sneaking into class late via the classroom window, he gives Voss parking lot duty and strips him of a vacation day. Rather than accept more work that he's in no way interested in doing, he tries to find someone to fill in for him. His colleague, Marty, the music teacher (played by Henry Winkler) is more than willing to assume the responsibility but also a little shaken by the news that his wife is pregnant. Later, at a school board budget meeting, he's given the even more troubling news that thanks to budget problems, the music program is in jeopardy. Voss, despite his long-standing apathy, offers to raise money to save the music program and his colleague's job. He resumes the job of teaching citizenship classes in night school but sees that the wages would make it near-impossible to earn the money in time. One of his students, Niko (played by Bas Rutten) asks for additional tutoring and Voss agrees, reluctantly. It is during a tutoring session at Niko's apartment that Voss, who wrestled in college, sees a mixed martial arts match, learns that the loser was paid $10,000, and decides he can raise the money by joining this very punishing sport.Now, the last Kevin James movie that I saw in theaters was Zookeeper. I wasn't impressed. I won't say that Here Comes the Boom was impressive, but it was easily a step up from Zookeeper. Also, naming the movie after what would eventually become the main character's theme song isn't particularly creative. Still, I was entertained. Watching an overweight 42 year-old enter the ring and take serious punishment over and overand over was hilarious and watching the effect his decision to make an effort had, not just on him but on the entire cast of characters, was bizarrely uplifting. I don't imagine James or any of his co-stars will receive awards for their work in this film, but I liked it and you might too.",7,27,34,6 December 2012
The Hangover Part II," Inferior follow-up
","They're all back, they're in Thailand, and they don't remember a thing. Again. Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha all return in this sequel to the wildly successful 2009 comedy. This time it's Stu (Helms) who is about to be married and his friends are in Thailand for the wedding with Alan (Galifianakis) being brought along out of pity. However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens. And while a member of the party is, again, missing, this time it's his future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) who is nowhere to be found. And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of 'green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a 'green comedy'. Whatever aesthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film.",6,0,1,24 November 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Absolutely brilliant
","How many bad relationships have you had? Relationships that keep you from moving forward for one reason or another? What if someone offered you a simple solution that would only take one evening and cost a nominal fee? Would you take it?When we first meet Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey), he's waking up in his home, wearing pajamas he doesn't recognize. It's Valentine's Day and, rather than go to work, he makes a spur of the moment decision to visit Montauk. As is typically the case with beach communities in the off-season, Montauk is deserted. Then, unexpectedly, Joel sees a woman on the beach. He wonders why he 'falls in love with every woman' he sees who shows him 'the slightest bit of attention'. He encounters the same woman when he orders breakfast at a local restaurant and then, one final time, on the train home. The woman (played by Kate Winslet) introduces herself without any prompting. Her name is Clementine and she and Joel are getting off at the same stop. Their initial interaction makes Joel rather uncomfortable, he being the quiet, reserved type while Clementine is very outgoing and gives little thought to other peoples' opinions of her. Additionally, she has great disdain for generic adjectives like 'nice', a word Joel uses more than once during their time on the train. When Joel spots Clementine walking home he offers to give her a ride and she accepts. When they arrive at her apartment, Clementine invites Joel up to her place for a drink and, despite the differences between them, or maybe as a result of them, Joel is intrigued. They take a late night trip to see the frozen Charles River and their romance progresses. The following morning, they arrive at Clementine's once again, Joel driving while Clementine slept, and she asks if they can go to his place and sleep there. She enters her apartment to retrieve some personal items and Joel, waiting in the car, is approached by a stranger who inquires as to why Joel is there. The conversation is awkward and short. Then, Clementine returns and they depart. Next, the credits begin rolling and we are shown an obviously distraught Joel. That is when the story really begins.I go back and forth on the subject of non-linear storytelling. There are some stories that seek to make themselves seem interesting by showing the elements out of order and others that are genuinely enhanced by jumping from one point in time to another. I believe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind falls in the second category. The creative manner by which they depict those elements of the story that take place within the mind of the main character, the subplots involving the unprincipled technicians performing the procedure add a whole new dimension to an already engrossing tale. Carrey and Winslet are both at the top of their games and, in my opinion, Carrey was never better before and hasn't been since. This is an amazing movie. See it.",9,0,1,7 April 2013
The Artist," Thunderous silence
","With every change in technology and popular tastes, there are those who are left by the wayside when they are unable or unwilling to adapt. And, in contrast, there are those who quickly find themselves better off than they were before. We, of course, know what happens to the latter, but what of the former?On his way into the theater for the premiere of his latest film, silent movie star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) encounters young aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) and the two are photographed by the many reporters by the entrance. By the next day, Miller (Bejo) is on the cover of Variety with the headline 'Who's That Girl?' Valentin's spouse, Doris (played by Penelope Ann Miller) is annoyed while Peppy (Bejo) is ecstatic. When she auditions for a role in Valentin's next movie, the studio is hesitant while Valentin is insistent. Over time, Miller's popularity increases to the point where she no longer needs Valentin's patronage. In the same amount of time, Al Zimmer (played by John Goodman), the head of the studio holding Valentin's contract, announces they will be halting production on silent films in favor of sound. Valentin believes sound is a fad and decides to produce his next silent film without the studio. Only to have the opening go unnoticed thanks to Peppy Miller's latest offering being released on the same day.I haven't seen any of Dujardin's or Bejo's previous films. And, while I recognized members of the supporting cast, their roles were much less significant. Also, given that the majority of the film is silent, it was an unusual experience. I was tempted to switch on my iPod at times, but somehow I didn't think AC/DC was compatible with the tone the film was trying to set. Leaving all that aside, this is a brilliant film and I enjoyed it immensely. Though I would hope it's not the beginning of a trend as silent films could be disastrous in the hands of less competent professionals. See this movie.",9,2,3,24 November 2012
Super 8," Old-school Sci-fi
","A factory accident in the small town of Lillian, Ohio leaves an emotionally distant man (Kyle Chandler) a widower and his son without the one parent he could relate to. At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train. Written and directed by J. J. Abrams of Lost fame and with Steven Spielberg co-producing, Super 8 is easily a step above efforts like Cloverfield and Artificial Intelligence while falling just short of films like E.T., Super 8 is a welcomed addition to the sci-fi genre and a great time to be had at the movies.",8,0,1,24 November 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," Very Good
","Have you ever felt like a disappointment to everyone you know? Someone your parents and peers think of as an anchor dragging the rest of them down or as a mere inconvenience? How do you get past that?Berk is a small, Viking village located near the Arctic Circle. At least, that's an assumption I made based on the main character's statement that 'it snows nine months of the year and hails the other three'. That main character, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the only son of the village chief, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler). The village is under near-constant siege by outside forces. Those outside forces being dragons. Hiccup (Baruchel) is short, slim, and in no way strong. The one trade all villagers learn in their lifetime is the art of hunting and killing dragons. Gobber (Hiccup's employer and the proprietor of the village armory, voiced by Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup stop all of 'this' while gesturing to all of him. Gobber (Ferguson) is a man who has lost several limbs over the years, all during encounters with dragons. Hiccup, being seriously lacking in physical strength, designs and constructs a machine to propel the weapons that the other villagers simply throw by hand. Of course, during a trial run in front of Gobber, the machine strikes a villager. Hiccup takes that same apparatus to a mountaintop, fires on one of the few species of dragon that's never been captured or seen and, miraculously, causes that dragon to fall to earth. Overjoyed by this victory, Hiccup shouts in triumph but is soon set upon by a species of dragon that can breathe fire and produce fire throughout its entire body. He's rescued by his father who expresses disappointment in his son and disbelief in Hiccup's claim to have landed a blow against a Night Fury. He treks through the woods the next day, determined to find proof of his accomplishment, but finds something far more significant.Now, unlike a lot of 'adults' I maintain my affection for 'children's' movies. This is not to say that I like all, or even most, children's movies. For example, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Eight Crazy Nights disappointed me to a degree that I cannot express in words. But, in spite of its flaws or maybe because of them, I loved How to Train Your Dragon. Casting Baruchel as Hiccup was genius. Hiccup's peers, voiced by Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara and others, fit the roles they're given perfectly. If you have children who haven't seen this movie, you should take steps to remedy that. If you don't have children but can enjoy movies that are produced for them, like I do, check it out.",8,2,3,27 May 2013
Jack Reacher," Not bad
","Have you ever seen someone who you know deserved to rot in jail get away with it? What if they somehow wound up committing the exact same crime? Could you let them get away with that a second time? I doubt it.When we first join the characters, we find ourselves in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A sniper attack ends the lives of five seemingly random people. With an abundance of evidence against him, the police arrest and charge former Army sharpshooter James Barr (played by Joseph Sikora). Rather than confess and throw himself on the mercy of the court, the way District Attorney Alex Rodin (played by Richard Jenkins) and his lead investigator, Detective Emerson (played by David Oyelowo) would like, he writes 'find Jack Reacher' on a piece of paper and that's the last we hear from him for sometime. Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) is a former military police officer who served with distinction and all but vanished from the earth once he left the service. The D.A. and lead investigator ask how they're supposed to find someone like that and just as one of the characters says 'you don't find him, he finds you' he shows up at their office. By this time, perhaps as a result of misconduct on the part of police and prison officials, James Barr is in a coma. His lawyer, Helen Rodin (defense attorney and daughter of the District Attorney played by Rosamund Pike) introduces herself to Jack Reacher and asks him to work as her investigator. Reacher tells Rodin how he and Barr first became acquainted. Barr, a sharpshooter who never fired a single shot during a battle scenario, has been trained for a task he was never ordered to attempt. He, out of desperation, kills several men who are completely unknown to him. As it turns out, those men were civilian contractors and Barr killed them as they were concluding a rape rally. Barr was acquitted and Reacher, certain he will commit a similar crime in the future, vowed to be there when he did.I wouldn't call myself a Tom Cruise fan. I've seen films he was in that I liked (examples include A Few Good Men, the Mission: Impossible series, and Collateral) and I've seen him in movies I hated (Knight and Day, War of the Worlds, Vanilla Sky). I would consider myself a Rosamund Pike fan; however I have only seen two other films in which she appeared (Die Another Day and The Big Year). I wouldn't call Jack Reacher a masterpiece or some sort of reemergence of Cruise's career, but it was very entertaining and I'm glad I saw it. If you're an action fan, you should see it too.",7,2,7,22 February 2013
Les Misérables," Quality
","Could you build a new life with mistakes of your past haunting you? What if you had to do it more than once? Everyone has a breaking point. What if you reached yours and had further to go?Jean Valjean (portrayed by Hugh Jackman) stole bread to feed his starving family and, while serving his sentence, tried to escape. So, nineteen years after his initial incarceration, a guard known simply as Javert informs him that he is free to go. Javert (played by Russell Crowe) believes that Valjean (Jackman) is a born criminal and that he will return to jail eventually. After spending almost twenty years in prison, Valjean is unable to find work and resorts to sleeping on the street. He is taken in by a bishop and spends a night in a church. He steals the church's silver in the night and is arrested but the bishop lies to the authorities, claiming the silver was a gift, thereby facilitating Valjean's release. Valjean breaks parole and is reborn as an honest man but Javert vows to find and arrest him. Eight years after the bishop's kind act, Jean has become a factory owner and the mayor of a small town. One of his workers, Fantine (portrayed by Anne Hathaway), is exposed as an unwed mother and fired by her lecherous foreman. Fantine (Hathaway), with no other options, resorts to prostitution to support herself and send whatever she has left to her daughter Cosette. Seen arguing with a customer by the rigidly moral Javert, who is now police inspector, Fantine seems destined for imprisonment. Luckily, Valjean intervenes and brings Fantine to a hospital. Despite initial suspicions that the mayor is Valjean, Javert arrests another man he believes to be Valjean and offers the mayor his resignation. Valjean declines, exonerates the man believed to be him and goes on the run. Rather than concerning himself solely with his own freedom, Valjean seeks out the daughter of the now-deceased Fantine who is being 'cared for' by a pair of unscrupulous innkeepers. Those innkeepers (portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) extort a large sum of money before allowing Valjean to leave with Cosette and then inform the police who are hot on his trail. Nine years later, Cosette (who has, of course, grown and is now portrayed by Amanda Seyfried) is still being cared for by Valjean and, after a chance encounter with a revolutionary, falls in love instantly. That revolutionary (Marius, portrayed by Eddie Redmayne) is the object of a one-sided crush by the daughter of Cosette's former caretakers. Her name is Eponine (played by Samantha Barks) and while she has little or no interest in politics, she joins Marius's revolution almost immediately.I can go either way where musicals are concerned. I couldn't stand Chicago, but I loved Dreamgirls and eventually bought it on DVD. Also, while I'd heard of it before and knew it was a musical, my first introduction to the story of Les Miserables was a film starring Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush which altered the original story and abandoned the musical aspect. I really liked this film. All the actors in this film, to varying degrees, are competent singers. In fact, Anne Hathaway was shockingly good. What I liked better about the Liam Neeson film is that it supplied explanations. Even so, if you can appreciate musicals, you should see Les Miserables.",8,2,4,31 January 2013
In Time," Great idea, mediocre execution
","Everyone is on a clock. What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.'Time is money' was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to 'money is time' is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.",6,59,69,24 November 2012
Thor," Entertaining, but by the book
","The film opens in a realm and/or planet far removed from Earth and human existence. We're given a brief overview of the major events in its history and then we're introduced to its royal family battlefield conqueror, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). After disobeying his father, Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is banished to Earth and stripped of his godlike abilities. Enter Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not- so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth. I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least. The 'earthlings', are good enough as are those from Thor's home planet and the story is about what I expect. It's not amazing, it's not awful. Basically, it's just a good time at the movies.",6,10,20,24 November 2012
Taken 2," Not bad for a sequel
","How do you come back from the worst experience in your life? Therapy, denial, maybe some substance abuse? What if, after a relatively short amount of time, you're flung back into a very similar circumstance? I don't imagine that would help.Sometime after returning to the relative safety of Los Angeles, Bryan Mills (played by Liam Neeson), his ex-wife Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) and their daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace) are still rebounding from the trauma they suffered. Bryan (Neeson) arrives at Kim's home to give her a driving lesson only to be informed that she is not even in the house. She's with her boyfriend. A boyfriend Bryan knew nothing about, no less. Simultaneously, in Tropoje, Albania, Murad Hoxha, father of deceased kidnapper and human trafficker Marko Hoxha, is attending a funeral service being conducted for his son and his accomplices. Murad (played by Rade Serbedzija) vows to avenge the deaths of his son and his friends. After hearing that a planned vacation to China is cancelled by Lenore's now estranged husband, Bryan invites both Kim and Lenore to join him on a business trip in Istanbul once he's fulfilled his professional obligations. They arrive sooner than expected and, unbeknownst to them, followed by Murad's henchman. Following a family lunch in the marketplace, Kim returns to the hotel. It's immediately apparent to Bryan and Lenore that their daughter hopes privacy and the exotic locale will rekindle feelings of love in her long-divorced parents. While romance does seem to be in bloom between the couple, it is abruptly halted when Murad and his men make their play for the Mills family.Now, I was and still am a huge fan of the 2008 film. I believe Neeson took a film that would've seemed dull and uninspired in the hands of Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, or any other contemporary action star and elevated it beyond the material. This film, while entertaining and plausible enough for an action/adventure, is the lesser of the two. Of course, there's the fact that it's more of the same and, therefore, less interesting. In addition, while the original depended on Neeson's estimable talent, this film relies heavily on Maggie Grace. A competent actress, sure, but nowhere near as good as Liam Neeson. I enjoyed it about as much as I expected to. That's it.",7,1,2,29 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Not as good as its predecessor
","You sacrifice your name, your body, the love of your life to achieve one goal. You achieved it, but someone later puts those achievements at risk. What do you do? Come out of hiding or run?Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) has abandoned the cape and mask so that Batman could never be arrested and prosecuted for the crimes committed by Harvey Dent that he took the fall for. He's been living like a recluse for eight years while Commissioner James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) has all but extinguished violent crime in Gotham. Gordon wants to reveal the truth during a celebration honoring Harvey Dent but decides the city isn't ready for it. At that same celebration, a congressman is abducted and, while investigating the crime, Gordon is shot. The patrolman who rescues him, John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promoted to detective and told he's to report directly the Commissioner. Blake (Gordon-Levitt) knows Batman's true identity and pleads with Wayne to once again don the cape and mask. Commissioner Gordon echoes those sentiments when Wayne, incognito, visits him in the hospital. The kidnapper, a terrorist and mercenary intent on destroying the city, is Bane. Bane (played by Tom Hardy) was once a member of the League of Shadows before being expelled by his and Bruce Wayne's mentor, Ra's al Ghul. Bane was hired by a competitor of Wayne Enterprises, John Daggett (played by Ben Mendelsohn). We're also introduced to a master thief working with Bane, Selina Kyle (played by Anne Hathaway) who is, of course, Catwoman, though she's never addressed by that name.I was a latecomer to Nolan's new take on the Batman story. I saw The Dark Knight in theaters, but I didn't catch Batman Begins, the first film in the series, until it began airing on cable. Once I did, I bought the DVD. I bought The Dark Knight on DVD the day of its release. Bale as Batman was amazing in the first two films and he is just as good, if not better, in the third. Hardy as Bane is nowhere near as mesmerizing as Heath Ledger's interpretation of The Joker, but he is far more intimidating. Hathaway as Catwoman is the best version of this character that I have seen to date. Of course, the other versions, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry, were beautiful but one-dimensional. I was hoping this film would be better than its predecessor. Perhaps it's the notion that this means the story is over, but I thought The Dark Knight was the best in the series. That said, Rises is brilliant and anyone who's seen the previous films should see this latest one as soon as possible.",8,0,3,24 November 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Murray does it again, finally
","Have you ever looked at someone and, in an instant, felt a powerful connection to them? Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast- forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public. I, however, enjoyed it a great deal.",8,0,1,24 November 2012
Flight," Denzel Washington shines
","After an amazing display, the world hails you as a hero. But, even with that, you still might spend the rest of your life in prison. What do you do? Obscure the truth and save yourself or admit the truth and face the music?Captain William 'Whip' Whitaker (played by Denzel Washington) is an airline pilot with impeccable skills and a personal life in shambles. After a night of intimacy and intoxicants, Whitaker and flight attendant Katerina Marquez wake up and prepare themselves for a scheduled flight to Atlanta. Whitaker greets his co- pilot, the naÃ¯ve and devoutly religious Ken Evans (played by Brian Geraghty), and flight attendant Margaret Thomason (played by Tamara Tunie) and then prepares for take-off. After deftly piloting the plane through turbulence, Whitaker mixes himself a drink, turns on the auto- pilot, and goes to sleep. The plane goes into a steep dive as it approaches Atlanta which rouses Whitaker from his slumber. Both Whitaker and Evans attempt to halt or at least slow the plane's descent, unsuccessfully. Whitaker then decides to roll the plane so that they might glide in at a safer angle. During the maneuver, Katerina (Whitaker's companion from the previous evening played by Nadine Velazquez) unbuckles her seatbelt to help a child who's been unseated thanks to the maneuver. In the interim, the engines flame out and the plane is now gliding to earth. Whitaker turns the plane right side-up, the plane crashes, and Whitaker loses consciousness. Now injured, Whitaker wakes up in an Atlanta hospital and is met by a friend and representative of the pilots' union named Charlie Anderson. Anderson (played by Bruce Greenwood) tells Whitaker that of the 102 people on board, 96 survived the crash. Katerina, with whom Whitaker had spent the night preceding the crash, was among the six fatalities. Whitaker's injured but will leave the hospital in a matter of days. While in the hospital, he meets another patient named Nicole Maggen while smoking in the stairwell. Maggen (played by Kelly Reilly) is in the hospital as a result of an overdose that occurred as the plane was crashing. After the hospital releases him and he is picked up by friend, neighbor and dealer Harling Mays (played by John Goodman), Whitaker elects to avoid the press by staying at a farm owned by his deceased father that he has been trying to sell. He drives to a meeting with an airline where a lawyer named Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle) tells Whitaker that a blood test performed after the crash showed Whitaker was under the influence and that he could face prison time, no matter what the ultimate cause of the crash. Whitaker is the very definition of an anti-hero. While he succeeds in saving the majority of the crew and the passengers, he struggles with a myriad of personal issues including alcoholism and cocaine addiction. Goodman's character, while he is a supplier, is hardly a salesman. He simply serves the needs of a demanding customer. The character of Nicole Maggen offers little more than perspective as we watch her turn her life around while Whitaker continues down a dark road and attempts to take her with him. Cheadle and Greenwood play morally ambiguous characters who know Whitaker broke the law but hope to keep that a secret. While this may not be as triumphant as director Robert Zemeckis's last live-action film, Cast Away, it's a well-made, well- written, well-acted film and I'm glad I saw it.",8,2,3,6 December 2012
Pitch Perfect," I didn't hate it, but...
","What if your only goal in attending college was to appease your father so he'll subsidize your true ambitions? Would you simply slack off and plan the future you really want? Or would you find a group of students anxious to have you and stick it out?During the opening scene of the film, we're introduced to the Bellas, an all-girl a capella group from the fictional Barden College who are performing at Lincoln Center. During a solo, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp) vomits on stage and turns the Bellas into a national joke. The following semester, new student Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick) meets Aubrey (Camp) and Chloe (played by Brittany Snow) who are desperate to rebound from their previous embarrassment. Becca (Kendrick), however, is only biding time in college to please her father while composing mash-ups on the laptop in her dorm room. Conversely, Fat Amy (played by Australian comedic actress Rebel Wilson) is confident in her singing ability and anxious to join the Bellas, who used to be composed solely of traditionally beautiful co-eds with vocal talent. Then, while singing in the shower, Beca's talent is discovered by her dorm-mate Chloe. While Beca is noticeably unnerved by the uninvited presence of another nude member of the student body, Chloe refuses to leave until Beca joins her in song. After discovering the fact that Becca has yet to attend a single class, her father (a professor at Barden played by John Benjamin Hickey) tells her that if she wants him to pay her way to Los Angeles she must attend her classes and join at least one student organization. Despite performing Cups at her audition, Beca's invited to join the Bellas along with Fat Amy and the nearly inaudible Lily (played by Hana Mae Lee). And so began a new season for the Bellas under the dictatorial direction the veteran performer with a nervous stomach, Aubrey.Now, I wasn't expecting much a movie intent on lampooning something whose ridiculous nature is pretty self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked. Beca's unfiltered contempt for college clichés and the majority of the student body inspires a lot of laughs. At the same time, the gross-out factor is in full-effect during this music- oriented comedy and I don't really care for that kind of humor. Also, Beca's rejection of Jesse (a kindhearted coworker at the campus radio station played by Skylar Astin) wear thin long before she relents. Since the problem I have with this film is essentially the same as the one I had with Bridesmaids, I'll give it the same score.",7,2,6,25 November 2012
Looper," Good film
","What is the perfect crime? I don't know if killing men sent from the future, and therefore unidentifiable, qualifies, but it's certainly close. Of course, if you should screw up somehow, those same people would know immediately. What then?It's 2044, and while time travel has yet to be invented, those in the future use it to their advantage by sending individuals who threaten their business interests back to that time where they can be eliminated by men awaiting their arrival. The men who execute these unfortunate individuals are known as loopers. Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) is one such man. Simmons (Gordon- Leavitt) is in the employ of a mafia boss in Kansas City who he calls Abe (played by Jeff Daniels). Abe (Daniels) was sent back in time to manage the organization's hired guns as well as their other illicit operations as only someone from the future is uniquely equipped to do. When loopers have outlived their usefulness, they are sent back to be executed their younger self who receive payment in the form of gold rather than the customary silver. This is referred to as 'closing your loop'. In his spare time, Joe abuses drugs, maintains an intimate relationship with a showgirl named Suzie (played by Piper Perabo), frequents a club owned by his employer and is studying French to prepare for his eventual retirement in France. Things start going awry when Seth (Joe's friend and a fellow looper played by Paul Dano) is confronted with the task of closing his loop and fails. His superiors are more than a little displeased by this and so Seth goes to Joe, hoping his friend will hide him. Eventually, Seth is found, maimed, and his now disfigured older self is executed. This is after Seth and Joe both learn that a crime boss known only as The Rainmaker is behind the recent rash of closing loops. As Joe resumes his usual routine, he too is given the task of closing his loop when his older self (portrayed by Bruce Willis) appears before him. Joe's younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film.",8,0,2,6 December 2012
50_50," Cancer comedy that's actually funny
","You're in a job you like, in denial about your struggling relationship, and you're not particularly close to your parents as your father is suffering from Alzheimer's and your mother is so much more emotional than you are that it's difficult to carry on a conversation with her. Then you get the news that changes your whole life. Is that the makings of a comedy? Will Reiser thought so and it's inspired by his life.Adam Lerner (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a producer for public television whose live-in girlfriend Rachael (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is a struggling artist. While they were not talking about it, it appears a break-up is inevitable. Adam's best friend Kyle (played by Seth Rogen) is urging him towards the door but Adam is unconvinced. Then, during a doctor's appointment he made to resolve back pains that wouldn't go away, he's given the news. He has a tumor on his spine and if he doesn't subject himself to chemotherapy and then surgery, he'll die. Kyle (Rogen) is determined to keep his friend in a positive mindset. Rachael (Howard) is given an out but doesn't take it and decides, instead, to remain with Adam and is supportive, at least at first. Meanwhile, his insurance also covers visits to a psychologist. That ends up being something of a double-edged sword as the in-house psychologist, Katherine McKay (played by Anna Kendrick), is very inexperienced.This is the second film in just over two years to feature a comedic take on a serious illness and Seth Rogen in a significant role. The first being 2009's Funny People with Adam Sandler. Having seen both, I can say unequivocally that 50/50 is not just a better film, but a great film. There are solid performances from all the cast, an interesting story and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't appear too good to be true. See this immediately.",8,0,1,24 November 2012
Cloud Atlas," Not as good as Cast Away, but...
","Who among us doesn't want to be remembered? To make an impact that will last lifetimes? It turns out everyone's life does, just not necessarily the way you might like or to the degree you might hope, or so says this latest offering from the creators of The Matrix trilogy based on a novel of the same name by David Mitchell.Chronologically, the first character we're introduced to is Adam Ewing. Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) is an American lawyer travelling to the South Pacific to conduct business on behalf of his father-in-law. He witnesses the enslavement of the native islanders, offers passage to one who stows away on the ship, Autua (played by David Gyasi) and falls ill as a result of exposure to a parasite. Once incapacitated by his illness, Ewing is 'cared for' by the maniacal Dr. Henry Goose (played by Tom Hanks). Eighty-seven years later, we're taken to the UK and introduced to a young man whose wealthy father sees him as an embarrassment and has disowned him. That man, Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), dreams of being a composer. While hoping to achieve that, he takes a job dictating for a man whose already achieved fame of his own, Vyvyan Ayrs (played by Jim Broadbent), whose eyes are failing him. Despite Ayrs unpleasant demeanor, Frobisher proves up to the job and it allows him time to further his own ambitions. Flash forward another thirty-seven years, we meet Luisa Rey. Rey (played by Halle Berry who also portrays relatively minor characters in the previous story lines) is a second-generation journalist writing a story about a nuclear power plant that is opening in her hometown of San Francisco. Unexpectedly, she meets Rufus Sixsmith (former lover of the now-deceased Frobisher played by James D'Arcy). Sixsmith (D'Arcy) is a nuclear physicist who knows that the plant is unsafe and hopes to relay his knowledge to Rey and provide evidence to substantiate it. What neither Ray, Sixsmith, or Dr. Isaac Sachs (another whistleblower played by Tom Hanks) are aware of however, is that they are all being hunted by a man whose employers wish to see the plant open, no matter the risk to the environment or local residents. Once again, we jump ahead. This time, thirty-nine years to the present. There we meet Timothy Cavendish (played by Broadbent). Cavendish is a publisher at a publicity event for an author named Dermot Hoggins (Hanks). During the event, Hoggins sees a critic who panned his work and throws him off the balcony. While he is sent to jail for his actions, his book begins flying off the shelves resulting in a financial windfall for Cavendish. Members of the Hoggins family wish to take the proceeds Cavendish is receiving from the sales as a result of Dermot signing away his rights to them before going to jail. Cavendish goes on the run and his brother Denholme (played by Hugh Grant who, like the others, played roles of varied significance in the previous stories) sends him to an establishment that he mistakes for a hotel but that is, in fact, a secure home for the elderly. Rather than capitulate, Cavendish plots his escape with help from other unhappy residents, one of whom only says two words over and over during the planning of the escape and the escape itself.There are two more story lines which, together, span a time of two-hundred nine years into the future. Rather than describe them both, I'll simply conclude here with my thoughts on the film as a whole. Cloud Atlas, while not as brilliant as the hype made it out to be, is a great film. Hanks and company play all of their roles expertly. And though the connective tissue between them strains credulity at times, they each leave the viewer with a sense of hope and optimism that, in the end, things will work out somehow. That's not a large part of my particular worldview, but it's beautifully depicted and highly entertaining, nonetheless. See it.",8,1,4,6 December 2012
Fast Five," Five and counting
","Fast Five is the latest in the action-driven, visually stunning, Fast and the Furious series. I would think it's the last installment, but these days I suppose anything is possible. It begins with brother and sister Dom and Mia Toretto (Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster) along with ex-law enforcement officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) as wanted fugitives on the move and in need of gainful, thought not legal, employment. Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film. Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end. It's about beautiful cars, beautiful women, and the occasional fistfight or shootout. In that regard it's a success.",7,0,1,24 November 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Truly enjoyable
","If you've ever watched a horror movie, you've seen characters headed for their doom after making an obvious mistake and asked yourself, 'how could they be so stupid?' What if your job depended on that very stupidity? Better yet, what if the world as we knew it depended on that stupidity? Five college students, Dana (played by Kristen Connolly), Curt (played by Thor himself Chris Hemsworth), Jules (played by Anna Hutchison), Marty (played by Fran Kranz) and Holden (played by Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams) are all packed and ready for some much needed rest and relaxation in a remote cabin in the woods (I know, the title was no help in predicting that). Separately, two men in a corporate facility whose nature is not fully explained are gearing up for a series of operations taking place worldwide and one happening domestically that determines the future of their employment. While en route to their secluded cabin, our college students stop for gas and are more than moderately spooked by the station attendant who tells them that tragedies have befallen more than one of the previous owners. Still they press on and the attendant, Mordecai (played by Tim de Zarn) relays that to the two men in the corporate facility (played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) while they laugh at the man's ghoulish demeanor which he maintains long after the collegians depart.There's a good deal more to this story, but to reveal any more would give away too much. What I can tell you is that I enjoyed this movie immensely. The relatively unknown cast members serve their purpose and the more accomplished professionals, namely Whitford, Jenkins, and a largely unseen Sigourney Weaver add an entirely different dimension to a film that might otherwise be cookie-cutter from its inception. If you enjoy horror or enjoy a good parody, you will enjoy The Cabin the Woods.",7,0,2,6 December 2012
High Fidelity," One of Cusack's Best
","What are your passions? Travel, fine food, family and friends? What if you decided to forsake everything else in your life to make a career out of those passions? Looking back, what would you think?Rob Gordon (played by John Cusack) is a lifelong Chicago resident and owner of his own record store. The store, Championship Vinyl, attracts very few window shoppers and almost as few intentional customers. The staff consists of Rob, Barry (played by Jack Black), and Dick (played by Todd Louiso). Originally hired to work two days a week, Barry (Black) and Dick (Louiso) decided instead to show up every day. Their personalities are complete mirror images of each other, Barry being loud and opinionated (one of many reasons that Jack Black was perfect for the role) and Dick being soft-spoken and deferential. What they and Rob have in common with each other is an almost encyclopedic knowledge of music and a superior attitude as a result. When we join the story, Rob is being dumped by his live-in girlfriend, Laura. Laura (played by Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has chosen to leave in the evening and Rob, vehemently opposed to the idea, elects to shout out the window as Laura drives away. Rob then proceeds to list the five most devastating breakups in his romantic past, purposely excluding Laura from the list. Noticing that all those relationships ended at the urging of the other party, Rob decides that he is doomed to be rejected. He reaches out to his first girlfriend, a girl he kissed for two hours a day for three days before finding her kissing someone else on the fourth day. While he fails to find his middle school love, her sister informs him that the boy Rob saw her kissing on the first day is now her husband and that they live in Australia. In fact, the woman he speaks to is under the impression that her sister's husband was actually her first boyfriend. Rob tries to disabuse her of this notion but the sister, believing him to be delusional, hangs up. Rob, now believing that his circumstances are the result of fate and not any sort of failure on his part, plans to reach out to his other former partners. Penny Hardwick (played by Joelle Carter) who would not allow the intimacy between them to progress past kissing, Charlie Nicholson (played by Catherine Zeta- Jones) who rejected him and began a relationship with a coworker, and Sarah Kendrew (played by Lily Taylor) who found the ideal relationship with each other, both having been rejected and fearing they would never find their true soul mate. Sarah found someone else while still with Rob and ended things with absolutely no warning. This is one of those rare comedies that displays truly inspiring performances. Jack Black is, well Jack Black, but he is a valuable addition to the cast and the story. Cusack as Rob plays a character that we lose sympathy for on more than one occasion but ultimately find ourselves rooting for. And, as is typically the case with movies that feature multiple music aficionados as characters, the soundtrack is incredible. Thirteen years have passed since the release of this film and I enjoy it just as much if not more than I did when it was first released. THAT is the mark of true greatness.",9,0,2,14 April 2013
V for Vendetta," Remember Remember
","What can anyone do in the face of true tyranny? When simple criticism is outlawed, what chance does a revolution have? How do you inspire a nation that's been bullied into silence?The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase 'good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails'. Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying 'That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much.' The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a 'yellow coded' curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should. Just one man's opinion.",9,1,2,24 March 2013
