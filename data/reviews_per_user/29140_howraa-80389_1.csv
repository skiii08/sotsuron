Captain Phillips," life changing
","This movie is not only extremely impactful and intense, the actors have played their roles so well that it feels like you're in the movie itself. By the end, you feel like you're there with all the actors and you start feeling the emotions they feel. The best part about this film is that it not only gives the perspective of the protagonist but helps viewers empathize with the Somalian pirates as well and understand their situation better.
A wonderful film overall and definitely one of my favorites.",10,1,1,12 May 2020
