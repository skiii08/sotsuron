The Avengers," Amazing end product of mediocre films
","I never thought going into the cinema that the previous Marvel films would amount to so much. They are nothing in comparison to this masterpiece. The films leading up to this being Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the Iron Man films. These films range from average to decent, decent being Iron Man 1 which is the best out of the prequels. This film works in so many ways! It's hard to know where to begin with the review. The acting is good, the story line isn't complex but not too simple either. Each character is given a good amount of screen time and no character is left under-powered or look insignificant. The effects are very good maybe some of the best ever so far in film making. Josh Whedon has done himself proud! I loved Firefly and now I love this!Overall a very very VERY good film. It is incomparable to The Dark Knight or the other Batman films as it is a completely different type of film. I do love those films as well. It just.. works.",8,1,4,25 August 2012
Warrior," A very good, deep and emotional film
","I watched this film just last night after seeing a facebook status saying how 'sick' it was. Sorry for the childish dialect there but we will move on. This movie started off quite slow, building up the characters but this was to be expected. Tom Hardy played the character well being someone with little show of emotion and did not talk much but however was shown to care although he may not have wanted others to think that. Nick Nolte being the ex-alcoholic father was also played well it's a shame he doesn't seem to be in as many films these days. Having never seen Joel Edgerton play a major role in a film I did not know what to expect. He was good although maybe too bland in some places but overall produced a good performance especially during the closing scenes.I like the story of the film. It was simple but had little extra things popping up throughout the film that added to the overall suspense of the ending. I found myself leaning up out of my bed biting my nails wondering what was going to happen to these two characters.Overall a very good film and well deserving of it's IMDb rating. Definitely worth a watch!",8,0,2,25 August 2012
