Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What was George Lucas thinking!!!!!!
","He should watch Episode V: 'The Empire Strikes Back' before thinking about future Star Wars movies. Even though I'm more of a Star Trek fan, I do know a good movie when I see one. I think Episode V is one of the best movies of all time. In contrast, Episode I has a very weak plot that relies on special effects and very annoying computer generated characters like Jar Jar Binks.",3,0,1,24 February 2002
Minority Report," Great movie :-)
","Minority Report is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood for a long time. It has an interesting plot with plenty of twists. The action is extremely well done and it also leaves you with questions as you leave the cinema. While the movie does have some minor problems, most criticisms you will see are from those who don't understand it properly.
*** Spoilers begin ***Really, the only plot hole big enough to worry me was the bit where Anderton (Cruise) gains access to the precrime facility using his removed eyes. Surely they would have withdrawn his access rights to the facility. A better way to deal with this would have been for Anderton to somehow hack into the computers to gain entry or he could have been let in by someone on the inside that he knew (maybe the guy looking after the precogs).As for the ending, yes I agree with most people here that it was too happy for the style of this movie. I think a good way to end it would have been to get rid of the voice over and finish it just after Burgess shoots himself. This would provide a semi-happy ending, but get rid of the happily ever after bit.*** Spoilers end ***Overall I still give it 10/10. While it does have some flaws, they are very minor and don't detract from the enjoyability of this movie. Minority Report deserves its place in the imdb top 250!",10,0,0,31 July 2002
X-Men," What a pathetic movie.
","This movie tries to be an action movie and an intelligent movie but fails dismally on both counts. The so called intelligent parts to the paper thin plot were extremely weak and never really got past the 'we shouldn't pick on those who are different to us' message. As for the action, it was drawn out, predictable, relied too much on special effects and lacked any sort of suspense. Also, for most action type movies to work we need to at least care a little bit about the 'good' characters and hate the 'bad guys'. Quite frankly, I didn't care who won or lost thanks to the almost non-existent character development.Well done X-Men, this is the first movie I have ever awarded a .....wait for it.... ----> 1/10 <---- on imdb. Avoid this movie at all costs!!!!",1,12,23,31 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great Star Wars movie.
","I really think that there are many die hard fans of the original three who see the new Star Wars movies just to pick them apart and whine that 'George Lucas has lost the plot', etc... As a Star Trek fan, I see the same thing happen with each new series of Star Trek that comes out, some fans just refuse to enjoy it. They simply whine and complain about any little problem they can find. Get over it! Stop looking at the problems and enjoy the many good points. Yes, Episode I was rather ordinary and Jar Jar Binks is the worst ever character. However, I think Episode II is just as good as the original trilogy. The main problem (if you can call it a problem) is that you really need to see all other Star Wars episodes or at least Episode I for this to make sense. Apart from this, the dialog is no where near as bad as some people here would like you to believe, the same goes for the romance story. While both these aspects of the movie have their problems, they aren't exactly terrible either. As for the special effects, they look even better than Episode I. However, the most important part is the story. While it may seem a bit disjointed on its own, when you look at it from the overall Star Wars series of movies it makes a lot of sense and it is very good.When you see this movie (and I highly recommend it), make sure you see it with an open mind and not as a fan of the original trilogy who just wants to pick it apart. It really is a great movie and well worth the entry price.",7,0,0,23 May 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the greatest movies ever made
","2001 is an abstract movie that will divide the audience into two camps, those who understand it and those who don't. If you understand this movie then there is no question that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you don't understand it then you will hate it.I have now seen this movie twice. The first time was when I was about 9 years old. I was used to the fast action and popcorn storylines of movies like Star Wars. The extremely slow pace of 2001 and it's lack of dialogue meant that I really didn't take much notice of what was going on and became bored with it pretty quickly. Since then, I became interested in Star Trek (which has a number of extremely thought provoking episodes (eg: TNG 'The Measure of a Man')) and other sci-fi with more intelligent storylines.
This leads me to earlier this year when I had the opportunity to see 2001 again (this time on DVD in full widescreen). It had been so long since I originally saw the movie that I really didn't know what to expect. As the move progressed, I began to think about the themes and ideas behind it. To put it simply, I changed my ideas about this movie completely. It is a brilliant film and I don't think we'll ever see anything like it again. The key to enjoying this movie is how you interpret it. Don't expect to the story to be spoon-fed to you like most other movies. You have to think about this one.*** some spoilers ahead ***My interpretation of this movie is that it is a story of human evolution. The monoliths represent some something that affects humans (and our ancestors in the early stages of the films) and allows them to 'take the next step'. One interpretation is that it could be an alien influence, but there are a number of possibilities.The movie can be broken up into a number of different sections. The first is 'The Dawn of Man'. In this section of the movie, one group of 'ape men' discover a monolith. After this, they gain the knowledge and ability to use weapons and tools. This gives them an advantage over their rivals.The movie then jumps into the future where an unidentified object has been discovered on the moon. Eventually we find out that this is another monolith. This acts as a catalyst and mankind begins to explore the solar system. ie: For the first time we are leaving the vicinity of our planet. The first stage of this is an expidition to Jupiter.Upon reaching Jupiter another monolith is found. This is where the most abstract part of the movie occurs. I won't say anything about it, except this. How would anyone show something beyond our ability to understand? This is what I think this section represents. This is where mankind takes the next step and evolves further.There is also the story of HAL during the voyage to Jupiter. Again, think about what HAL represents. Also think about why HAL seems to have more personality than the human crewmembers. It is much more than just a simple story of a psycho computer! ;-)*** spoilers end ***I would give this movie 100/10 if I could. This is science fiction at its best. BTW, if you can, watch the widescreen version on DVD. Many of the shots are lost in the conversion to 4:3 pan & scan.",10,5,8,18 September 2002
