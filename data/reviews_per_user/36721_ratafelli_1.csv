Resident Evil: Afterlife," 90 minutes of stupid action scenes.
","Personally, I wasn't expecting much from the movie, but some things went right. Let's start with the good things. The soundtrack was awesome, almost every time we was gifted by a song that perfect completed the scene. If is not the best soundtrack that i ever heard on a movie, is on the top 3 for sure. I really like the production, and I think that is a step forward for the series. Extinction was terrible. Really. Afterlife does a great job making things work at least decent this time. But the good ends here. The plot is stupid and I wonder until when we have to wait for a real end? Those cliffhangers became so clichÃ©. The whole movie seems like a big trailer. Things happens and changes fast and they're always like 'let's do this'. 'OK, this won't work, let's do that!'. The movie lacks focus. I think that there's nothing more to do with the plot. The first movie did a great job because eight years ago things were different. But they tried everything to do with the plot... What's gonna happen next? Another 90 minutes of stupid action scenes with a decent production... and no end? Even if the production was good overall, I can't say the same about the effects. Some of them look really cool like the fight at the bathroom, where Claire kicks that big Zombie ass. This scene was incredible. But the first scene from the movie, where those Alice's jumped over the Umbrella facility... It was like a amateur movie. It was ridiculous, Well, at least I think Milla did her job, it isn't her best movie, but it's solid. Can't say the same for the other characters... they all look generic. Chris, Claire, Luther, K-mart... They doesn't inspire any kind of emotion. Claire sounds dumb when she says that don't remember anything. Telling the truth, if those characters didn't appeared it would simply change nothing. Because they didn't nothing. My rate is 6/10. Not totally bad, but far away from being a good movie. It's just 90 minutes of action. But... and I mean BUT stupid action. The only real good moment was the Claire's fight at the bathroom like I said before. Not really for the girl, but because the whole scene was superb and it looked awesome on 3-d. The other scenes like the plane scene, or the 'Matrix' fight at arcadia were so boring that I was starting to think if the movie would last too long... So if you're a die-hard Milla fan, you'll probably love it like I've loved Apocalypse 6 years ago. A Resident Evil fan may like the references like the Big Hammer and the new zombies. An action movie fan may think it was decent. Anyone else you'll think the movie is just stupid, what, personally, I totally agree. And before I forget, any of you really thinks that any movie after the first had something new to offer? If they ends the series in a next movie, anything that they done on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th movie was useless because the story didn't went anywhere, take a look and you'll see it's like running in circles. Nothing changed at all. The formula is starting to get boring.",6,0,4,25 September 2010
