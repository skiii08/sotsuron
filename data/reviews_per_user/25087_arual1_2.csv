Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great and interesting throughout
","I watched this on TV and didn't expect much. I don't like period dramas or anything that may be historical but to my pleasant surprise, this story was interesting and fast paced throughout. I don't understand the low ratings, unless you're into stuff that's 100% like real life, but the point of this story was to set it in a time where vampires could be plausible. I.E. when shooting someone, you can get away with it because there's no DNA evidence and such. The casting was good and the storyline had a couple of fresh ideas thrown in to make it better and add to the quality of the film, with twists. I think anyone seeking out a good film should try it, because it has a good mixture of violence and real reasons behind that violence in the form of vengeance.",9,1,2,5 June 2013
Warm Bodies," Best Film I've Seen in Years
","I'm hard to please in terms of films because they generally follow the same format. I watch 4 clips on the internet for Warm Bodies and thought it looked good. It was absolutely amazing and I would recommend this film for everyone! Everything is perfect. I love the actors, the plot, the way the story unfolds, the romance, the action (guns), the humour (quite a lot of people laughing in the cinema)! It was beautiful and a film that makes you feel something. I like how everything happens. There's conflict, drama and moments of intensity. It's only a little slow in parts, but not dull. Everything happens for a reason in this film and from the exposition to the ending you root for Julie and R.",10,3,8,17 February 2013
