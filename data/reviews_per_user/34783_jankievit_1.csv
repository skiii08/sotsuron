The Avengers," A very entertaining Movie but with some serious flaws in the story
",I went today to the 3d version of the movie in Antwerpen Belgium. Let me start to say it is very entertaining and its almost more a comedy than a Marvel Movie. Why i not rate this movie higher is because there a lot of flaws in the storyline and they step over a lot of issues to easy. Iff you compare that for example with X-Men First class or Ironman the story lines are much better so i don't really understand why the reviewers before me don't talk about that enough. The enemy is very weak(almost a single shot would kill them) and i still don't understand why Loki was doing in the plane and why he would let them catch him... And the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with him ? Also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did nothing. From characters the black-widow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and Hawkeye is shooting with a bow how is that faster than a gun. This movie was saved in the first part by Tony Stark character extremely funny and the Hulk character in the second part of the movie. But how Hulk came a very smart monster who knows what he's doing i still don't know. But still its a movie worth going to the cinema but its def. not a movie which is worth a 8.4,8,9,32,25 April 2012
