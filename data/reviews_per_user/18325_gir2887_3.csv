Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Is a Testament to Several Ideals in Cinema, and a Precedence-setting Film.
","*Spoilers eeverwharr* Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was one of my favourite titles as a youth, and even now that I'm eighteen, I still thoroughly enjoy every second of it. I watched it just the other day, and even though I can pretty much recite every second of it, it's still an almost magical experience for any variety of individualistic movie-goer.For starters, this movie is big. The inclusion of cartoon characters ranging from Disney to Warner Brothers is a massive undertaking that I can only guess as to how much time it actually took to gather licenses and credits for it. In their respective roles, all of them held true to their etched origin and personas ranging from Bugs Bunny's free-fall antics on Eddy Valiant to Betty Boop's showgirl-esquire personality, featured in the club where Daffy and Donald Duck are dueling it out with pianos(Again proving Daffy will always be better solo than with Bugs). The interaction with the 40's and 50's setting American characters was flawless as well, as it easily captured the early-American, smoothe vibe even with the inclusion of their comic, pencil-drawn counterparts.The main point this movie excels at is personality. The newly-crafted cartoon characters have a riotous appearance, especially Baby Herman, the womanizing, dwarfed man. I'm partial especially to the appearance of Roger's wife, Jessica Rabbit. While, still a cartoon, she manages to pull off a distinctly human character based slightly in the moronic antics of her cartoon ilk, such as cheating on Roger by way of playing patty-cake with Marvin Acme. However, she manages to resign herself to a relatively shady and intriguing figure throughout the movie. You'll be surprised how elusive to protagonism or antagonism she is, especially for being a cartoon. Not to mention, being an animator myself, she's been one of the characters that I've idolized most since I was young(I've even got a custom guitar with a graphic of her. The model name is the JESSICA-7821) Of course, the cast of quirky characters doesn't end there. Christopher Lloyd plays Judge Doom, a new character on the political scene with an intense aversion to toons, which reveals it's own plot twist in the end. The Toon Patrol is also a lovable bunch, consisting of a mob of jackals that break out into uncontrollable fits of laughter throughout every miniscule joke. The war between them all is a riot on it's own.Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is not only an inventive, but heartfelt, ingenious, memorable and funny movie that will stand the test of time very well.",10,0,0,5 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Wow. I Get Brokeback Mountain. And I Don't Like It.
","Just to preface this, I'm independent. I don't care about sexuality, and I'd actually like it better if everyone were bi-sexual so politics aren't an issue. There's nothing homophobic about my review, it's completely based on the movie and not the subject content.Okay. So. I watched Brokeback Mountain a few nights ago against my better judgment, because I usually boycott high-acclaim movies that are pretentiously geared towards the dramatically enlightened and sensitive citizens. To me, that's not entertaining. However, curiosity got the best of me and I gave in.Let me go ahead and get this out of the way. The story was good, later on. Not great, just good. And it has Jake Gyllenhaal in it. That is always a plus. Not to mention, Anne Hathaway played a fantastic role and has definitely come along since the Princess Diaries.Now, the bone that I have to pick with this movie. I have never been so utterly bored and uninspired by a movie in all my life. I would honestly rather watch Troll 2 of my own volition than ever have to see this painstaking movie again. Why? A number of reasons.First of all, I have never seen such absolutely direction-less work. It's literally like Ang Lee just gave his actors and cameramen the book and just let them go with it. I mean, was there even an editor hired for this? Did they need one? If it wasn't for the few orchestral spots I honestly would've just given up on waiting for some sort of directional pulse. I mean, where's the vision? Where's the cinematic metaphors for all the intense pain that Ennis and Jack are going through? There're absolutely non-existent.Not to mention, the holes in the storyline are borderline ridiculous. Everything seemed on-par whenever Jack and Ennis were herding in the mountains. OK, Ennis starts taking his clothes off right outside of Jack Twist's peripheral vision to change clothes, and what does Jack, the man who's attracted to him do? Nothing. He stares at a fire. OK, say you're a guy and you're walking down the street, and a good looking woman walks by. If you're attracted, you're going to look. Not only is it logical, it's true chemically. The same goes for women as well. Now, that would have been a nice little hint at the progression that Jack and Ennis were making towards wanting each other, because the moment they do have sex the first time, I felt so lost. It came out of nowhere. There was no hint of sexuality, no gay joke, lisps, anything. Nothing that was filmed showed any real hint of any homosexual tendencies, and then just out of the blue they're having sex with each other. Sure, people know what the movie is about on a rumor basis alone, but that doesn't account for sloppy story and script progression.Oh yeah, did I mention the incredibly predictable ending? Let's just put it this way: in the first hour of the movie, either Jack or Ennis discuss a gay man who was found dead with his face smashed in. Scenes are shown where his face is beaten by a tire-iron. Guess how one of them dies? Sure, you could call it dramatic irony. Or, you could called it unoriginal storytelling.After witnessing one of the most over-hyped movies in the history of moving pictures-nay, since hieroglyphics were the fad, I feel almost mentally destroyed that people defend this slop because its about the struggle of the gay man, and at it's heart a good love story. Look, I'm sure that at it's heart, Troll 2 was supposed to be scary. Was it? No. Why? Horrible direction. Granted, Brokeback Mountain isn't that bad, but it's not exactly a brilliant and stunning movie, either. Movies like this have been coming out for a long, long time. However, for some reason as soon as a movie about two gay guys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal comes out, it's Oscar time! When it comes down to the bare bones of the matter, Brokeback Mountain is at best a movie that could've been above-average if it wasn't for the completely lifeless and droning atmosphere and progression, and at its heart mainly just another movie for people who really don't know movies.",3,5,37,25 January 2007
Army of Darkness," A Horror Movie That Backfired And Still Got The Point Across
","Army of Darkness qualifies itself, at least to what I believe, to be at the beating heart of all cult fanaticism. This legendary movie, equal yet still somewhat separate from the Evil Dead movies before it may seem to be nothing more than an outdated film with excessive amounts of cheese now, but beneath that lies a message that's actually innocent and light-hearted; not to mention, the years of horrible horror movies to follow the Evil Dead series would make Army of Darkness into an accidental parody, as well.As the story goes, it follows Ash, played by the now endeared-to-a-generation Bruce Campbell as the sole living survivor of an attack by demons and darkness, 'deadites', on a cabin in the secluded woods. As he thinks he's safe, the darkness of the necronomicon - a book of evil incantations and summonings bound in flesh and inked blood - returns to pull Ash back into the middle ages amidst a somewhat confused war during the increasing gravity of the evil and deadites on their land. However, instead of being treated as a saviour or wizard, he's instantly bound and thrown into battle with a deadite in true Roman arena fashion. Of course, he has a chainsaw for a hand, man. And he's Ash. He defeats the deadite and in Indiana Jones' manner, pulls himself from the pit he's thrown into, and the hilarity ensues: '...Shop smart. Shop S-Mart. YOU GOT THAT?!' It's one-liner after glorious Ash/Campbell one-liner as he ventures to retrieve and hold the necronomicon away from and invading horde of deadites and skeletons, as well as an evil Ash.As amazing as the plot sounds, and the fine points in between that progress the story, watching the movie is a completely different experience. I only wish I wasn't five at the time so I could've enjoyed it in the all-encompassing encapsulation of a theater. You can tell from the first few minutes re-summarizing the nights before that this movie is no modern-day Matrix. The DVD featurettes say the movie was filmed with a revolutionary film technique called Introvision, but referring to the movie, you'd probably just laugh again, however it's actually one of the strengths of the movie. With modern-day horror films, there's a tremendous over-doing of 'deaditting.' Cutting and chopping a movie to make it appear scary but shoving in loud and obnoxious sound-bytes of single or few-frame splices of a catastrophe, or a contorted face, or... you get the picture. This, in and of itself, was actually one of the accidental parodies I was mentioning earlier. Whereas now, the somewhat dated special effects definitely appeal to the atmosphere of the movie, it's become sort of an inadvertent shot at the lackluster horror movies of today, but manages to add in insult by having such a sense of humor with such an original storyline.And of course, no actor could've pulled the part better than Bruce Campbell. The Hollywood cult-extra, he's appeared in so many things as a usually arbitrary character that you don't seem to notice him. However, no one else could've done Ash like Bruce Campbell did. He bleeds personality and there's not a single moment of the movie that isn't funny in some way, shape or form, and it's largely due to him. Not only did his facial expressions and idiosyncrasies seem almost pre-destined for this movie, but the Bruce Campbell voice is just unmistakable and his delivery defines deadpan. Simple one-liners had me on the floor just because of the amazing delivery.And of course, underneath all that's going for this movie lies its beating heart, which most people don't seem to get up-front. It's a message that the 90's, dawn of apathy in America, still has a heart that can be as light as the days that people were young. Sure, not all of the humor is all-audience, but the same token, it's not in the same league comedies like Airplane! and Top Gun were. It was more exposing the beating heart underneath the dead skin by going back to a more slap-stick and motional style of humor. When Ash is in the graveyard getting the Stooges treatment by the skeletons, it's impossible not to laugh just because of nostalgia. It's one of the few movies where the humor is as much in how the characters talk and act as what they say and do.As time goes on and horror movies get shittier, Army of Darkness embeds itself further as a gem amongst American cinema and cements Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell into movie history as a visionary and a genius.",10,2,3,25 January 2007
