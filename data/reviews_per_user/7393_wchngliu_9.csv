The Devil's Advocate," This Is Such A Silly Movie
","The Devil's Advocate is utter pants. I wouldn't waste my time explaining the plot but it has to be one of the silliest horror movies ever made. It is a sheer letdown typified by Pacino's over-the-top and overdone performance and Reeves annoying southern accent and a narrative so ridiculous it is laughable. Then again, Reeves has never been that good of an actor himself anyway, if his previous roles are anything to go by. Charlize Theron is type-casted as the blonde bombshell and victim of distress and whilst I have seen better performances from her in this film, she is nothing more than male eye candy and thus, what else? Rather that she turns up in one scene in the nude. Likewise, the ending is just laughable and terrible. This film is total rubbish.",3,1,8,4 July 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," This Proves That Not All Animation Has to Be CGI Based To Become A Hit
","Before the CGI phenomenon and Dreamworks's digital animation kicked off in the late 90s- early 00s, animated films were still hand drawn and well animated. Bob Zemeckis- who had hit the big time with the first Back to the Future film, turned his attention to making a movie by combining both live action and quality animation. The collaboration of all the Disney, Warner Bros and Tex Avery cartoon characters is just amazing to see- although it would've been just as great had Hanna Barbera and its creations, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone, Top Cat, Huckleberry Hound, Scooby Doo to name made an appearance or two as well.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is one of the finest animated movies of all- time and so enjoyable to sit through as well. British actor Bob Hoskins plays an American detective, Eddie Valiant- a guy who hates toons well in fact anything to do with them, whose partner in crime dies after being killed by one of the toons in Toon Land. Roger meanwhile is being framed for a crime he didn't commit after a businessman, who has a sexual encounter with Jessica Rabbit, is found murdered and he finds himself a prime suspect to the case. So Roger goes on the run from the mob and seeks refuge in Eddie's hideout. It is up to Eddie to help clear Roger's name and for Roger to further convince Eddie that he wasn't responsible for the victim's death. Christopher Lloyd who played Doc Brown in BTTF again makes his mark on another Zemeckis effort; this time as an evil villain trying to thwart Eddie and Roger's plans.These days with many computer generated animated films, whilst they look impressive on screen, the makers often sacrificed the quality of the narrative and story lines in favour of fancy graphics. With 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?', what we have is a terrific film, where both the juxtaposing of live action sequences and animation are of a high standard. The animation looks fluid and smooth and to this day, it hasn't diminished the film one bit. The special effects are brilliant and the performances- both vocally from the voice actors and live actors, are one of a kind. The film is well written and the concept is well implemented and devised. Kathleen Turner does exceptionally well as the voice of Jessica, capturing her sexual presence and oozing a vixen-like persona. Charles Fleischer does a sterling job as the often maniacal Roger; he was able to switch from being insane and plain crazy to unfortunate and sad, often this would occur in one particular scene.Not even Space Jam or the okay-ish Looney Toons: Back in Action could rival this 80's effort. But the success of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' goes to show that one doesn't always have to rely on CGI to produce a really great animated feature film with live action sequences thrown in. Likewise, the characters are well drawn and colourful without the need of being pixel lated. Although Space Jam and Looney Toons both looked impressive, the narrative in those movies weren't as strong, effective, nor as appealing as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'.Entertaining, light-hearted and well executed, this is a must for all those who love watching classic cartoons and their favourite characters come together for the first time on the big screen.Rating: 9 and a half out of 10",9,0,0,8 July 2008
Wayne's World," Wayne's World! Party Time! Excellent!
","Starring Saturday Night Live's very own duo of Wayne and Garth- Canadian Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, Wayne's world is a comedy rock fest of epic proportions. Think a grown-up Bill and Ted and replace the history element with more heavy metal rock. Wayne's world is a humorous and farcical take on two hosts and fanatical rock fans, who host their own Cable show titled: 'Wayne's World'.Wayne is the guy, who wears a black t-shirt and baseball cap, whilst Garth is the long blond- yet shy geeky one, and the pair utter phrases such as 'schwwwwing!', 'we're not worthy' and 'excellent!'.Proved as a relatively small hit, their small screen antics catch the eye of a sleazy TV producer played by Rob Lowe. He intends on destroying Wayne and Garth's reputation and careers by exposing them as frauds, and to make his life a misery even dates Wayne's crush:lead singer Cassandra in the process. Meanwhile, in addition to falling in love with Cassandra, Wayne agrees to promote her band's talent and help enhance her chances in furthering her career.The humour is adolescent and at times childish and daft, but this is all in the name of fun with this movie. The cast ensemble are great and they all looked like they had fun making the film.Unlike the Austin Powers movies, it relies heavily on pop cultural references and mickey takes on various TV shows and films. And although Mike Myers is a very funny comedian, it seems as if in film terms people associate him more with the Austin powers franchise, rather than with Wayne's World. Which is a shame because I prefer Wayne's World to Austin Powers; the humour wasn't as smutty and as it was utilised in a somewhat clever way- even if some of the scenes came across as childish or silly looking.Highlights of the movie include the Scooby Doo ending- one of three endings that is-, the product endorsements of Pepsi- the taste of a new generation LMAO!!- and Adidas, and a memorable rendition of Queen's Boheminan Rhapsoday, with Wayne, Garth and company rocking along to the track.Overall, Wayne's World is an entertaining- yet highly amusing farce, which should've got a much higher profile than Mike Myers' other hit,'Austin Powers', which went on to spawn three other sequels.As Wayne and Garth would say: 'Excellent!'",9,1,2,15 April 2008
As Good as It Gets," Feel- good film that is not too sentimental and which hits the right mark
","As good as it gets is one of my all-time favourite films ever and it's mainly all thanks to the wonderful performances given by the three main leads: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. James L Brooks has this habit of churning out hit after hit, and this film is no exception. Even though this movie is 10 years old, it still manages to successfully retain that feel good factor and it looks as if it hasn't dated whatsoever. The story revolves around writer Marvin Udall- an OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)sufferer and his attempts at becoming a better person and human being. at first, he is moody, aggressive, impatient, irritated and annoyed and often makes sarcastic remarks in the expense of other people. as the film progresses, Marvin changes as a person overnight and thus, these changes are ultimately as a result of the experiences and difficulties as encountered, shared and faced by Carol (Hunt) and Simon (Kinnear). Carol is a single mother, who lives with her mother and works as a waitress and of whom has to contend with looking after and caring for her sick son; Simon meanwhile is a gay guy who earns his living as an artist. However, his life changes completely after an incident where he is set upon and is physically beaten to a pulp by a bunch of vandals. Eventually,and in one point in the film, he ends up in a wheelchair and realises that his life is not going to get any better; however, when Marvin realises the errors of his ways after he taunts Simon and he, tries to hit back in retaliation, the events which follow afterwards lead to Marvin realising the importance of the good things that he has in his life.And that it is because of these two individuals in Simon and Carol, that they remind him that all the good one does, does indeed prevail over the bad in life. This is an excellent film that has a positive moral message running through it and that while it remains a comedy, the sentimentality is not too syrupy and not too sickly sweet, and yet at the same time, it is not underplayed in contrast to other romantic comedies throughout. It has the right balance of happy and sad moments, to a extent to which it is at an equal level playing field and keeps the story flowing nicely . Therefore, As good as it gets is arguably one of the best romantic comedies to have ever existed, period. It is absolutely pure magic",10,1,2,24 June 2007
Monster," A Killer Performance By Theron That Explores The Motives Behind Wournos' Mindset
","For all of the debates surrounding the prosthetic look of Charlize Theron and her physical transformation into Aileen Wournos, it is her performance and the manner of which she has carried off that performance as that character, that makes Monster such a interesting film to watch. With the direction taken by Patty Jenkins, it is not so much a film about a woman committing heinous acts, but unlike so many serial killer movies which very much rely on violence and in depicting that violence on screen to explain their evil intentions, Monster attempts to show to us that the violent nature of Wournos' erratic behaviour is partly as a result of society's failure to acknowledge and assist those who have fell through the net and were let down by the system; thus they turn to crime, such as murder. I am not saying that I condoned the actions of Aileen Wournos- apart from one who- according to her, tried to rape her-, but rather with the abuse that she had experienced as a child,they played a considerable part in her growing up as an angry, bitter woman. Her psychological and emotional damage was inflicted by those who were in her care and of whom were in the hands of those people of whom were supposed to protect Aileen.Monster is alas, not a serial killer movie, but neither is it a lesbian one: the violence for example is not as excessive and gory in stark contrast to other so-called films of a similar nature. Having said that the rape scene in the car where Aileen is attacked and taken advantaged of was somewhat distressing to watch. It is most certainly not implying that violence is, in the context of this film, utilised as a way of empowering women over men. It is in fact a film which attempts to underline how behind the troubles and abhorrent actions lie a emotionally scarred and frustrated person, who was clearly troubled and not happy, nor satisfied with oneself. Irrespective of her gender. But also that she was often misunderstood by certain parts of society; like for instance when she goes and applies for jobs she gets turned down. Also in one scene which also took place in a car, she had killed her first john, as an act of self-defence, after he tried to rape her. Because of that incident, she is spurred on by the assumption that all men are women rapists, paedophiles etc and continues her killing spree by targeting her male victims and thus shooting them, one by one.The role that Selby, of which her real name is Lydia and whom was Aileen's lover, plays is important because it was during the time in which those murders were carried out, that she had been in a lesbian relationship with her. Christina Ricci gave as good a performance as she did and it was interesting that it was Monster where she made her film comeback, after spending a couple of years out of the limelight.The acting was first class, the direction was masterful and the locations looked spectacular. Theron delivers a killer and mesmerising performance as Aileen- never had I seen her in a performance of a lifetime, until I saw this film. Even without the prosthetics, I do think that she could've just about pulled it off, still. Given her not too impressive previous on- screen roles as stereotypical male eye candy and blonde bombshell figures, there was always this danger that she would be ridiculed, as well as type casted as an actress. Thankfully for her, her solid efforts in Monster, as well as North Country, put an end to all that and the persistent criticism being levelled against her.Overall, Monster is a superb film full of raw, passionate emotion. I very much doubt that any other movie that Theron had starred in or will star in, will ever supersede and surpass her excellent rendition of Wournos. Kudos to Theron, Ricci and Jenkins though. It is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century.",10,4,5,27 June 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Emotional , Moving, Awe-Inspiring And Captivating
","If it wasn't for Jamie Foxx's performance in the movie, Ray then Don Cheadle would've probably walked away with the best actor Oscar in the academy awards ceremony back in 2004. Having said that, for all of the hype surrounding Foxx's efforts and his portrayal of musician Ray Charles, it is Cheadle's performance as hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina that stood out that year, and it is a performance of which is by far the best he has offered on the big screen. I was at first sceptical about the casting of Cheadle- an Afro-American playing an African character because I was a tad concerned about how he'd be able to pull off an impressive and authentic accent. Though afterwards, my doubts about this were erased by the time I watched his captivating performance and he did manage to successfully pull it off.Hotel Rwanda was breathtaking: previously dubbed Africa's answer to Schindler's List and based on a real life account of the infamous Rwandan genocide of 1994, it documents the efforts of Paul- a Hutu native, as he tries to forge a pact between the Hutu's and the tutsis and end the long running feud that has been taking place for a considerable period of time. As a result, he managed to save the lives of thousands of Rwandans, despite the West's failure to intervene in the case, as well as the lack of consideration given to their plight by the Western media.The film is not so much a depiction of the actual events itself, but rather one's human interest account of the genocide from the perspective of Paul and his wife, Tatiana- of whom is wonderfully underplayed by British actress, Sophie Okenedo. She did herself justice in this film and it's good to see a British actress doing well in a movie that tries to convey a serious but damning message at the same time. I was disappointed when she didn't win an Oscar, alongside Cheadle himself as they were remarkable in their roles.As for the violence in Hotel Rwanda, it is not overdone in a way that it is deemed gory. This is a drama after all and the characters's thoughts, emotions and feelings, as well as the brilliant acting had more of a resonance and impact during this film than the piling body counts of Hutu and Tutsi victims.It takes a while for the film to kick into gear and yet once it does, you cannot help but be gripped by the suspense and drama of it all.Although Hotel Rwanda deals with the genocide theme in a somewhat delicate and humanistic manner, it also raises questions regarding humanity, culture, race, family and morals. For whilst it is not just about the fact that the West ignored all pleas and all the warning signs, it is to painfully state how ignorance kills. Ignorance can be eradicated by means of education, knowledge and understanding but it can also destroy lives through lack of knowledge and understanding as well too.The cinematography is excellent, beautifully shot and the scenery is great. The independent film is not your standard Hollywood fare, but that shouldn't put you off from seeing Hotel Rwanda.It is brilliant and an emotional roller-coaster of emotions. If you haven't seen it yet, then i'd recommend it to those who love their movies",9,0,0,7 September 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," An instant classic for me
","I bought the DVD of Little Miss Sunshine- and alas, I wasn't disappointed. it was fantastically funny and the performances by Arkin, Carell, Collette, young Abigail Breslin, Dano and Kinnear were just top notch stuff. The Hoovers like any other family have their own problems: father Richard is a unsuccessful motivational speaker trying to instill confidence and to be able to fully motivate his family, mother Sheryl is a chain smoking wife and mother to Olive, who at times is at loggerheads with her husband in the film, grandpa J Edgar Hoover is a foul mouthed, heroin snorting junkie, uncle Frank is gay and on the verge of committing suicide after his partner left him for another guy, whilst Dwayne is a Frederich Nietzsche addict, who takes up a vow of silence, in his attempts to one day become a fighter pilot. As for Olive, she seems to be one without the problems and unaware of the problems plaguing her dysfunctional family. The family all set off in a mini yellow Volkswagen on a road trip to Redondo beach, California and to the Little miss sunshine beauty pageant that olive is taking part in. However, during their journey numerous events unravel within the plot: grandpa dies in his sleep, the family sneak his dead body from the hospital bed and attempt to load it in the van, Frank comes into contact with his former lover at a local gas station, Dwayne breaks his vow of silence after Frank tells him he is colour blind and towards the end,there is a small encore scene where the Hoovers get on stage and lark about to Rick James' 'Superfreak', which is one of the main highlights of this film. It is amusing, tragic and light-hearted all rolled into one, Little Miss Sunshine is a fab film which often tugs at the heart strings but also highlights that the beauty myth, can be so flawed due to the existence of beauty pageant shows that seek to sexualise that myth, as well as to disseminate and rob the innocence of young girls. Both Kinnear and Collette are great character actors, who seem to perform well, either as supporting characters to the main leads in a good established mainstream film, or as leads in a well written independent flick, such as Little Miss Sunshine.Overall, it is a fantastic movie that rightly deserved its plaudits",9,2,4,25 June 2007
Scream," Without Doubt The Ultimate, Original, And Best Teen Horror Slasher Flick Ever Released
","*** This Comment May Contain Spoilers *** I for one will say that I am not a fan of horror movies, least of all stuff such as The Nightmare On Elm Street series, but I did enjoy watching the Scream trilogy. If anything, thanks to Wes Craven it has totally reinvigorated and rejuvenated the horror genre, thus transforming it from what was deemed as old fashioned and catering towards older folks into a trendy, contemporary and youth based genre and introducing movie goers to a new sub-genre of horror: the slasher flick.Scream in truth for most part, is a thriller which incorporates and juxtaposes elements of horror movies to it. Evidently, its success spanned other movies of a similar- yet not as good nature, likewise I know What You Did Last Summer, in addition to silly and innocuous spoof movies such as the Scary Movie series.What was so great about the Scream films though was that there was no way of telling who the killer was, the first time you'd seen it. Rather you'd assume it would be this person, when in fact he/she wasn't involved whatsoever. When I first saw the first movie, I had no idea that Sidney's boyfriend was the killer, alongside one of her so called best friends. Also, the victims weren't as hapless and hopeless as we'd come to expect, as all of them put up a brave fight and attempt to make their escape unharmed.The twists in Scream were clever, but what was also clever was in finding out and discovering the sheer motives and reasons, as well as actions that led up to and during the killings by the killers themselves. The performances from the leads ranged from the very good to terrific; hence, Friends's very own Courteney Cox Arquette successfully manages to plays against type as a roving reporter, and the build-up to the actual revealing of the killer's identity is full of suspense and intrigue, whilst Neve Campbell does a good job playing would-be hero, Sydney. Therefore, it's not so much the blood, gore and killings that shock and leave the audience baffled but rather the final outcome when everything is out in the open, the whole truth is revealed and the murderer unmasks himself.In all, Scream is one rare and yet extremely intelligent horror thriller. It is full of suspense, intrigue and some of the scenes will make you jump out of your seat. It is undoubtedly the ultimate, original and best teen horror film, as well as the best contemporary horror movie you will ever see. The sequel meanwhile was good, although not as great as the prequel, whilst the third, well it is not as good as the second and no where near superior to the first.As a horror movie, Scream is a scream and the killer's mask itself is almost an iconic movie trademark that is reminiscent of the Michael Myers version from Hallowean. The best horror movie of the 90s methinks? well, its certainly one of the cleverest that's for sure",9,1,2,8 September 2007
Back to the Future Part II," The Best Instalment in the BTTF Trilogy
","The Back To The Future trilogy is undoubtedly one of the most successful movie franchise's in history, and there's no mistaking why. The sequel to the first movie was often criticised for being too complicated to understand- and yet it is due to the various sub-plots taking place within the movie, which makes this instalment the most interesting and eventful in the series. As others have rightly pointed out on here, Back To The Future: Part 2, will probably make no sense to you unless you have seen and understood the first film. The plot, is in itself, complicated: Marty McFly with Doc Brown travel forward in time to 2015 and to prevent further crises taking place with the future McFly family. As they do so, Biff, Marty's arch- enemy has got hold of a book that contains a list of sports statistics and results. With this, he uses it to make a fortune for himself, and hence he becomes a very rich man. Marty and the Doc have to retrieve the book, as well as to make sure they do not come into contact with alternate versions of themselves. Also, other events unfold as the film progresses: in 1985, George- Marty's father is deceased and thus, Marty discovers his mother, Lorraine is- wait for it- married to Biff! Marty and Doc Brown then travel back in time to 1955- where most of the first movie was based- to set the record straight.The film has so many great twists and in contrast to the first film, the narrative doesn't follow in the same way as your typical time-travelling flick. It also has some great action sequences thrown in, for instance, when Marty has to escape from Biff and his clowns using a kids hover-board.I was surprised to learn that Crispin Glover, who co-starred in the original BTTF film, was a notable absentee in this one. But I guess his absence did pay dividends for this sequel because it did make the story all the more compelling and intriguing to watch. The main leads in Fox, Lloyd, as well as the supporting cast in Thompson, Shue and Wilson all held the film in place really well and delivered their lines and performances with such style and professionalism. Lea Thompson's role as Lorraine Mcfly was wonderful-yet intriguing, given the fact that in real life she was born in the same year as Michael J Fox himself,- and so, I would, for the record, go on to say that she could've played the role of Marty's girlfriend in place of Elizabeth Shue.Personally, I preferred the second film over the others in the BTTF series, because I felt it was more challenging and that it kept viewers on the edge of their seats, which is all the more so as it didn't follow the conventional narrative formula as other sci-fi time travelling based films. Even though the story was complicated to get to grips with, BTTF 2 was unique and original in its own way, particularly as it had more to offer in terms of twists and turns. The first film was good, whilst with the third, I thought that the Wild West setting was somewhat of a mistake as it just didn't work as well as it should. But I could understand the fact that the writers, as well as Zemeckis, wanted to try something completely different.As in regards to Back The The Future 2, it is an enjoyable and exciting ride and one of the rarest and best examples of a film sequel ever produced. With great special FX, excellent dialogue, great performances, good humour and an interesting narrative and plot, all these make for a terrific classic, which this film is. Full marks!",10,1,2,2 July 2007
