Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars, the start
","The original Star Wars was a stand alone movie it had to be if it failed there would be no others.  That movie had a begining a middle and an end. This movie suffers from the same problem as the Empire Strikes back, it is a set up movie you have to start some were and this movie although visualy stunning doesn't have the depth that I wanted.  That lack of depth makes this movie much less than I hoped for.  After such a long waight it seems to me that it is just a bunck of cool special effects with a thin story holding it all togeter.",6,0,1,3 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," A mordern day epic
","I realy liked this movie.  It was in my opinion an epic picture, the teller of the tale, is just that, he is not the hero.  The hero is monumental 13 men led by the hero, battle for a people to servive.  They volintere to go fight for another band of vikings, bringing an Arab with them.  They fight for glory and survival.  In the end the heros main consern is that the Arab record the deeds of his men and he so that they will live forever. The battle seans are grafic and bloody so for most people this is not going to be a date movie, but if you like movies you should go see this one.",8,0,0,10 September 1999
Cross of Iron," Anti War war film, Peckinpah's only commercial war film
","Sgt. Stiner is a hard man, life on the Russian front fighting for the Germans has made him so.  The film clearly shows the brutality of war, the self sacrifice that people make the choices that people have to make.  At one point in the movie a young Russian boy who Stiner befreinded is let go free just before a big battle, I have always questioned in my mind did Stiner let him go to save him or to use him as a stalking goat, the act takes on a different perspective when you ask that question.",9,0,0,3 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Thriller, perhaps the best of this year 99
","One of the best movies this year, and perhaps Mr. Willis best work, ever. Willis plays a phychiatrist helping a disturbed child known as Freek to his class mates.  Having failed a child once before he focuses on the child to the exclution of every else.  Sounds pretty mundain fair.  Normaly this would be true but I cant tell you what makes this movie special with out ruining it.  Please take my word for it this is a movie that must be seen and spend the money to see it on the big screen.",9,0,0,7 August 1999
