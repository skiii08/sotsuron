Howl's Moving Castle," Enjoyable movie for adults.
","To me, I think it is hard for children to understand the idea of this movie. I've never read the original, but other reviewer had mentioned this movie was not so much based on the original story. First, I would like to say that sound track of this movie was fantastic (His movie always has great sound-track). Second, I would like to say that I had a problem with voice. Sophie's voice was by C.Baisho. I think she's alright, when Sophie was old lady but when she was young girl her voice didn't meet the character (C.Baisho is I think in her late 50's or something like that). Over all, I enjoyed it very much. And I will watch few more times to understand his message. I didn't enjoy 'Sento-Chihiro no Kamikakushi', but I think I liked this movie better in someways. Hopefully, he will produce more great movies in the future. I'm surprised to see that he didn't introduce great characters(Such as Totoro, Makkuro Kurosuke, Ji-Ji and etc). P.S. I think this movie, people will either LIKE it or DISLIKE it. Not for everybody I think.",8,14,27,3 January 2005
Lost in Translation," great fun! and more!
","The movie was just too funny too watch.  I liked the camera works, it captured a lot of interesting, and stereotyped views. The film had no translation or what's so ever!  The main translator had horrible English skills, this movie really made you 'Lost in translation.' Unfortunately, I understand both Japanese and English, so I was unable to experience that...  But form my point of view, I think there are bits that director purposely put stereotype Japanese people... (I THINK? I HOPE! Other wise, it's just bad...) Also, I liked how they (I THINK?) used a lot of random people, I don't think they were actors!  They were really shooting this film in the city with full of non-extras and non-actors!!!  It was amazing.  I want to know what Bob-san whispered...",10,0,0,28 September 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What happened to the seriousness of it?
","Over all, it was cool 'ACTION' movie. But I thought they put too much of stupid jokes in it.  I heard a lot of people were laughing at some funny stuff. (inc. Me) But what happened to that all serious stuff?  I thought it was totally mainly 'an action' rather than interesting story it had in previous 2.  I liked it at first, but now that I think about it, I want my money back!  It really was just stupid comments that Arnold said/did made us laugh and actions that kept people's interest.  It's obvious that they are thinking of doing 'T4'... I liked J.Cameron better than this guy...",5,0,0,14 July 2003
