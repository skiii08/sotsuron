Requiem for a Dream," Not for the weak.
","Having brothers who have gone through the incredibly disgusting, horrifying addiction of heroin i can tell you, this film nails the scariness and dread that comes from this addiction. This film is not for the weak at heart, it is real, gruesome and truthful. But, this film is important to understand and comprehend the power of these drugs. A great film that is produced, directed, and acted very well, i highly recommend. Just make sure you can handle the truth, This film expressed the true evil of addition, please be careful when watching this movie, it will move if your not ready, i cant stand this stupid review s**t limitation crap. etc. etc.",10,0,1,25 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Cheap Scares and Mediocre Performances.
","I really wanted to like this movie after just seeing Devil Inside (poor film). When i saw the trailer I was truly hoping for a eerie classic horror movie where you really felt scared without the use of cheap scares and in your face randomness (birds scene, need i say more?). It started to get so repetitive and desperate trying to create a scary movie but by the end of it people in the audience were laughing, myself included. Save yourself the money and time. Worth a rent? sure why not if your into those sorta movies, but otherwise don't bother. Trust me. ...... Nothing left to say. 10 line minimum is stupid, sorry. So please ignore this text ..",3,15,26,13 February 2012
