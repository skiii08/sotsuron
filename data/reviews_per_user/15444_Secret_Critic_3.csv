Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," What Have You Done To This Franchise
","OMG what the hell have disney done to the Star Wars Saga... They have totally ruined this by the poor and untalented casting - Chewy was the best actor and all he did was roar.. DAISY this girl cant act -- I watched all 3 recently and had to fast forward most of it cause it was that bad......Words cant describe my anger, total disappointment and poor quality of acting..to bring back the hope in Star Wars i watched the old school Stars Wars THIS WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST....Get a grip Disney and future directors isnt all about he money...",1,5,11,16 March 2020
