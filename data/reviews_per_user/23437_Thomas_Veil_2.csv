The Incredible Hulk," Strike two
","Hero origins in the Marvel universe are often hard enough to believe on their own. (Radioactive spiders are more likely to give you radioactive blood poisoning than super powers.) The Hulk, being basically Mr. Hyde on super-steroids, is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Lou Ferrigno, despite not being as brawny as the comic book character (and who is?), nevertheless did it well. The CGI character in this movie, not so much.In fact, the CGI is the main killer for this movie. On its own, it's not convincing at all. There are almost no scenes in which you're not aware that you're looking at a video game character interacting with normal humans. The result is that the movie ends up looking like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' crossed with an X Box game.Whoever designed the Hulk obviously never heard that less is more. A hulk larger than any living bodybuilder would have been fine, but this is one gigantic, over-detailed brute. If motion-tracking technology was used, it didn't show up in the final product. This Hulk moves awkwardly, at times much too fast considering his bulk. His skin is ridiculously over-detailed, as if the producers were afraid anything less would result in a plastic-y look. The result is that the Hulk looks like he's got the world's worst skin rash or something. Muscle striations are visible everywhere except the Hulk's eyeballs, and his overall size is just WAY overdone, like some homoerotic bodybuilder fantasy.Poor CGI also afflicts things like helicopters and other vehicles, which is puzzling considering people have been doing these things for years now.That leaves us with story, and unfortunately, the old 'the army wants to turn me into a weapon' trope is getting really, really, really tired now. Some ingenuity might infuse fresh blood into this idea, but you won't find it here. The baddies are about as subtle as a fart in an elevator. One ends up wishing that the Cigarette Smoking Man from 'The X Files' would show up to concoct some devious, shrewd plan to capture Bruce Banner. But no, we go full-out tanks-and-troops. And the less said about Blonsky, the better. It's all might and no brains. There are no surprises in this movie, only the assurance that you can see the next turn of the plot in this movie coming a mile away.Norton does a serviceable job as Banner, but you can tell that even he knows that this is a paint-by-numbers plot. Overall it's just old, tired and overblown. Adam West's Batman reached the same level of camp, except that the producers of that show did it intentionally and with gusto.",2,6,11,8 May 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Cute idea, mediocre execution
","This is an odd film. On the one hand, you've gotta like Steve Carrell. He brings a charm to his character, and the part is written well. He's appropriately down about his virginity, but he deals with it. He's naturally p.o.'d when his friends razz him about it, yet mature enough to accept their apology. And the ending is what it should be: Carrell finally finds the right woman when he stops listening to other people's advice and just acts like himself.On the other hand, a lot of the jokes in this film are really lame. The morning hard-on? Cute but hardly guffaw-inducing. The crabby immigrant who swears a lot? Been done, and the swearing is OVERdone. The dumb friends who give Steven bad advice? Old, old, old -- at least as old as 'A Guide for the Married Man' (1967!) and done to death many times since, not only in movies but plenty of TV sitcoms. The boss who secretly yearns for Carrell to be her, ahem, 'buddy'? Nothing ever comes of that plot line.But then this movie had a rough road to hoe. As I said, it's been done over and over ad nauseam, the only real difference is this time it's buddies helping someone lose their virginity, instead of just helping someone get laid. It'd need a ton of wit to overcome a concept this worn out, and that's why I think I was unsatisfied with this film: the jokes were easy and not particularly witty. Some were just odd. For example, when Carrell winds up finally having sex, he sings 'Aquarius'. I found myself asking, 'Why is that supposed to be funny? It just looks strange.' I'm guessing very young audiences take the song to be a dorky expression of happiness by a dorky character, but a lot of folks older than Gen X won't make that association. To them it's a cool (if dated) song.In the end I can't help wondering what better writers would've done with something like this. Hopefully made it into something more than a hybrid cute love story/dumb teen comedy.",4,2,5,5 August 2006
