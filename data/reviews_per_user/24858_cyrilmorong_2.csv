Miracle," Good but misleading
","Do you believe in critical thinking? If not, stop reading.  The movie `The Miracle,' about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, provides a great opportunity to use critical thinking, which shows that the game against the Soviet team was not as big a `David vs. Goliath' story as the movie made it out to be.But first, it's a good movie. Kurt Russell portrays coach Herb Brooks well. Brooks was a good coach who did a great job of preparing his team. The hockey scenes are exciting.  The team spirit and patriotism in the movie seem sincere and genuine.  Thumbs up.But back to the `David vs. Goliath' angle.  Was team USA a `David?' In hindsight, we know that twelve of the U.S. players went on to play in the NHL.  Some very soon after the Olympics were over. Some had long and fine careers. So the talent was there. At the end of the movie, we're told what the players are doing now.  But no mention of their NHL careers.  If they had mentioned this, we might not have seen them as such a little `David.' So the director only told us what he wanted us to know, to play up his angle.If we compare the U.S team in 1980, to the team in 1960, which also won a gold medal, we can see how good the 1980 team was.  Only two players from the 1960 team made it to the NHL and one had a career of only 12 games. Now, in 1980, there were 21 teams in the NHL and in 1960, there were only six.  So if it were 3.5 times easier to make it to the NHL in 1980, we might expect 7 players from the 1980 to make it if they had the same talent level as the 1960 team (3.5*2=7).  But many more, 12, did.  Furthermore, the 12 from the 1980 team played a total of about 6,000 games in their NHL careers while it is just 675 for the 1960 team.  So it seems even more miraculous that the 1960 team took the gold since it looks like they had much less talent than the 1980 team.  The 1960 team also beat the Soviet Union, who were the defending gold medal winners. Haven't heard about a movie for the 1960 team.Were the Russians invincible?  No.  But the movie shows the U.S. players watching the Russians beat a team of NHL all-stars 6-0 on TV just prior to the Olympics.  If you know nothing about the history of hockey, you might say to yourself while watching the movie, `wow, how can these young kids beat a Soviet team that clobbers the NHL's best?'  Well, that 6-0 loss was part of a three game series in which the NHL won one game (4-2) and the other was close (5-4). In 1972, a team of NHL all-stars beat the Russians in a seven game series.  In 1976, a team of NHL all-stars won the Canada Cup tournament, which pitted the best national teams of the world against each other.  This included the Russians, who won 2, lost 2 and tied 1. Also, these NHL all-star teams did not spend six months practicing together as a team like Team USA did in 1980.  If they had, they would have done even better and the Russians would not have looked so invincible. It takes both talent and team work to win.The old format of the NHL All-Star game also shows the value of teamwork. In 1950s and 1960s, the defending Stanley Cup Champions played a team of All-Stars at the start of the NHL season.  Obviously the All-Stars had more talent than could be assembled on any one team.  But the all-stars only won the series 10 wins to 7, with two ties.  The Detroit Red Wings beat the all-stars 7-1 in 1950.  In 1959, the Montreal Canadiens beat the all-stars 6-1.  So sometimes all-star teams get beat pretty bad because they have not had a chance to practice together as a team.  To make an issue out of one game (the 6-0 game mentioned above) is to reach a conclusion based on a small sample size. That can be very misleading.In the final seconds of Team USA's victory over the Soviet Union in 1980, the announcer Al Michaels shouted, `Do you believe in miracles?'  Calling something a miracle does not make it so. If you believe in critical thinking, you won't be so easily fooled. Maybe the movie should have simply been titled `The Upset.' But an upset is not as compelling as a miracle, now is it?",Null,0,0,12 February 2004

","WARNING!! MAJOR SPOILERS!!I don't know what the movie was supposed about. I liked the first three-fourths of it, but I cannot recommend it.  I think it is full of logical inconsistencies, especially involving the characters.Take the Kevin Bacon character:  At one point, he tells his partner Laurence Fishburne that he will put the cuffs on his friend faster than Fishburne will if his friend (Tim Robbins) is guilty.  This establishes him as a guy who puts duty above friendship.  So why does he not arrest Sean Penn at the end of the movie when he knows Penn killed Robbins?  Either he does his duty or he doesn't.Take Fishburne's character:  What happens to him at the end of the movie? Where is he? He would be the first to investigate the missing Robbins character, whom we know is killed by Penn.  Somebody would be investigating his disappearance. Is it just an unsolved murder or disappearance?Penn's character: He gets established as a loving, caring father who went straight after serving time because he loved his daughter. We see him say to his daughter's picture something like `I know I contributed to your death but I don't know how.'  He is by himself, so that should be an indication of a caring, thoughtful guy, which, to me, he turns out not to be by the end of the movie. He is cold and ruthless. In movies, when we are shown characters doing something alone, it is an indication of what they truly are. That is like a contract the movie makes with us. He also knows that Robbins was abused as a kid.  Yet he kills Robbins based only on circumstantial evidence.  Robbins's wife thinks that he killed Penn's daughter.  But Penn has got to be smart enough to want more evidence.  Then he kills Robbins in front of 3 guys who will be surely grilled and leaned on by the cops because it is well known they associate with him.  A bartender also saw them all together.  And Penn would have to know he was a prime suspect. Wouldn't a guy like Penn be shrewder?  Wouldn't he late till later, and have it done when he has an alibi?Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden: She seems to be a pathetic character by the end of the movie.  At first she seems caring, consoling Penn's wife after the murder.  But she suspects her husband murdered Penn's daughter and tells Penn and not the police.  Who is that dumb?  Did she not want her husband to get a fair trial?Laura Linney's character:  She is Penn's wife.  We don't see her or get much sense of her until the end of the movie. Then, as others have said, she turns out to be Lady Macbeth.  She tells her husband Penn that it is good that you do what you have to for your family.  Why could that not simply mean turning Robbins over to the police?  She then tells this cold-blooded mobster of a husband that he could run Boston!!  Then they roll over on the bed and have sex?!?! Only cold, ruthless people do that.  Why should I care about them?Coincidences:  Robbins just happens to kill a guy molesting a child the same night Penn's daughter is accidentally killed?  And Robbins just happened to be in the last bar that Penn's daughter was in? And Penn kills Robbins just before Kevin Bacon's character, a cop, tells Penn he has the real killers? These seem like very cheap plot devices. Too improbable to be believed. How about Penn and Bacon?  They end up being very awful guys, yet they were not the one abducted or molested.  Sure it happened to their friend.  But it is too much to believe they would be so affected.The characters for most of the movie seemed sympathetic.  But at the end, none of them, except possibly for Robbins's character that got into a car as a child with a child molester who pretended to be a cop (Penn and Bacon were there, too but did not get in) are sympathetic at the end of the movie. Penn gets back together with his estranged wife and seems to be happy with his life, so why bother investigating the murder of his friend Robbins even though he knows Penn killed him?  YUK.  At a parade, he makes his hand look like a gun and gives a sort of fake POW! pointed at Penn, like you're the man buddy.  Or this is as much as I will do to you.  And we see Penn surrounded by two or three of his thug henchman.  Penn seems to have no remorse for killing Robbins.  Linney gives Harden a sort of so what look, I don't care what happened to you.  Harden walks around looking very sad and pathetic. Penn and Bacon don't seem to care how sad Robbins's son must be. We can see how sad he is a float with other little leaguers.  There seems to be no reason why we should care about the characters played by Bacon, Harden, Penn or Linney.  They are all despicable and unlikable people.And it is not okay somehow that Robbins is dead because he killed a child molester, either.  If I were on a jury trying Robbins for that murder, it would be hard to give him the death penalty.  The movie seems to be saying that was some sort of justice that he got killed.  Yet his murder of the molester was not premeditated like Penn's murder of him was.  Or the conscious decision of Bacon to be okay with Penn killing Robbins. And the way Penn killed Robbins is brutal, painful and demeaning. Penn treats him in a very mean spirited way. The movie seems to be saying this is okay. Again, YUK.",1,182,262,30 December 2003
