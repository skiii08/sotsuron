The Blair Witch Project," Have you ever been lost in the WOODS?
","Have you ever been truly lost in the woods? The total darkness, the total silence, your imagination taking you on a wild ride. That's what Blair Witch Project is all about, imaginations going wild. Those primitive fears that humans have had since we sat huddled around a fire in fear of a Saber Tooth Tiger looking for an easy meal. Fear of the unknown is real fear. To see the monster, to know the monster, is a monster that can be dealt with. That invisible monster, the one from the ID, is the one that can't be dealt with, it can only be feared. Blair Witch Project is about sitting in a dark, cold tent at night without a gun, knife or spear and listening to your approaching doom. A previous writer said it best, you can't watch this movie with a bunch of friends, in a safe cozy living room drinking beers. It should be watched in quiet solitude so your imagination can run wild.",Null,0,1,19 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My 6 year old grandson was the perfect reviewer of this movie
","Where is Darth Vader!! That was his number one question. I bought the tape for him thinking it would be a great experience for Grandfather and Grandson. Every time he comes over he wants to see Star Wars, his favorite character is Darth Vader. What I ended up watching alone, grandson lost all interest, was another dead Walt Disney type of boring 'G' rated movie.",Null,0,1,11 September 2000
Alien," The Real Alien film
","In 1979 Alien made its appearance on the silver screen. However most fans of the film that were not at the Premiere showing do not realize that they missed The Real ALIEN. Selected theaters throughout the country were allowed to show a full un-cut version of the film that contained numerous scenes that were not released on later showings. The scenes created an almost unbearable amount of tension and fear. Scenes that show the Alien head and extended tongue appearing out of a total black background and then slowing withdrawing back into total darkness while the crew is searching for it. The studio, wanting to tone down the film for general consumption, deliberately removed scenes like these. It was thought that in its original state the movie was to powerful and would have a negative effect of sales.Some months later after the sales slowed down the movie was brought back to the theaters and advertised as 'See Alien with scenes never before seen.' Unfortunately we may never see the Real Alien film.",Null,0,1,5 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great for Kids of all ages but,
","If you are one of the few people on the planet that hasn't seen this one, don't bother if you are looking for a real Science Fiction movie. In 1977 when it was first released Star Wars was billed as a real science fiction movie that would top anything previously made. What we got was a fantasy void of any science that takes place in OUTER SPACE. People actually booed when Darth Vader appeared on the screen, not because he was the villain, but because of the realization that serious sci-fi was not going to happen here. I enjoyed the movie despite this but I'll never forget that sinking feeling in my gut when I realized here we go again another Walt Disney type movie complete with puppets and mystical heroes.",Null,2,3,11 September 2000
