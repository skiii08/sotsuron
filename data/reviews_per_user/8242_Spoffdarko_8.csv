Skyfall," Disappointing and too much product placement
","Disappointing is the only word I can use for Skyfall, poor cliché-ridden script, too many blatant nods to previous Bonds, some really stupid ideas and scenes (Komodo dragons anyone?). I was very excited to see it and left the cinema disappointed and a bit angry at being cheated out of £8.00THIS...is NOT Bond...Casino Royale IS Bond. And am I the only one who felt that this was a mini-reboot of the reboot?Shame really when the best thing about the latest Bond film is the appearance of the DB5.I don't know if it is just me, but Skyfall also seemed like a huge product placement exercise, if you weren't looking at Omega watches, it was Heineken beer, or SonyVaio laptops, or Sony mobile phones, or Jaguar cars, or Macallan Whisky.And they were just the ones I did see, there must have been others.Also with 30 minutes worth of adverts for Omega, Sony, Heineken, James Bond video games etc. before the actual film started, I was just marketed-out by the end of it.Very disappointing in the fact that they now use the most enduring franchise in film history to flog you as much stuff as they can.",5,13,31,5 November 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Still to be beaten.
","In the action/ adventure genre I believe Raiders of the Lost Ark is the yardstick by which all other films should be measured.There simply was not an action/ adventure film made before this which is as good, and there has not been one since (although the sequels came close).Everything here works, there is nothing wasted. Nothing to bloat the film and make it boring, nothing to slow down the pace and nothing unnecessary. RotLA cracks along at a good pace, but occasionally gives the viewer time to breathe before we are off again on another leg of the adventure. This is action movie making at it's very best, the cast, direction, cinematography, score, locations, story, everything is just perfect. Everyone involved in making RotLA brought their 'A-game' to the table, and it shows. RotLA is such an evocative film, from the opening jungle scene, to the Cairo markets, to the outline of Indy against the sunset as they dig for the Well of Souls, to the final 'storage room' scene. The images Spielberg created here are masterful, the score by John williams complementing them perfectly. The action is pure edge-of-your-seat stuff, and there are a good few laughs thrown in too.I was around 6 or so when I first ever saw it and I was blown away. I am still blown away every time when I watch it now (I am now 41). A modern classic in every sense of the word, one that is far superior to the mindless cookie-cutter tripe that is churned out pretty much every week in cinemas 37 years later. It really fascinates me how people can say that Raiders is for 'kids with no brain' and give it a poor rating. These are probably the same people who turn up at the multiplex each month to see the next Marvel film, which is just the same as the last Marvel film, but with a slightly different character.Nothing else to say really, if you haven't seen Raiders then see it. You can thank me later!",10,1,2,18 July 2018
Ready Player One," Disappointed
","This is a difficult review for me to write.First and foremost I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan. I firmly believe he is one of the finest film makers the world has ever seen. Right up there with Kubrick, Hitchcock, Lean, Kurosawa, Lynch and the other great pioneers of cinema.E.T. was the first film I ever saw in a Cinema, and as a 6 year old it left a huge impression on me. I have followed Spielberg's career and films ever since, I have read many books about him, watched interviews, documentaries, and all the extras on all his films. I almost feel like I know him personally. He is to me, like Halliday is to Wade Watts, someone to be looked at in reverence and awe. His films shaped so much of my childhood, and I will always be grateful for his contributions to popular culture. So many of the cultural touchstones we enjoy and take for granted nowadays would probably not exist without him.
So, with a heavy heart, we come to Ready Player One.I was extremely excited to learn that Spielberg was starting production on a film centred around a Virtual Reality universe that made huge references to 80's popular culture. When I first heard about it, I decided to pick up a copy of the book (which I had never heard of). Having read the book I enjoyed it, but did not think it was amazing, just quite good. The film, however, I felt had the potential to be something spectacular. I thought the collaboration of Spielberg and Cline would take the book, and with a little re-writing, a tweak here and there, bring it to the big screen in awesome fashion.I was wrong.Perhaps it was the fact that he was a little 'starstruck' by working with Spielberg, but I cannot believe how much Ernest Cline has allowed his material to be torn to shreds and thrown in the trash can. Worse, actually, that he co-wrote the script, so he must have excised a fair chunk of it himself. I would genuinely say that a large proportion of the book is not present in the film, the setting, characters, and a handful of references and scenes are all you get. I would say 75% of the book is gone. I understand fully that books need to be changed and adapted to be made into a film, but something went massively wrong with Ready Player One. I simply don't understand how the team behind this production (including Cline himself) could consciously allow this hatchet-job to happen. I am by no means an Ernest Cline fan-boy, but there were so many scenes in the book that would have translated brilliantly into the film (and not even ones that required licensing deals) and these great scenes were discarded. I won't spoil it by describing what the scenes were, but some of them would have given us more sympathy with Wade, instead they were glossed over and we don't really see his plight of having almost no money, no prospects, and living pretty much hand-to-mouth in a dystopian society. He just comes across as a surly teenager, which in the book, he is not. In the book he is a likeable guy who is struggling along in a life that has dealt him a poor hand.Two of the challenges for the keys were changed completely, and this is to the detriment of the film. The original challenges should have been kept (or kept and changed slightly if licensing was an issue) and the ones created in the film (whilst, admittedly, being spectacular to watch) should have been side-line challenges that Wade takes part in and not the key challenges themselves. Many of the 80's music and videogame references are simply not there, perhaps due to aforementioned licensing issues? But for a film that sold itself on a retro 80's pop-culture vibe, the 80's nostalgia feeling I had during it was surprisingly low, I think that was mainly down to the music and there not being enough of it or having the wrong music playing in the wrong scenes. For example, Van Halen's 'Jump' is totally wasted in a scene where Wade is just making his way around the Stacks. The music was put to far better use in the trailers (which, incidentally, were better than the film itself).Much of who does what, and how things pan out in the story has also been changed around drastically, basically to give the actors something (or a bit more) to do. Art3mis is brought into the real-life part of the story far too early in an attempt to give the story some emotional grounding, unfortunately their relationship in the Oasis actually works better and is more believable. The villain Sorrento remains pretty much as he does in the book, but at the end of the film appears to have some kind of a change of heart that made me feel nauseous. Even after my rant, there is some good stuff to be had here. The visuals are absolutely incredible, there are some references which catch you by surprise and are very welcome and there are some genuinely thrilling and funny scenes. In particular, the back-story of James Halliday and Ogden Morrow is played out well (even though you don't see very much of them).So, all in all RP1 for me was a disappointment. After following the project from the beginning, watching the trailers almost every day since they released my excitement for this project had reached fever-pitch. Sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start my hands were trembling slightly and my mouth was dry, I could actually feel my elevated heart rate, that is how much I wanted RP1 to blow me away...It failed.I have to close by doing something I don't want to have to do. I have to lay the blame for my utter disappointment at the feet of my hero. I am so sorry to say this, but I fear he may have lost the magic that made him and his films so special. Spielberg was by far the most influential person on this project, 'The Captain' as it were. I feel that this time 'The Captain' steered the ship so far off course that no-one knew where it was going until it was too late. I don't understand how something with so much potential could have gone so wrong in the hands of a true genius.The last 15 minutes of the film are a complete waste of time, some of it is actually laughable. I almost get the feeling that the end of the screenplay was not proof-read, and was just filmed mindlessly with no actual real thought behind the outcome.Ultimately, if you can't guess what happens, Wade wins. Then he decides to perform a huge rug-pull on all the people who risked their avatars in the battle to help him win. He closes the Oasis on Tuesdays and Thursdays, apparently to make people spend more time together in the real world. So after all his speech about 'I love the Oasis so much, are you willing to fight to help save it?' he shuts it down for 48 hours a week...Cheers buddy! As a gamer he should know better than anyone how angry gamers get when the servers go offline for ONE hour!What a shallow and soul-devoid hero Wade is, did he spare any thought for the people who earn their living from the Oasis? who receive their education in the Oasis? the lonely people (which Wade once was) who have no family or friends and use the Oasis as a means of social interaction? apparently not...You see, Wade is now ok after his big win, he has a nice girlfriend, a nice fancy loft apartment and a fat wedge of cash in the bank. Who cares what closing the Oasis a couple of days a week will do to the people who are left in the slums?In the end, Wade shows early signs of becoming the very thing he was fighting against in the first place...Shame really...",4,1,4,3 April 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Erm, no...
","Awful in pretty much every sense.Do not waste your money on this pathetic excuse of an X-men film.The very clever and interesting X-men franchise has now sold out and turned into the mindless summer blockbuster in the Transformers style.Over the top everything, far too much exposition for the retards in the audience, boring story, paper-thin villains, I could go on...I found myself checking my watch a few times during this over-long stinking turd.My partner who is an avid X-men film fan ever since X1, turned to me as we were walking out and said 'well, that was crap'...I had to agree.",1,37,70,30 May 2014
Inception," Not worth the hype thrown at it
","I have some advice for intelligent people who wish to see a great film about dreams...Watch Mulholland Dr. Instead.I found Inception to be a strange animal, it's almost like a film that has been aimed at cretins to help them feel as though they are intelligent.As far as having my mind blown I found myself still waiting for the 'Blow' as the film wrapped, following two and a half hours of dull exposition, lacklustre performances, and cliché after cliché all dressed up as the 'next big thing'.I am by no means a 'Nolan hater' he has made some very solid films up to this point and has real talent, I also do not blame him for this offering as he obviously thought it was good, I blame the easily pleased and intellectually challenged people who have hyped it up to be something it clearly is not.The 3rd greatest film of all time?...Give me a break.",3,9,17,5 August 2010
Deadpool," What did you expect?
","I don't know what some people expected to see here.They must not have watched the trailer or seen any advertising for Deadpool before actually watching it.Deadpool is meant to be cheesy, corny, over the top, naff and all the things a super-hero film tries it's best not to be (but usually is).This is the beauty of it, Deadpool is reverse-reverse ripping the p*ss out of all the other super-hero movies, and it does it with such style. Deadpool takes all the things super-hero movies try their best to avoid (but fail every time) and magnifies them by x 10, that is the fun of it!I love this film, it is a very welcome departure from the usual Marvel c*ap we have been receiving time and time again.Well done Deadpool guys, can't wait for the sequel (or Deadpool's number 2 LOL).",9,3,5,8 August 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Too excessive
","I just found this whole thing bloated and excessive, at the expense of any decent story or realism.The original Road Warrior painted a stark picture of a struggle for survival after the 'end of the world as we know it'. This is not like that at all.I just felt that the theme was not properly explored here, I would have preferred to have seen Max on his own, surviving, and then maybe trying to help someone else later on in the film.I didn't expect (or want) a Road Warrior remake, but I also did not expect (or want) what this turned out to be.",3,17,36,20 July 2015
Back to the Future," My favourite film of all time.
","The best film ever made.I really cannot convey how much I love Back to the Future. I was born in 1976 so was the perfect age for when this was released at the Cinema. I spent my pocket money on 'Back to the Future everything' sticker book, poster, pencil case for school, skateboard, you name it! I think I saw it about 5 times at my local Cinema, and then at least another 5 on VHS when it was released. I literally bugged the guy at the Video store not to sell it to anyone else when he was done with renting it out. I saved up and bought the ex-rental video from him when he got a new copy and watched it pretty much constantly!Everything about BttF is perfect. The story, the cast, the score, the locations, the De Lorean! BttF is a pure time-capsule (no pun intended) that whisks me back to being 9 years old again.Michael J Fox is wonderful as Marty in his break-out movie role, and I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Doc Brown with the perfection that Christopher Lloyd did. The rest of the cast are also extremely strong, everyone brings their game here to make the best film possible, and it shows.Both Bob's (Zemeckis and Gale) created absolute magic and captured it on film, there will literally never be another one like this. I know Bob Zemeckis was awarded the best director Oscar for Forrest Gump, but for me, Back to the Future will always be his crowning achievement. Alan Silvestri and Huey Lewis and the News added the cherry to the top of this wonderful cake with their fantastic score and music contributions! We also cannot forget Steven Spielberg, without him, Back to the Future may never have been made.If you are any kind of movie fan then BttF is a must. The fun and downright excellence of this film just shines through in every scene, it is infectious. You can tell that everyone had a great time making it!BttF also has the best cliff-hanger third act of any film I have ever seen! I still sit on the edge of my seat even now, and I must have seen it 50 times (Will Marty and Doc's plan succeed?).I showed it to my 7 year old son last weekend, and whilst he did not understand all of it, he loved watching it. There is a reason why Back to the Future became wildly popular, has stood the test of time, and is loved by different generations all around the world. The reason is because it takes the viewer through every emotion that a great film should, one moment you are basking in the cool of it all, the next you are laughing, the next you are on the edge of your seat. That, is visual storytelling at it's best!Extra bonus points must be awarded for making the Time Machine a DeLorean, this was an inspired and genius idea. The design of the Time Machine is second to none, it looks exactly like you would think a Time Machine should, and is, by my reckoning, the coolest car in cinema history. Pulling a car with such a troubled history from relative obscurity, and turning it into one of the most recognizable in the world was a master-stroke.I think being there in 1985 the first time around gives me a particularly special relationship with Back to the Future, but everyone should see it at least once, as I said, I think it is the best film ever made, and the collective work is the best trilogy ever made!Thank you to everyone who came together to make the Back to the Future trilogy happen. You gave us something really incredible, unique, and timeless!",10,0,0,20 May 2019
