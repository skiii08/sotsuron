The Blair Witch Project," Highly original - DO believe the hype...
","The Blair Witch Project focuses on a group of students who shoot a documentary about a local myth - the Blair Witch. They hike into the forest - never to be found again.... Their footage is rediscovered a year later - that footage is the Blair Witch Project.This film is a highly original 'movie' - choc full of fear and mood. Yes - it was hyped beyond belief when it was released... It was billed as a sort of snuff documentary of sorts. But I think it delivers mood and atmosphere by the truck load.The characters are well developed and conceived. When the proverbial poo hits the fan - the tension between the characters hits boiling point.Don't expect a truck load of gore, zombies or hockey masked goons - just lose yourself atmosphere and mood in the Blair Witch Project!",Null,1,2,23 November 2004
Alien 3," Extended Workprint DVD Edition - Definite improvement...!
",Plot Spoilers Ahoy!!I've just watched the workprint edition of Alien 3 on the Alien Quadrilogy - and I'd have to say that it makes it a much better film than the original release. It expands on things which were not crystal clear as in the original version including Ripley's affair with Clemens and Gollic's obsession with the 'dragon'.  Also - I much prefer this ending rather than the original ending - in the original - the alien bursts out of Ripley's stomach - giving a sense that the alien had finally beat Ripley.  Whereas in the new version - Ripley just jumps into the molten lead - beating both the alien and the company/Bishop.  A LOT more satisfying than the original movie - and it doesn't leave you disappointed. Another aspect which the extended version is far superior is that it gives you more empathy for all of the prisoners by providing more of an insight into them - which gives much more impact to their downfall than the original.This movie isn't up to the extremely high standard of the first two films - but definitely - it is worth checking out the new DVD version of it.,Null,1,3,14 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best bit was the opening 'Star Wars' title
","Star Wars Episode 1 'The Phantom Menace' is the first episode of the Star Wars movie saga. It tells the story of a couple of Jedi knights who, whilst assisting a Queen save her home planet Naboo, find a young boy who could be the 'chosen one' who could bring balance to the mystical 'force'.I've got to be frank - the best part of this movie is where the 'Star Wars' logo appears over space and the familiar Star Wars theme blasts out. If you are a fan of the first films - it is a fantastic sense of hope, excitement and exhilaration. Pity that as soon as the 'Star Wars' logo fades into the darkness - so does the movie.The traditional opening 'Star Wars' backstory text talks about an intergalactic trade embargo, taxation and a blockade. Wow - that doesn't really get you going does it. And as soon as you settle into the movie - the characters are cardboard and only act as a background to the special effects; the story uninspired, over complex yet toned down for kiddies; the dialogue - ever so wooden ('Are you an angel?'/'What?'/'An Angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the moons of Iego, I think. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.'...as a case in point); the special effects aren't all that; and ultimately - maybe the backstory behind the original Star Wars trilogy isn't all that exciting. I mean we all knows what happens (Anakin gets the Queen knocked up and becomes Darth Vader)?! What's the pointMost of the actors (most of which are really good in other films) look somewhat bored with the material. Perhaps they should have attempted to ad-lib the script - as George Lucas' script writing ability is at the 4th Grade level.The movie is terribly edited and paced - the movie gets incredibly bogged down over an unexciting 'pod race' sequence and lead-up. I felt like I was watching a bad video game (everything including the acting is computer generated!).Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this movie is the final half an hour - it almost makes it feel reminiscent of the old Star Wars climatic sequences. But to be subjected to the first hour and a half is just unbearable.If only Lucas had just quit while he was ahead and stopped making Star Wars after 'Return of the Jedi'. I mean - I think I enjoyed the 'Ewok' telemovies better than this junk.",2,11,24,25 May 2005
Fight Club," Ultimate trip
",Fight Club tells the story of an insomniac insurance investigator (Ed Norton) who initially attends help/support groups to try to help his insomnia.  Annoyed at the presence of another `faker' (Marla  Helena Bonham Carter) at these groups  he turns to Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt)  an eccentric soap salesman.  They soon develop underground `fight clubs'  a highly aggressive male `support' group.  Fight Club starts to get out of hand when Tyler gears `Project Mayhem' up a notch.The plot of Fight Club is based on a Chuck Palahnuk novel of the same name (brilliant author  check him out!).  The narrator (Norton) provides classic nihilistic / disinfected / insomniac views of the mundane of life (so many classic lines).The performances are just so good  Brad Pitt is always a winner in these `sorts' of crazy roles (see 12 Monkeys).  Ed Norton plays a terrific `straight' worker type who is enticed by Tyler's ways and `free' lifestyle  but as he works out Tyler's world  Ed Norton is great as the seemingly insane narrator.The soundtrack (by the Dust Brothers) complements the mind-blowing visuals from David Fincher and crew.This is one movie that is a bit of a mind-fudge the first time around  and a bit of a must for repeat viewing!10 out of 10!!!,10,1,3,14 February 2003
Akira," Wildly slick and original ride
","Akira is an anime classic.  The plot revolves around a bunch of motor-riding punks who accidentally get caught up in a Japanese military / government experiment.  Tetsuo, a gang member, is subjected to various scientific tests where he develops a latent psychic ability.  When he is unable to handle the new found powers - he takes it out on the world. I've been a big fan of this film since it's release in the 80s.  It brought a new darker, more adult orientated wave of animation to an unsuspecting audience. The film's animation is still astonishing - it was the first Japanese anime to use the Western process of recording the actors before developing the animation - and it shows.  It looks more realistic and gritty - less cheesy than other anime contemporaries. The plot and character development for an anime film is second to none - it doesn't hold up and isn't compromising for audiences who don't pay attention. The new English 're-dub' is much more recommended than the original - it actually makes the ending less complicated and cryptic. A wildly slick and original ride for those who are into futuristic sci-fi films.",Null,0,4,30 January 2004
Billy Elliot," Feel good film
",Billy Elliot focuses on the struggle of a young boy (Billy Elliot) and his newfound love and passion for dancing and ballet.  The story is set against the backdrop of union upheaval in Northern England where Billy's father and brother face redundancy in a local coal mine.  Once they discover Billy's dancing secret - they are outraged - and want him to do something more manly! This movie is definitely a feel good one - it is similar in a way to The Full Monty - whereby people struggling with oppression and depression overcome it.  But where I thought the Full Monty was depressing (people are trying to commit suicide in it!!) - I think this is much more uplifting. The dance sequences are spectacular - and the acting hits the spot. This is definitely worth a watch or two!,Null,1,3,2 July 2004
Blade," Interesting spin on the vampire myth
","Blade is a movie based on a comic book of the same name. A vampire, Blade, who has enhanced 'powers' is a vigilante... out to stop the underworld of the vampires.Blade is an interesting twist on the tired old story of vampires - with visually impressive (for the most part) action, special effects and design. The basic premise is pretty good although the story doesn't really last for the long running time of almost two hours. Quite possibly - this movie would have been a hell of a lot sharper if the editor cut half an hour out of the movie.Also - the film goes out on a whimper... If there was a better ending - it would have been a more satisfying ending.The movie seems to pay homage to both Hong Kong action films and newer stuff like 'Mortal Kombat' (eg: lots of martial arts set to a thumping techno soundtrack) - although I wish there was a bit less orchestral music and more techno!Wesley Snipes is impressive in the action sequences but his character is a little bit shallow (makes Batman look deep!).OK - but could have been much sharper and better!",Null,4,8,3 December 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride!
","Sleepy Hollow is director Tim Burton's take on the classic story of the 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow' (aka the Headless Horseman).As you would expect from a Burton film - it is Gothic, darkish with a splash of camp (no thanks to Johnny Depp's performance!).The story centres around a New York detective who is sent to investigate the beheadings of three people in the village of Sleepy Hollow. He soon uncovers a murderous, headless ghost which his scientific background can't explain.Sleepy Hollow is an exciting film - the headless horseman sequences are completely electrifying. They are instantly recognisable (I probably had nightmares as a kid remembering that headless horseman crossing the bridge) and totally engaging - as the ghost proves himself as an unstoppable force on the townspeople.That said - where the film sort of falls down is it's 'head rolling' plotting. It is sometimes confusing to try and make sense at all the plot twists and developments - although things are reconciled by the last 20 minutes (it all makes sense).Overall - Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride - brimful of headless delights...",8,1,2,12 May 2006
The Beach," When good books go bad
","The Beach is a prime example of when a good book turned into a movie goes bad...The Beach tells the story of an American traveller in Bangkok - looking for the ultimate experience. He befriends a Scottish traveller who, after suiciding, gives the American a map to a secret beach - the most beautiful beach in the world (or so the story goes)...The Beach feels like a bit of a train-wreck of a movie. Leonard De Caprio - although a talented actor - feels so uncomfortable as the lead.Danny Boyle (most famous for the film Trainspotting) gives a bit of visual flair to this movie (as well as a pretty good soundtrack) - but with no soul.The action feels forced and un-thrilling. The actors on the whole feel way too hammy.You don't really get to feel for Richard (the main character) and his transition over to the 'dark side' probably because Leonard couldn't act his way out of a paper bag in this movie.And what is with that video game dream sequence - it probably rates as one of the most embarrassing scenes ever committed on film...",3,3,6,27 February 2007
Final Destination 2," Lame Lame Lame...! WARNING SPOILERS!!
","Final Destination 2 follows on from the first film - where yet another group of teenagers avoid 'Death's plan' by avoiding a fatal road accident. Yet again - they get picked off one by one in even more gruesome horrific style.I was a semi-fan of the first - it was original, fresh, sometimes shocking or scary... but it suffered from being too smart. Its conclusion was a bit of a let down (doesn't really answer how you avoid inevitability). You would think that the sequel would try and remedy this...!Yes - the death scenes are just as outrageous as the first... but I found this movie to be quite annoying and uninteresting. All the characters were fairly bland - so you didn't care if they horribly die. The couple of survivors at the end of the film were the most boring characters (I was so disappointed they didn't get decapitated or something!). I also thought that Ali Larter's death was a bit cheap (I hate sequels that give characters from earlier films cheap deaths!).Again - the film doesn't deal with the ending (or how to beat Death) satisfactory. It was all pretty predictable and if you didn't see the twist ending happening a mile away - you probably need to go back to school.This movie was lame lame lame! Don't bother.",Null,0,1,19 November 2004
Alien," Scared S*&%less
","I first saw this movie when I was about four years old.  I loved Doctor Who at the time and loved all the sorts of 'aliens' with laser guns and such. My dad rented out Alien at the local video store and I thought it would be a movie with 'Dr. Who' type aliens in it. Boy - I was wrong and I was totally scared out of my brain by this movie.Alien is an absolute classic.  The plot is simple enough and I found that it tended not to focus on all of the characters (to gain sympathy for them). Because the Alien is so terrifying and horrific, you find that it doesn't need to do this ...Another brilliant masterstroke of this movie is the heroine - Ripley.  I find it great that there is a female hero of this film - it makes it a lot scarier and adds a sense of vulnerability.The actual design / special effects of the Alien is also quite brilliant.I find that this is the best movie of the 'Alien' series (even over the sequel - Aliens). This movie could be one of the best movies of all time. 10 out of 10",Null,0,1,13 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," So frustating - very pale in comparison to original trilogy
","After watching Attack of the Clones a few times - I just find it so frustrating to watch when drawing comparisons to the original trilogy.I only would wish that George Lucas would not make any more Star Wars films - as they are all just screwing around with the sentimentality of fans of the original.The plot still revolves around the same bunch of dry characters.  The acting is just so wooden when compared to the original trilogy - but I don't think the wooden acting is helped anyway with the horrible dialogue in the script. You will be just cringing at listening to the actors - it is painfully bad (see Yoda for the best/worst example).  I feel that the characters in the original three have more soul - they are full of life unlike everyone in this film.The sound effects are distracting to the point of unbearable.  Every single creature has a distinct sound-effect, as well as every gun, every space ship - haven't these sound effect guys have ever heard about 'Less is More'!The visuals are equally as distracting and annoying as the sound effects. Just about every single shot is crammed full of computer generated effects (a la the Star Wars Special Editions of the late 90s).  Yoda and even the storm troopers are all digital effects - it just feels cheap and soulless. Are we watching a cartoon here?!I think that these new Star Wars movies have meant death for everyone's careers involved with it (maybe apart from Ewan McGregor).The final action sequence is not bad - but why sit through 137 minutes of soulless commercial crud just to get there?!George Lucas ain't a genus - and Star Wars Episode 2 is proof of this.  I wish he would give up his day job!  Even though this is better than the totally limp Episode 1 - it is still infuriatingly bad.",Null,1,2,17 February 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," God fearing, gun toting Republicans vs Blood thirsty, cannibalistic mutants
","The Hills Have Eyes basically pits a family of god fearing, gun toting Republicans against a blood thirsty, cannibalistic 'tribe' of nuclear mutants - so I basically had trouble working out who I should root for...All things serious though - The Hills Have Eyes was a bit of a nasty piece of work. The violence was OTT (over the top) and especially disturbing during the 'rape' scene (need I say any more!). The main characters (republican withstanding) were all a bit grating - people you didn't really care if they get brutally raped or murdered or both by violent mutant zombie people. The plot is a little predictable (eg: you would be pretty dumb to not figure out that the family should not have taken the short cut route through a 'non-sealed road' and a 'private gate'!).The action scenes are OK - and the scene with the 'democrat' guy waking up in a freezer was probably the highlight of the movie. Although the highlight wasn't the climax (which was a bit of a let down).The Hills Have Eyes was a bit of a nasty piece of work - but I'm sure the under 13's set would have great fun watching it.",5,0,2,20 January 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as sharp as the original two films - SPOILERS!
","Terminator 3 was probably set to not reach the same heights as the two previous entries.  James Cameron, Eddie Furlong and Linda Hamilton were not involved with it - a shame :(.  Also - I thought that they rapped the series up nicely at the end of the second film (destroying the last remnants of the Terminators to prevent Judgment Day from happening)....  However in Hollywood - when anyone is on a good thing - they will milk it to get a few bucks out of it.  Thus a few plot holes were exploited and... surprise-surprise - the machines live on. Terminator 3 opens up with John Conner (now 20-something) who is a drifter - not wanting to be connected to the system.  We learn that Judgment Day was only delayed from T2 - not preventing.  Of course - they send two terminators from the future to hunt and kill all the future leaders of the human resistance. This film isn't all that bad - I just don't think it reaches the high heights of the first two.  Cameron (when making sequels) - tends to follow the same rules of the first movie - while giving it a whole new fresh appeal.  Sadly - T3 doesn't feel as fresh as the first two and it tends to bend the rules a bit for its own devices.  Nor does the movie follow the basic plot lines of the original two films.  The Terminatrix is a good idea (to be female) - but doesn't reach the same levels of brutality as Arnie in the first movie and the T-1000 in the second.  Plus - it doesn't feel that radically different from the T-1000 (which was just a pleasure in T2)... all the shape shifting aspects are still there - but she just seems to have a few bells and whistles attached for fun (eg: controlling other machines / can fire off weapons).  I don't think they play off the Terminatrix's powers off to full potential - which was a shame. Overall - I don't think it is a bad movie - its just that it tries to be a different movie from the first two - without succeeding.",Null,0,0,31 January 2004
American Beauty," Ultra-sharp satire
","American Beauty is deadly sharp satire - it centres on what seems like a typical American middle class family.  But upon closer inspection - their lives are slowly turning inside out.  The husband (the very dry Kevin Spacey) is on the verge of a mid-life crisis - dissatisfied with his marriage, job and family.  He becomes obsessed with his daughter's best friend.  Meanwhile - the very career focused wife (Annette Bening) starts an affair with the real-estate 'king'.

Aliens," Kick A$$@!
","Alien was / is one of my all time favourite films.  The totally shocking and scary alien  a stealthy stalking killing machine  disposing the crew of Nostromo  it scared the bejesus out of me (it still does!).Aliens picks up 57 years (or so) after the first film.  Ripley can't get over her experience with the alien  she decides to join a team of marines, sent over to investigate the disappearance of colonists on LV-426.  Everyone is sceptical of Ripley and her story of the alien.Surprise surprise  the aliens have taken over the colonists and its up to Ripley and the surviving marines to escape from LV-426 and get rid of the aliens once and for all!  Hoorah!This film works on so many levels.  It is highly original  tweaking this film into a `Vietnam-style' war film is a brilliant masterstroke by James Cameron  but retaining the sense of dread and menace from the original filmThe characterisation is terrific  Ripley shows her softer, motherly side (not shown in the first)  but remains strong and determined  a great feminist character.  It shows her rising to the occasion once again  to face her demons one more time (alas the sequels!)The marines are excellent  with their tough / cool in battle attitude  from the dyke-ish Vasquesez (she is so cool) to the `fragile' Hudson (I love it how he is so distraught through the movie until he finally gets over it  and you know what happens to him)  ;-).Even Bourke is great (in a way)  he develops the issues raised in the first movie about who is worse (aliens or humans?).The special effects are awesome and it was great how the aliens have changed from the original film into more of a fighting machine than being a sleek, silent killer.Even though this film is `gold'  I still think the original beats it (only just) with its spooky atmosphere  I know heaps of people would argue with this!My score 10 out of 10 baby!  A word of advice  watch the original cut rather than the special editioneven though some of the extra scenes are kind of cool (the shooting gallery gun thingos)  I find that the film was better without you knowing what happened on LV-426.",10,1,2,14 February 2003
Die Hard 2," What the...?
","Die Hard 2 (aka Die Hard 2: Die Harder) follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) who arrives at Dulles Airport to pick up his wife for the Christmas holidays. But, being a Die Hard movie, some terrorists take over the Airport's traffic control system and hold all the inbound flights 'hostage'... There is only McClane (and the Airport cops, and the army) to put a stop to the terrorists.This movie is fairly dumb. There are soooo much implausibility and a tonne of plot holes:1. McClane arrives a few hours early to pick up his wife at the airport. I mean - who goes and picks up their loved ones from an airport a couple of hours early?! Probably only the stupid and lonely....2. The fact that the old granny smuggled a cattle prod on the flight is pretty silly (unless pre-9/11 they didn't check for weapons on flights?).3. You see terrorists getting nasty with the luggage area of the airport - but what does this have to do with taking over the airport's traffic control system?4. If the British Plane thought that the ground was in fact 200 yards higher than in reality - shouldn't it have crashed before the runway? 5. The total implausibility of McClane and his wife getting caught up together with terrorists again - plus the fact that the obnoxious news presenter from the first film is, not only in this film, but travelling on the same flight with Holly McClane on Christmas Eve with his camera man in tow. Why would a reporter from LA be flying on Christmas Eve to DC with a camera man?!6. The stupidity of the police who don't bother to check the immediate area to find out where the terrorists were hiding.7. Why couldn't all the planes hovering over Dulles just fly somewhere else (it isn't like Washington DC is in the middle of nowhere)? 8. Holly McClane mentions that she was on a 5 and a half hour flight from LA to Dulles - but it only takes less than 4 and 3/4 hours.... duh! 9. The bunch of terrorists dressed up as painters in the annex - what do they have to do with anything except for the excuse of having a gun battle with the SWAT team?10. The rental car woman that tries to pick up Bruce Willis - clearly he is old enough to be her father and it is sick. Plus she was mega-peeved when Bruce stole her stamp pad and paper - but when he gets back - she gets all flirty.11. The reporter who sneaks into the control tower... what the? Security?!12. The polite service on a British carrier??! Not in this universe. 13. Bruce Willis manages to call his wife on the plane phone. I'm not sure how that works...? Speaking of phones - the reporter appears to go to a 'pay phone' near the toilets of the plane.... I've never seen those?I'm sure just about everything single bit of this movie has some sort of plot hole or implausibilies. But if you switch off your brain - it ain't a half bad dumb action film. Just not up to the standard of the first one.",6,3,5,25 May 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Way way bad stuff
","Alien Vs Predator (or AVP as fanboys would call it) is the joining of two pretty good franchises, but instead of making it something of quality, this movie is like a road accident.AVP has some sort of 'plot' involving scientist discovering an ancient pyramid thingy in Antarctica, but have found a place where predators (the big alien dudes who like to hunt Arnie) used to breed aliens (the Ripley variety) to hunt on Earth. Of course - the scientists fall prey to some aliens and predators alike. One by one - they all get hunted down (except for a pretty stupid heroine - of course!).If you didn't think this movie could get any steeewpidier - one of the surviving predators teams up with the surviving human and try and put a stop to the naughty aliens (at this is the point I would normally walk out of the cinema).I think this movie was supposed always supposed to be crud. Not only did the highly-talented (cough! - note the sarcasm) Paul W Anderson direct it, but he also had writing credits too. I definitely had low expectations for this one - but it was probably worse than I could ever imagine.There was no fear or dread in this movie. All the deaths were predictable - and you would have to have rocks in your brains to not work out who survives.I only hope that there aren't any more Alien and Predator sequels made! There is definitely a diminishing returns effect happening with both franchises. I can only hope Sigourney Weaver pushes anyone with ideas of making more sequels out of a space-ship with a fork lifter machine.Woeful stuff!",4,1,2,22 January 2005

Amadeus," Klassy period piece which ain't too snobbish...
","I first saw Amadeus when I was in high school in drama class.  I wasn't a big fan of classical music (still not!) - but I was definitely taken back with this movie.The movie focuses (for the most part) on Salieri - who desires musical greatness (with the help of god) and is maddened by the 'lack of effort' that fellow composer Mozart exerts while creating heavenly, divine music.This movie is just fantastic - even though I don't like classical music - this film doesn't isolate people like me...  It may be all flashy period-piece - but don't let that put you off - it ain't too snobbish...The deepening obsession with Salieri and the 'deteriorating' career and health of Mozart is very compelling.  The set designs / costumes and soundtrack are very memorable.  Also - the acting is top class.Watch it...!",Null,3,5,7 May 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Back on Track
","POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS Of course  this film follows right on the heels of the 2nd part.  It shows Marty going back to 1885 to try to save Doc Brown from being murdered in the wild-wild west.  So this time round  it is more of a Western style affair. Plus the story is much more focussed on Doc Brown (which was probably needed as Marty had been done to death in the first two parts).  Doc falls in love with a schoolteacher named Clara  hurrah!The series definitely gets back on track with this offering  with things for most people  drama, romance (which I think was lacking in the second part), action, comedy  Plus the scene with the train and the De-Lorain is quite thrilling  with the Doc trying to get Marty and himself to the future whilst trying to save his love. aawwwwhhh!Definitely  a must see for fans of the original (and the series)  8 out of 10",8,0,0,14 February 2003
Pi," Scary, highly original mathematic thriller
","Pi is a low budget, black and white, highly original thriller involving a mathematic genius Max who is almost about to crack the mathematical pattern behind the stock exchange.What begins as an intriguing, thought provoking film focusing on maths and patterns soon turns a scary nightmare roller coaster down to hell. The visual style associated with Darren Aronofsky pictures is evident - it adds immensely to the tension and fear in the film, as well to the thought provoking elements of it.  The various camera styles and set-ups add to the overall edgy, claustrophic mood of the film.Pi's electronica soundtrack fits the movie like a glove. The casting in the film (basically all unknowns) is great.  Sean Gullette is excellent as Max - a man who is on the brink of insanity.Pi is a highly original film (come on!! have you heard of a mathematic sci-fi thriller before?!!!) and a must see for all the culture vultures out there.",Null,0,1,30 January 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Heaps of an improvement from the first film
","RE-A basically picks up where the first one left off. Alice wakes up in the heart of Raccoon City, dazed and confused. The Umbrella Corporation have blocked off the city, in an attempt to cover up the T-Virus outbreak. Alice befriends Jill Valentine, a member of STARS (and a character from the RE playstation games) and a group of survivors and attempt to escape the city via the help of a mysterious stranger.I wasn't a big fan of the first RE movie - maybe it was a bit of a let down as I was a huge fan of the games.... so my expectations for the film sequel weren't exactly high. But I thought it was a vast improvement over the first. The horror emphasis has died down a little - but it is more of an attempt to make an action film in a horror context. Alice has even more superhuman powers than the first film and she takes on zombies and monsters in a 'Matrix' inspired combat style.I really enjoyed the ending of this film - just when you think the film is over - it has a few twists and turns right up to the end. Quite a satisfying ending (even if it leaves it open for a sequel).Recommended if you are looking for a film with a bit of style but not too heavy on substance.",7,1,2,13 January 2005
Saw II," OK masochist fun if that is your cup of tea
",Saw 2 revolves around a 'not-so-straight-and-narrow' cop who gets involved with the serial killer Jigsaw's latest game of horrible torture and death.Saw 2 tries to do things a little differently than the first film. Saw 2 has a house full of teens (or near teens) locked up in a spooky house where one by one - they meet an unfortunate death (a la traditional slasher film) but all done in the style of the 'Saw' franchises death traps.Although there are some nice plot twists (in the original Saw's style) - possibly the final twist (who the killer is) is a bit half-baked and unbelievable. The references however to the first film are quite ingenious (where the final scene takes place)...The acting (like the first Saw) can be a little half-baked too and some of the 'death traps' aren't so ingenious as the first (eg: instead of a reverse-facial-beartrap we get a spiky-mask...).Overall - OK masochistic fun if this is your cup of tea...6 out of 10,6,1,2,31 May 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," There is nuthin like this! (Possible Spoilers)
","From Dusk till Dawn - one part tense road movie thriller, one part b grade spatter feast - is truly an original film. It tells the story of a couple of brothers who are on the run from the law. They head for the Mexican border to rendezvous with some gangsters at a sleazy strip bar.  Along the way - they pick up a family and hold them hostage. This movie is just brilliant fun.  The first half - is a tense thriller (very much Tarantino) - it explores the tense and often uneasy relationships between the two brothers and their hostages.  Once they hit the bar (towards the middle of the film) - Rodriguez (the Director) and Tarantino release the pressure - by letting the group and the viewer take down their guard - in a alcohol and sex fuelled fiesta - Mexican style. Of course - the film takes a giant twist into a all out blood fest with vampires.....  what did you expect!?! This movie is just tops - with great, stylish directing and writing from the Rodriguez / Tarantino team - and great performances by the hard, sexy and super cool George Clooney and Harvey Keitel (as the preacher who gave up god). There are great side characters including the doorman Cheech Martin and the awesome Sex Machine (I only wish Sex Machine was in the film for longer!). The blood fest with the vampires is totally over the top - it would have been better if they had added some of the deleted scenes (as shown on the special edition DVD/laser disc) - they have to be seen to be believed. There is nuthin like this!.... so watch it now!",Null,0,1,12 July 2004
Saw," Better than average but not perfect thriller/horror
","Saw is one of those sort of movies where the less said about it the better.... but the whole plot surrounds two men who wake up chained in a dirty bathroom who soon discover they are playing a psychopath's game where the only way to escape is for one man to kill the other...Saw is a pretty interesting movie for the most part - with heaps of plot twists and 'killer' scenes - it delivers the requisite thrills and chills that a good horror/thriller movie should.Some of the scenes are just soo squirming disturbing - it should have the horror fans begging for more...But for all its pluses - I find that the acting in Saw is a little undercooked. Leigh Whannell, an ex-Australian TV presenter feels a little out of his depth in the more emotional scenes (not to mention that his accent seems to drop in and out of being Aussie) and Cary Elwes character seems to go from 'perfectly sane' to 'insanely mad' in about two seconds at the climax of the film. That moment (and you would know it if you have seen the movie) - just doesn't gel like it should...But despite it flaws - Saw is a pretty good movie (for those into gutwrenching horror stuff)...",7,0,1,12 May 2006
The Fly," Creepy gory 80s classic
","The Fly is an 80s gory classic - it tells the story of a scientist who is pushing the bounds of science whilst falling in love with a journalist (Geena Davis).  He accidentally tests out his invention whilst merging himself with the genetics of a household fly.  The fly hits the fan (so to speak) - and his body begins to change... The Fly is a great creepy film - which attempts to delve into genetic ethics while being a 'creature feature'.  It's makeup is truly disgusting - but that makes it all the much better to watch - doesn't it? Jeff Goldblum is perfectly cast as a nervous, socially awkward scientist - and his transformation into a 'super' creature is just great.  Geena Davis is also excellent as the love interest who gets caught up with all the events in the movie.  John Getz is also great - he makes this an 80's movie as the greedy, self-centred yuppie wanna-be Geena Davis boyfriend... Fun but with morals...",Null,1,2,12 July 2004
Downfall," Modern Classic
","Der Untergang (aka 'The Downfall' in Engrish) details the final days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.The Downfall is a bona fide modern classic - incredibly disturbing, scary, disorientating and emotional.The maturity and honesty in which it deals with its subject matter is outstanding.There are so many powerhouse performances including that of Hitler (Bruno Ganz) - who doesn't play it as a cheap villain 'stereotype' - rather Hitler is portrayed as a realistic, deeply flawed human being coming to terms with his inevitable fate and that of his country. There are also some powerful, disturbing glimpses into his genocidal nature.The scenes of Eva Braun dancing in a ballroom with the imminent Russian invasion happening outside has to be seen to be believed. It is like a disorientating cruise on the Titanic. The scenes of the SS leader's wife putting her children down were some of the most emotionally gutrenching scenes I've ever seen on the screen.Normally - I'm not a big fan of war movies - but this is a modern classic and has to be experienced.",10,1,4,28 April 2006
Army of Darkness," Taking more influence from Slapstick than Schlock
","Army of Darkness completes the Evil Dead (Sam Raimi) trilogy - where we find that Ash, the hero, has been transported back to the Dark Ages in England where he accidentally unleashes a huge 'Army of Darkness'. This movie is completely different (in my opinion) than the previous two - there is much more emphasis on slapstick than schlock (see The Evil Dead). More comedic - this film reminds me a lot of the Three Stooges sort of painful slapstick stuff. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is portrayed as a witty action flick movie star (it works!) where he is seen taking on the evil hordes whilst flicking off one-liners a la Arnie style. Even though the movie is only 80 plus minutes long - it tends to drag around two-thirds the way through.  But if you love action adventures (or the other two entries in the Evil Dead Series) you'll probably enjoy Army of Darkness.",Null,1,1,30 January 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Colorful, stylish adaptation
","Bram Stoker's Dracula was a return to the original Stoker's text (a move away from those cheesy Hammer Drac films).  It tells the story of Count Dracula and Mina (a incarnate of Dracula's former lover) and their undying love for each other. This is a visually striking and arresting film - the design, costume and makeup is unforgettable (who could forget Dracula's queer hairdo...?). My only problem with the film - is the casting of both Mina and Jonathon Harker with both Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves respectively - I thought they were cast because they were the 'then' hot young actors - but they both can't act their way out of a shoe box....  But Gary Oldman tries to 'somewhat break the typecast' by being the subject of desire (even though he is the bad guy...).",Null,1,1,2 July 2004
Jaws," Total total classic - the original blockbuster and definitely one of the best
","Jaws is one of the first mega Hollywood blockbusters - and definitely one of the best. It follows the Peter Benchley book of the same name - an obsessed police chief enlists the help of a marine scientist and a veteran fisherman to help track down and hunt a giant Great White Shark who has been terrorising the North-eastern US community of Amity Island. Spielberg - who knows how to shock and keep an audience at the edge of their seats with Duel - is certainly in his element here in Jaws.  He places the audience in an strange environment - underwater camera shots at swimmers who are blissfully unaware that they are about to become Shark dinner.  The excellent John Williams score also keeps up the tension. All the leads are well cast - Roy Scheider as the outsider Police Chief who is on the edge and Robert Shaw as the old, wry fisherman. Yes - the mechanical shark might look cheesy by today's standards - and yes - the film depicts the shark quite unfairly and inaccurately - But I was sucked into this film when I first saw at the age of 3.  Ever since seeing this (I'm sure I'm not alone here) - but I always felt like there is something waiting for me down at the beach.",Null,1,3,12 July 2004
Halloween," The original slasher!
",Halloween - the original slasher film (yes - before Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street). This basically has no budget and no plot for that matter.  The 'plot' focuses on a young Jamie Lee Curtis - the virgin babysitter who is stalked by an unknown masked boogie man (....Michael Myers). This is the original slasher film - not much plot - just a lot of set piece murder scenes shot in near darkness. Yes - this movie is very very tame compared to today's standards (in terms of gore and sex) but it is a classic - with many imitators and clones (and even spoofs!).  And you have to love the Halloween score - truly creepy.... Watch this with the lights off and the doors locked.,Null,0,1,12 July 2004
Back to the Future Part II," It's going weird now!
","POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS Back to the Future Part 2 tries in vein to be like its older brother  but unfortunately  it sort of fails to rekindle the magic of the first film.The film is set right after the end of the first film  the Doc takes Marty and his girlfriend to 2015 to help sort a `drama' with his future son (he gets arrested  oh no!).  But unfortunately  when they return to 1985  everything has changed for the worse.The movie is kind of fun in 2015  with subtle throwbacks to the first film (ie: the mayor, the milk bar/80's bar, skateboards/hover boards).  It makes fun of things like Ronald Regan and Jaws  but all of the actors do a rather unconvincing job ageing (and cross dressing!).The film from then on  gets a much darker, nastier feel  as they travel back to the 80's  where things are not as nice as it was.  Plus the plot gets rather confusing.The nice part about the second half of the film is the revisiting of the events in the first film (in 1955)  but it sort of just ends up being more confusing.  Plus the film ends on a strange, unresolved note  where nothing much is.resolved!It also shows a preview of the third film  as part 2 and 3 were shot back to back (Matrix / Lord of the Rings style baby!).  It was revealed on the DVD version that the director  Robert Zemeckis spent some time directing the third film while this movie was being finished and it shows!I'll give this film 6 out of 10  fun, but not in the same way of the original.",6,1,3,14 February 2003
Amélie," Wildly fantastic
","Amelie is a truly exceptional piece of French cinema.  The story (if that is what you can call it) centres on the introverted but imaginative Amelie - a young woman who loves to touch others in very subtle but strong ways.  Her whole world changes when she meets a young man called Nino - who is similarly 'quirky'.Amelie is like a huge, colourful picture book BUT for adults (as there is a lot of 'adult content' in this one).  The film - directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (who was responsible for Delicatessen) - is totally beautiful to watch, spellbinding and wildly fantastic.It is a fairly long movie (if this is the only criticism) and you do feel like b####-slapping Amelie towards the end of the film because of her fear of Nino and falling in love - but if you love world cinema - you need to see this movie.",Null,0,2,7 May 2004
Final Destination," Inventive  but goes off the rails a bit!
",PLOT SPOILERS ALERT!!! Final Destination was a mostly enjoyable journey  it tells the tale of a group of students who are thrown off a plane  because one of them has physic premonitions about the plane blowing up.  Of course the plane blows up  but mysteriously  one by one  the survivors begin to die in horrible circumstances.  They work out that they have averted `Death's plan' and Death is reworking their fates (to be even more horrible than the plane crash).The plot sounds a little unbelievable  but it's an inventive and fresh take on the slasher-teen movies.Even though the movie goes against the typical horror heroine  the hero  Alex has feminine qualities that make him feel quite vulnerable to the audience.  Kerr Smith does a great job to go against type to play the macho jock who mostly wants to beat the fudge out of Alex (Devon Sawa)  miles away from Dawson's Creek.The first couple of `death scenes' are truly horrific and violent  some of these are pretty much guaranteed to scare the bejesus out of most people.But the movie tends to go off the rails a bit (after the train scene  funnily enough!).  I think the writers had a `hard time' trying to come up with a way how to beat `Death' in the end.  However the penultimate scene where Devon Sawa and Ali Later battle `Death' at Ali's house is quite `electrifying' (no pun intended!).After watching the DVD extras (deleted scenes / interviews with `executives')  it documents the trouble the film makers had in making an audience satisfying ending.  POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS  the original ending had Alex dying to save his pregnant girlfriend  thus cheating Death.  But the test audience had a bad reaction to this  feeling a bit distant from it after the first half of the movie was so different.  They reworked the ending  so Alex survived and Kerr Smith ultimately dies.  This made it into a typical horror movie ending (you know  a final shock right before the end credits).  I had just felt that both possible endings to the film were a bit of a let down  after the terrifying early death scenes  it doesn't seem like it goes out with a big enough bang.Don't let my review put you off the movie though  go see it for an original take on the teen-horror genre.7 out of 10,7,0,0,14 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," What a finish!
","Return of the King was an excellent send-out of what should be one of the greatest movie trilogies ever!The story in this 'episode' largely focuses on Sam and Frodo's journey to reach Mount Doom in an attempt to destroy the 'One Ring'. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gandolf and co continue to battle Sauron's forces so that Frodo can complete his quest.After the mainly singularly focused (with a dash of horror) Fellowship of the Ring and its complicated follow-up, The Two Towers, with huge battle-scenes - The Return of the King, in my opinion, blends what was so good about the first two films and combines it into one climatic powerhouse finale.  Whereas Frodo's quest is more character driven with a horrible sense of dread, Aragorn and Co's are more about the huge battle sequences.All the acting / casting is just great - it gives the whole film a certain mature weight.  The SFX are incredible - I'm not a huge fan of CGI stuff - but the effects in this movie are getting fairly realistic (it doesn't look like 'cheap' CGI effects - hello Star Wars!).  The NZ scenery is spectacular as ever and I love the Aussie contingent in terms of acting.Although I thought the ending was incredibly soppy and probably could have been trimmed - I think that this episode takes the cake in terms of the Lord of the Ring trilogy.",9,0,1,22 July 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Fresh classy sexy vampire film
","Interview with the Vampire is a fresh, classy sexy vampire film which tells the story of Louis (Brad Pitt) as the underling to the vampire Lestat (played by an in form Tom Cruise).  Louis can't cope with the morals and ethics of being a vampire but succumbs to his urges and maims, then resurrects a small girl (a very young Kirsten Dunst) who becomes his love through centuries. Interview with the Vampire is a fresh take on the genre - with the three male leads - Pitt, Cruise and Banderas delivering a homoerotically charged performances and Dunst - playing the cunning but cursed Claudia - an everlasting child - unable to physically love Pitt. All in all - this is an unforgettable movie which you need to see.",Null,1,3,12 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Probably the best
","The Empire Strikes Back continues the Star Wars saga after the original Star Wars film. The Empire is hunting down the Rebellion and subsequently tracks them down on the icy planet Hoth. Luke and R2 split ways with Han and Leia (and Co.) - Luke travels to learn the ways of the Jedi, while Han and Leia hide out from the Empire in the Cloud City.Empire is arguably the greatest film out of the series. I love the character development (if they were cardboard-ey in the first film - they are 3 dimensional in this one). The epic battle on Hoth is sweet. The ending is a revelation.Definitely recommended.",Null,0,1,24 November 2004
True Romance," A Blast (even though it is a Hollywood-ised Tarantino film) - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!
","True Romance is the story of how Clarence (a comic book store employee, obsessed by Kung Fu and Elvis) and Alabama (a call girl) fall for each other, are chased by both gangsters and the police with a case full of cocaine.True Romance is an excellent film - a thrilling mix of love, gangsters and those Tarantino cult pop-culture references. There are so many stand-out performances - the lead couple (Christian Slater / Patricia Arquette), Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper (gotta love the Sicillian speech scene!), Brad Pitt (as the crazy stoner) and Gary Oldman (the wannabe black white pimp).True Romance feels like a Hollywood-ised version of a Quentin Tarantino film - written by Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun fame). Apparently - the ending was changed (to make it more happy) and the story was made linear (as opposed to a Tarantino-esquire non-linear story). If True Romance had a fault - it would be this. But this is a relatively minor problem - the strong cast and screenplay sees this movie through.Definitely recommended!",Null,1,3,19 November 2004
Contact," I agree with South Park on this one - SPOILERS WARNING!
",Contact focuses on Ellie (Jodie Foster) an astronomer who receives a message from outer-space.  She subsequently builds a machine from this message in order to make contact with the 'aliens'. This movie is just way tooo long and unengaging.  It attempts to analyse issues relating to Science vs Religion - but it only sugar coats the issues. I agree with the 'South Park' view on this film where Mr Garrison (after receiving a nose job surgery) vomits after his doctor mentions this film. He then remarks 'I had to sit through that whole movie to find out that her father was the alien!'....  So true! This movie overstays its welcome - and when it reaches the conclusion - it is unfulfilling and annoying. Yawn (or vomit - whatever the case may be)!,Null,1,3,31 January 2004
Back to the Future," Go Van Halen!
","Back to the Future is a great 80's movie.  It basically involves a teenager from 1985 going back in time to 1955  he hooks up with his parents and has to make them fall in love so the future is relatively unchanged.It's a film for all ages (puke!)  but it is!  Middle aged people can get their kicks out of it  as a nostalgic trip back in time whereas younger people can relate to Marty as being a fish out of water  in a time where he is unfamiliar with customs / culture.  Plus on revisiting the film recently  I picked up on the rather `incestuous' interplay with Marty (the teenager) and his mother  it puts a funny adult spin on things!Plus this movie has things in it for most people  it has rather exciting action sequences, it has bad 80's music (Hewy Lewis and the News alert!), it has romance, it has comedy, it has drama, it even has Michael J Fox!Go see it  9 out of 10.",9,1,2,14 February 2003
The Birds," Unsettling Apocalyptic Hitchcock - Totally Memorable
","The Birds - one of my favourite Hitchcock films - is based around a young socialite/prankster (Tippi Hedren) who sets her eyes on a sexy lawyer (Rod Taylor).  She follows him to Bodega Bay with a couple of caged 'Love-Birds' and is herself, followed by flocks of Birds. When I was young and watched this - I thought it was fairly cheesy - with non-convincing special effects - but good for a bit of a squeal. But recently watching it again, from an adult perspective - I found it quite apocalyptic and unsettling in the way it brings up ideas of environmental damage and man against beast.  The way Hitchcock devises tension in this film is quite memorable and fantastic. I love the warped 'Bird' soundtrack - which just adds to the surrealness of it all. Unforgettable - and also - watch out for a Hitchcock cameo at the start of the movie!",Null,1,2,2 July 2004
The Simpsons Movie," Axe the Simpsons already!
","The Simpsons used to be one of the most razor sharp satires on television... about 15 years ago. Unfortunately - just like a lot of shows that don't know when to call it quits - the Simpsons TV show has become a fairly patchy, predictable and somewhat juvenile comedy  devoid of any great wit.So I wasn't really holding out for much out of a Simpsons Movie  and sure enough  it was fairly patchy, silly and not all that razor sharp.The plot (if you could call it that) involves Homer setting off a chain of events that leads to the Environmental Protection Agency placing a dome over Springfield as it has become too polluted (or something)... Although there are some sort-of-funny sequences  the writers appear to be more interested in sight gags, cheap laughs and quirky references rather than biting satire and mature humour. All of the characters are complete stereotypes (which has made the Simpsons to be rather stale TV show after almost 20 years).Another thing about the Simpsons Movie  is that it just feels like an overlong TV episode  nothing has really improved or been enhanced to make it a 'big screen movie' (just some better animation). I don't think a joke at the beginning (where Homer says why pay for something that is for free on TV) doesn't help The Simpsons Movie become a big screen event. At least the South Park Movie was made into something special (eg: a musical whilst upping the crudeness of the jokes).Please please put this stale old family down...!",4,3,7,3 August 2007
