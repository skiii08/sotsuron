The Devil's Advocate," Behold! I send you out as sheep amongst the wolves!
","Ultimately it will be up to you which wins out in this film: Al Pacino's attempt to elevate it or Keanu Reeves' attempt to sink it. Pacino does a splendid job as Satan himself and is aided by the best writing in the movie. We are treated to Satan's own views on good and evil and it is fascinating. Reeves appears to be - as he did in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' - foregoing all of the complexities in acting and portraying a single feeling at a time. Angry Keanu! Sad Keanu! Confuuuused Keanu! It's frustrating to see Al Pacino attempting to play off of him and being forced to carry the scenes by himself.The overall writing is fairly standard with moments of brilliance. The supporting acting is pretty good, especially Charlize Theron. The cinematography and special effects work quite well.This is a good one to catch on HBO and even rent if you like Pacino.",5,3,7,6 August 2005
