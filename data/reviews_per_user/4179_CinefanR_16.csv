The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino shines!
","Stylish, well written and atmospheric, with a smart and humorous script, 'Devil's Advocate' delivers the right amount of suspense and eeriness. It's a real pleasure to watch it again and again. Charlize Theron strikes a few false notes here and there, and Keanu Reeves obviously isn't the best actor in the worldBut this is clearly Al Pacino's show. And he is magnificent, incredibly charming, funny... No words can describe this performance, it's definitely one of his best. He's stealing the show in such manner that his presence is felt even when he's off screen. Pacino's speeches in this movie are priceless - he's a force of nature alright.",10,2,2,30 April 2012
Scarface," Unintentionally hilarious
","This one is so bad, it's good. Great, actually. But I don't know what's funnier - the movie, or some people taking it seriously.First of all, there's the Cuban 'accent' issue. This may not be obvious to American viewers, but Al Pacino's accent is so terrible here that he looks like a cartoon, like a parody of his 'bad guy' persona. What's funny is that he thinks he's doing a great job. Even great actors, including Al Pacino, look ridiculous when they try unfamiliar accents (remember Richard Burton in 'Villain' or Pacino again in 'Revolution'). There's no way in hell that's a great performance, unless you're deaf. The script doesn't help either. Saying a thousand time 'f*king f*ck' is just ludicrous (no, it's not scary, shocking or compelling). Pacino's goofy mannerisms will make you laugh. It's intended to be over the top, yes, but that 'accent' undermines his acting. This is a masterpiece of the 'unintentionally funny' category, and for that reason only it is indeed enjoyable. Whoever wrote 'Scarface' must be pretty low on brain cells. All the characters, including Scarface himself, are so unsympathetic that you can hardly wait to see them all wiped out. But that's not the problem here. The problem is of course the bad acting, the dim-witted dialogues, the tiresome violence that turns comical after a while. The 'so 80's' soundtrack is a blast. Watch 'Scarface' for a good laugh.",10,2,5,19 April 2012
3:10 to Yuma," It works... as a comedy
","If you're in a mood for high camp, '3:10 to Yuma' is sheer entertainment. It never gets boring, thanks to its two leads, who are cheerfully chewing the scenery.Outrageous plot holes make for an endless source of humor, the unintentional type. Funny details like why Wade isn't handcuffed properly with his hands behind or how is it possible that his face looks intact after a severe beating, will keep you wondering what brand of entertainment this is.With a gunshot wound to the stomach, Fonda's character shouldn't even be alive, let alone travel and talk back. Dan gets to jump off roofs despite his handicap, the most dangerous mass murderer is allowed to sit next to Dan's children at the dinner table Not to mention something that all viewers must have wondered: why don't they just kill Wade? Why are they willing to risk their own lives to save a murderer from torture? 'You can't do that. It's immoral'. Wow, this is a masterpiece of the unintentionally hilarious. Are these people politically correct police officers transported with a time machine back in the Wild West? Such blatant disregard for plausibility makes you wonder about the filmmaker's intent.The conclusion is tragi-comical and mind-blowing, for sure. Characters are elusive and inconsistent; we never really know what's driving Wade, and why Dan is ultimately drawn to him. The perplexing punchline, dripping with 'moral ambiguity' had me laughing out loud. The soundtrack made it epic. I almost felt sorry for poor Charlie Prince.",10,0,2,12 July 2012
In Bruges," 'In Bruges' aims high and misses by a mile
","'In Bruges' is an ambitious, but ultimately failed attempt to deliver some sort of existential fable... The internal 'moral' conflicts of professional assassins weren't amusing in any way or intelligently presented. This subject matter would have any movie director walking on very thin ice. In order to pull it off, the director must display tact, the writer must provide smart dialogue and strong character development; and the actors should skate gracefully. None of those qualities are to be found here.The sickening violence, relentless verbal assault and cringe-inducing jokes (insults) are not only in very poor taste, but a pathetic display of mediocrity. Add some offensive 'moral' considerations (a dwarf's life is apparently less valuable than a child's life, among others) to the variety of cheap tricks to stir some 'controversy', and you've got a perfect exploitation flick. I realize the subject matter isn't exactly fairy-tale, but that aggressive vulgarity distracted from everything else. In what bizarro world does that make for 'brilliant writing'? 'In Bruges' is just one really bad (in a painful, unfunny way) film that desperately wants to be 'artsy'. It's supposed to be a darkly humorous and insightful take on the human condition, but instead it only disgusts. There's no wit, no finesse, no spark in this movie. Ralph Fiennes and Colin Farrell, two fine actors, are surprisingly ineffective here as a result of an atrocious script. The raving reviews are stupefying Too bad about Bruges, it's a city too beautiful to be associated with this pseudo-intellectual trash.",1,29,66,25 May 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," Dull, uninspired
","Lackluster, formulaic and unfunny look at the fashion world and its alleged 'shallowness', lack of ethics, etc.There's not one single line in this movie to remember, that's how mediocre the whole thing is. The plot, dialogues and lousy attempts at character development are all so poorly done, if it wasn't for the presence of Maryl Streep, it would have ended up in the endless pile of B-category trash. Tough but essentially 'golden heart' boss- check Smart but unattractive girl gets job in 'fish out of water' setting– check The girl's Cinderella-like transformation- check Average-Joe boyfriend gets dropped for career's sake- check Shallow, annoying characters (mainly women) used to illustrate the fashion business– check 'Moral' lesson at the end- check Is there any cliché I've missed? Extremely dull and devoid of humor, the portrayal of the powerful career woman is rather insulting, and so is the movie's lecture on ethics. A waste of time.",1,6,10,9 June 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," Spectacular, fascinating character study. The Legend lives on
","They don't make screens big enough for a movie like this. Hell, they don't make Actors like these anymore... Being born in the 80's, I must have seen 'Lawrence of Arabia' in my childhood but didn't understand what the fuss was all about (except for Peter O'Toole's beauty and intense radiance). I have reluctantly revisited it recently. It took me several viewings to fully appreciate it, and it's probably the greatest movie ever made. Much has been said about this film, and usually people who have something to criticize are getting into pissing contests over its historical accuracy. I couldn't care less about those 'controversies', they are missing the point. This is a fictionalized account, not a history lesson. I'm only interested in Peter O'Toole's Lawrence and the way this particular story is told. Historically accurate or not, I don't care. Not only 'Lawrence of Arabia' hasn't aged one day, but it's light years ahead of recent productions. Cinematic perfection is what it is, and it's a miracle. There must have been a rare star alignment 50 years ago, that made everything click so perfectly - cast, acting, script, music, editing, scenery, costumes, all within a remarkable direction. Every scene is an invaluable lesson of filmmaking, a demonstration of superlative acting. What strikes me is that sensitive issues like sexual identity and violence are beautifully explored with a subtlety, intelligence and elegance that are no longer to be found in film today. I'm afraid to imagine how the 'Deraa sequence' would be depicted these days. Filmmakers today just lack the talent and sensitivity to make it compelling without resorting to obscenity and gore for cheap shock value. Peter O'Toole is splendid, sophisticated,larger-than-life, and leaves you breathless with every movement. You will notice the subtle touches of his performance, the nuances of his ambiguous identity, constantly shifting. The portrayal of Lawrence is somewhat inconsistent, inexplicit, and he remains a fascinating puzzle, which is both frustrating and also the key to the movie's overall success. You will be blown away by the power of Lean's imagery and his ability to define a character so precisely and memorably through purely visual means. There's no CGI, so everything looks and feels real. But it feels real mostly because we see the alien Arab world through Lawrence's eyes. It's amazing how introspective, how personal such a grand-scale epic can be. So who is O'Toole's Lawrence? What is it that drives him to do what he does? I still don't know, but with each viewing there's something new to discover. I believe that David Lean's respect for the mystery, for the ineffable of human personality is something to be admired. But it's more than respect, it's Lean's intelligence that prevents him from 'explaining' Lawrence. That's why people are still crazy about this movie 50 years later.",10,1,3,14 March 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," Great performances
","Al Pacino gives life to a character that otherwise would be totally unsympathetic. As to his partner, Sal,it's interesting how Cazale managed to create such a blend of vulnerability, sadness and innocence into a 'ticking bomb' bank robber with a criminal record. Leon is another memorable character, played to perfection by Chris Sarandon. The mother, along with the wife, gives a better understanding of the circumstances in which Sonny snapped. Anyone would go nuts with those two women around. The only intelligent character in this movie is Lance Henriksen's, another amazing, under-rated actor. He has a small part here, but it's a pivotal role. Sharp, slick, precise. His eyes speak volumes. The critique of the media is sharp and darkly funny. All the actors are doing a great job, and the spirit of the era is well captured.",10,1,2,20 April 2012
Donnie Brasco," Excellent character-driven story
","For people who don't like 'gangster movies', like myself, there are at least 3 reasons to watch 'Donnie Brasco'. It doesn't glamorize violence, unlike other movies of the genre. On the contrary, it deromanticizes the whole 'Godfather' perspective. Although it has two disturbing scenes, those are relevant to the characters' development. It's 'back to the real world' time, where there's nothing 'mythical' anymore about being a mobster.The superlative acting and great script. Al Pacino is amazing, and Depp is a great; the chemistry these two actors have here is exquisite. If they are multidimensional characters, it's also because of a good script and smart direction. Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are also very good in supporting roles.It's a psychological, character-driven story, that goes beyond conventional 'good guys-bad guys'. 'Donnie Brasco' is too sophisticated to make the usual point that cops and criminals are equally monstrous. There is a gruesome scene, where viewers get a sudden, shocking reminder, that these mobsters (including Pacino) are indeed, without any doubt, the bad guys. There is however an important common trait, made crystal-clear by director Mike Newell, between the police and the mafia.In conclusion, this is the best gangster-movie so far (Sorry, but I find 'The Godfather', 'Casino' and the likes to be unwatchable crap).",10,0,0,18 May 2012
The Insider," Heroes come in short supply...
","Despite a not-so-dramatic subject matter and its considerable length, the movie keeps your attention all the way, thanks to Russell Crowe's particularly touching performance. He has a surprising depth and sensitivity that makes his role a memorable one. Al Pacino toned down his usually flamboyant acting style into a more quiet, but convincing performance. Their crusade is fascinating to watch, and you'll find yourself totally engaged in the story. Complex issues are being explored, and the moral dilemma that characters are facing in their professional and personal lives makes this movie an excellent, spot-on portrayal of media business and corporate politics. The movie is simply very well acted and directed, and the music is outstanding. 'The Insider' is like a breath of fresh air.",10,2,3,5 May 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Fascinating
","The movie is very well done -'epic' doesn't begin to describe it. '2001' conveys a sense of wonder and mystery that keeps your attention even if, most of the time, not much happens and the pace is very slow. The grandeur of space and human civilization will always be associated with that famous 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', and you know from the opening sequence that this will be something different from your usual sci-fi flick. Visually stunning, '2001' is surprisingly fresh and doesn't look dated at all. Only women's haircuts and some outfits are reminiscent of the late 60's, a detail of no relevance. Special effects and the overall realism of space travel are outstanding even by today standards. At times hypnotic, atmospheric and vaguely sinister, the movie is also pretty cryptic, which can be frustrating I suppose, especially if you're unprepared. I personally found it intriguing – I guess it depends on personal taste and timing. The astronaut David Bowman and the others are not well defined, so don't expect any character development. A sense of depersonalization throughout the entire movie and a deliberate lack of emotion are meant to make a statement about that particular stage of evolution. Many philosophical issues arise and you'll be screaming for more information about what's going on in the mind of Hal or Bowman. The novel will provide you with all these important details- to complete the experience, you must read the book. The ending raises a lot of questions that are left unanswered, as in open for interpretation. The final minutes are splendidly surreal and the images will stay with you for a long time. The movie is a perfect complement to the novel, just as good – they are both masterpieces in their own right.",10,1,3,6 February 2012
Drag Me to Hell," Idiotic and disgusting attempt at horror comedy
","It seems I have to write 10 lines about this piece of garbage that some folks call cinema. Well, let's see what it contains. A despicable killing of a baby pet. Totally unfunny scene, at least to humans. Many, countless, vomiting scenes. I admit there is a sense of humor (sick in a puerile way) somewhere in there, but it's so shockingly disgusting that you might end up throwing up yourself. There is a lot, and I mean a lot of puke here, including a corpse vomiting in someone's mouth. Lovely, isn't it, and hilarious. An old lady who puts a curse on the main character and gets pushed around all over the place. Yes, she was a nasty witch, but getting old people kicked around is in very poor taste. The parking lot scene is mind-blowing, you don't know whether to laugh or cringe. In conclusion, this is a moronic attempt at comedy horror and a waste of time. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, no redeeming value whatsoever in this lame excuse for a movie. The whole jumping out at you for a scare is cheap and never leaves an impression. Try Alfred Hitchcock for a change, you might actually learn something about the real deal. Yes, the comparison is outrageous.",1,1,3,27 July 2012
The Happening," Good premise, poor execution
","The premise is good, but idiotic dialogues and stereotypical characters usually don't help. The movie contains some of the worst lines and performances ever. Mark Whalberg aka the 'science teacher' is terribly insipid and that stupid wife of his is just obnoxious to the point that I wanted her to suffer a painful death. The acting is abysmal What's more to say? The message is spelled out like to a 5 year old, just in case you didn't catch it the first time. Yeah, we got it. Nature – good, people- destructive. We get it.The underlying 'love story' is uninteresting, distracting and clichéd. Did I mention 'annoying'? The ending is unsatisfying and there are inconsistencies throughout the movie. The creepy old woman was the only memorable character.",2,0,1,1 March 2012
The Deer Hunter," Very impressive
","'The Deer Hunter' is a gut-wrenching story about friendship and war. I caught it accidentally one night on TV, it was late and I didn't even know what movie I was watching. It left me speechless. Only a few actors could match the emotionally devastating performance of Christopher Walken and John Savage in 'The Deer Hunter'.I hope the ending is an ironic commentary meant to suggest that even after all this tragedy, these characters still fail to understand that patriotism is just a notion that governments use in order to manipulate masses. To politicians, soldiers will always be nothing more than statistics and a good topic for a speech. The absurdity of war and its inherence couldn't have been better suggested.",10,0,2,11 May 2012
Heat," So much for realism (and logic)...
","I remember seeing this in my childhood and being extremely impressed with it. Some scenes have stayed with me all this time. However, revisiting 'Heat' 17 years later was a disappointment. The story looks far fetched and riddled with clichés and improbabilities.The main problem is with the selling point, which is of course the 'Al Pacino- De Niro relationship'. Here's the problem: no cop who does this job out of conviction could possibly respect/admire a criminal, especially one who has killed other police officers. So the ending is absurd and downright ludicrous. The famous coffee-shop scene that Pacino and De Niro share is ridiculous and pointless, entirely made for us, the viewers. At the public request, we present you Pacino and De Niro, face to face! The clash of the titans! Not only there is no way in hell that a committed policeman would casually sit and chat with a criminal over coffee, but what they have to say is so silly – sharing thoughts about their messed-up private lives? Pacino trying to talk De Niro out of the bank robbery business? Seriously? Such a lame excuse to deliver the much anticipated De Niro- Pacino 'moment'... The writing is terrible in this scene, as De Niro is also restating something he'd said earlier, therefore diminishing the impact of that line. Another example of bad writing and poor characterization is a scene where Jon Voight warns De Niro about Pacino's tenacity.The constant shift to everybody's private lives was annoying and turned the whole thing into a crime-opera cheesefest. How many times have we seen the 'frustrated cop's wife' act? And who cares about the bank robber's problems with his beloved wife, whom he occasionally cheats on? Oh, yeah, bank robbers are capable of love too. Touching! Talking about unlikelihood, De Niro's 'romance' was laughable, and so was the transformation of an innocent librarian into an accessory to murder. The way Amy Brenneman switches from horror at what De Niro did to the 'Oh, well, he's cute anyway' is hysterical. Moral relativism is an interesting topic for sure, but not here. There are moments that we're supposed to find moving, like the miscast Ashley Judd shedding a tear on the balcony or the cop hero Pacino holding hands with a criminal... What a joke.The movie does contain some entertaining moments (although highly improbable), like the robbery scene. There's no way the Police would get into a shootout like that with so many civilians around. The suicide attempt scene is unnecessary and forced, and there are other flaws and extremely far-fetched/illogical scenes throughout, like DeNiro & the gang gracefully passing through police check-points without even wearing a disguise, just hours after the bloody robbery.'Heat' is fairly entertaining only if you can ignore its inconsistencies and plot holes. The more I watch, the more I find it insulting to one's intelligence. I know it's 'just a movie', but come on... it's a 3-hour movie, and such an amount of implausible developments make suspension of disbelief pretty hard. I swear, if Pacino had shed a tear in the end, I would have rated 'Heat' with 10 stars and put it on my all time favorite 'so bad they're good' list.",5,84,150,8 May 2012
Gladiator," CGI Overkill
","First of all, the CGI is terrible and mostly gratuitous. I don't see why the director couldn't shoot some REAL natural landscapes for Crowe's psychedelic flashbacks. As for Rome, it was all obviously fake, computer generated crap. Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations. Watch Lawrence of Arabia' for example and you'll feel the difference. What a sad irony that a film made 40 years prior to Gadiator' gives class to contemporary cinema...Secondly, the action was excessively violent. I won't even discuss the historical accuracy. The only bright spots are Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, both over-the-top in a pretty entertaining way. Russell's presence is overwhelming thanks to a spectacular physique and charisma... but not even his amazing acting skills can't save this movie. The music by Lisa Gerrard wasn't necessarily bad, but redundant when applied to (over)emotional scenes. That's the way to manipulate crowds: play the violins and let the blood/tears flood the screens. By the way, Gerrard's music was infinitely better and more properly used in 'The Insider'.",6,2,6,2 July 2012
The Godfather," Massively overrated
","I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called 'legendary' Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics But the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole 'family' tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to 'care' about these characters, to think that they are 'cool'. The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a 'hallmark' of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and 'culturally relevant'. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch 'Donnie Brasco' instead.",1,49,138,30 April 2012
