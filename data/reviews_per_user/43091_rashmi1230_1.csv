Airlift," A must watch and a great Republic Day Treat
","In an epoch of clich√©d film-making, 'AIRLIFT' is a tight slap to all those commercial movies without content and originality.Films like 'Talvar' and 'Airlift' shows that the Bollywood is witnessing an evolution and is clearly at par with the Hollywood.Personally I think 'Airlift' is India's answer to the Oscar Winner, Ben Affleck starer 'Argo'.Though the film is without an antagonist, its gripping and jaw dropping story line leaves you at the edge of your seat.Though the characters are fictitious the movie gives a clear cut pictures of the agony of the stranded Indian in Kuwait at the time of Iraqi Invasion and the efforts carried out by a set of Indian Kuwaiti and Govt. of India Officials to engender the BIGGEST EVER rescue operation in the history of world.The film is well executed in all aspects. Well done Raja Menon. Thanks a lot for making such a fabulous movie. Akshay Kumar is just amazing as Ranjit Katyal..He just nailed the role..The film will definitely make you feel proud as an Indian.You will leave the theater with a feeling of patriotism.I recommend you that this film is a'MUST WATCH' . BRAVO!!!Team 'Airlift'",9,3,5,23 January 2016
