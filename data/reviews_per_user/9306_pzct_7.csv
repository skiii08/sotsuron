It," Creative, Suspenseful, Creepy, and A wonderful Remake!
","I decided to rewatch this movie for a nice refresher. And once again, when I researched thid movie, I fell in love with the kid cast, loved the creative, yet creepy CGI such as the painting monster or the Slideshow scene, the ending scene, and everything! This movie is an amazing remake that had such talent put in into it. I love my boy, Richie",9,0,1,26 April 2020
John Wick," DON'T MESS WITH JOHN WICK!
","Don't mess with John Wick. This guy is someone you shouldn't make angry. In this movie, John Wick's Dog was killed by Alfie. His dog was the only thing left to him by his wife who died. It was the only thing that brought him light. But when Alfie killed it, John Wick went god mode. This movie is full of action and BADASS scenes!",8,1,3,12 May 2020

Rio," Lovely
","Watching this movie
I felt like the points connected together. There are tense moments, amazing bad guy, lovable background/side characters, along with a good ending that made me all cheery. So I will give this movie the 9.0 rating. Or at least ranging from 8.5 to 9",9,0,0,24 April 2020
Joker," An Amazing Masterpiece
","I like how the movie tries it's best to make the backstory of Joker perfect.They have Joaquin Phonix, who plays an amazing joker. So the movie had elements that made me fall in love, for starters, Joker had a laughing condition where he would sometimes burst out laughing out of nowhere. I liked how he soon lose his mind and take a stand against society. What surprised me is that Young Bruce Wayne. Joker met him. And when the riots happened, it shows Bruce's parents getting killed, which would lead him to become Batman. All in all, this movie is slow but amazing!",8,0,4,24 April 2020
