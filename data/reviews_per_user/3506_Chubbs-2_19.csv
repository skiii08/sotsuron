The Blair Witch Project," Scarry? (Spoilers)
","I was so geared up for this movie, i was expecting to be scarred senseless, but instead I had the worst movie going experience ever.Now I understand the Movie was made on a shoe string budget, but it was completely without any shocks or scares at all.I am not a Horror fanatic so a reasonable scare will scare me, but this had nothing, I've been more scared watching the Simpsons Halloween special, or even worse Show Girls.The acting was convincing but the movie was not at all scarry, and the ending, with that m***n standing in the corner and then nothin, I was left robbed and wanting closure on this ordeal which I did not get.Overall, I would place this in the Comedy section of a video store, because there more more laughs than scares.Pitifully bad and misleading.",Null,1,1,6 November 1999
Scarface," Pacino Is The Man.
","Oh My God, this is one of the greatest movies ever. Pacino is the king he brought Tony Montana to life he gave him the edge, the classic characteristics, and who could forget that famous accent.
This is the story of Tony Montana, the political prisoner form Cuba who was sent to America, and in time became one of the most powerful drug lords in the country. This is DePalma's, finest effort, and definately Oliver Stones finest writing effort.Depalma's vision of the drug lord Montana, is flawless, this movie was ahead of it's time, it ranks up there with such classics as the Godfather and Goodfellas.Absolute Perfection, Highly Recommended.",Null,0,0,1 September 1999
Se7en," WOW Wonderfully Chilling
","This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. I was disappointed when this film was first released at the movies, because I was too young to go watch it, I would have enjoyed the movie going experience for Se7en.
But when I watched the movie for the first time, i was glued to the television screen, it was around 2 in the morning and i had the surround sound speakers doing their job, and for the next two hours i was enthrawlled in this deeply disturbing movie about a maticulous serial killer who patterned his murders according to the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Sloth, Pride, Greed, Envy, Wrath and Lust.The two detectives played flawlessly by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are dragged into the sick mind of the killer as murder upon murder piles up each posing their own little riddles for the pair to solve.
This movie, which was director David Fincher's first and writer Andrew Kevin Walkers finest is a thrilling ride which keeps you guessing all the way until the thrilling climax which will throw everyone for a loop.Truly one of the greatest thrillers ever, I have watched it multiple times, and you know what I think i'll go watch it again.",8,0,0,14 August 1999
The Big Lebowski," Shut the F%#! up Donnie
","The Cohen Brothers are the kings of Dark comedies. Other movies such as Fargo, Hudsucker Proxy and Milller's Crossing are classics.
Big Lebowski, is a story of mistaken identity and the spiral of bad fortune which trancends for 'The Dude'. From a pyschotic veitnam vet, to a guy who thinks he's bowling's answer too Jesus, this movie is hilarious.John Goodman, gives of of his bet performances ever, and in my opinion was over looked for a supporting actor oscar.This movie has all the regular Cohen Brother actors, Steve Buscimi, John Turturro and John Goodman who frequent the Cohen Brothers projects.You will love this movie, twists and turns and laugh out loud comedy.......Fantastic.",Null,0,0,10 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Started Great, But Slowed Down
","Now I love South Park, Trey Parker & Matt Stone are geniuses, and Cartman is a Legend. This movie started great, I was crying in my seat from how hard i was laughing, total disregard for conservity, i loved it.But it began to slow down, it seemed to drag on, and there wasn't enough attention given to Cartman, I mean he is the star let's not go kidding ourselves. I found some of the things mentioned and done to be shocking, but hey I loved it, I admire that kind of rock the boat mentallity.One other thing, was that there was much too much singing, I cringed when I felt another song coming up, i was like, 'Oh no not another one'.
But overall is was very enjoyable. I've seen it 5 times and i keep laughing all the time. One more thing, everyone at the MPAA, should get a life and leave the creators of these wonderful characters alone.",Null,0,0,29 August 1999
The Bodyguard," A Great Romantic Thriller
","I just recently watched The Bodyguard again and i forgot how good it was.Costner plays the role of the obsessed bodyguard perfectly and Houston's first feature film performance was flawless.This story of an obsessed stalker terrorising a famous performer and the bodyguard trying to protect her at all costs, was made in a refreshing way, even to compete with todays movie standardsMick Jackson's The Bodyguard is a great movie to watch over and over again even when you find out whodunnit .",Null,47,70,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force Is Strong In This Flick
","Now I'm not going to sit here sprout about the inner workings of this movie or how its far far far more superior to Episode I.All I shall say is THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!From the opening scene all the way through to one of the greatest battle scenes in film history.STAR WARS Fans will love it, as will movie fans. Do your shelf a favor and do what ever needs to be done to see this movie now! Call in sick, ditch school, dodge jury duty, postpone the wedding, just get out there and see this movie, you will not be disappointedSnoogans",Null,0,0,15 May 2002
American Pie," I Laughed Out Of My Seat
","Not since 'There's Something About Mary' have I laughed so hysterically in a movie theatre. This teenage comedy about a group of four senior high school students trying to lose their virginity is the funniest thing ever.From maximising the wonders of the internet, to a cup of beer that has a strange distinctive taste, this movie will have you in stitches.This new method of gross out humour, has become very successful in recent years. Started off by the Farrely brothers, it has branched out and as this movie shows, has become very entertaining.Now, there are some people out there that may be offended with this movie, they may turn their heads and become disgusted with it...........but hey, who cares about those uptight repressed morons. This movie is FANTASTIC, I loved it I'm gonna watch it again, a laugh again, and again and again.GO SEE IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT, IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,3,5,17 September 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," If Neo Asks Why, One more God Dam Time!
","Spoiler AlertI was so excited to watch this movie, I thought the original Matrix, was original and clever, the second was a splendor for the senses taking us to places never seen in cinema, But the 3rd installment was absolute crap!Firstly if the movie is called The Matrix shouldn't it atleast take place in the dam Matrix? I mean we dont get a sense of the Matrix until the climax when Neo Takes on Agent Smith (Played perfectly yet again by Hugo Weaving) The epic battle between Jesus and Satan.....oh sorry, Neo and Smith ;) was the last redemming facet of the movie that gave us a glimpse of why we loved the Matrix so much, Great fighting, amazing SPFX and Mind blowing score, but we had to wait 2 hours for it to happen!This is merely a run of the mill sci fi action, not worthy of the Matrix name, very bland, boring and silly, people in the theater were actually laughing when Trinity died, talk about not catching the moment.Anyway, Joel Silver should stop pulling himself and us by saying this is the future of Movie Making cause if it is, man we're in trouble1 3/10",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
Spider-Man," With great performances comes great movie!
","Toby Mcguire?.......who would have thought it, who would have thought that this kind of known actor would pull off a picture perfect Spider-Man performance, the comic nature, and dark side all rolled into this great Spidey package. He was great as was the rest of the cast, Willem Defoe in particular, the obvious choice for the Green Goblin, how ever they should have used make-up on his face instead of a mask, Defoe has great, and unique facial expressions.Sam Raimi, the meistro of the camera, did a great job in making this live action comic book, staying true to the original comic series, at the same time modernising it to todays audiences, this is how Spider-Man was always meant to be experienced.The web-slinging action sequences were amazing, incorporating incredabily radical camera manouvers with a fast flowing action feel to it.
As comic adaptations go this is one of the better ones, far out-doing others such as X-men, Blade and Spawn. Batman still though remains as the Top Comic book adaption, Tim Burton's vision of the Dark and Disturbed figure known as Batman was spot on the money.So if you're one of the few who hasn't seen this movie, get up go to the movies grab some popcorn and a soda and sit back and enjoy this fun thrill ride, this sometimes emotional often times action packed flick will leave you wanting more.Cya Snoogans.",Null,0,0,5 June 2002
The Usual Suspects," What An Ending
","Who is it ? Who dunnit ? Who could it be ? , these are questions that you will asking your self non stop for the entire movie. If you can figure it out before the ending, well you should be working for the CIA or something.This is a movie that has to be seen at least twice to be fully appreciated, the first time for enjoyment and the second to fully understand what was going on. Perfectly directed and the writing was flawless. A cast that anyone would kill, the performances are something to behold.One of the best crime stories ever. Take my word for it.",7,0,1,29 August 1999
8 Mile," The movie's Good, but Eminem is Great!
","Alot of Rappers want to jump into the movie scene with tragic results namely Master P, Ja Rule and DMX, the exception however is Marshall Mathers III.
Eminem picked the perfect project to showcase his 'acting chops' as they say and what a set of chops they are. We'll forget about his 'actual' theatrical debut in 'The Wash' and focus more on this Curtis Hanson Hip Hop Urban Fable.Eminem plays Rabbit a white kid from a trailor park who has dreams of getting a rap record deal, he goes through many trials and tribulations in his life and struggles for eveything he has.All in all Eminem gives an outstanding performance and commands the screen, he has a pressence that just holds and draws in the veiwer.A very entertaining and engrossing story with a riveting performance, I've heard of Oscar rumours for Eminem but I seriously doubt it though, maybe if the Academy had a catagory for Best New Actor, but since they dont, we may have to see if Em has has what it takes in the future to score one of those elusive statuettes.",Null,0,0,16 January 2003
The Mummy Returns," Much Better Than The First
","Wow......That was a great movie, best film on the big screen ive seen for a while.People we're cheering, laughing and were on the edge of their seat. A great rush for movie goers, and make sure you see this one with a theatre with great sound, trust me it'll be worth it.Cya",Null,0,0,24 May 2001
Titanic," It's Good, But Come On Everyone Went Overboard.
","Now, this movie made over 1 Billion dollars, and I'm happy to say that not a single one of those dollars were mine. I have seen it, but I saw it at a company preview, and I work at a video store, so free videos. Now, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but the hype that went on over it and the out pour of praise for Leonardo DiCaprio, from fans that came out of the wood work, who really didn't appreciate Leo's previous and better work, such as This Boy's Life and The Basketball Diaries, now they were good movies.Everyone was urged to see this movie, it was almost uncool not to have seen. If someone had asked you if you had seen it and you answered no, they thought you were crazy. Well I decided to make a stand against it. This movie was pure Hollywood, no real story, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen with the love story, and I can't believe it made so much money, I mean everyone knew the ending............It sank.If you are to watch it, make sure you watch an original copy with surround sound, or better yet see it on DVD. Now I don't mean to sound harsh, but come on, it wasn't that good to warrant a billion dollars.",6,3,5,1 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Lucas Directed Episode (Possible Spoilers)
","Up until now it has been easy, and some might say even hip to criticise the Star Wars prequels. Great expectations garner harsh reviews usually, but in the case of Revenge of the Sith, all expectations are well founded.Lucas has come out and delivered a knock out blow with his final instalment of the galactic saga. From the opening scene we have to strap ourselves for a great ride. Anakin is all grown up and R2-D2 pulls out some tricks and cements his place as the true hero of the series! The story is engrossing, and revelations are realised as the movie takes you through Anakin's descent into the dark side at the hands of the amazingly evil Lord Sideous.Light Sabre fans will be bouncing up and down with excitement as they watch the elaborate duels transpire on screen, especially when Obi Wan takes on a 4 light Sabre wielding General Grievous (figure that one out) The special effects are amazing, every intracity detail is covered and you can see that this was a labour of love for Lucus who has dedicated almost 30 years of his life to the telling of this story.Fans of Star Wars definitely won't be disappointed. and all the doubters will be pleasantly surprised with this final chapter. Go see it, go love it and not to sound to much like a geek.......May the force be with you.",9,1,4,18 May 2005
The Sixth Sense," Supurb Film Making
","Wow, this was a great movie. A great story with great performances and an ending that will blow your mind.There have been some great endings in movie history, including Usual Suspects, Primal Fear, Seven and Shawshank Redemption, and now you can add Sixth Sense.Surprisingly a champion at the Box Office, this movie has capyured the imagination of movie goers all around the world. And it's great to see that you don't have to have massive special effects or an enormous budget to produce a trully great movie.Bruce Willis gives a strong performance, but Haley Joel Osment gives an incredable performance as the haunted child, his performance will no doubt garner him an Oscar Nomination. Overall, fantastic. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,6 November 1999
Casino," DeNiro, Scorsese, Pesci and Stone. How Can You Go Wrong ?
","The name DeNiro alone automatically guarantees the movie to be a classic, add the name Scorsese and well, you have instant gold on screen.The most recent teaming of the masters of film has produced a very entertaining and thought provoking story of life in Las Vegas when it was at the mercy of the mob.DeNiro turns in a flawless performance as Sam Rothstein, a professional gambler who was like a cash register, he was put in charge of a large CASINO bye the mob. His performance as a perfectionist gambler who tries to run a casino and make an honest woman of his wife (played perfectly by Sharon Stone), was worthy of an Oscar (As has every other performance he has done).Pesci once again joins his Italian friends DeNiro and Scorsese to turn in a performance as a psychotic maniac who has an obsession with inflicting pain. The genius of Pesci is that he can play a clumsy funny annoying character, such as Leo Getz (Lethal Weapon 2 3 and 4) and then flip the script and play a truly scary maniac such as Nicki in Casino.The next time DeNiro and Scorsese work together will once again undoubtably be another movie great.Truly a great movie, not to be mistaken as another Goodfellas, but to have it's own place upon the mountain of movie masterpieces.",Null,1,1,4 August 1999
Heat," 2 of the greatest actors on the planet, how can you go wrong
","When Heat was first in production i heard the names DeNiro and Pacino, and that's all i needed, even if they were sitting on a couch and staring back at me i'd still watch.This movie not disapoint, a complex story about crime and passion and how obsession controls all. Pacino plays the obsessed detective trying to catch the cunning master thief DeNiro, who unseemingly can do no wrong.Director Michael Mann, has written and directed a master piece of human drama, which in my opinion should have garned multiple Oscar nominations.DeNiro and Pacino's first screen partnership was flawless and the meeting between the two, half way through the movie sends chills down the spine.Heat will forever be classified as one of the greatest movies ever made, the characters are pure and the action and drama is unparralel.Hopefully, we will get a chance to witness these masters opposite one another once again, we can only dream.",Null,0,0,24 July 1999
The Godfather," Flawless filmmaking, an absolute definitive classic
","Citizen Kane ? please, it doesn't even compare to The Godfather. Wrongfully placed 3rd on the all time greatest list of movies, The Godfather is perfection personified. In today's high tech and fast paced times, there will never be a movie with such depth, and meaning as the Godfather. Some say it's a story about crime, but in actuality it's a story on loyalty and betrayal in a family. About how generations evolve, and particularly about the metamorphosis of Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone, turned for a straight war hero, to the ruthless leader of the Corleone Family. Coppolla's vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless. I think those critics must reconsider the final verdict and place The Godfather in it's rightful place, at the top of the movie mountain.",10,0,1,21 May 1999
