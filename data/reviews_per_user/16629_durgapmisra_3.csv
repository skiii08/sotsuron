Skyfall," Retro-tainment!!
","My first viewing of Skyfall left me a little frustrated at the slow pace in the first half. However the story did catch speed in the second, and by the end i felt it was overall slightly better than Casino Royale. On reflection , however, there was a lot to appreciate from this Bond movie. An ageing James Bond , with his powers in apparently terminal decline, refuses to give up against all the odds, even against a fitter, though older , villain.A lot of the action is without any fancy gadgets . Similarly, M's unwavering belief in Bond's ability to do his bit when the time of reckoning comes is commendable. The reference to Lord Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses was heart touching, and remains my favourite scene from the movie. The movie showcases Bond as a human being first and a secret agent next, and shows a human side of him which many thought never existed. The movie has a lot apart from just action sequences ( which are aplenty , mind you) and that makes me feel in retrospect that this is the best Bond movie I have seen in my lifetime (have only seen them in the last decade).",10,18,32,14 November 2012
Interstellar," Interstellar- a love story across space and time
","Interstellar Review(SPOILER ALERT):Christopher Nolan's latest endeavor reaches out into the farthest corners of space, quite unlike Inception where he plummeted the depths of the human mind. The premise is the oft quoted disaster scenario; only this time it appears to be much more realistic with food running out for earth's 6 billion inhabitants and mankind seemingly destined to suffocate as the oxygen content of the atmosphere starts to dwindle. However there is a distant hope for salvation- a wormhole has been placed in the vicinity of Saturn (cue 2001: A Space Odyssey) seemingly by some 'higher beings' which may provide an escape route for mankind to reach out to potentially habitable worlds. Only if we can overcome Murphy's law (whatever can happen, will happen, including whatever bad can happen). Steps in Matthew McCounaughey (Cooper) to head an expedition of 4 travellers {Dr Amelia Brand(Hathaway-who leaves behind her ageing father, Professor Brand AKA Michael Caine), Romilly(Gyasi) and Doyle(Bentley)}, accompanied by 2 magnificent robots, TARS and CASE (although constructed in the spirit of HAL, these two AI are quite the extreme opposite of HAL in every sense). Cooper's sacrifice is leaving behind his two young children{Tom(child â€“Timothy Chalamet, adult-Casey Affleck) and Murph(child-Mackenzie Foy, adult-Jessica Chastain)}, not knowing if he will ever make it back to them again. Crossing the wormhole leads our explorers into a system orbiting a black hole (The Gargantuan), with three potentially habitable planets named after the brave explorers who made a near-definite one-way trip to these worlds. The movie is a fantastic sequence of interstellar adventures, but does not need any 'Aliens' to spoil the show (does mankind really need an external influence to destroy it, when we are experts at self destruction?). Not wanting to spoil the rest of the movie, it suffices to say that the final act of the movie is a dizzying sequence combining human bravado, survival instincts and love into a heady mix that takes time and possibly repeated viewing to really absorb the meaning of. Suffice to say, the man who played the priest (read Man of Faith) in my erstwhile favourite science fiction movie, Contact, sees his career complete a nice circle by himself making a jump of faith, both metaphorically and literally, this time. Add to this the hauntingly beautiful music of Hans Zimmer, and a couple of 'wow' moments, one of which leads to the demise of the antagonist (yes there is one), and you have the complete package. The last scenes are guaranteed to make your eyes swell up as a satisfying conclusion is reached to this grand tale. McCounaghey and Chastain play stellar roles, and this film is guaranteed for Oscar nomination in multiple categories, technical as well as acting. It also demonstrates the superiority of 2-D hand-held cameras over the current slew of 3-D digital shooting, and is possibly the last film to be shot on IMAX. As much as it might seem an action adventure fantasy, it is much more a parent-child love story than anything else, and may not appeal to all audiences, hence the fiercely divisive opinions amongst critics already. Over time, this shall be acknowledged as one of the masterpieces of 21st century filmmaking, much in the way 2001 attained its acclaim years after release.",10,13,28,7 November 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope never gives up on you
","Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch.",10,3,4,12 July 2011
