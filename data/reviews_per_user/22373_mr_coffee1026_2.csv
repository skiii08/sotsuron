It," Someone broke their time machine
","The original movie/story was written for the time period when my parents were kids... this particular remake was written for a time period that did not exist... both with references from the original time frame like paper boats made waterproof with ceiling wax and New Kids on the Block which certainly would not have had a fanbase from the outsiders from when I was a kid. Tragic departures from the original story like the bathroom cleaning scene - which only had spooky significance in the book and original film in so much that Beverly had to attempt to clean it several times on her own where the mess would nearly instantly resurface... where as when she got her friends to help the mess did not come back again. The effects are certainly updated but that is the only thing this movie has going for it and wasn't really worth the time.Leaving out the references to things like the mummy and the werewolf didn't do this story any favors. I think if you want to reboot a period piece like this you should really go all out, not attempt to 90s everything and hope it still works, because it really doesn't. character development for the kids was severely truncated so when major scenes came about later it was hard to sympathise with them Seems like there was a whole lot of the story the rewriters didn't think was that important, they weren't right.",1,2,4,16 September 2018
Alien: Covenant," And I really liked the Alien franchise
","The computer animated aliens in this movie were laughably bad, worse even than alien3 which had a lot of technological limitations... appropriate use of costuming and prosthetics made the overall movie watchable, but this movie has no such redeeming qualities. There appeared to be some actual physical items used for the face-hugger sequences, but that scee was far too short. There also appeared to be a complete lack of consensus on the size that these creatures were supposed to be and so they seemed to be disproportionately sized to themselves from one frame to the next... seemingly to magically transform from the size of a soccer ball to the height of a human in a single camera pan. Any increase in effect resolution gained over the years was negated by that sort of nonsense which caused the alien to be very cartoon-like and not at all a threat. Hijacking bits of the original Alien soundtrack in an effort to elicit any feelings of nostalgia felt rather insulting. I have no interest in watching your computer-generated cartoon. The appeal of the original films was primarily how visceral and real they felt, the further you aim from that target, the worse of a result you manage to produce. I give 2 stars because the on board ship sets were well crafted and looked legit. Too bad, could have really made a great movie on sets like those.",2,3,6,13 October 2018
