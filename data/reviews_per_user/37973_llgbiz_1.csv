Walk the Line," a thin line to walk
","I'll make this short and sweet, neither of which this film was. Bottem line, just another relationship movie. The acting was fair, the direction and photography were good, and yet I was grateful when this film finally came to a close. I found this to be a poor tribute to a musical legend. I am a big Johnny Cash fan, I grew up listening to him. To tell the truth I feel a little cheated on this one. I was hoping to at least hear some Jonny Cash music. Instead you get a couple of hours of someone else's idea of what Jonny Cash sounded like. If you're interested in relationship movies then you'll probably enjoy this one. If your not, pass.",3,19,37,5 March 2006
