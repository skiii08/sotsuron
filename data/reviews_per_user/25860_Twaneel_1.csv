Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Both people beside me are actually snoring.
","The best part in this movie is Henry's sunglasses. Unexciting storyline. Unimpressive special effects. The vampires look more like zombies with fangs. Even Abe's beard is poorly done. The only compliment I am able to give is that the actors worked well with what they were provided. If you have no respect for good cinema, zombie movies and enter this movie with no expectations for the movie, you may find yourself mildly entertained. Otherwise you will find yourself sitting in the cinema writing up IMDb reviews to feel better about yourself for wasting the 20 something dollars you spent to sit and eat overpriced popcorn.",1,5,12,3 August 2012
