"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," As Fab As Ab Fab.
","A fairytale travelogue of Australia which is not far of the mark. Funny, poignant, sad and hilarious at once.  Very well cast and directed ( no one could believe that Guy Pierce was NOT gay! ). Made on a shoestring budget but far better and more entertaining than most films costing 20 times what Priscilla did.",10,1,3,20 September 2003
