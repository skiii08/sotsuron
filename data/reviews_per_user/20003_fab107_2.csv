Scarface," Pacino is superb!
","Al Pacino's performance in this film alone is enough to make it a masterpiece. There were moments when I actually forgot I was watching a movie and forgot that Tony Montana was being played by an actor. It all seemed so very real. Despite this movie's greatness, it still felt a little too long. On the other hand I couldn't think of any sections of the movie that could have been cut out to make it shorter. Every little detail in this movie serves a purpose. The chainsaw scene was downright disturbing to watch the first time I saw this movie, and I have seen my fair share of on-screen violence. Throughout the movie I felt a cetain uneasiness. Partly because of the situations and partly because of the score. There was quite a bit of cheesy 80's music, but the musical score was great.I can't stress enough how unbelieavable Al Pacino is in this movie. It's got to be one of the greatest performances of all time.Overall I give this movie an 8/10.",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Not Kubrick's Best but...
","I went into this film not quite sure what to expect. This probably indeed is Kubrick's worse film, but that in itself does not make it a bad one. Sure if you're gonna compare this piece of work to masterpieces such as, 'A Clockwork Orange,' and 'Full Metal Jacket' among other brilliant Kubrick works, then of course you will be disappointed by this film. Personally, I just took this film for what it was. A disturbing look at sexuality and the destructive role it can play in relationships.What really impressed me about this picture was the atmosphere and look of each setting in the movie. The most unforgettable sequence for me was the scenes, where Tom Cruise finds himself completely out of place.The music I felt was excellent. I can understand people who criticize it, but I think it fit perfectly with each scene.I agree with a lot of people that the pace to this movie was too slow and maybe the running time also should have been shorter, but in my mind the positive aspects of this film, outweigh the negatives.Overall a good film that I would recommend for anyone to view at least once with an open mind. I think that even if you hate it, at least you will still be thinking about it for sometime. I'm sure of it.",8,0,1,28 January 2001
