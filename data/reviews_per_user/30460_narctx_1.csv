Iron Man 3," Actually I'm confused here!
","I was so excited when I knew that Iron Man 3 will be shown in theaters and went to see it in the very early show, but at the end of the movie I was confused about what I felt about it. From the trailers, I pictured 'The Mandarin' as an archenemy and I believed that he could be one of the greatest movie villains of all time, may be even head to head with Nolan's Joker, but I was disappointed by how they ended it; I didn't want to see a useless decoy with only a beer can in the hand. Maybe they wanted to add a twist, but with a character like 'The Mandarin' and how 'Ben Kingsley' played it at the beginning of the movie, maybe that wasn't the best twist to think about and just burying a character like 'The Mandarin' that actually I don't know how Marvel approved this script, as it took Marvel's Mandarin and used it in the worst way possible. Needless to say how they tried to add some 'supposedly funny' situations like when 'Mark 42' suit get tripped by some ruins then it's ripped into shreds, which raised a question in my mind about how could a suit like that really protect Tony in combat? I rated it 6/10 for the great sound effects and CGI which was really entertaining and kind of buffered my huge disappointment.",6,0,1,5 May 2013
