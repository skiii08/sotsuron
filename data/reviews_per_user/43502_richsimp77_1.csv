Hereditary," Hilarious
","This film starts off looking like it's going to be a great horror, but soon turns in to a brilliant comedy. When the girls head gets chopped off and her brother just drives home I was laughing out loud. Then he just leaves it for his mum to find?! Comedy gold.The acting was good, but the film itself was boring and I laughed far too much at what was meant to be a psychological horror.",3,1,6,5 July 2019
