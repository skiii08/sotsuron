Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The jokes on you!!
","ALthough people are complainig that the movie is offensive to both Khazaks and jews but the real joke is on the Americans. The film highlights the American people's stupid views and to watch the way they react is both funny and very intriguing. The bit that amazed me the most was when Borat was at the dinning club and the snobby woman said 'i'm sure it wouldn't take long for him to be totally americanized' y wud he want to b 'americanised'. y do Americans assume every1 wants to be like them and why do they feel the need to change every1 into them? the real joke is on the Americans and i personally though this was one of the funiest points in the movie.'I like you,I like sex, Is NICE!!!'",7,0,7,14 November 2006
Fight Club," the real world
","i was 14 years old when i first saw this film and thought it was a bit weird an pushed it to back of my mind thinking that i was just a bit thick and didn't understand it. like 90% of people who watch this film i was expecting a pretty mindless film about bare knuckle boxing, and being a 14 year old male that appealed to greatly, instead i viewed,which at the time i thought, was a strange weird film. it wasn't until the second time i saw the film i understood what it was truly about and by the time i saw it the third time i was amazed at how accurately it captures the real world. call me crazy but this film altered my whole outlook on life, as a confused teenager this made things clearer me and i cant help but think only the intellectuals amongst us can truly appreciate this work of art. after watching the film i read the book which is just as brilliant as the film but i do think the film gives you a clearer image of what the book is trying to say,exactly what a film based on a book should do, i have spoken to many other people who agree with me that this film makes you look at the world in its scary reality.",10,0,2,2 April 2006
