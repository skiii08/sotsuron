The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," The puppets were fantastic!
","I just saw this film and I kept waiting for an explanation.  I guess I wasn't in the mood for dreamy, come up with your own ideas as to why/what was happening in the movie.  I enjoyed watching the expressions on Irene Jacob's beautiful face, but I agree with another user, that found the puppets 'engaging'.  That scene was magical to me, the puppets had so much emotion to them. More emotion than I've seen on some actor's faces. The way the puppeteer moved their hands was so delicate.  I thought the actor that played the puppeteer was intense and attractive. The rest of the movie was okay, and although I love 'artsy' movies this one was too 'artsy' for me.",Null,2,7,26 August 1999
