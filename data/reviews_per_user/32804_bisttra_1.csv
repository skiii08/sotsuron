The Equalizer," no meaning at all
","I can not understand what is the meaning of this more than two hour film. That there are some ex FBI guys who if got angry could destroy all alone the Russian mobsters all over the globe, even in Moscow, no meter they are like a crow among pigeons. but they don't. got angry. still. @!?!?! I don't just like Denzel Washington, I love him; why?!?! At the first half hour I thought: wait, this is Denzel after all, wait and you will see the hidden masterpiece. This is not even a good action movie.. Are the authors trying to create the new super hero: the supermarket man with hammer and drill, who calmly kills the bad guys. He's got mysterious abilities that we do not see or even been hinted for, he just travels the local bus and protects people he likes. He says he do not knows why, just trying to reach justice and peace!?! I see it is based over a comics, maybe some do not need to be filmed!",5,5,8,30 December 2014
