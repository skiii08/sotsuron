Ford v Ferrari," Excellent in every way, and a treat for racing aficionados
","I went to see this film thinking that having Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sure not to disappoint - and I am glad to say I was right. I also wanted to see the legendary story of Ford vs Ferrari, as it happened, on the big screen and got more than I hoped for.
The drama, characters, excellent music, and everything else that makes for a great film can be found here. I loved boh the performances of ALL actors as well as the life-like race cars and how they are driven and how they behave in different situations. If you are not a racing fan, there will be plenty to enjoy, but knowing a thing or two about cars, gearboxes and RPMs helps.
The only thing that I didn't care for were few minor historically innacurrate details, which were added for entertainment value, I imagine. One, here or there, I could live with, but when they are piled up, and don't help the story, they should be left out.
Other than those minor complaints, which is why I give it 9 instead of 10 stars, the film is as close to perfect as one can get.",9,2,3,16 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Absolutely, without doubt the worst film I have ever seen
","I still remember seeing the original Blade Runner. The theater was empty, and I knew nothing about the film. Yet, even though I was concerned that I made a poor choice, I was immediately drawn to the story, or rather - hooked into it, and could not help but fall in love with that film. What a relief it was to find that over time many others realized that original Blade Runner had a true value - which was missed by most reviewers at the time. Exact opposite is true of the Blade Runner sequel: it gets decent reviews and that only solidifies my belief that all new releases by major studios get reviews 'made to order'. It does not matter any more whether a film is good or bad; the only thing that matters is - how good is your PR campaign, which often means - dirty PR such as buying votes and positive reviews. Why is this film bad? There are many reasons, and I hate to give away spoilers, so I will tread gently. But before I start, I will just say that around 30 or 40 min mark I wanted to walk out. The only reason I did not, is because I had to see this film. But it was way too painful.The first problem with this film is simple: lack of a good or at least watchable story. The film starts with some guy growing some fat, ugly larvae in a pool. Film-making rule #1: do not start a film with repulsive imagery. At least not before you set a tone. Film-making rule #2: make sure you show us what the main protagonist is after - and why. No such a thing here. Even when in the end we find out what is going on and so on, we are never really convinced about the importance of it all. Again, I have to refrain from giving away too much, but if you watch it, you will see. To put it mildly: this film is a 'story' (for lack of a better word) about some bladerunner who is trying to solve a problem which does nothing for me or anyone else. It is also about 90 minutes too long. To add weight to feather light story, there are looooong drawn out scenes of nothingness, and most of the information is given in little snippets hoping to make it look like the story is smart, only you are dumb. Didn't work on me. The story is as dull as a sack of hammers. And then the worst offense of all: there is not a single scene, action, line of dialogue, or anyone's reaction that is based on proper motivation. Nothing. Zero. Nada. Zilch. The whole thing was written from the point of 'Oh, this is act three, better get the energy up - OK, lets have these guys fight!' or 'OK, here we have nothing, so lets throw in some nudity!' At one point someone is a dear guest; next scene, they are about to get killed by their host. Everyone behaves like they are beyond psychotic, and completely alienated. No emotion, no rhyme or reason, no motivation, no goal, nothing. Just emptiness mixed with some boredom for good measure. There are a few films I really hate, and I usually say I would rather watch Miley Cyrus than those films. In reality, I'd probably only pretend to watch Miley Cyrus because I cannot stand her 'performance'. But, in this case, I can say with my hand on my heart that I would truly beg to pay to watch Miley Cyrus in place of this awful thing, sorry - 'film'.",1,5,8,10 December 2017
Scarface," Not as great as it is lauded to be
","I saw Scarface when it first came out, and then again some 35 years later. Through all those years only few images from that film stayed with me - mostly how gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer was/is. This did not compare favorably to other great films which I remember to great detail, and upon watching it again recently, I found out why.
First of all, the main character, well portrayed by Al Pacino is far from an interesting of likeable character. His love of violence, dirty money and drugs may be attractive to some, but even when I was much younger, I found him entirely forgettable. There was not much reason to root for him, or even feel for him. 'A dumb, violent newcomer with (almost) no morals gets in trouble? Let's see what's on other channels...'
Then there is the story which is entirely predictable. What can happen to a violent criminal other than violence? And that's what happens. Unless you like watching violence in all it's bloody glory, you don't get anything from watching this film.
And then the story itself, or whatever story there is, is painfully long - overstretched to saga proportions to give it some weight.
In the end, between all the 'f' bombs, low-brow action and dialogues, and characters destined for self-destruction, I fail to see where the attraction that this film enjoys comes from. In a way, I think the audiences have been had by their own penchant for cheap thrills.
Shock value? Sure. Blood and foul language? Galore. But artistic merit or inspirited storytelling with strong characters? Not even close. This is one of those films that managed to garner praise despite it's lack of quality on all fronts, except for decent acting. Oh, and don't get me started on terrible music score... it only made the film age terribly, although it's age shows even without the score. As I was watching it, I could not help but think of much older films which managed to stay fresh, films such as 'M' by Fritz Lang or 'Rififi' by Jules Dassin. Heck, even lighter fare such as 'Pehlam 123' holds much better over time than this overrated, pretentious piece of sub-par, cheap 'entertainment', for lack of better word.
All in all, a forced three star. I had to watch something afterwards just to detox from the bad experience that left me wondering why did I even waste my time on it in the first place, when even on the first viewing in the theater, back in the 80's, I was not terribly impressed.",3,1,3,21 April 2018
The Young Victoria," Worth watching just for Emily Blunt's performance
","An interesting life story of Queen Victoria is presented in a rather dull way in this film. It feels as if the director did not know what he wanted to tell us. We see numerous times long and often boring shots of things that are best said once and quickly (queen's dog, stairs, or just nothing in particular), all at the expense of character introduction and development, and story.Most 'beats' in the film have been flattened by heavy weight of dullness, important moments are downplayed, some less important ones are overdramatized for no reason, and the biggest satisfaction of watching this film comes from performances of the two young actors - Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend.While all actors did a great job, which is one redeeming quality of 'Young Victoria', Emily Blunt steals the show yet again. To see her go through full transformation of her posture, walk, accent, facial expressions, even the way she cries, laughs and yells for every role, is enlightening. As much as I chose to watch this film because of her, I was immediately absorbed in her character and forgot that it was Ms. Blunt I was watching, rather than her young majesty.Fortunately, Emily Blunt's performance makes up for most of what is lacking in this film, so it is definitely worth watching (those five stars I gave to this film were mostly earned by Ms. Blunt). Otherwise the film itself is a good study of how a good story can be ruined by poor script and direction.",5,1,2,24 November 2011
Marie Antoinette," What a waste of time
","While slow, bordering with meaningless pace worked in Lost in Translation, in this film we don't get a chance to fill in the blanks. Most of the film, if not all of it, is just empty space, devoid of emotion, substance, character, development, or anything else.Add to that historical inaccuracies, music which is ridiculously out of place and time, and you will understand why it is so hard to like this film. Good performances by all actors in the film, as well as rich sets and costumes, albeit overdone, don't help at all.This was an attempt at creating Amadeus meets Lost in Translation, but it failed. The only thing it did well was ruin an otherwise interesting story.",1,4,6,9 May 2007
As Good as It Gets," As sucky as it can get!
","First of all: I managed to skip this movie for many years, mostly thanks to my, by now, well sharpened sixth sense about films I have not seen. This one had a vibe of 'I may not like it...' so I waited and waited... until few people told me to watch it. So, it came highly recommended.And, from the first second of this horrible excuse for a film, I could not believe what I was watching. A film that starts with no tone. I don't know what I am to expect; I know it is a comedy, but what type? I guess I will see as the film goes on.I will be honest: I only managed to torture myself with the first 27 minutes of this horror. I was hoping that they would all die premature deaths so that I don't have to watch it. Then as the film regressed further, I started hoping for an earthquake and finally a WWIII. Didn't happen, so I finally had to stop and come here to warn others.By the way, I have no idea what those who like this excuse for a film are on, but this is one of those times when I have serious doubts about the future of humanity, seeing that this sub-garbage gets 7.7 rating and high recommendations. I mean, even just judging it by simple standards of film making, this thing fails: characters have no motivation, they are absolutely unrealistic in every way possible, things happens just to get the story moving, and so on and so on. I mean, a 14 yr old could have written a better 'comedy'.How this thing ever got made into a film, and how so many people got conned into thinking that it does not suck even things that cannot be sucked is beyond me. I am appalled.I will stop here before I start using profanities. Simply put - this is as bad film making as it ever gets.",1,5,16,18 June 2017
Passengers," Haters gonna hate, but moviegoers have plenty to enjoy here
","I don't quite get all the hate that this film gets... I can also think of great number of recent alleged sci-fi films that don't deserve a minute of one's time, yet they are cherished and loved.In any case, I went to see Passengers with high expectations. While I am not a fan of either Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt, they were very good in this film - good enough to immerse me in the story (unlike most other alleged sci-films these days). I've been a fan of Michael Sheen ever since I saw him in Midnight in Paris where he was brilliant also, and his performance in Passengers was so good that it is easy to forget that this synthetic robot with a plastic smile is brought to you by a thespian. What a performance! Worth seeing just for that alone.The story is by now well known, due to spoilers being given away like candy during Halloween and partly due to (leaked?) script that was posted a while ago. Most importantly: the film has been changed from the original script and for the better.The thing that I liked about this film is that first of all - it is not stupid. I did not have to put an extra effort to suspend my disbelief the way I had to for most recent sci-fi favorites (except Martian which I liked). Yes there may be one or two occasions when I knew that 'such would be almost impossible' but even then, there is also an option that the situation had something that we, the viewers may not be aware of. For instance, the sudden loss of gravity would require sudden stopping of the rotation of the ship; that would require enormous amount of energy, otherwise things don't just stop in space. But, who knows - maybe the ship did decide to stop the rotation? So not entirely impossible (this is not a spoiler because the official trailer clearly suggests loss of gravity).The drama of the film is obviously based on the fact that two passengers woke up too early during their cross-universe trip. No matter what you think of the morality of how that all happened, remember this is a film and not televangelism. In other words: there is no space for political correctness in character portrayal.In the end, I can say that there was plenty to enjoy in this film, from excellent visuals to great performances all around. I actually plan to buy this in bluray, which I don't do that often with new movies (my library of recent films includes 'Argo', 'Dallas Buyers Club', 'Midnight in Paris'...) If you are expecting another marvel-comic inspired super-hero driven FX fest, you will be disappointed. No iron-men or spider-men or any other mutants in here. Just your plain simple ordinary humans with all their shortcomings.But if you are looking for an interesting story, with an interesting premise, and no cringe-worthy 'even kids know this is impossible' moments, than this is for you.ps. I loved the attention to detail which translated to some really cute and funny scenes...",8,324,532,21 December 2016
Midnight in Paris," Just what the doctor ordered!
","American cinema of late has not produced memorable films. Out of a few hundred films that come out of Hollywood every year, most if not all are forgotten immediately.Just as I was starting to realize that golden era of filmmaking is long gone, that there will never be great acting and great stories told on the big screen, came 'Midnight in Paris'. What a joy to watch! Midnight in Paris is a film about a writer(played wonderfully well by Owen Wilson) who is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée (played equally well by Rachel McAdams) and who is longing for the 'good old times' of early 20th century.It is probably best to know as little about this piece of magic filmmaking before watching it. Suffice it to say that one would be hard pressed to find a film which represents a more perfect combination of great story, with great sets and locations, great art direction and costumes, perfect performances by all actors including some surprises such as French first lady Carla Bruni, and beautiful music, photography, some of the best dialogues ever written for the big screen and above all - simple feeling of joy after watching a truly good film.All in all, this is a film that can be enjoyed many times over and in my book it gets a well deserved place among some of the best films ever made.If there are any regrets about it, it would be that it deserved many more Oscars than it got.",10,0,0,4 June 2012
Life of Pi," Film as junk-food
","Life of Pi is a story about a teen who gets stranded in the middle of the ocean with a few wild animals... most notably a tiger.If the setup sounds interesting to you, than you would probably like the film as that's all there is to it. That and some decent visual effects and nice photography.As for the story - there is not much there. It starts with 'The story will make you believe in God' or something to that effect, but there is no place for God in it. Some claim it is meant to prove non-existence of God... but I did not see it that way. It is too blah to have anything in it really.Bottom line: in the world where true mysticism and symbolism is lost, there is no shortage of pretentious works of 'art' (film, novels, or anything else) which gladly promises to bring some new value. They all have a few things in common:<ul><li>Story originates in a far away land and/or time</li></ul><ul><li>It is based on some completely unimportant and ridiculous premise that only young teenagers may be interested in it</li></ul><ul><li>It is visually rich</li></ul>Whether it is Life of PI or any other similarly dumb fantasy such as Harry Potter or Lord Of The Ring, it does not really matter. They all require that the consumer have low expectations, poor understanding of human condition, and is easily entertained with anything that seems even a little 'different'.Often, forced attempts to be different brings us just more of the same, and Life Of PI does just that.",2,2,5,8 April 2014
Man of Steel," Yet another FX fest for immature audiences only...
","How sad to see the very art that gave us films such as 'Seven Samurai' or 'Grand Illusion' has been reduced to a theme park ride level of entertainment. Forget about subtleties, deeper meanings or even a story... in that sense, Man of Steel is not to be blamed; the road was paved a few years ago when Hollywood, unable to write and a produce a good script, turned to cheap thrills. Within that scope of cheap thrills, the Man Of Steel is one non-stop roller-coaster ride filled with explosions and fights for your average testosterone driven adolescent viewer to be excited for quite a while. When people loose sense of important things, they turn to cheap thrills, and this film would be one such thrill. With great cast who all performed quite well, and excellent effects which fill 100% of almost all shots in which characters are not yelling (which is very few), this is one of those 'one (film) for me, one for them' kinda deals - do it for the studio so we all make money so we can do what we like later... That's the bad news, and it should be enough to keep a true cinefile well away from the Man Of Steel. The good news is that the script was at least not terrible, it had some resemblance of intelligence in it, although don't expect triple digits IQ, and certainly very little if any wisdom in it. It is a 'good vs. evil' story with nothing new brought to the table except - fight force with force (which actually never works, but we would like to believe it does, so we watch movies which feed our illusions). Careful product placements - from I-Hop to Sears and latest Nokia phones, adds to the commercial feel of the film. A few stupidities kinda make one cringe, but in all that chaos, who will notice?All in all, a decent FX Fest with very good cast, and lot of noise, explosions and fighting. Technically - truly well done. Story-wise? Well, it was never meant to be intellectually stimulating... but it could have been. Even thrill rides can have a clue or two about deeper human values (beyond just love at first sight) and so on, yet this film mostly fails there. A zero in that department, combined with 10 in how it was done, and you get a 5 on 1-10 scale. Watchable, but not the best way to spend your evening. I had to watch it, but otherwise I probably would not, except perhaps out of curiosity.",5,4,9,27 June 2013
Armageddon," hollywood at it's worst
","Even with a simple and unbelievable story like some big asteroid coming from nowhere, and of all the infinitely big empty space going exactly for the planet earth, this could've been at least an OK film. But, all the other things that make a good film are missing here from the start. The childish and unbelievable scene of the father shooting at his daughter's boyfriend; the lack of true emotions by any one character; the script which calls for meteor showers any time the film gets boring; the total predictability of the plot; the shallowness of characters and bad acting on their part (which I think has more to do with direction then actors). In any case, a week story gets an even weaker script which gets made into a boring special effects fest. Steve Buscemi was good as always. Other then that I have a hard time remembering anything else that was good about this film...",1,2,5,21 July 2000
American Beauty," yet another pretentious holywood movie
","At first while watching American Beauty it seems like it could be a truly good film. However, despite good cinematography, acting, and OK plot, this film lacks something unforgivable - a good story.The story is pretending to be inspiring and thought provoking. What we see is Kevin Spacey trying to rebel against the rigid society he lives in. And by trying to be different he's just more of the same. This is where the film fails. In today's society, rebelliousness is confused with true originality, and this film makes the same mistake.The main character is rebelling against the alienation and out of balance value system that everyone adopted. That's a decent intro to a potentially good story. But that's where it all ends too. We don't see any kind of growth on his part, with the exception of the last few seconds of the film (when he looks at his old family picture - and that's not enough); nor do we see something that would certainly make for a truly great film - a realization that rebelling is NOT the way out of alienated life, but a way to stay in it (while unfortunately thinking that something good was done about it). Drugs, sexy girls/wives, dream cars no matter how extreme and 'different', have never brought true happiness to anyone; they are cheap substitutes for something essential. But in American Beauty that rebelliousness is shown as a solution for our hero.The film may give those who are just as alienated and rebellious something to identify with; others will be disappointed with the story that seems like it will have some depth, but stays within conformistic boundaries of today's society and makes no progress.All in all there was nothing great about this film, only a disappointment that there was nothing original about any of the characters - they are living their limited little lives thinking that they are different when they are not. This film also pretends to be different when it is not.Kevin Spacey just being himself doesn't really give a special performance; OTOH, Annette Bening is excellent.Hardly a 4/10 (only because of Annette Bening and good cinematography).",1,2,5,4 June 2000
No Strings Attached," Not watchable
","As soon as I started watching this trash, I came upon a scene where at a funeral, a girl says to her bereaving mother that 'that's a guy I had one night stand with when I was 14'. That right there is enough to see that someone immature, unrefined and clueless wrote the script. Having still some goodwill left in me, I skip over more stupid scenes and dialogues hoping for something better.
While skipping I come upon so many mindlessly boring dialogues that it didn't take too long to hit the 'stop' button. The culmination was introduction of our protagonist's dad played by Kevin Klein. Wonderful actor, horrible role. Comes out he slept with his son's ex-girlfriend. In a typical immature, clueless filmmaker fashion, it's all delivered in a matter-of-fact manner.
The story, dialogues, scenes and characters are so dumb, the film is unwatchable.
Just when I thought that I have learned how low the Hollywood had sunk, I was proven wrong,
Oh, well, you learn something new every day.
ps. To her credit, Natalie Portman manages to look cute and believable, her dumb lines notwithstanding.
pps. No, I could not watch it to the bitter end.",1,4,4,3 September 2019
The Transporter," Lowest IQ movie I have ever seen
","There are fun movies, guilty pleasure movies, even silly or ridiculous films... and they can all be enjoyed, to some extent. But this one is way below any of those standards. It feels like it was written during a drunk weekend, and with no re-writing. Someone had money to burn.
I won't go into details, because they are worthless. I wanted to see action and camera work, as well as chase sequences, and even those failed. Fighting was badly coordinated, chase scenes lack sense of space and orientation and therefore believability, story is barely there, twists and plot points absolutely ridiculous, timing is off throughout... In conclusion: this film sucks in every way imaginable.",1,0,2,25 June 2018
Ex Machina," Certinaly better than average Hollywood flick, but not a classic
","The theme of Ex Machina has been covered many times before: Blade Runner, Demon Seed, AI, I Robot, Westworld... Essentially it is a story about creating a computer/robot which will have self-consciousness like a human.The main character in Ex Machina gets to interact with one such creation and is trying to evaluate it. It is what unfolds from this point that makes this film interesting.While watching the film I loved that there were a few moments of brilliance - moments where things made perfect sense. However, there were also many moments which made no sense. Even then, the film was watchable, even enjoyable. The plot-holes or lack of logic were not as bad as in Interstellar for instance, but they were there.While I enjoyed the relationships that were well portrayed in this film, I found the ending a bit lacking. Just as the film has many layers to it, which we get to discover, the ending should have had the same quality to it - but it does not. In the end, what you see is what you get.If the ending were as complex as the rest of the film, I would give it 8 maybe even 9 stars; but as it is it gets 7 stars.All in all, this film deserves praise for being daring, and not trying to cater to the lowest common denominator. Although the vernacular suggests that target audience is primarily geeks and techies, the film is very watchable and enjoyable. Unlike most of what passes for film these days, Ex Machina is not an insult to intelligence. However, it could have been a lot more than that - we could have been discussing how it surpassed all those films I mentioned earlier, but it has not; not even close.",7,3,5,3 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin lowers the bar for bad films to unreachable level
","This is bad film making that becomes worse with every minute. Quentin has run out of ideas and takes a saying that it's easy to get an emotional reaction from audience, quite literally.Instead of trying to criticize the film, I'll just list some of the scenes and themes that are graphically presented in Kill Bill: paedofillia, ripping ones eyes out, raping a comatose woman, biting someone's tongue off, cutting of off arms and heads with huge sprays of blood, cutting head in half with a good shot of the persons brains, a bullet rips through some guys brains and camera follows through the wound with two girls on the other side of the wound looking through, shooting a pregnant woman in the head, killing a woman in front of her daughter and then giving that girl a little speech about revenge, a 17 yr. old asks a guy if he wants to have sex with her, and as soon as he says 'yes' she butchers him...Does all this even need criticism?",1,11,20,11 November 2004
Jurassic World," Better than your average special effects fest
","First of all Jurassic World is a piece of entertainment rather than art, so I base my vote and review on that.If you were curious as to the overall story and feel of the movie, I will only say that if you liked the first Jurassic Park, you will most likely like this one too. The writers and director have taken the sequel formula quite literally, down to repeats of entire scenes and shots. The thing that is new is a new character, the menacing dino, and the performance of the dinosaurs - they definitely feel more natural and one can even feel their characters. Kudos to the FX crew for that. I also enjoyed the somewhat stylized approach to violence in film - there is enough action to keep one on the edge of their seat without gore. So kudos for that too.The story itself is essentially a repeat of the first film, with few twists and turns: things go wrong, then they go terribly wrong, lives are in danger, and our hero tries to save the day.What I disliked in the film were overly dumb dialogues and exposition. They go way beyond clichés and border on mentally retarded, with IQ of those scenes hovering around 50-60. A teen kid hates his younger but smarter brother - just like that. It supposedly makes for a more interesting story. A nice woman hates her first date but he is still trying; the forced and outright dumb banter between them makes me want to vomit and force the writers to watch some much more entertaining classics such as 'To Catch a Thief'. Kids are again directed to act like grown-ups which only makes it hard for the viewer to maintain the suspension of disbelief. And then, there are things such as our heroine running through mud in high heels and emerging out of it all with those shoes firmly on, and clean.Luckily, those cringe-worthy moments did not last long enough to make me lose interest, and the action and the rest of it was entertaining enough that I am willing to forgive the tendency to cater to the lowest common denominator. Actually, I am not even sure that Hollywood understands how to cater to the lowest common denominator... this film would have been just as successful if not much more so, with smarter dialogues and a story that does not leave a loose end here and there. If it had the same story but smarter characters/dialogues I, and many I know, would give it a higher rating.With all that being said, this is still a fine piece of entertainment. I especially like the fact that director opted for tension induced by our expectations and fears rather than outright gore. It also makes the film (relatively) safe for kids.So, if you go in to be entertained, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.ps. Watched it in 3D, and it was OK, but I still fail to see what the attraction is all about over 2D...",7,0,4,17 June 2015
Pretty Woman," One of the best romantic comedies ever made
","I remember watching this film when it first came out. Even as someone who at the time did not care for romantic comedies, I actually liked it. I mean, it was not another Eisenstein or Kubrick, but for what it was, it worked for me. That was some quarter of a century ago.Then, recently I started watching all those romantic comedies that I avoided over the years, and this one came up. Why not - let's see how I feel about it now.And I must admit, I was stunned, in the most positive way! Again, this is not Citizen Kane or City Lights. It is a fair tale set in the modern times, but what I loved about it, now that I have a few more years of experience under my belt, was that it was crafted with incredible attention to detail. Everything, and I mean EVERY little thing was done impeccably: the smooth setup at the beginning, gentle and interesting enough that we are never bothered by how unrealistic it is. The dialogues which are never forced. Scenery, which obviously being set in Beverly Hills could not be better. And finally, the ending which works so well.I generally don't believe in films created by a committee. Pretty Woman went through so many re-writes and test screenings that one cannot recognize the original idea in the final result. The original was supposed to be a gritty story about a hooker, and while more realistic, it could never achieve what the fairy tale story about a nice hooker with a big heart could achieve - that great feeling that there is still love in the world that maybe, just maybe, things could turn out really well for anyone. Yes, call me delusional or romantic, but all that really works in this film.They say that there was a lot of improvisation in the scenes, and they were shot many different ways. I have also seen other films by Gary Marshall and was not impressed at all. This is the only one I liked. I am tempted to believe that the director was helped by the editor or someone like that to polish out what must have started as diamond in the rough.Again, if you have not seen this film yet (highly unlikely), don't expect some 'haute cinema'; but do expect some great fun, and a decent romance mixed together. One must admire the fact that such a fairy tale was made in modern times and that it manages to keep one believing in it. Never was I reminded that I was just watching a film - that's how well put together it is.",10,1,4,22 June 2017
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Not to be missed
","I always believed that a good film needs a good plot and/or screenplay to start with. This film has one of the most interesting plots in a long time. Even if a lot of it was inspired by Pulp Fiction, Italian Job and a few othes, that doesn't take away from the film. (It's not like Tarantino hasn't borrowed from other films either). Plot is original and captivating. Film itself is very funny ('a disgrace to criminals everywhere') and deserves multiple viewings just to ensure that one gets it all. Acting is refreshing, music perfect for the film and editing, photography, jokes and all the rest work perfectly well together. If you're expecting to see a film that will inspire you to higher ideals, then look elsewhere; but if you're looking for a great comedy then this is the film to see. I happily gave it 10 in the voting section.",10,0,0,24 July 2000
When Harry Met Sally...," Contrived, boring and entirely forgettable.
","As most people, I saw this film when it came out. Normally, I remember films very well, but except for the well known restaurant scene ('I'll have what she is having!'), I couldn't remember any of it. So I decided to watch it again. The film starts of relatively well - not your typical romcom style, and that's a good thing. But that's also where the list of good things about this film ends. What starts with him being cold and distant and her being 'structured' as she puts it, ends with both of them being pretty much the same. (Occasional emotional outbursts do not a character arc make) I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. I even stopped the film a few times just to see how it would play with a few sentences taken out here and there, and it played much better. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch and a story that reminds you that it is artificial, quite regularly. The illusion of a relationship between the main characters is the worst part: they are friends, and that only in the second half of the film. I never believed that they were for real; I was also annoyed with both of them too many times to care if they loved each other or died in a freak accident. In the end, the most important question about this film is - how did it get such a fanatical following? I remember that when it first came out, it was pushed and promoted all over the place. The 'I will have the same' scene in the restaurant was daring for those times, and it certainly helped, but even that scene plays quite badly: structured characters do not just jump out of their structured world to entertain audiences - more was needed but it was never there. Maybe it was all that advertising and PR, or perhaps everyone wanted to see a (faked) orgasm on the big screen... In any case, the film was never that good to start with, and it really aged badly. If the editing and dialogues were a bit better focused, and if character development was a bit more realistic and deeper, I would consider this for an upgrade. As it is, it gets very generous 3 stars from me.",3,2,7,31 December 2016
Steve Jobs," A rich biography turned into a shallow bickering
","When one deals with a life of a personality such as Steve Jobs, that writer would have to try really hard to make the biography/biopic boring. Regardless where you stand on issues such as Steve Jobs 'creativity' or his family matters, or his personality, we can all agree that there must be plenty of material in his life that would make for an interesting biopic. And of all the interesting stuff that did happen in his life, mostly behind closed doors, we get to listen to non-stop verbal diarrhea of monologues, which should pass for dialogues... but which are all too predictable and formulaic to be of any interest: every sentence is interrupted, questions are either ignored or answered with a sarcastic put-down and hardly anyone is listening to anyone. There is nothing to reveal anyone's motivation, no depth to any of the characters and whatever you see in the first few minutes gets repeated all the way to the end: maybe Jobs is a genius, maybe he is not, but lets see how he argues that point on and on; maybe he loves his daughter, maybe he does not; maybe he was responsible for those great products, maybe he was not... and so on. The whole movie is set in those few minutes before each famous Apple (and Next) product launch: first we see the 1984 product launch, then the next one, then the next one, and by the end, even Jobs himself says 'how come everyone is coming to talk to me just minutes before a product launch?' Well, its because the script is simply awful. It was obviously written in a rush and the result is uninspired, shallow and pretentious film. Direction was no better and end result is something akin to the first Apple computer: useless (yes, the very first apple computer did not have any output, so it was actually useless).",2,21,41,20 January 2016
The Great Gatsby," One of only few films I could not watch to the end...
","If you can believe it, I actually walked into this film knowing nothing about it, except that it was based on the book 'The Great Gatsby'. I didn't even know who it was directed by, and I prefer to see films that way. I can always find out anything I need to know after the fact.The first thing that struck me about TGG was strange color grading. While some scenes have perfectly normal color, some others have what must have been an attempt by the director to give us a sense of some fairy-tale like world. While still trying to figure this film's inconsistent visual style, an even more painful experience surprised me: that of modern music and dancing. From F. Scott Fitzgerald to 'Moulin Rouge 2' in a split second. At this point I knew who directed the film...From then on, The Great Gatsby was one music number after another, with breaks consisting of poor story telling in between.And about half way through, I found myself walking out. I rarely ever do that, but this was just too painful. It was about as bad as Sofia Copolla's 'Marie Antoinette'.Here and there, in all that chaos and failed experimenting with camera, shots, acting and music numbers, I came upon a shot or two which I actually liked. They don't really work within the film itself, but on their own, they were well done. It was some sort of an organized chaos which I admired for its complexity and its lack of story telling power.I can easily see how die-hard fans will love this piece of kitsch to death; unlike Moulin Rouge which had some good qualities, this film has none of it. The only 'quality' is that it can be easily called 'Moulin Rouge 2, with barely a story to tell'. How do you take a great book and manage to ruin it, is beyond me. At best, this film is kitschy, and at worst - a completely failed experiment. The director confused chaos with creativity.All in all, this was not worth my time.",2,6,9,13 December 2013
