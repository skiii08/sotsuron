Mission: Impossible III," Don't bash it until you see it!
","You can't really go into this movie expecting an epic adventure (i.e. LOTR) or a great drama (i.e. Shawshank Redemption). You should go into this movie with simple expectations knowing you'll be treated to extreme action sequences and a clich√©d (but good / fun) story. It is a summer blockbuster, afterall.I, myself, am not a big fan of Tom Cruise the person, but I am a fan of Tom Cruise the actor. And he does a damn fine job as Ethan Hunt. Emotions, facial expressions, fast running and maneuvers are all there. Cool looks? There too. Him being shorter than all other actors? There.While many of the action sequences are somewhat spoiled by the trailer, I found myself still secretly cheering for Ethan even though I knew what the outcome would be. For example, the movie starts out with the ending, then flashback to the story of how he got there. So I sort of know during certain action sequences who's going to 'win' or escape. But like I said, enjoy it for the intense action, because they are extreme, creative and different.As far as J.J. Abrams is concerned, this was an impressive first big screen movie for him. You can tell slight similarities between MI3 and his shows like 'Lost' and 'Alias'. For example, the 'Lost' violin suspense music is here. If you're a fan of either show, then MI3 is definitely worth your while.",9,0,1,8 May 2006
