Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," best comedy of 2006.
","in my opinion, this is the funniest movie of 2006 by far. when i sat down in the chair at the cinema i was angry because i was so close to the screen because i had to look up and move my eyes from side to side to capture the whole picture. i quickly got over this and when the film started i laughed from beginning until the end, pretty much non stop. the acting is hilarious and there are so many original jokes. i was sure this was going to be a good experience, as many of the people who like the same films as me had told me this one was amazing, but i never though it was going to be this good. i can't point out one weak joke in this movie from the top of my head, apart from the nude wrestling. funny at first, but went on for a little to long.i would like to add though, this movie will not fit everyone. people who are easily offended by cultural joke and / or do not find jokes in that category funny, should definitely not see this movie.if you do not think this movie is worth spending money on seeing at the cinema, you might be right. i think this movie will be better with a good bundle of friends around a fairly well sized TV than at the cinemas. final line is though: i think it's a movie worth seeing.",10,2,13,27 November 2006
