Catch Me If You Can," Catch it if you can
",This movie was well worth the price of admission. The opening credits were actually interesting to watch. Reminded me of some of the opening credits of some late 60's early 70's movies. If you just watch the movie and don't get hung up on thinking about what this guy's actions did to the lives of the people involved you are in for some good entertainment. Being based on a true story you have to wonder just how much of it is the truth. Some of the things were pretty unbelievable. Was the FBI really that unsophisticated back then? Maybe check fraud was just not a very high priority. The late 60's period also made the film very fun to watch.  There were no explosions or graphic language(maybe a word or two here and there).  Just an enjoyable movie that I would probably pay to see again.,Null,0,0,30 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best movie I have seen in years.
","I had not read the Rings books. I saw this movie on DVD and wasn't sure what to expect. I can only comment on this as a movie, not as a comparison between book and movie. I enjoyed the movie very much. Too many times these types of movies, I mean medieval type movies, put dialog in them to appeal to the people of modern times.  That type of thing ruins a movie for me. LOTR stayed true to the times and kept me interested most of the time. I got a little impatient at some of the slower scenes but overall the movie was great.  I especially liked the opening montage and the scenes at the shire. I will be seeing the next two movies at the theater. Probably more than once.",Null,0,0,6 September 2002
