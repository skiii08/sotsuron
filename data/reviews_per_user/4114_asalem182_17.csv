Walk the Line," Walk the Line Barely Walked the Line
","Walk the Line was a good movie, but if you walk in expecting to see a movie about the music of Johnny Cash, prepare to be disappointed. WTL is mainly a movie about the love story between Cash and June Carter.Walk the Line started off very well. Within 30 minutes, we see how Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up, his affection with music (listening to songs in his childhood, spending time in guitar shops and writing lyrics when he was in the army), and his turbulent relationship with his father ( who was blaming Johnny for his brother's death, and telling him his brother was the better son). Then we see his first audition, followed by his first gig, where he sees June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) for the first time.Once June appears, the movie felt like a repetitive song. That song goes like this: John meets June, John and June sing a song together, John upsets June, John starts drinking and taking pills, John and June make up, and start singing another song.. This sequence was repeated 3 times. Now I know these events happened in Cash's life, but I'm also pretty sure there are other things we should have seen. For example, what were his relationships with other musicians? and more importantly, what were his relationships with his daughters? (he barely spoke to them during the movie). Also, Cash is one of the best songwriters of all time, so how did he come up with the ideas behind his songs? The weird thing is, we have two scenes of June Carter writing Ring of Fire, and only one scene of Cash writing music in the army, and another scene showing us how he came up with the lyrics of Get Rhythm (easily one of the highlights of the movie).So, why did I give WTL a 7 despite all the problems I had with it? It's pretty simple: Because Phoenix and Witherspoon gave two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. Being a big fan of Phoenix since his 'Inventing the Abbots' days, I knew he was going to pull it of. And he did indeed. I will never forget the look on his face when his first wife left him. The fact that he learnt how to play the guitar, and that he sings exactly like Cash is even more impressing. Anyway, the real revelation here is Witherspoon. 5 minutes after she appeared, I totally forgot she was an actress. I saw her on TV the other night and I thought 'Why did she dye her hair blond?' and then I remembered Witherspoon is a natural blond and she became a brunette only for the movie. Her performance was sweet, funny, and unforgettable. Also, she sounded like and angel in the songs, and I wouldn't be surprised if she and Phoenix start getting deals from record companies in the near future.So, I'd recommend watching Walk the Line, but I'd really love to see another Cash biopic, one that will focus on his music.",7,1,3,11 December 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Welcome Back Mr. Hunt, You've Been Gone for Too Long.
","The last couple of years weren't very kind to Mr. Cruise. He went crazy on talk shows, War of the Worlds had a lukewarm reception, and for almost 2 years, he couldn't get the latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise off the ground. Fortunately, with MI3, he finally seems to be back on track.IMF member Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is almost retired. He's engaged to beautiful nurse Julia (Michelle Monaghan). But when Hunt knows that international arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is about to kill his protégé Lindsey (Keri Russell), Hunt has to reunite with his team to save Lindsey.The first 2 films of the franchise couldn't be more different. Mission Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, was an intelligent thriller, with a confusing plot, and it didn't have enough action. On the other hand, MI2, directed by John Woo, was an action-driven film, and its plot was silly. MI3 follows in the footsteps of MI2, but with better action, better acting, and a better story.The action in the film is an action fan's wet dream. Almost every gimmick in the book is there; Shootouts, check. Car chases, check. Chopper chases, check. The bridge scene in particular made me drop my jaw in awe. It was better than any action scene since Return of the King. The Vatican operation, very reminiscent of the Prague operation in the first film, was also stunning. Director J.J Abrams (the man behind hit series Lost) did an amazing job. The action sequences are well orchestrated, well edited, and unlike many recent action films, you could always tell what's going on. And all the money is up on the screen. In fact, I'm surprised the film only cost 150 million to make.While the story isn't as good as the first part, it's far better than the paper-thin story of the sequel. The best thing about it was the comeback of the IMF team, who were totally absent in the sequel. The domestic angle gave more humanity to the character of Ethan Hunt. And I was also glad that double-crossing was back in full force this time around.Hoffman gave the best performance. There is a very thin line between being a great villain and being over the top. But because Hoffman knew exactly what he was doing, he never crossed it. Cruise was very good as Hunt, and Simon Pegg was great as the comic relief.Of course, the film wasn't flawless. The last 20 minutes are very cheesy, the ending is somewhat anti-climactic, and Hoffman was criminally underused. But everything else was so good that it atones for all these sins.So, I'd definitely recommend seeing MI3. Bring on part 4.",10,2,5,20 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Make Yourself Lucky, and Go Watch Slevin
","Lucky Number Slevin is witty, funny, entertaining, with amazing performances and excellent dialog.Slevin Kelvara (Josh Hartnett) is not the luckiest guy in the world.He just lost his job, his apartment, and caught his girlfriend cheating. If that's not enough, two rival crime bosses, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), both think Slevin is someone else and start looking for him. And when a world-class assassin, Mr. GoodKat (Bruce Willis), shows up in New York for the first time in two decades, a police detective (Stanley Tucci) starts to wonder what's going on.We didn't have a mistaken identity thriller in quite some time, and fortunately, Slevin was a worthy addition to the genre. Jason Smilovic's script was witty, sharp, and full of twists and turns to keep the viewer interested. The dialog was very funny, and I loved the word playing between Slevin, The Boss, and The Rabbi. My only complaint with the story was that some key plot elements could be predicted way too early in the film. Anyway, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show.Technically, the film is great. The sets, cinematography, costumes, and soundtrack are all top notch. Director Paul McGuigan, clearly influenced by Tarantino, was very good. He really knew how to switch smoothly between dark and funny scenes. He could use more editing though, as the 'explanation' scenes near the end were longer than they should have even. But maybe he had to do that, because the story was somewhat complex.I was very impressed by the acting in the film. Each actor was original in his own way. Freeman, finally playing against type (When was the last time he was a baddie?), was menacing. Willis, totally comfortable with taking a back seat this time, was funny and cool. Kingsley was able to overcome his recent duds and gave an amazing performance. His accent cracked me up several times. But the real surprise here is Harnett. After his, ummm, not so good performances in Pearl Harbor, Halloween H20, and 40 Days and 40 nights, he shines in Slevin. He was likable, without losing the character's edge. I really wish he works with McGuigan again in the near future.So, I'd definitely recommend Slevin. It was the best thriller I've seen in quite some time.",9,12,30,11 May 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda will hit you harder than the majority of the movies you've seen
","Hotel Rwanda was a touching, shocking, and very powerful film. I was surprised filmmakers waited a whole 10 years to make a movie about one of the biggest massacres of all time.Hotel Rwanda tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, in a career best performance), a hotel manager who is forced to turn his hotel into a refugee camp to save his family and the refugees from the massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994.The first question that will come across your mind while watching HR is 'why have we become so cruel?', and no wonder one character asked the exact same question during the movie. You'll see roads covered with corpses, the males of the dominant tribe, The Hutus, raping females of the other tribe, The Tutsis, and Hutus slaughtering Tutsis on the streets. And then the United Nations, in one of their biggest failures of all time, decided to rescue only the Westerners (by making them leave the country) and leave the people of Rwanda to die alone. And Hotel Rwanda isn't afraid to show everything. I wonder how they could get away with a PG-13 rating.After that, I think you'll feel ashamed. In the best scene of the movie, an American cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix, in a great cameo), had to leave the country after the infamous UN decision. When his Ruandan friend begs him to take her with him, he says with teary eyes 'I've never felt so ashamed'. And frankly, I was ashamed too. I didn't try to donate money, or protest, or do anything for that country, and that's why I felt I (along with millions of people around the world) was responsible for what happened. I even think your average Joe will never know this massacre happened in the first place. And that's another great thing about Hotel Rwanda: It reminded us of that horrible event.And I have to disagree with the people that said the somewhat uplifting ending ruined the movie for them. In fact, I can't find a better ending for the movie. That ending happened in real life, and it shows that despite all the cruelness in the world, there's still some hope left.So, I'd definitely recommend Hotel Rwanda. Being a true story, it will hit you harder and touch you more than the majority of the movies you've seen.",9,1,1,18 December 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," An Action Film that has a Heart and a Brain
","I want you to name me the last great action flick. Die Hard 4.0? Nah, it lost all credibility when The Bruce single-handedly beat a jet. Casino Royal? Nope, too much talking for my liking. MI3? Anti-climactic. The Bourne Supremacy? Oh yes, that was a magnificent picture. So, I guess it's not really surprising that The Bourne Ultimatum, the sequel to Supremacy, is arguably the best film of the year so far. We went in with extremely high expectations, and I'm happy to say that those expectations were met, and then some.When we last met Jason Bourne (Damon), his girlfriend had just been killed, so he was out for revenge. This time though, it's back to basics. Bourne is being hunted by CIA officials, led by Strathairn's Noah Vosen, as he's still searching for his unknown past. Also unlike the last film, Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Allen) and series regular Nicky Parsons (Stiles) are on Bourne's side.I'm quite sure no other film this year will give you the Adrenaline rush Ultimatum gave us. To cut to the chase, I'll just quote US critic Todd McCarthy: 'If they could bottle what gives The Bourne Ultimatum its rush, it would probably be illegal'. Basically, the film is one massive action scene. The chases in London and in Tangier in particular took my breath away and had me on the edge of my seat. But if you think Ultimatum is just a loud & dumb action flick, well, think again. The film's got big a heart; Bourne is still the sympathetic spy who wants to atone for his previous sins. And even better, Ultimatum has a brain too. The story is complex and gripping and believe or not, but Ultimatum is probably the most anti-American film since Syriana, Damon's 2005 political thriller (I haven't seen Sicko yet)After helming Supremacy, United 93, and Ultimatum in a row, I think Greengrass has firmly established himself as one of the best directors working today; the film has an excellent gritty look, innovative fight scenes, and an outstanding score. The English filmmaker still uses the shaky cam excessively, but because the editing is phenomenal, the shots hold long enough that you can actually tell what's going on. Greengrass got the best out of his cast as well. Damon excels as Bourne, Allen is amazing as usual (she should get an Oscar like, now!), Stiles finally gets to do something other than listening to her earpiece, and Strathairn is good, but somehow underused.So, I'd definitely recommend seeing The Bourne Ultimatum. It's a fitting end to an amazing trilogy, and it's one of (if not) the best films of the year",9,1,2,20 August 2007
Batman Begins," Chris Nolan, Chris Nolan, (out)does everything Sam Raimi can
","Batman has always been my favorite comic book hero. I remember watching Batman tens of times, being scared a lot by the Penguin in Batman Returns ( I was 10 years old when it came out ), loving the action sequences of Batman Forever, and then Batman & Robin was released, and as you already know it was of the worst movies ever made. After Batman & Robin, I lost any hope of seeing another Batman movie.So I was surprised to know that they were making another Batman movie. I was equally surprised by the talents attached to the movie in front of and behind the camera. I thought 'this movie might be half as good as the Spiderman movies'. The Spiderman movies were in my opinion the best comic movies ever made, and that totally changed when I saw Batman Begins.First things first, Batman Begins is not a sequel nor a prequel to the old Batman movies. It assumes the old movies never happened. It re-tells the story of Bruce Wayne in a whole different way. It begins by Bruce Wayne as a kid, how his fear of bats began, how his parents died, the reasons of his anger, etc.This movie is quite the opposite of the old movies. One of the main problems of the original series is that too much attention and screen time were given to the villains, Robin & Batgirl, and as a result Batman was almost a secondary character. That's not the case here. The character of Bruce Wayne is the main focus here, I can even say that Scarecrow needed to be shown a little bit more.Batman Begins is very dark, which brings it closer to the spirit of the comic books. This movie is definitely not for children. Some of the scenes with Scarecrow are scarier that any horror movie released this year.Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne / Batman. I liked the way he changed his voice when he was Batman to scare his enemies more. The supporting cast ( with the exception of Katie Holmes, which wasn't given much to do anyway ), were as good as Bale, especially Morgan Freeman & Micheal Caine.I definitely think Chris Nolan is the reason why the movie is so good. Instead of making Batman Begins a dumb action movie, he created a character movie, with some action scenes here and there. I've read that some people didn't like the one-to-one fights because the camera was so close and shaky. I think this was Nolan's intention, as we see the fights from the point of view of the criminals. I think the first fight, where we don't see Batman at all, but instead we see the criminals thrown to the left and to the right is an instant classic.So why do I think this movie is better than the Spiderman movies? Well, as I said, because it is darker, the movie is closer to the spirit of the comics than any Spiderman movie . Box office wasn't in the mind of Chris Nolan when he made this movie. He didn't make a movie for the box office, he made the movie he wanted. There are no romantic scenes to attract the ladies, the movie is too scary for the kids, and the whole first hour is Batman-less. And as the early box office figures show, the movie is making only a fraction of the money Spiderman ( or Spiderman 2 ) made. I'm sure 10 years from now, everybody will say how Batman Begins is the best comic movie made.So, I highly recommend watching Batman Begins, and let's just all hope that this movie will be decent hit so that we could see a sequel.",10,1,2,19 June 2005
Saw II," Saw - originality + (gore * 5) + some unneeded characters + better acting + better twist = Saw II
","I guess nobody was surprised when Lions Gate announced they were making a sequel to Saw. The first part, despite being a Se7en rip-off, was the most original horror movie released in the last few years, and was a breath of fresh air to the genre. Fortunately, the second part is almost as good.This time around, we have 8 people locked in a house. They must find a way out before inhaling too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg), is the father of one of the hostages, and he only has 2 hours to save his son.The best thing about Saw was its originality. We spent the whole movie watching 2 people trying to get out of the bathroom they were locked in. Saw II tried to follow the same footsteps by having 8 people locked in a house, but obviously, the originality of the prequel is now gone. In addition, I felt there were too many characters in the house. Therefore, we didn't get to know these characters well, and so we didn't care for them. Also, I thought some of the characters in the house didn't have choices, while Saw was all about the choices we make.But these flaws aside, Saw II was better on every other level. Remember how Cary Elwes gave overacting a whole new meaning in the first part? Well, the acting is far better this time. I especially liked the performances of Wahlberg and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw). The sequel was also more shocking. Two scenes in particular will make you cringe; when one of the characters is thrown into a needles pit, and the death-mask scene. Also, the twist ending, although a part of it was somehow predictable, made much more sense this time, and is a great set-up for a third part. And finally, the film had the best opening scene of the year, and featured a great homage the Saw.So, I'd definitely recommend Saw II, it's not as good as Saw, but it will keep on the edge of your seat for the whole time.",8,0,0,21 February 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I, Tim Burton, have decided to let moviegoers once again into my magical world
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a movie with great visuals, a good message, good performances, funny scenes, but it also had some minor flaws.CatCF tells the story of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), a poor boy who (along with 4 other kids) wins a tour through the biggest chocolate factory in the world, owned by the weird Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp).I haven't seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), so I can't comment on the similarities and the differences between the two movies, But I've read the book 3 times, and I can assure you the movie is pretty close to the book.Tim Burton is at his visual best. Each set is as magnificent as the one before it. I really liked the chocolate waterfall, the inventing & television rooms, and the elevator. Burton also succeeded in telling a good story. Sure, the movie is based on one of the best books ever written, but Burton also had his touches like the flashbacks and the trademark dark humor.Freddie Highmore was great as Charlie. He was totally convincing as the poor boy. You could really feel his sadness when he didn't win the golden ticket in the beginning of the movie. David Kelly, who played Charlie's grandfather was just as good. I'm afraid the same thing can't be said about Johnny Depp. Don't get me wrong, Depp gave a good performance, but as a great fan of him, I was expecting more.As I said, the movie had some minor flaws. I felt we should have seen more interaction between the 5 kids,they barely spoke to each other during the movie. Also, the songs performed by The Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy) were fun to watch the first couple of times, but after that, they became somewhat boring and predictable. Anyway, you always had the eye-candy to look at during these songs.So, I'd recommend CatCF, it's one of the best movies of the year.",9,1,3,1 September 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Beauty and Boredom
","Pride and Prejudice isn't a bad film by any means. The thing is, I don't think it deserves all the praise it's been getting since its release in November.Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's most famous novel, and is mainly about the love/hate relationship between poor girl Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and rich man Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden). The story is set in Georgian England. As far as I'm concerned, this is at least the 4th of 5th film based on the novel. There was even a Bollywood musical adaptation released in 2004. So, was director Joe Wright and co. able to bring something new to the table? Overall, I'd say yes. First things first, the film is extremely beautiful to look at. Whether it's the fields, the small houses, or the large ballrooms, they all look amazing. Wright shined in the ball scenes. Despite the huge number of people, he handled it very well. His camera (or scanner, I must say) moved smoothly from one character to another, and he rarely cut. And not to mention, the dances were well choreographed. I also really liked the score; it was very heartwarming and very fitting.The acting was very good too. Knightley gave a great performance, and her Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Just look at her eyes during Mr. Darcy's first proposal. You could really feel her pain and vulnerability. Macfayden was good, and Judi Dench was great as Catherine de Bourg, although I felt she was criminally underused (2 scenes in the whole film).And unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. The film makers had to fit a 4-hour story into a 2-hour film, so a lot of stuff had to be chopped. As a result, all the secondary characters almost had no screen time. For example, Mr. Wickham gets only 2 scenes, and Mary Bennett gets about 10 lines. So, whenever Elizabeth and/or Darcy were not on screen, I was bored to death, because frankly, I couldn't care less about the other characters in the film. They were as bland as it gets.Another thing I hated was all the 'stalking' scenes. In several scenes of the film, we see Darcy in the background, quietly staring at Elizabeth. Yeah, I know his pride and shyness prevented him from talking to her, but for some reason, I felt these scenes belong to a horror movie or something. One scene in particular had me laughing (unintentionally of course); When Elizabeth bumps into someone (we couldn't see who he is), and then the camera moves up to show us Darcy's face, looking down on her, I thought he was going to grab a knife and cut her throat or something. That scene was during the 'hate' part of their relationship, so it would have made sense, heh.So, I'd recommend watching Pride and Prejudice, but I'd suggest lowering your expectations. Or even better, I'd suggest seeing other Working Title films like Love Actually, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and I think you'll have a better time. I know I did.",6,3,6,13 May 2006
The Descent," In caves, no one can hear you scream
","While The Descent is not as original as 2004's Shaun of the Dead, it's still a breath of fresh air to the genre, and another reason for me to like the British horror even more.The Descent tells the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), a mother who loses her her husband and daughter in a car accident. One year later, she goes with 5 other friends on a caving expedition that goes horribly wrong.Surprisingly, the thing I liked most about The Descent was its story. The film only has six characters, and each one of those is essential to the story. They're not there just to be killed. We have the grieving mother, the supporting friend, the suspicious friend, the doctor, her older caring sister, and the adventurous newbie. Another great thing was the direction the story took in the second half of the film. In 99% of the horror films made these days, there's an inevitable teaming-up between the characters to escape the trouble they were sunk into. That's not the case with The Descent. In The Descent, the characters don't trust each other, deceive each other, and they even start hurting each near the end of the film.The setting of the film is very creepy, and very reminiscent of horror classics Alien and Aliens. Director and writer Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) kept building and building the tension in the first half, and fortunately the second half really paid-off. When the chaos started, I could even hear my own heartbeat.After seeing the film, I read a long debate on these boards regarding the film's end. It seems there are 2 endings for The Descent. The film's original ending, and a new 'happy' Hollywood ending for the American version of the film. I've seen the original, and while I wouldn't exactly call it a feel-good ending, I still think it's a perfect one. It makes The Descent much more than a horror film. It makes it a redemption tale.The Descent wasn't flawless. You could predict who's going to die 15 minutes into the film. You might even be able to predict the order of the deaths. Also, there were a lot of cheap jump scares we've a thousand times before. But, on the other hand, the acting, sets, and music were all very good.So, bottom line, do yourself a favor, and go watch he Descent.",8,1,3,28 March 2006
The Happening," The Pre-Release Negative Buzz was Deserved. Sorta.
","I never understood why critics (and audiences) were so hard on M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly believe that Lady in the Water and The Village are his best films (sue me!). That's why I overlooked The Happening's negative buzz, and went to see it on its opening day. To my surprise, critics were right (for the most part), and Shyamalan has disappointed me for the first time.The idea of an airborne toxic that causes people to unconsciously hurt themselves is genuinely original, creepy, and effective. Fittingly, Shyamalan comes up with the scariest death scenes in recent memory. My fiancée had to cover her eyes multiple times. Moreover, The Happening has a couple of excellent jump scares. Needless to say, Shyamalan is still excellent at composing his scenes. And as usual, James Newton Howard's score rocks. Unfortunately, that's were the good news ends.The very first scene of The Happening puts you right in the middle of the action. But that's probably why the film runs out of steam so quickly. This should've been a 75-80 minute film. Basically, nothing happens in the second half. We're just introduced to a couple of freaky, freaky characters. Mrs. Jones in particular did get huge laughs at my showing. And BTW, I was perfectly fine with the explanation the film came up with. After all, this is a super-natural thriller.Shyamalan was always able to get excellent performances out of his leads. I'd even say that's his trademark. However, Mark Wahlberg totally lets him down. He was terrible. He has same look on his face whether he's scared, joking, or thinking. The tone of his voice rarely changed as well. His turn single-handedly eliminates the emotional impact of a lot of scenes. Remember Lady in the Water's Healing scene? I cried like a baby when I saw that. The Happening has a similar 'redemption' scene, but frankly, I couldn't care less. Deschanel was even worse. She was just standing there, reciting her lines. She got better near the end though.",6,50,109,11 June 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," I Never Cried Happy Tears After Watching Movies, Until I Saw The Shawshank Redemption
","For quite some time, I've been hearing how good The Shawshank Redemption is. But Unfortunately, I never got the chance to see it. After seeing it last week, I can safely say that the movie lives to the hype, it even exceeds it.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), a hotshot banker who's convicted of murdering his wife and his lover, and who's sent to jail. In the prison, Andy meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ), a ' man who knows how to get things '. And a friendship begins between them.There are many great aspects about the movie. I'll begin with the most obvious one, the uplifting tone. When The Shawshank Redemption ended, I was so happy I cried happy tears, I was never happier after watching a movie.The story of the movie is so simple, yet it's very touching and effective. We spend almost half the movie watching 2 men ( Andy & Red ), talking and walking in the prison yard. Slowly we get to know them better, and in the meantime absolutely fall in love with them. I think friendship was never portrayed better in movies.One of the best things about the movie is the acting. Morgan Freeman was never better in my opinion, Tim Robbins gave a very good performance, but I think he was better in The Player, and the supporting cast ( Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows ) was pretty good too.Frank Darabont's directing is flawless. He was able to make us believe we're watching a real prison, helped in that by the great cinematography. He excelled in creating the right mood for both the uplifting scenes ( the opera scene, the library scenes ) and the depressing scenes ( the scenes with Brooks, and the rape scene ). It seems Darabont is at his best when he's making movies set in prisons, as evidenced by The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. When he tried to change that in The Majestic, the results were so-so.So, I definitely recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption, if you haven't watched it already. This is truly one of the best movies ever made.",10,1,1,19 July 2005
The Queen," The Best and Most Entertaining History Lesson of the Year
","'You met me at a very strange time in my life', The Narrator, from Fight Club (1999).Just like The Narrator, we meet Elizabeth II, Queen of England, at a very strange time in her life. The film starts in May of 1997. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), leader of the Labour Party, had just won the general election, ending 18 years of government by the Conservative Party. 3 months later, Diana, Princess of Wales, died after a car crash in Paris. Initially, The Queen (Oscar winner Helen Mirren) wanted the funeral to be a private one, since Diana was no longer part of the royal family. She also thought there was no need to address the nation regarding this event. But slowly, The Queen starts to realize people from all over the world are accusing her of not showing enough grief over Diana's death. If that wasn't enough, she later finds out 25% of the British people want to get rid of the monarchy altogether. For the first time in her life, The Queen, who had always thought nobody knows the British citizens more than she does, feels she has completely lost touch with her people. Some radical changes had to be made.Unlike what you might expect, The Queen is not a boring history lesson. In fact, I thought it was very entertaining. That was mainly due to Peter Morgan's (Last King of Scotland) great script, and the amazing directing done by Stephen Frears (High Fidelity).The script is very witty, full of emotional moments, and often darkly funny. I guess nobody will ever know what really happened behind the scenes in the week following Diana's death, but I think Morgan tried to make the story as accurate as possible. Also, I liked the film's main theme, tradition vs. modernism, and thought it was quite relevant. Morgan even had the courage to take some stabs at Diana (apparently, how she was an attention-seeking drama queen).Frears did a great job. He created a fascinating portrayal of the royal family after the tragedy. The only minor problem I had was with Prince Philip. I felt he was a little too cartoonish. The use of real-life footage and integrating characters from the film into them was a masterful decision. It made the film much more real. The film never drags, and is almost always beautiful to look at.Now, we come to the million-dollar question. Did Helen Mirren deserve winning every single female acting award this year? Well, the answer is pretty simple, and is a big fat YES. She gave a controlled and multi-layered performance. What's even more impressive is that there were no 'big' acting scenes, Mirren was much more subtle than your typical Oscar winner. I also have to note that Sheen was excellent as the young, enthusiastic, prime minister.So, I'd definitely recommend seeing The Queen. It's an entertaining, well made, Oscar winning film. It's about one of the biggest tragedies of recent times, and it has some of the best performances of the past year. What more could you ask for?",9,3,5,22 March 2007
La Vie En Rose," La Vie En Noir?
","Musical biopics are a dime a dozen these days; Ray in 2004, Walk the Line in '05, Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man in '06, and finally, La Vie En Rose in '07. However, La Vie En Rose, which chronicles the life of French singing legend Edith Piaf, is not your typical biography. Trying to put a spin on the genre, director Olivier Dahan decided to present Piaf's life via a broken chronology, leaping back and forth across time without apparent rhyme or reason. I felt that decision was both a gift and a curse. Yes, it did add some originality to the whole thing, but then again, it's hard to be invested in a storyline that jumps around so much. In addition, I thought half the actors were overacting (Raymond, Piaf's music instructor comes to mind). Rose is also too melodramatic, and extremely depressing. In fact, La Vie en Noir would've been a more fitting title. Nevertheless, I'd still recommend watching this flick. Academy award winner Cotillard, who completely transformed herself into Piaf, injects so much life, energy and passion into her character that she elevates the film to another level. Her performance literally sent shivers down my spine. The make-up was phenomenal as well, and the Oscar win is totally deserved.",7,2,5,18 March 2008
Munich," Everyone's Looking for A Place to Call Home
","I had many doubts when I knew Spielberg was making a movie about what happened in the 1972 Munich Olympics. The subject matter is controversial, the middle east conflict is not solved yet, and I felt the project was rushed, as Spielberg began shooting the picture only 6 months before it was released. Anyway, after seeing the film, I'm happy to say that Spielberg has proved me wrong.Munich tells the story of a secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and kill 11 Palestinians suspected to have planned the Munich attack. The squad is lead by Avner (Eric Bana, in an amazing performance). At first, Avner is excited about the mission, because his bosses and his mother kept telling him he's doing a great thing for Israel. But slowly, he starts losing his sanity (spends his nights looking for bombs under his bed), his friends (3 of his teammates are killed during the mission), his home (he tells his wife to move to Brooklyn so he could see her more), and most importantly, his humanity (during the last assassination, he enjoyed humiliating the victim).The last assassination in particular was a wake-up call for Avner. He's discovered that he's not only wandering away from the planned mission, as the last 2 people he killed had nothing to do with what happened in Munich, but he also realized that no matter how many Palestinians he kills, these people will be replaced, and in most cases, the replacements are even more violent than the predecessors.That was one of the few problems I had with the film. I thought someone like Avner, so terrified during the first assassination, that one of his teammates had to pull the trigger instead of him, would start questioning what he's doing earlier than what happened in the picture. In the film, he started doubting his mission after the 8th assassination. Another flaw would be some cheesy scenes. For example, during one part in the movie, the Isreali squad have to share a room with some Jordanian bodyguards. They almost have a fight over what music to play; Arabian or Israeli, anyway, they agree on playing some American jazz, and everyone in the room starts laughing. I know this was supposed to be a metaphor, but I thought it was a bit silly.These minor flaws aside, the film is fantastic. I really liked Spielberg's portrayal of the Palestinians. They're not the bearded, stupid guys maniacally shouting 'Allah Akbar' we've seen in tens of movies before. No, Spielberg's Palestinians are lawyers, teachers, poets, and family men. The same can be said about Avner. He's a loving husband who cried when he spoke to his newborn on the phone. Yet, you will fully understand why these supposedly ordinary characters would start killing other people. They're all fighting for a justified reason; All the characters in Munich are looking for a place to call home. I also liked how the film didn't present a solution to the problem, and frankly, there's no solution for the middle east conflict right now. Unfortunately, this circle of violence will keep growing bigger and bigger.Technically speaking, the film is very good. I thought it was one of the best films to portray the 70's. From the sets, to the costumes, to the haircuts, even to the grainy picture, everything is pitch perfect. The assassinations were well executed, shocking, and very violent (beware, this is a hard R). And although the film is 160 minutes, I was not bored for one second. John Williams' score is amazing, and I'm not surprised it was nominated for an academy award.So, I'd recommend Munich. It's Spielberg's prayer for peace, and it's a well made one.",8,1,2,15 March 2006
300," The Critic and the Geek
","Every film is made for a reason. Some films are made to entertain, others to educate. I'm sure Zack Snyder (the excellent Dawn of the Dead remake) had one thing on his mind when he was making 300; create the most faithful comic book movie yet. Sin City, another film based on a Frank Miller comic book that was shot using bluescreens, was criticized for being 'style over substance'. 300 takes that concept to the next level. In 300, the style is the substance. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book. In fact, some shots are lifted directly from the graphic novel (the scene where the Spartans push their enemies off a cliff comes to mind). Needless to say, the film, which tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae between 300 Spartans and (estimated) 1 million Persians, is extremely beautiful to look at. Imagine visiting Le Louvre and you're pretty close. Every single frame is like a painting.Some people have been talking about how the action genre is dead. 300 proves them wrong. Basically, the second half is one massive fight, with limbs flying, heads spinning, and blood splattering across the frame. As you might expect, the film is pretty violent, so if you're a parent, you might want to leave the kids at home. Snyder shines in those action scenes. He has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. Slow mos, fast forwarding, zooming, and rapid-fire cuts are all used to perfection. And hats off to whoever choreographed the fights. They were poetic.With the visuals being at the top of the filmmakers' agenda, characterization had to take a back seat. All the characters are either black (evil) or white (good), with no shades of grey whatsoever (believe it or not, the most complex character is Ephialtes the hunchback, who has about 5 minutes of screen time). Take Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler, in a decent performance) and his army for instance. They spend their whole screen time kicking butts, delivering big speeches and uttering cool lines. OK, so they're fearless and heroic. What else do we know about them? Zip. None. We barely know them, so they don't earn our sympathy. Remember how you were emotionally invested in characters like William Wallace (Braveheart) and Maximus (Gladiator)? I'm fairly confident you won't feel the same way here. Also in some scenes, the film was way too weird for its own good. I mean, I doubt we'll be seeing a man-goat rocking out in any other film this year.I really don't know how to grade 300. The geek in me, who has seen the film 3 times so far and has a giant 300 poster hanging down his wall, wants to give it a 10. On the other hand, the 'critic', who rates films based on plot and characters and whatnot, wants to give it 4 or something. So, I guess my grade should be somewhere in between",7,1,4,22 April 2007
The Island," An island of ideas that was deserted in the second half
","The Island is a movie that showed a lot of potential in its first hour, but unfortunately, it fell apart after that when it turned into another popcorn summer action flick.The story of The Island happens in the near future. The entire earth has been contaminated. The people who survived the contamination now live in a Utopian facility. Their only goal in life is to win the lottery, because the winner gets the chance to live the rest of his life in the island, the only place on earth that was not contaminated. The 2 halves of The Island are like 2 separate movies. The first half is a thought provoking sci-fi. It raises a lot of intriguing questions like 'How clones should be treated, as products or as human beings?' & 'Is there a paradise (an island) for the believers (the ones who win the lottery)?' Unfortunately, the second half was your typical Michael Bay movie, so you know what to expect: big explosions, car chases, quick cuts, and loud music. That half wasn't bad by any means, but the problem is that the first half was so much better that the second half felt worse than it really is. Also, there was little originality in that half, unlike the first one. The Island had a big cast, but the majority of the actors had almost nothing to do. Michael Clarke Duncan & Steve Buscemi were on-screen for about 15 minutes, and Djimon Hounson did nothing but shout phrases like 'You can't let them get away, You have to catch them, Etc'. Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean gave good performances, but I was let down by the performance of Scarlett Johansson. Considering her talents and her past work, I expected much more from her.I have to say that Michael Bay did a good job in directing The Island. The sets were great, the pacing was generally good, and for the first time in his career, he directed a movie that will make the viewers think during and after watching it. Anyway, I think the special effects looked fake in the aerial pursuit scene, and I think the car chase scene was worse than the one Bay has made in Bad Boys 2. So I'd recommend watching The Island. Sure, it could have been a much better movie, but in the end, it's still a movie that will make you think and keep you entertained at the same time.",7,0,0,2 September 2005
