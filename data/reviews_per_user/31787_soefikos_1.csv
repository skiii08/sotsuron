Ali," is M. Ali as idiot as that?
","this film was a big disappointment, it made Ali look like a real simple-minded guy. Example: he didn't go to the army because they drafted him as Cassius Clay? I am sure it was not like that. But the film really makes him look like someone who just obsessed with a couple of thins and was just too stubborn or simply too idiot to let go. There are a couple of interesting scenes in the film, and the matches are interestingly filmed, but otherwise this is a really long, really slow movie that wants to say a lot about a lot and finally manages to pass its hero as the village idiot. Will Smith did a good job in gaining weight, but finally it's still Will Smith with a funny voice. Not that he didn't try - but he has too strong a personality himself, he's too known to convince as Ali. It is a real pitty, I am sure the film does not do honour to Mr Ali. Even if he is as extravagant a personnality, he cannot be as stupid!",4,0,0,15 March 2002
