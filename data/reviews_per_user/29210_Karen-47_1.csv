The Blair Witch Project," answer to poll question
","I chose The Blair Witch Project as the answer to the 5/23/00 daily poll question of what the worst movie to watch before a camping trip would be. However, I believe that The Blair Witch Project would be the worst movie to watch before breathing!  I can't understand how anyone was terrified by this movie.  The premise was good, and I can understand how a similar situation could be truly frightening.  But what truly terrified me was that with an investment of way under $100,000, the movie has made multi-millions of dollars.  Even walking in circles in Maryland, you'll come out somewhere that you'd recognize as civilization.  I found it very unrealistic and tedious, and it did not stimulate my imagination except to imagine life when the movie ended.",Null,1,1,23 May 2000
