The Devil's Advocate," not flawless but should be seen
","First thing to be said about this movie is that it doesn't deserve a 7.3. The beginnings of the film may even be considered as boring and court scenes are ordinarily impressive, the quality of attorney defenses that we can see in any other movie. When I was getting bored, Al Pacino came. He just keeps the movie one step ahead only with his talking. He was very impressive, also the quotations that was made throughout the movie was a great taste of this movie. Both John Milton and Kevin Lomax characters are perfectly described and played by Pacino&Reeves. Charlize Theron was quite a success, too. In the scenes she go nuts, which she does a couple times in movie, I couldn't expect more from her. The ending was somehow expected, he would give up, yes, and if he would just die there, that would not be the happy end. He just went back and started over, that part was 'too happy', it didn't have to end that well. Overall, the movie is over standards, and at least should be watched for Al Pacino's great performance. I'd give a nine, but I think it deserves more like 8.3, so it's a 8/10.",8,1,2,17 December 2009
