E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," His Magnum Opus
","Call him the Great Manipulator, I really couldn't care less. Sitting in that cinema, aged six, and seeing how everybody, young and old, was so deeply affected by this tale of universal friendship, well, I never saw anything like it again.It always amazes me that so many diss this movie, saying they got 'sucked in it' as a kid or that it's dated, pointing at the Atari/BMX/Star Wars figures etc. Why, that would make a fifties film dated because there's no cell phones and TV-remotes. Or hating the message of the film so much that they start attacking its technical merits. That's just beyond me. The direction of children is a most difficult thing and Spielberg pulls it off superbly. Cinematography is top notch, giving us the best signature shot of all time. The score, the effects and Rambaldi's creation deserve the highest marks.
In this day and age it's more cool to rate cynical, dark movies as personal favorites, claiming that they are more real and poignant. Great, raise your kids with showings of 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Scarface' for all I care.",10,2,4,9 September 2001
The Fifth Element," Sci-Fi European Style
","Bruce Willis in Jean-Paul Gaultier outfit saving the universe and life as we know it from an undisclosed evil that has teamed up with over-the-top madman Zorg 'I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED !!', played with gusto by Gary Oldman. How??? Who cares in a world designed by the imagination of Besson, acclaimed anime artist Moebius and JPG. Needless to say, it's style over substance here. But with great attention to detail, check out the filter on the cigarette that Bruce smokes in the beginning of the film.Not for everyone though, but put your mind on 'dim' before you watch this film and you'll have a great time. In a way it's like that other Willis vehicle, 'Hudson Hawk', don't take it too serious -do not rationalize the gaps in the plot- just enjoy a weird and wonderful world. If only Besson would have considered to take Jean Reno for the lead...",10,0,1,16 September 2001
Snatch," too smart for its own sake
","Same as with Lock, Stock and whatever, really. Guy Ritchie, an o.k. director at best, should pick a decent screenwriter for his next project to tone things down a bit. Way too many crossing story-lines, OTT characters and each and every line has to be smart and smug but strangely none of them are genuinely funny or clever, in short OVERKILL. Being rude and spouting profanities doesn't make it funny in itself, although Roy 'Chubby' Brown would disagree on that one.The British think they have a Tarantino on their hands, but that just proves a cliche about the British and their tendency of overrating themselves.Horrible stuff, watch Pulp Fiction instead.",1,16,53,18 September 2001
The Thing," Strange things are happening on the South Pole
","It all started when a husky ran into the U.S. research base in Antarctica, pursued and being shot at by some Norwegians who don't live to tell why exactly they were hurling grenades from a heli at the poor mutt. Further investigation reveals that something really spooky has taken place in the Norwegian base. No survivors again, only burnt remains, in indistinguishable shapes. Meanwhile, the husky has found a new home in the U.S. base.We see about a dozen guys working there, scientists mostly, among them heli-pilot MacReady, played by Kurt Russell. The dog in the meantime is walking around, sniffing, doing the stuff that dogs basically do before it's put in the kennel with the others. Although it's difficult to see through the darkness it turns out that we're not dealing with a dog at all. No, it's some bizarre creature that shoots tentacles to try and grab the other dogs.....and emulate them!Turns out a spacecraft of some sort has landed in Antarctica thousands of years ago and the Norwegians have accidentally dug it up, waking an occupant who was probably not in the best of moods. Stealth is its weapon, taking over any creature when it sees the chance and then getting rid of the original. Question now, has the dog infected any of the humans? Who is real, and who is a copy? Further bummer: you're in the most inhospitable environment on Earth and a storm is closing in. Escape is impossible.Paranoia ensues, protagonist MacReady doesn't know who to trust and tries to come up with a way of discovering who's who, getting sleepier and sleepier in the process. No one to trust. Is it Blair who destroyed the generators and radio so the creature cannot escape to the civilized world, thus isolating the group completely. Or is it short-fused Childs, who wants to shoot and ask questions later. What about the guy responsible for the pack of huskies? He was near that kennel for an awful long time, just by himself. And who's that guy running around outside in the dead of night? No creature from this Earth can survive in those temperatures...So the story unfolds, accompanied by an eerie Ennio Morricone soundtrack in the background. Special mention must go to effects, that set a new standard for 'gore' in 1982. The performances are all fine, the direction never slips and those that haven't seen it are lucky, for they can guess and guess. Especially when MacReady finally figures out how to smoke out 'The Thing', in one of the most suspenseful scenes of all time.Critically axed at its release, now critically acclaimed and rightly so. Carpenter mused: 'no one is ever going to see something like this again', and he was correct. This is a one-of-a-kind, the best horror/sci-fi ever made.    BTW, as far as I know, this is the only movie that doesn't have any women in it (not that I have something against women).",10,0,1,18 September 2001
JFK," Best LONG movie of all time
","Really, it's not about whether you believe in Stone's theory or not, you have to admit that this is one amazing work. Clocking in at almost 3 hours running time, no problemo, it virtually whizzes by in a kaleidoscope of images, color, B&W, old news reels and fast editing. An all-star cast with some memorable performances, notably by Gary Oldman as 'patsy' Oswald, Jay O. Sanders and Michael Rooker as Garrison's aids and the always impeccable Joe Pesci. A special mention must go to Kevin Costner who delivers his best achievement to date.Stone's best work, although he didn't get an Oscar for this one, maybe because he had already won twice in previous years, for 'Wall Street' and 'Platoon'. The way in which he recreates that fateful day in Dallas, TX, deserve the highest marks.It's amazing the way this movie got attacked in the U.S media upon its release, proving that - well, I don't want to get into conspiracies here, who knows who's keeping a tab on the internet...And the message still stands firm: be wary of your institutions!!!",10,3,15,14 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well...
","Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy TTT, but it is nowhere near 'The greatest flick of all time' as some have perceived it to be. Here's why.Why does it have to clock in at three hours plus? It's difficult to keep this guy enthused for what's, and let us be frank here, basically an action movie within a fantasy setting. Action scene after action scene and very  s l o w  bits in the middle disguised at character building. Even the climactic Battle at Helm's Deep, although finely executed, felt overlong in my book, a prime example of more being less. Films like Traffic and Magnolia require a three hour running time because these are complex character driven stories. TTT does not.Why non-fantasy buffs are looking forward to the four hour DVD extravaganza baffles me.The whole interweaving of plotlines that culminate in a grand finale, read: Star Wars,type of storytelling that is so pervasive in movies these days defies logic in this one. Are we to believe that Merry and Pippin are hopping along on this three for what must be a week? Come to think of it, Merry and Pippin were as pointless in the film as they were in the books. Nothing to do but to sit on Treebeard and express but one emotion, the 'wide-eyed look of amazement'.The Romance. One word. Forced. In there to keep the chicks happy too. And if Aragorn doesn't have enough troubles on his mind, why with fighting an assorted lot of Uruk-Hai, Wargs and Trolls and all, we just throw in an extra love-element for good measure. And finally, the film reeks of self-importance. That's why the Indiana Jones Trilogy is miles above LOTR in my book. Jones acknowledges that it's entertainment. It's doesn't take itself too serious. It winks at the audience saying ' Come on, we're entertaining you so don't bemoan the flaws and errors in logic' and as a result you don't. This baby has *art* smeared all over it's smug face. Well it's not art, it's longhaired guys battling guys in rubber masks.",Null,0,0,18 January 2003
The Matrix," Hmmmmm....
","I'm not sure if this movie will be regarded as favorably in ten years time as it is now. Maybe future reviewers will laugh at the crude 'bullet-time' effects, snigger at the blatant product placement of archaic cellphones, yawn at the reluctant-hero-facing-an-overpowerful-enemy theme, dismiss the philosophizing on reality as a forced attempt by second grader and scratch their heads thinking how Reeves could go from this to his Oscar winning spree five years later...But for now it stands as a guilty pleasure, for me at least.And on a further note, can't the Matrix just be seen as life in general, instead of this computer controlled system. Is the Matrix not really about the limitations that we put on ourselves, inhibiting to live life to the fullest. A dreary job behind a desk, consuming, and acting out the role that society has mapped out for us etc. that stand in the way of fully experiencing the wonders of this world, or as Trinity puts it: 'You know where that roads leads to, Neo. You know exactly where it ends. And I know that you don't want to be there.' Or something like that",10,0,0,20 September 2001
Contact," Great flick
","But one question remains. Already accepting that the findings of the science team could be suppressed by Katz (and Angela Basset's character doing nothing about this), why didn't Ellie just suggest firing up The Machine one more time to see if that passenger would corroborate her story? Okay, one more question. We see Bill Clinton in power when The Message is first discovered. The man is still in power when Ellie takes the trip through The Machine. So i figure only a short time passed between these two events, at least not more than a few years (unless Bill found a loop in the U.S. Constitution). So are we to believe that humanity was able to figure out all this new science packed in the message and build a trillion dollar machine in such a short time? That's quite a leap. To compare, at my work it takes about four years for the paperwork to go through in order to get a new copier.But apart from that, this is a truly humane and thought-provoking movie. I only wish Hollywood could make more of these.",10,0,2,21 October 2005
