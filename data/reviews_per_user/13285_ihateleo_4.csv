Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite Good
","This review may contain spoilers. First of all let me say that I have never paid any attention to critics and I always form my opinion on simply watching something firsthand.I saw this film when it first opened and I saw it five times after.The criticism that this film gets is very unjust and wrong.This film perfectly sets up the Star Wars story and introduces us to some of the characters that we have known for years.For instance Anakin Skywalker is introduced and completely fleshed out, i personally think that making Anakin a very kind and good natured boy was an interesting and well thought out idea, not to mention the fair performance delivered by Jake Lloyd.I may also add that some of the sequences in this movie are extremely well done and artistic (the shots of Naboo are beautiful)and the direction is magnificent, Lucas relies on well paced shots as compared to the shaky all over the place camera work of LOTR.And on to Jar-Jar Binks, I have always loved the character and I feel that his addition to the story really helps to move the plot and basically allows the queen to re-claim Naboo from the Trade Federation.There is absolutely nothing wrong with Jar-Jar or any character from this movie for that matter.And to talk about underrated, Liam Neeson gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a film, his grace and powerful presence really heightens this amazing film.I also know many other people who enjoy and appreciate this film.How this film's rating is so low baffles me, i truly feel that this and Episode 2 are unmatched by anything that has been released in recent years.This is true cinematic genius.The duel at the end of this film is one of the most exciting action scenes i have ever witnessed and the music is absolutely incredible.This film is packed with drama and rich storytelling techniques.Dont let disgruntled anti-Lucas idiots ruin this experience for you.This movie is unique and extremely entertaining.The force is very strong with this one.10/10",10,3,6,23 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Very excellent!
","It seems to be quite popular and 'trendy' to label the Star Wars prequels as bad or inferior movies.Lets also think about today's movie-going public..people who enjoy such films as LOTR and Spider-Man.People say these films contain bad acting, that makes me want to laugh out loud.Nearly every performance in this wonderful film was either good or superb.And this film actually had 'gasp' characters you could care about unlike overrated, second-rate fodder such as LOTR and its sequel.Lets not forget the brilliant score that embodied much emotion and feeling just like any great Star Wars film should.My hat is off to George Lucas and John Williams for nearly making me cry in one wonderful scene, just before Anakin and Padme are about to be sentenced to death in the arena.Scenes like that had way more power and emotion than any sub-par sequence in LOTR.The direction was also very good, as well as the FX.This film has all the magic that made you love Star Wars as a kid.The Yoda/Dooku fight was one of the most thrilling and jaw dropping scenes ever witnessed in a motion-picture.I do not pay attention to pathetic reviewers who simply can not understand or give credit to a film that truly deserves it.Anyone that would say The Phantom menace or Attack of The Clones has no plot must be the biggest brain-dead, Ben Affleck fan in the world. This film is awesome, nothing will change my opinion.Thank you George and all of your talented cast and crew.When Episode 3 is released it will finally bring us the last film in this last great series.Star Wars rules forever.",10,1,1,19 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," HAHAHA!
","Man oh man was this bad,after having very high hopes for this trilogy I must say I was extremely dissapointed in every single aspect.First of all I will elaborate on why I didnt like this film (if some 'ringnut' doesnt try to attack me).Okay, first the direction was very shaky and all over the place, the close up shots were way to close up and the film seemed to go all over the place without even being comprehensible.Peter Jackson was definately not the right man for this job, lets remember that this was the man that was just barely making good cult films such as Dead Alive and Bad Taste (both of which were much better I might add).I knew this was going to be really really bad when Frodo flew in Gandolf's lap rather gay and boyishly.And the so called FX looked like a slightly more modern update of the ones that were used in Spawn.Must be New Line Cinema..anyone knows how awful this company's track record has been.I truly am surprised that this film is ranked up there with the greats when it doesnt even come close to being as good as say Big Trouble In Little China.I guess it just goes to show how ignorant our movie-going public is today and how easily led they are.This movie is like a pretty picture with absolutely no substance.I was actually wanting all of the Hobbit's to get killed because they annoyed me so badly.Which reminds me, how can anyone in their right mind take Sean 'Encino Man' Astin seriously?Every time I saw his awful presence on the screen I was looking for Pauly Shore to come running up beside him.Pauly Shore would have actually not hurt this film at all.This movie was also way too long, 40 minutes into this disaster I had no idea where i was or where the film was going.And the ending was just laughably bad, considering Hobbit's are very short their arm's extended about 30 feet under the water for a very cheesy rescue.I could go on and on about how much this sucked and I am not doing this for attention or to be different.I know others who think the same way.This film embodies awful.The editing and the direction was very sloppy, an amateur film maker could have done a much better job.This convinces me that Peter Jackson sucks.Goodbye",1,1,4,19 December 2002
Jurassic Park," Still As Relevant As Ever.(May Contain Spoilers)
","The first film to modernize and embellish digital fx, Jurassic Park was ahead of its time and is still a revered film.A Paleoentologist and a Paleobotanist are given the opportunity to embark with an eccentric visionary to a one of a kind island to give an endorsement. With the discovery of Mr. Hammond's fantastical new dream made a bold reality, things go awry when a sabotage occurs and the prehistoric beasts run amok restoring them to their primal state.The point being that nothing can contain that which is inherently wild, therefore teaching arrogant men not to tamper with nature's delicate balance. While it may be disguised as a 'summer blockbuster' what lies within Jurassic Park is a testament for those willing to look.It makes its point with plenty of action and terrific visuals to boast.Watch for Richard Attenborough's poetic speech about the illusion of creation and control.The juxtaposition of man and dinosaur being a scathing parable for all that would wish to create something as defiant and new as Hammond's genetic monstrosities.Both beautiful and frightful, the dinosaurs serve as a warning for mankind to know his balance.With a perfect cast and a truly original story, the film never feels tired or redundant.Spielberg has not made a film of this caliber since.",9,2,3,8 November 2005
