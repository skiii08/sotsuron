Iron Man 3," A great action movie Disappointing Iron Man Movie
","After seeing Iron Man 3 twice that's start by saying if this movie wasn't labeled as an Iron Man movie (And didn't have the suits too) it would be a fantastic action movie but it is an Iron Man movie so it has expectations some of them Iron Man 3 delivers but some of them it just does not. The first act of Iron Man 3 is fantastic it funny, smart, action packed and just works but sadly the second act arrives now that's start with the Mandarin Kingsley knocks it out of the park but they under used the character of much. One thing the Iron Man movies is humor and this doesn't fail with that this movie has a lot. Most of the acting is fantastic like Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Robert Downey Jr. as always and Ty Simpkins as Harley you will see this kid in more movies, but there are some average acting like Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen At the end the day Iron Man 3 is good movie but doesn't have the Iron Man feel from the first two but still is a good movie. 7.5/10",7,1,5,28 April 2013
