Alien 3," Monumental ending to a saga
","Spoilers Herein Alien 3 is a fitting end to the Alien Saga. It's not on par with the great Aliens, but is at least as good as Alien, if not better. The film gets a bad rap because two loved charachters, Hicks and Newt, are killed off instantly. But this film has a lot going for it. It is smart, exciting, and it has great cinematography, as to be expected with any of the Alien movies. I was very pleased with the script. I have never seen a Hollywood movie that has had such a blatant disregard for main charachters than this one. That is a plus, especially in this day and age, where main charachters, by some miracle, always get lucky and never die. Watching this movie, for the first time, if you are able to guess who will be alive at the end...then you should win a prize.",8,1,3,16 August 2003
Ali," Great film, but leaves something to be desired
","(minor spoilers) Mann's direction of this film is superb, you can tell he put great effort into it, as nothing seems off. Great acting, especially by Peebles, and Silver in a quieter role. And Voigt's depiction of Howard Casell is right on target. The film draws you in, and keeps you truly interested. However,the film's sudden ending is unforgivable. If you are going to tell a story about Muhammamed Ali, why not do it right, and go all the way. Instead, we get a quick cut off after the Rumble in the Jungle. Still, this film is underappreciated. I give it 7/10",8,1,2,4 August 2003
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Hope for the future
","I liked the Force Awakens, but couldn't help shake the feeling that it was an imitation of Star Wars instead of the real thing. Perhaps it was because the movie re-hashed the same origin story used in A New Hope. Maybe it was because the archetypes were too familiar. Maybe it was J.J. Abrams used a creature that was supposed to challenge Yoda on the small and cute scale. For whatever reason The Force Awakens felt forced. Thankfully, Rogue One is a breath of fresh air.The world portrayed in Rogue One is morally murky. Spies, extremists, traitors are all here. Finally the rebel alliance is shown as having dirt on its hands. The movie complements A New Hope in extraordinary ways. Characters show up (many unexpected) that really tie the two films together. To those whining about not having 'memorable characters' remember, this is a one shot movie which tells a story focusing on a mission. The rousing third act did something nearly impossible.... I felt an engagement to the film that I have not felt since Return of the Jedi. The ending is one of the most satisfying of all the Star Wars movies. So yes, come for the cameos and fan service ( they won't disappoint) but stay for a risky statement film that stands on it's own. If this film is any indication where the Star Wars universe is heading than it is in good hands.",9,1,6,19 December 2016
Alien: Resurrection," Ripley How Could You?
","Why is this movie so bad? Well it isn't, unless you compare it to the ones that preceded it, then it's a real junker. What makes it different from the other Alien movies? Well, one of the great things about the Alien movies is that they were kind of intelligent. Interesting and scientific even. Pretty much throw that out the window here. Also, one thing that distinguished the other Alien movies from other 'Monster' movies were strong supporting characters. You got to see them vulnerable and scared before the creature attacked. You actually cared about them. But here there is no supporting character development, they are just pieces of meat. Characters that the under-developed script writers drag along(characters that serve no purpose), just to kill them later. You can pretty much who will be next and when it will happen. That is unforgivable. Alien Ressurection is more like a comic book than a movie, and in this case, that is the farthest thing from a compliment.",2,0,1,16 August 2003
World War Z," Against All Odds
","Severe deviation from the source material? Check. Production problems and reshoots? Check. A zombie movie with a PG-13 rating !? Check. With all these 'issues' I was ready to swear off the movie completely, but curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did because World War Z is a movie that certainly shouldn't work, yet it does.As a fan of the book (I read it 4 years ago) I went into the film knowing that the script contained a cohesive story built around one character. Certain detractors of the film may dislike it solely for this reason because it is so different from the book. I would urge them to consider them as two separate entities. Once that is accepted, the film can be a pleasant surprise.Let's be honest, in the last 5 years film has become over saturated with zombies. So the makers of this film made some wise decisions intending to set their film apart. I'll admit I'm more of a traditionalist (slow moving zombies), but I like when film makers take risks at a new approach. The fast zombies in this film often use coordinated attacks,swarming like insects and that is something to ponder as well as visually behold. The film has a breakneck pace, with intense sequences...and it really has the feel of a global epidemic since it takes place in various locales around the world. I knew I wasn't the only one in the audience on the edge of my seat, as many times during this film I heard the rest of the audience let out a collective sigh of relief. By presenting zombies as a global problem in the first stages, it is a breathe of fresh air compared to the standard 'few survivors vs thousands of undead' in a secluded fortress scenario. The film feels more like a political thriller than a zombie film, which belief me actually works to its benefit.Lastly, one gripe I have heard about the movie is a lack of character development. I agree, but I think character development would actually detract from the film. How many times in horror movies are supporting characters only there to serve the purpose of cannon fodder? Also, often times side characters are given moments to make a poignant speech before being killed off, which is a ploy by screenwriters to generate emotion from the audience. You'll see no such tricks here characters come and go, and we are often left to wonder about their fate. The film's frantic pace and lack of clich√©s really make it a surprising treat. 8/10",8,6,12,23 June 2013
Dunkirk," Poetry in Motion
","Too often, war films fit in a convenient narrative box. Take Saving Private Ryan ( a masterpiece which I love by the way). Time is taken to craft the narrative, introduce characters, etc. And nowadays we take that formula for granted. I remember the year Saving Private Ryan and altogether different war film called The Thin Red Line was released. Critics praised it, film goers loathed it. I did not like it much the first viewing either. I agreed with others that there was not enough action, many actors (such as George Clooney) had performances that barely registered. But the experience of the film stayed with me. The Thin Red Line was visual poetry, and an examination of mans duality with nature and the indifference of war.I bring this up because, in many ways, because Dunkirk is sort of a spiritual successor to The Thin Red Line without the internal philosophical monologues. Dunkirk is heart pounding and riveting. It is the most intense film I've seen in years. The dialogue is sparse, characters are too numb by the experience to bother. Character development is minimal. The film is too urgent to get caught up in such trappings when the goal is just to survive.The film is a masterpiece for those two reasons. The film is an experience and the story is Dunkirk. Even watching the film you feel the futility and insignificance of individual lives in the midst of war. It is a best picture contender that goes against the grain. What Nolan achieves here is mesmerizing and true poetry in motion.",10,4,13,25 July 2017
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Vastly Underrated
","Pitt is pitch-perfect as the larger than life Jesse James, but is out-shined by Casey Affleck in his courageous, un-nerving performance of Robert Ford. Affleck more than deserved his Academy Award nomination, and I believe he would have won if the film had been more successful. I can only surmise that those disappointed with this film expected an action-oriented shoot'em up Western, and not a brooding character piece. The films slow pace may bore some viewers, but I enjoyed it. I compare it to a cross between a Terrence Malick film and Deadwood. The film doesn't glorify the west, instead it shows it as dirty and brutal. This is definitely one of Pitt's top performances. For those interested, I also recommend Bruce Springsteen's version of the classic song (title of the film).",8,2,4,23 August 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1, All that glitters is not gold ,"Hey, the next Vin Diesel movie is out!! (yawn) These days the Hollywood machine churns out action films a dime a dozen, so what sets Kill Bill apart? Tarantino. He directs with zest, and an infectious energy that is hard to dislike. I can't really pin point it, perhaps it's his style, or uniqueness, or just plain memorable charachters...but something places him at the front of the herd. Kill Bill isn't a perfect film, but it is by all means engaging. It has an epic feel to it, The Bride is on a quest for vengenance. And at the end of volume 1, she still has a few left on her list. It takes a good part of the movie for her to finish off the first assasin, like a movie within a movie. Perhaps the best part about the end of volume 1, is it leaves something to look forward too. I can't wait till febuary.",8,0,1,12 October 2003
The Cannonball Run," Decent movie for a lazy afternoon
","This is an enjoyable movie as long as you aren't expecting much. It's got it's moments, some you'll laugh at, and some you'll shake your head at. But all in all not a bad way to spend your time on a lazy afternoon. And the director should thank Jack Elam, without him this movie would have lost over half of it's laughs.",7,0,1,3 August 2003
