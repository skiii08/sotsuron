Skyfall," Here's What Is Missing
","... and 7 is on the high side.James Bond is supposed - required - to display male mystique, idealism, escapism, vicarious experience, hoped-for cool, turn-of-phrase fun, and romping romance with the best the other gender has to offer of that release's generation - and a great watch.A lot has gone missing with the Daniel Craig incarnation ... and he's not to be blamed. Craig in 'Munich' is da bomb and presaged what he could do with the Bond role. In 'Munich' he WAS the young Bond, yet-to-become suave, in-charge, & licensed as 007.Now the franchise has gone 'real,' 'feminine feelings' & 'woundedness,' set-backs, childhood deficits, and the crazy time-warp thing - is this prequel Bond or is it today's Bond while trying to be both at once? 'Casino Royale' was OK; but it's been a meander downhill from there. It's kind of the Dalton Bond without the Wayne Newton type of fun and chicks sturdy enough to keep-up & survive all the action ... both kinds.What should Bond be? A marriage of 'Taken 1' (and that should have been QoS with Bond rescuing the Eva Green character and bringing her along for another romp, which would've been new, by the way) and Jason Statham's 'Killer Elite' shaken & stirred with 'Entrapment' - with some scenics & time-off for wide-screen romantasy & martinis.In 'Skyfall' even the watch is unworthy. It doesn't need an internal laser or cutting saw bezel ... just be cool, not middle manager dull with a Speidel Twist-o'-Flex. Bring on Breitling. What we have now is neither fish-nor-fowl. Something needs to change - perhaps even bringing back Pierce Brosnan who had most of the Bond joy- of-cool going-on. Remember 'Die Another Day' and his thing with kick-ass Michelle Yeoh blended with the svelte Teri Hatcher? The fight in the sound proof studio? Yum. BMW car debuts? How the '80's & '90's are missed.The cool needs to be brought back to the mix. Chases & explosions can be found elsewhere & everywhere. The 007 franchise is wandering, adrift, trying to be 'relevant' maybe when it needs to be mostly as it was - just better & better. Noe one almost expects to see Dr. Phil make a guest appearance.Now let's all go for some Steve McQueen & Faye Dunaway to shake-off the Sky that fell short, even in IMAX.Cinematographic Note: The Arri Alexa looked great. Forget the film- digital teapot tempest. The camera just needed to be pointed at more Bond-worthy sets, sirens, & scenery.",6,2,10,9 November 2012
Lincoln," LINCOLN: Au Contraire
","The reviews are glowing ... but the film is not. The performances are good - and in the case of T. Lee Jones and D. Day Lewis, terrific. It's almost as though the President has returned to life. The other perfs are somewhat canned. And, though some are calling the film Spielberg's 'maturing' as a Director, really it's more like he phoned it in. There was none of the 'something new,' or an angle or perspective, or a gem technique such as the color frame(s) of the child in 'Schlindler's List,' or the final, powerful panning shot before credits roll in 'Munich.' And then, the trite, saccharine, contrived chorale of the illiterate soldiers reciting back to Lincoln the Gettysburg Address in the Opening. Highly unlikely. Disney-like. Did they have NPR in their knapsacks? Or even a newspaper with the text (they'd already memorized)? Weird. Lincoln deserved a better effort from the Director. Even the nat sound was like something from a '50's Western. The 1950's. Williams music? Something he had in a file cabinet somewhere. The music was restrained, properly probably, but it contributed little. The cinematography? Dark and contrasty. But at least that was intriguing and atmospheric as one contemplates the actual lighting of the day, night, and time.On top - or bottom - of this, the movie was tooooooo long for comfort in the multiplex environment of today. Already, at the end of its first week, the picture was relegated to the smallest screen and auditorium. It will best be seen later on Blu-ray, after it has a run on PBS, where it belonged. Ken Burns 'Dust Bowl' topped this (as did his 'Civil War') ... Steven. On a Blu-ray Director's cut it could have been longer - because then one can stop the player for a break, or not.This is the second recent Miss for Spielberg, the last one being the Disney'esque 'War Horse' where the begged-for ending was missed, where the soldier SHOULD have returned with grandpa and the horse back to the granddaughter who also loved the horse ... and then they TWO go riding into the cinematic sunset (remember, at the end) to the soldier's home, or anywhere, leaving it to the audience to imagine what might happily happen next. This was the kind of film it was, one that should have circled back to a happy, loose-ends tied-up ending - and Spielberg missed it. It was a horse story folks.As for LINCOLN, it could have been performed on a stage nearly to the same effect. But this is film. And, for Spielberg, it was lacking. One scene that does capture an essence better than most is Lincoln's ride through the carnage of the War. It's easy to understand that Lincoln would struggle with Depression, as has been reported. What an unholy mess in which to be mired with little in that day and place besides alcohol to relieve the horror, the sadness, the nation so sadly asunder. The theatre maybe? Even that was a tragic idea ... Bravo to D. Day Lewis though. One wonders if his voice was that of Lincoln, a little tinny. A line of dialogue somewhere could have clarified that. As for Lincoln the man, he was easy to find in Lewis' performance.",7,4,10,22 November 2012
In Time," Poetry is Capturing the Essence of the Ordinary, the Overlooked
","Usually I don't like, don't watch sci-fi. But the reviews here & elsewhere were intriguing, transcending the genre. And Amanda Seyfried usually is watchable no matter what. Dropping a dollar in the red vending machine turned-out to be rewarding cinematically.This film has been called an 'action movie,' a 'sci-fi' flick. What it is is an ingenious 'morality play.' Congratulations to the writer/director and Fox for greenlighting it, no pun intended relative to the embedded arm timer(s).We've all heard, ad nauseum, that 'time is money.' And that's the poetry of this production, to take that which is ordinary, known, obvious maybe, oft stated, and overlooked, and restate it in a way that captures and captivates. In this film time IS money, and therein also is its genius of concept and revelation.Is the plot perfect in every regard about which some reviewers are nitpicking? Not sure; probably not. It's not important though. It's close enough to be sufficiently provoking. And it's original, creatively so.TIME also is LIFE itself, stating the obvious. Without it, money does not matter, the old 'you can't take it with you.' And by flipping the time-is-money thing used mostly by bosses of the world as a people-prod - those who have plenty of money that others often are making for them - it hits close enough to human nature to make one think sitting there in the cinema seat, on the couch, commenting on how we value what we have, or don't have - and those who are greedy hoarders. Those who have TIME have LIFE. And since time is currency in the film's world, it shows us ourselves in an original, clever, and even poetic way - in today's cinema vernacular of guns, action, and violence.The one-day-at-a-time sub-theme was interesting & stimulating.This film is an intelligent concept staffed with actors good enough to make it really interesting. Timberlake was fine, even well cast; Seyfriend is nearly always totally watchable, and is here, too. Her make-up and hair was effective, almost subduing the Seyfriend look, while emphasizing it for a futuro effect. Good job.The '70's retro-techno-non-piston (I think) cars were a warpish concept, interesting for some kind of future world & alternate universe environment. ('70's Detroit product was America's ugly automotive nadir, opening the door for the Japanese.) However, as other reviewers have noted, the Jag car crash early in the film looks like '50's model not-so-special effects. It's so bad it seems out-of-place in a film that otherwise is slick. The money must've run out here in the real world ...Filmed with the ARRI Alexa, the digital capture uses a lot of the ugly fluorescent green and sodium orange available practicals of our real world. But it's effective, especially for the grittier parts of the action. To see how digital and available light can look superb, see Soderbergh's 'Contagion.'As for 'In Time,' it's that rare original concept where the Hollywoodie stars & production make it work effectively & provocatively. Bravo.",8,1,2,23 March 2012
Man on Fire," Violent: Obnoxious Shooting & Editing
","This film is about Denzel and the Avid editing system. Denzel is good, but the shooting & editing is awful - MTV run amuck - and it subtracts from Denzel's perf.But it is Denzel at better than his Oscar, which should have gone to Russell Crowe anyway. Everything else about this film is somewhat annoying. Denzel does not play nor make us believe he is the alcoholic he is supposed to be. It might not even be possible for him given his face & looks & movie-to-movie screen persona. Then he's an All-American coach for a scene, or two. Just doesn't work.The movie goes sickly violent after a visually crappy opening act. Some of it is hard to buy.The raw photography in the film is good, but the editing & effects turns it into overweening junk on-screen.",Null,0,0,26 September 2004
