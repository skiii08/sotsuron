Hereditary," High ratings must be from Paimon's followers
","Because of the high ratings, I was more scared before watching this movie than during and after seeing it..Way too overrated..",2,1,3,2 April 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain of what....?
","I couldn't connect with her.
I couldn't feel her pain and struggle.
I didn't enjoy her power evolution.
How did she earn her captain title?.
Turns out director fury is overrated just like this movie.Here is a summary: A woman with amnesia and ill explained super powers kicking ass, switching sides and kick ass some more..It took 2 hours to portray that",2,19,29,30 May 2019
Knives Out," Good movie..
","I enjoyed it very much...
The good little mistery and the little run-around were entertaining..",7,1,2,19 February 2020
Aquaman," Power rangers and SpongeBob SquarePants
","So childish, stupid, inconsistent and lame...
It's like an Under Sea lame version of Black Panther..Sure it's funny here and there but
He used the golden fork to bring death and horror to his people to take the throne, Worthy King my ass..The whole point of the movie was to bring peace and Unite surface dwellers and bikini bottom dwellers.. I'm still waiting...In the world of Superman, wonder woman, Aquaman people are still unaware and in denial of super technologically advanced people living in the oceans..They tried but
I was expecting something serious, not some saturated Goofy Nonsense",4,3,5,8 March 2019
Bird Box," Longest Worst movie I've ever seen in a long time
","People are dying, don't know what's killing them, why it's killing them how it's killing them Where it came from, Why it can't get/break into Houses... Why some are 'immune'.. from beginning to end whole 2 hours all you get is 'you see it you kill your self...'It's nothing like 'A quiet place'... it's an insult to compare this box nonsense to 'A quiet place'This bollocks of a movie is like a moron's version of final destinationIt's simply an insult to our eyesHow people rate it more than 4 Stars is beyond me and most probably beyond some one in heaven",1,5,7,6 February 2019
Split," Was skeptical, but oh boy what a wonderful movie this is

Great performance
Great story
Great endingCan't wait to see Glass",8,0,1,23 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Almost perfect
","I enjoyed every moment,
but I have to say that infinity war was a little better.I have objections here and there but the great action and comedy makes up for it..Overall It's a fully satisfactory conclusion..
3 hours well spent..",8,1,4,26 April 2019
Aladdin," Watchable but ultimately disappointing..
",Terrible Casting of Aladdin and Genie..Too much Illogical nonsense... Just because it's fantasy doesn't mean it has to be senselessToo much unnecessary comic relief,4,7,14,9 August 2019
