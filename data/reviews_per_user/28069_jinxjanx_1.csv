The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest movies I've ever seen!
","I saw the preview for this movie on tv and then got into wondering about it. I went to the main site and saw artifacts and stuff that they had 'found'. I began to really get into it, believing it was all true until I read the Rolling Stone review of it, learning that it was all fake. I saw the movie the first night it was available and even though I knew the truth I was so freaked out! It was an excellent movie and even though somethings are left for you to figure out, I liked it that way!",9,1,1,2 August 1999
