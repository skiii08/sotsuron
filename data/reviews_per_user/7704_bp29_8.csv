Blade Runner 2049," For the First Time I walked out of a movie
","Granted, I have not seen the first Bladerunner and I believe that was an error on my part, but I could only stand an hour of this tediousness, good acting and visuals but with many unnecessary scenes and the plot going nowhere, I just could not stomach it any longer and left.",4,14,32,6 October 2017
Us," over hyped, fails to deliver
","This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a magnificent, heart pounding score and a stunning performance from Lupita- but crashes and burns in plot holes, confusion, and cartoon supporting acts,,,Winston Duke, not his finest two hours- don't be surprised if he's nominated for a Razzie awardPeople need to be more objective and not let anybody mess with your head (media, etc.) and let you think that depraved and dark histories are work of art.",7,10,19,24 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," mixed bag
","If you can look past a policeman throwing someone out of a second story window and walking back into the police station across the street without any repercussions, despite there being eyewitnesses everywhereif you can look past billboards being recovered with banners despite them being burned to a crispIf you can look past someone wanting DNA to prove a murder and scratching a person at a bar to get said DNA instead waiting for the person to leave and then grab his empty beer bottleif you can look past a man in a police station reading a letter and listening to music with headphones on, while someone torches the police station with molotov cocktails and never realizing the orange glow of the fire on the walls around himIf you can look past a police station still being used despite it being torched with molotov cocktails If you can look past to people driving 24 hours from Missouri to Idaho to exact revenge on a rapist",8,1,4,10 December 2017
Justice League," incoherent mess
","I've had an epiphany- Movie's have lost the art of storytelling- Daddy's home 2, Madea, Bad Mom's Christmas- the general population would rather be spoon fed slop from Hollywood studios than be moved by compelling stories. This was a cash cow with CGI-ridden scenes and a rushed story line,,, The acting sucked, the Jewish boy that played Flash was the best act in the movie. Good job little Jewish boy, everyone else sucked.",6,0,1,18 November 2017
Toy Story 4," let's call it for what it is, a cash grab
","This movie didn't need to be made, should have stopped after the third, which was pretty near perfect",7,2,8,6 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," kept checking the time
","Can't believe this is anywhere close to the IMDB top 250 (at #148!!) I can't spoil anything b/c there's nothing to spoil with no plot, although I will say the last 30 minutes are Tarantino, but this is by far my least favorite film of his, I can't believe this is the same man who gave us Pulp Fiction and True Romance",6,1,2,18 August 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Cluedo
","I thought the critics were harsh, I enjoyed it- I've not yet read the book or seen the original 1974 movie, but this film reminded me one one of my favorite board games Cluedo,,, the cinematography was great, it was good acting all around and I really liked the musical score so much that I'll buy it as soon as it's released",8,7,20,11 November 2017
Parasite," My God People, Really?? Get Your heads out of the sand
","After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!",6,208,378,8 February 2020
