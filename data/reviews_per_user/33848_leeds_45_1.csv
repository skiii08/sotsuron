The Longest Yard," American Mean Machine?
","Although a reasonably good film i am annoyed by the likeness to the film mean machine with Vinnie Jones, Adam Sandler's character pretends to have a damaged knee like Vinnie Jones' character so as to ruin the game because of threats from the warden like in mean machine. The Prisoners team is even called mean machine. Although saying this i liked mean machine so liked this, is a good film, just annoying.Adam Sandler is good as always, although he really doesn't look like a superstar footballer against all the other players...there are a few funny lines but possible a few too many saying that this is an Adam Sandler film. > > > > > > >",7,0,0,10 August 2005
