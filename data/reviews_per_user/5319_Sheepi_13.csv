The Blair Witch Project," AN UNQUESTIONED MASTERPIECE.... here's why
","OK, first about all the very different opinions people have been having. The people who didn't like this movie have absolutely NO imaginations whatsoever!! So if you are a teenager who wants lame special effects to give you the picture, or if you just have no imagination, you'll hate this movie. You HAVE to have a good imagination; there are never any special effects in this movie.I LOVE this movie because of the lack of special effects. I'll tell you a horror movie that REALLY SUCKS: Scream ! What a piece of crap!
*NOW FOR THE SUMMARY/OPINIONS:*Blair Witch Project is a realistically portrayed movie about three cussing teens who go into the woods together. They become lost, and things take a very frightening turn...           *maybe a slight spoiler* the ending is a total surprise, but if you listen closely, there are hints towards this ending in the beginning. This movie gave me nightmares. It was incredibly scary, the best horror movie I've EVER seen. In short, you MUST see this movie!! Perfect 10/10.",10,2,4,29 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poorly written...a huge disappointment
","I do not recommend this movie at all.The visual effects are dazzling, and extremely over-the-top. In nearly every scene there is a bunch of computer effects, so unrealistic, and they completely detract from the story.Furthermore, the dialogue and acting are less than bad. The special effects are over-the-top and the acting is under-the-bottom. A few of the actors I can't say anything bad about, but overall, the acting is just grossly terrible. The lines and dialogue are lame and anything but creative.
This movie was a complete disappointment. *Tiny Spoiler* And the incredibly annoying, childish Jar Jar Binks character only adds to the gross failure of this film to impress me. I gave this movie a 4/10, only because of the good visual effects.In summary, this movie is a disgusting piece of work that is sure to disappoint every Star Wars fan to some degree.",4,3,6,29 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Wonderful, fantastic, brilliant. no exaggeration!
","A lovely masterpiece. Here's why *these might be spoilers, but only slightly*:1. The scenery was breathtaking. It was very beautiful and kept the film visually stunning throughout.2. In my opinion, much improved from Washing Irving's original, rather monotonous story. The story was complicated, and somewhat hard to follow the first time. On viewing the second time, however, it was far easier to understand how Ichabod was picking up those little clues.3. Flawless acting. I can say nothing bad of any actor/actress in this film. The cast was also well-chosen.4. The atmosphere created by the scenery was well-fitting. The sky was always gray, and the air nearly always foggy. 5. The horseman scenes were fast-paced, but not not lame like an action film. It was exciting to watch.A definite 10/10. Lovely film. I am without a doubt, going to buy this movie on DVD. I thoroughly disagree with anyone who disliked this film for the slightest reason.",10,0,0,18 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Very good movie.
","After I read other peoples' reviews, it seems either people like the movie, or they hate it. I particularly liked this movie. It is a must-see for every gothic/morbid person.Many people said the story was poor, and there was little development of the characters. The story was very good. It was somewhat complicated, but not over-the-top, with both humorous and serious dialog. The story combined comedy with horror in a perfect blend to satisfy the comedian or the gothic person. The script and plot were very well-written, with a unique story, that was very much improved from the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Tim Burton is under-appreciated as a director. The sets were dream-like with a nice gothic feel. The movie, except for the dream sequences, have a black-and-white appeal with well-blended periodic additions of color during Ichabod's dreams. But it's never too dark or foggy to see what's going on, which is rare for a movie like this.This movie was, in my opinion, better than the Disney version. It is much bloodier, the special effects are fantastic. There is no gore and very little sexuality, and I think the movie deserved a PG 13 rating, definitely. R is just too high a rating, it wasn't that bad with typical R-movie characteristics. The blood and decapitation never goes over the top.The horseman scenes were dramatic and well shot, also. And the horseman isn't what you always are looking forward to seeing.I highly recommend this movie. Much better than what I expected. I roll my eyes at people who say it was horrible.",10,0,0,28 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," This is a great movie for Gothic people.
","If you are Gothic or morbid, you'll love this movie, like I did. It features lots of blood and violence, and of course, decapitation, but doesn't go over-the-top on this. But it also has a complicated story,that might be difficult to follow if you don't pay attention to what's going on.The story has been greatly improved from Washington Irving's original tale. Good acting and a good plot.",10,0,0,28 November 1999
Gone with the Wind," Just boring
","If you are not a fan of romances, you will definitely yawn at this movie. I certainly did. I understand no one who calls this a masterpiece. The story is uninteresting and it's just painful to sit through. A definite 2/10 movie. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was out of respect for the people who think this movie's so wonderful.",2,8,31,30 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Don't see this movie if you're squeamish
","I didn't see this movie in the theatre, but I thought it was good, for what I could sit through. Some parts were just too gory for me to handle. It didn't change my opinion of war, I've always thought it was horrible. Very good story and good acting. See this movie if you've got a strong stomach. The first 1/2 hour is particularly gory, just a warning. The rest of it isn't QUITE as bad.I was impressed by this movie. The visual and sound effects were very realistic, so realistic it was almost frightening. Can you believe people would do such horrible things to each other? In conclusion, this movie disgusted and amazed me.",9,0,0,29 November 1999
Titanic," 9/10 movie
","I voted a 9/10, partly because the romance DID drag on a bit too long. The ship didn't hit the iceberg until 1 1/2 hours through the movie. After seeing this movie 3 times in the theatre, I was very bored with it, but reluctantly bought it on tape anyways. It CAN be considered a masterpiece, however. The acting was very good. The story could have used several improvements to keep it more interesting.After the ship hit the iceberg, things got exciting. This was the part of the movie I really enjoyed. Those who didn't see it in the theatre can never get the real feel of the movie, when the screams are blasting at you, it was exciting.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you rent it and sit down, at least through the boring first part, until the ship starts sinking and it gets interesting.",9,1,2,29 November 1999
Psycho," 8/10
","This movie didn't scare me one bit.Not to say that it wasn't dramatic, nor enjoyable. It was very entertaining and the acting is quite good. It's a quality piece of work. So if you've got a few to spare (Paraguay currency), then go ahead and rent it. You might want to buy it even before seeing it. Due to its lack of a scare factor, I gave it an 8/10. However it was an excellent film in other aspects.RINGO STARR FOREVER",Null,12,22,17 February 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Should you see this movie?
","After hearing all of the comments on this one, such as, 'Greatest Ever Made,' 'I loved it,' 'why didn't it win movie of the year?' I had very high expectations upon seeing it.I was not in the least disappointed. This movie IS all it's made up to be. Yes, without a doubt, you SHOULD see this movie.The story is a thought-provoking one of hope, and how to find meaning in order in the apparent chaos of life. Andy escapes from the prison in an attempt to find himself, after his good friend Brooks, who has been released after decades of living in the prison, runs into bad fortune. Andy's other friend who is also released manages to find himself like Andy did through his help. This is a story of the torture humans inflict on one another and how it is escaped through hope.10/10",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Scream," Excuse me?
","I can't believe some of the people that said this movie was good. And so many people gave it a 10 ! This movie was AWFUL!It's the typical slasher movie. A guy calls a girl and asks her what's her favorite scary movie. She hangs up on him, and then her parents find her dead, hung up in a tree covered with blood. Ooooookie dokie.
This movie is terrible. If you don't like it, you'll certainly be laughing most of the way through. I asked every friend I hang out with regularly (about 10 people); they all agreed that this was THE SINGLE LAMEST MOVIE they had EVER SEEN.Take my advice; see the Blair Witch Project. That movie scared the crap out of me! But be warned, you HAVE to have at least a hint of an imagination to like it. The people who hate it are pitifully without any imagination at all.1/10 without question",1,7,25,29 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," Very good movie, 10/10
","This movie is for gothic people, like myself, or morbid people. It has an unpredictable surprise ending. Disgusting in parts, there are also parts that make you jump, and others that make you laugh. Very well-written story and superb acting. The little boy is also a surprisingly good actor, I see very few kids who CAN act.I gave this movie a 10/10 for its unpredictability, riveting plot, and good acting. I am definitely buying this movie on DVD.",10,0,0,29 November 1999
Apollo 13," Impressive
","I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece. It was captivating, very interesting, and made you want to watch it all the way through. I love this movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone. This movie proves that space flights are never routine, and gives you a clear picture of astronauts' bravery.This movie's visual effects were particularly good. The launch scene is fantastic. The music enhanced the drama of the story, and the acting was truly superb. I rated this movie a perfect 10/10, and I now own it on DVD.",10,1,2,29 November 1999
