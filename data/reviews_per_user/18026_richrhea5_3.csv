Marie Antoinette," You Have to Show Historical Climax!
","I liked it, and was entranced despite filler scenes and occasional lapses in dramatic punch. But to coyly deprive us of the beheading really takes the cake, pardon the pun. The attempt at profundity by showing Marie's empty bedroom only heightens the immense dramatic error of what really happened to this lady. It COULD have been nominated for Best Pic if they had done that. Alas, huge miscalculation on filmmakers' part. Still, a visual eye-fest, and I appreciated the low-key, matter-of-fact approach.",7,0,1,16 March 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Doesn't Get Much Better than This
","In my book, it's a 10; great writing (crisp, funny, moving), inspired acting by Streep and all, fine direction (doesn't get in the way and displays even-handedness) plus it's topical and super entertaining! What more do you want? It's not a 'chick flick' because it can speak to anybody; uplifting and insightful, timeless themes, such as the power of confidence (swings both ways, good and bad), standing up for yourself and just being yourself despite the flack, and basically retelling the ugly duckling story with a twist. I feel like I learned something, too; what it means to be a winner, how circumstances can change a person but with the help of friends change can happen and not ultimately be one's downfall...

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Hated it then; hate it now.
","I saw this dog when it first came out. During the opening scenes on Hoth, I turned to my friend, and said, 'Get me in space!' Running around Antarctica with Yeti, was the worse.
Billy Dee Williams is a joke.
The smouldering love interest between Solo and Leia pathetic; everyone knows Luke loves her (oops, Lucas made her HIS SISTER after the success of I (Oh, excuse me IV). Oy vay! Even the editing stinks; watch the gun battle in the desert - ! A 5 for Special Effects, sound, and effort. Folks, the original was nominated for Best Picture! Lucas said everything he wanted to say in I. Sequels are made for one reason; filthy lucre.",5,1,11,27 July 2019
