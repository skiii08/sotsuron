The Devil's Advocate," The worst performance ever
","Not even in community theater have I seen such a bad acting job as the one Keanu Reeves turns in here.  This is it: the single worst performance humanity can offer.  Poor general technique aside, he alternates between having a horrendous southern accent and having no accent at all.  Perhaps the director instructed him midway through shooting not to use the accent anymore.Whatever the answer, Keanu's performance -- as well as the movie -- is a joke.",1,17,56,22 January 2001

The Godfather: Part III," Entertaining, but...
","I'm not breaking any new ground by saying that this one doesn't compare with the others.  Taken on its own, it's an entertaining movie that, while not that well done, kept me engrossed enough to sit through nearly three hours.Still, neither the acting, the directing, nor the writing matches up with Godfather I or II.  There's no need to go into detailed complaints, but all told, this movie is fun but nothing special.",6,0,1,1 December 2000
