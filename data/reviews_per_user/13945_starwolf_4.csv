Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln, Super Hero
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading the book. Sadly, instead of any story approximating the book, I got a mess of not-so-special effects with a way over the top story.During the sequence with the burning trestle bridge (I don't want to be any more specific because I don't like posting spoilers) I actually turned to my wife and said, 'This is stupid.' She agreed.My 11 year old daughter liked the movie so maybe grownups weren't the target audience for this mess.If you liked the book, keep away. If you want any kind of thought or story internally consistent story, keep away. If you want mindless depictions of the 16th president acting like a super hero, leaping tall buildings in a single bound, felling giant trees with a single stroke, performing moves that would make Jet Li proud, this is your movie.",5,57,102,28 June 2012
Suicide Squad," Better than expected, but still not a great movie
","So, yeah - it's a super hero movie. It doesn't suck the way a lot of people are crowing about, but it's not a masterpiece either the way a lot of other people are shouting.The good: I thought Margot Robbie's acting, without mentioning her accent, was pretty much spot on for what I would have expected from Harley Quinn. (I came close to naming my Harley Sportster 'Harley Quinn' but then this movie started being advertised, so I named her 'Binky.') The plot made sense, even if it was a bit of a stretch here and there. Other people have complained about it, but I liked the music. I thought 'Spirit in the Sky' was misplaced when it started, but whatever. Viola Davis plays a bad guy pretty well. I thought the actor who played Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) did a great job making us care about him and what happened. Jay Hernandez did a good jobs as Diablo. Most of the SFX didn't suck.The bad: Well, Margot Robbie's here and then gone again accent. (I could give her a slight break because I know how hard it is to carry an accent throughout a performance. But, OTOH, this wasn't a live show, she could have had an accent coach, and she got paid a lot more than I ever have, so no - no slight break.) For me the show screeched to a halt every time Leto's joker appeared on the screen. Man, I hated that characterization. It simply didn't work for me, even a little bit. Ditto Cara Delevingne - my Lord she is a terrible actress. And IMHO her body might look nice but her face certainly isn't all that. So, with the lack of a trace of acting ability coupled with not being gorgeous - she must be sleeping with someone to be getting these acting gigs. I simply couldn't buy her enchantress except when she was hidden under heavy makeup and CGI. Why the heck was Captain Boomerang in this story? He didn't add anything plot wise. At least Slipknot was there to show us the effectiveness of the 'persuasive device' used to make the Suicide Squad go along.The ho hum: So yeah, once again Will Smith played Will Smith. If you like his 'Oh hell no!' plus his 'now I'm going to speak slower in a lower register so you can tell I'm a serious and tortured soul' then you will like his 1,000th (a made-up number to emphasize my point) rendering of this character.All in all, not a failed movie and not a master piece.",7,1,1,19 August 2016
Resident Evil," Finally....
","This is the very first time I have seen someone take a video game and do a good job of turning it into a movie. Excellently done. The critics I see carping about the lack of originality just don't get it. I saw one of them say something about zombies not as good as 'Night of the Living Dead' and a train not as big as 'Ghosts of Mars.' Doesn't he get it? The zombies were pretty much exactly as they were the game -shambling, shuffling along until they are close enough to attack, and then diving in for that bite! The train, of course, was lifted pretty much exactly from the game. They weren't trying for a 'Ghosts of Mars' type thing.Milla was amazing. I read another review that claimed 'Tomb Raider' would be considered a better movie because it had a higher babe factor. Well yes, Angelina Jolie is a babe, but guess what, so is Milla. And the story line was a heck of a lot better than 'Tomb Raider.' It had a point, was internally consistent, and a great setup for the start of the game.In case you're unsure of my point, I heartily approve. Great job with the movie.",9,1,1,17 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Great Addition to the Star Wars Universe
","First things first, I love this movie! It delivered everything that I expected it to give me, and did it very well. Yes, I am a Star Wars fan. But I am not a blind fan and I can recognize some of the issues that the prequel movies had, or even The Return of the Jedi had. This movie gave me the same feeling I had back in 1977 when I was watching the original Star Wars for the first time. It was a lot of fun, had a simple story that made sense, and had characters who are likable and relatable. In addition there were the usual Star Wars aliens, vehicles, and settings in the movie. I have heard people complain that this movie was too much like the very first movie. In my mind, they were paying homage to the very first movie and using what worked in previous Star Wars ourings to make a new Star Wars. The movie had a few twists and turns as we find out who some of the main characters are and how they're related, it brought back old familiar faces which is always a fun time, and it left us with the mystery about who some of the new players are. I saw some other guy on here reviewing the movie complaining that there was no character development. First of all, we know who the characters are coming out of the gate. How are you going to develop Han Solo any further? Although I do think the movie managed to add some depth to the relationship between himself and General Leia Organa. It added depth to the main bad guy's character, and gave us a fairly complicated character in the storm trooper. All in all, I think the people trashing the movie or simply those who want to be hipsters and want to show that their tastes are above the plebian by trashing a popular movie. I don't care, I thought the movie was a blast. It's not Citizen Kane, but let's face it - unless you're really into making movies yourself Citizen Kane is boring. This movie is not.As I said, as I sat there and watched it I had the same feelings that I had watching the original Star Wars movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to go to the movies and have a good time and see you a worthy addition to the Star Wars pantheon.",9,8,33,21 December 2015
