Captain Phillips," The BEST!!! A must see.
","This moving was very moving from beginning to end. I don't think they left anything out in this movies, I can't say I wish they would have added more, it was perfection. Everyone played their part as if they actually lived the moments. Tom Hanks as always was a master at this role. The new comers Faysal Ahmed, Barkhad Abdi and Mahat M. Ali they were marvelous. The nurse at the end of the move gave me chills at how good she was at taking care of Tom. The movie was 2hr plus, but it didn't feel like it at all. It was engaging and enlisting about the story of Captain Phillips. I would go and see it again; it will be in my home video collection. The USA military is great as always.",10,1,3,14 October 2013
