Casablanca," Highly overrated
","Ugh. Top ten movie of all time? That is a joke. This movie belongs no where near the top 200. First off, this movie starts off slowly, very, very slowly. I felt as if all this dialogue and practical eventlessness in 'Rick's cafe' Americain' would lead somewhere, but I was let down. Although I do not care much for this film, I will give credit where it is due. Casablanca relates to many with the story of Rick and his former lover meeting by chance after many years, only to stir up problems and confuse his feelings once again. The story itself is interesting, I just don't believe it was dramatic or eventful enough to keep anyone interested throughout. I wasn't really sure what this movie was aiming for, and that's just the problem. There were serious scenes that demanded my attention, there are bouts of comic relief (albeit not overly funny), there are suspenseful scenes, and there are flat out mixed up scenes where I had no idea what to think. This movie tries to be too many genres at once. If it was more focused I believe it may have made more sense. OK- Just about the entire film is set in one single spot, that being Humphrey Bogart's Cafe, as I would venture to guess 80% or more of the footage you see is in one single building. YAWN. I actually fell asleep at TWO different points while watching this film. It is an absolute snorefest. The acting was good, the casting and script were nice, but there is just something missing from this movie that I cannot put my finger on. Overall it is very dull and dry, and I do not recommend it to anybody. I think it takes a solid 30 minutes before anything actually happens, and by that time we have already lost interest. Do not watch this film, do not recommend it to anyone, it will bore you to tears. Highly overrated, I cannot fathom how this film is considered an all-time great. It absolutely blows my mind. To sum up 'Casablanca' in one word---> YAWN.",Null,2,4,13 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Classic Steinbeck brought to life
","This film is great for many reasons, primarily because it was adapted from John Steinbeck's timeless novel. Although Steinbeck's original thoughts and emotions are written down in the text, John Ford and this cast do a superb job of conveying these emotions and thoughts on screen. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, and does so flawlessly. Each character has their own influence on making this movie great in different ways. At first, we see Tom fresh out of jail, naive to the current times and angry with people and the world in general for the state most people are in during the depression. Toward the end, Tom realizes he can't control every situation presented him, and matures over the course of the film by accepting things that he can't change. Although he carries with him good intentions, the Joad's and many like them are victims of the times.Steinbeck's novel is a classic, and I think that John Ford does an excellent job of paying his due diligence through this movie. If you are familiar with Steinbeck you'll already know that he writes of many things simultaneously, that is, many of the things he says can be taken at face value or delved into deeply and contemplated end over end. John Ford understands this, and it shows in scenes where his characters give monologues, usually with close up shots to show the raw emotion in their faces. At the end of the movie we see Tom saying farewell to his mother before leaving the ranch. Mrs. Joad inquires, 'What'll you do Tom, go off? How'll you survive- what if you get killed? I'd never see you again', to which Tom replies, 'Ma I'll be everywhere helpin' out the everyman. (If I were to die) I'll be there when a cop is beatin' a poor fella for no reason, where children laugh because they're hungry, an' they know supper's ready... I'll be everywhere.' It is here that we see Tom's change in his character, which is reflective of the entire country at the time. Beaten and broken, most are forced to fend for themselves in hopes of finding better days. Tom is the opposite, looking out for those he loves and complete strangers simultaneously.This movie reflects the nation as a whole of the time, and gives us a peek into the simple will and desire of those folks to merely get by without worrying about starving or having a place to sleep at night. As Ma Joad says, 'We'll keep on forever 'cause we're the people. Born on this dirt, live, die, and pass on to the youngster's here, we'll keep on going forever'. See it, read it, love it.",Null,0,1,12 October 2011
The Graduate," Strangely enjoyable
","Let me start off by saying that I definitely enjoyed this movie. That being said, however, I do believe that I enjoyed this movie because of the extreme levels of strangeness and awkwardness associated with the plot and characters. As the movie starts we immediately jump into Dustin Hoffman's (at first) unwanted affair with Anne Bancroft, and this sort of sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is very humorous watching Hoffman fumble around as he attempts to entertain this older and clearly more experienced woman, and the movie is clearly a comedy. But then something happens- Mrs. Bancroft's daughter enters the story and I felt the movie sort of shift and lose sight of its original plot. Perhaps this was done purposefully, but I feel that once Hoffman meets Bancroft's daughter it turns almost into a drama. The movie still maintains its humor but I think we see a clear change in the tone from jovial boyhood antics to someone who suddenly decides they want to grow up and get married out of nowhere. I don't think this detracts from the film, but I feel that Hoffman's character changes gears so suddenly the viewer may not be ready for it. Still a great film however, and I would highly recommend anyone to see it. There were some interesting camera tricks during the early stages of the film when Hoffman and Bancroft start their affair, as we see almost a montage of sorts depicting Hoffman running back and forth between his parents house and the hotel rooms he frequents with Mrs. Bancroft, illustrating his shame in a way. Also, there are some cool underwater shots in the pool scene(s) and I think they were very imaginative for the time. It felt fresh to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it the whole way through. Overall, this was a great movie- go see it!",8,1,1,30 November 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Love it. I hate musicals, yet still loved this film!
","Did you read the summary I wrote? I HATE musicals. Hate them so very much. I'd rather be inflicted with some sort of pain than sit through an entire musical film. Singin' in the Rain had quite the opposite effect though. I LOVED this movie. Musical or not, it was largely entertaining and hilarious all the way through. Gene Kelly is superb in his role as Don Lockwood, as he is charismatic, funny, and charming- as is his partner, Cosmo. I loved this movie for many reasons, but above all I think it was the overall look of the film. Some similar films of the same time period (where the sidewalk ends, I'm looking at you) just didn't have the same technology or feel I suppose. When I started watching Singin' in the Rain, I had no idea it debuted in 1952. In fact, I though it was much newer than that because of the amazingly crisp Technicolor technology. This movie looks smoother and clearer than many movies made in the 70's 80's and 90's. It was that good. I was, and still am, blown away by the amazing picture quality this movie possesses. I cannot say enough good things about this film. The ONLY detraction. I do mean ONLY, is that some of the musical scores carried on a little bit longer than I had cared for, but I was never bored. I only say this, because, as mentioned before, I am not a fan of musicals; just this one. Funny, suspenseful, entertaining (especially the stunts and dances). This movie was amazing. I loved it and recommend it to anybody. 9 out of 10, I loved it and so will you. Go see it!",Null,0,1,5 November 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Very odd- yet likable
","Very strange film. I will say that I have NOT read the book from which this movie was based, but I still understood the message. If you start watching this movie expecting it to be a traditional story with easily understandable events and messages, you will be sorely disappointed. The whole movie,right from the start, exudes one of the strangest feels I have ever gotten from any other movie. Just everything I can think of- the looniness of the characters actions, the soft music that conflicts with the despicable acts taking place on screen, and the accents of the actors. Much of the movie is COMPLETELY inaudible because the actors all have extremely thick British accents, and let me tell you, this drove me nuts. At one point I had to turn the subtitles on so that I could understand what was being said, but then I realized that much of what is being said does not necessarily matter because this film has a deeper meaning about life and society. What exactly that is I will not ruin for you, but understand if you choose to watch this film it is very unorthodox, very different than any film you will probably ever watch.It is very interesting artistically as the filmmakers use a variety ambient lighting a cool camera effects that really add to the eerie and confusing feel of the film. Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but I only started enjoying when I realized that this was not a typical movie. Once you realize you must look deeper into the message and story of this film, then will you appreciate how good it is. I recommend it to anyone willing to watch it with an open mind!",7,0,1,30 November 2011
