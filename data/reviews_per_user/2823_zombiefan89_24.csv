Blade Runner 2049," Excessive Random Nudity and a severe lack of the top billed actor
","Excessive Random Nudity and a severe lack of the top billed actor, Harrison Ford. Ford is literally only in the last thirty minutes of this over two hour film. The trailer and this site make it sound like Harrison Ford is the star. Also, BWAM! Get used to that sound. Oh, yes, it's one of those movies! Sudden loud noises for no reason. There is a lot of deep symbolism in the movie, yet it has such a clichÃ© story. Sequels where the new characters seek out the original characters from the first film are a dime a dozen.",5,3,8,16 October 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," ...It wasn't as bad as Thor...
","Steve Rogers was a bit cliché, but then the movie was about the 1940s, so clichés were common. There's really no way to spoil this movie, if you know anything about Captain America. Also the movie is mostly gun fights and explosions, just like a Michael Bay movie! The premise is an American made Superman through science. A lot of experiments when on during the 1940s, we invented the atom bomb, etc. So a scientist making a super soldier would have been on their 'To Do' list, if it were an option. As for characters, Steve Rogers wasn't that cliché, or at least, I didn't think so. He didn't have too many emotions though. He's not witty or charming. He's just your standard save-the-day super hero.I did enjoin the scenes where he used his brain instead of brawn, but those scenes are scarce indeed. The other characters were so bland, I can't even remember their names. There was 'Uncle Ben' as the scientist. 'Lois Lane' as the only female main character. Tommy Lee Jones as a stereotypical colonel( it was his dialogue, not his fault!), and there was the best friend. Not a whole lot of character development. Actually, now that I think about it, there wasn't any...Steve Rogers stays exactly the same through out the movie. He doesn't reach some profound understanding of anything. He just fights a lot and blows things up. I'm not joking, the movie is 70-80% explosions and gun fights. The whole movie is just to set up the back story for that Avengers movie, just like Thor! But everyone knew that from the title!",1,2,8,16 April 2012
The Hills Have Eyes," Finally! A Good Remake!
","This movie, I dare say, surpasses the original by every possible means! It's positively gruesome, but it's about cannibals, which makes sense. Why are they cannibals? Because their a bunch of inbred weirdos living in a desert. There's not exactly a Wal-Mart to buy food from, is there? The movie bares a striking resemblance to Wrong Turn, as the inbreeds are much uglier and more monster-ish than they were in the original, which is still a good thing. There's also the rape scene, same as the original. I personally applaud rape in horror movies. Not pornography quality of course, but it's just one of those things that should be there when a psychopath goes on a killing spree. This was what disappointed me in the Jason movies. Didn't he find one of the girls he killed attractive? Logically, being a moral-less lunatic, he'd have to have urges. Overall, I loved this movie. It's everything the original was with the modern advances of 2006. This is how all remakes should be.",10,2,4,31 March 2012
Knowing," One man's alien is another man's angel
","John (Cage) and his son Caleb are given a prophetic warning in a series of numbers written by a little girl in 1959. I'm still very much confused after watching the movie. I honestly didn't see the point of John even getting that number list in the first place, since he couldn't stop any of it! At best, he was just there so we, the audience, could see all the awesome special effects. There were three disasters within John's time frame to prevent, a plane crash, a subway crash, and a solar flare that would genocide all life on Earth. Each time, he was there as only a witness. To be fair, there really wasn't anything he could do, really. One man can't stop a plane crash, subway crash, or the end of the world with just a date, location, and body count. On to the weird ending, the aliens(angels) could have shown up anywhere and persuaded the kids to come with them. Overall, great special effects, great acting, but I'm still wondering, What was the point?",7,0,2,1 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Too soon for reboot, Wanted Spiderman 4
","The Amazing Spider-man is a bit of a mixed bag. It's really nothing new at all. Anyone who has read the comics or seen the 90's TV show would know exactly what's going to happen. Personally, if they had cast Alan Rickman as Doctor Connors, I would have really liked this movie. I did feel a lot of nostalgia when watching, but the whole thing seemed just bland to me. There was a lot of excitement when Gwen Stacy was in danger, as everyone knows she dies in the comics just as Uncle Ben does. This is not a spoiler. Everyone who knows anything about Spider-Man knows that Uncle Ben and Gwen Stacy die. Also, I'm positive Gwen will die in the sequel, if they make one, which makes her character all the most tragic. Google Gwen Stacy and you'll see 'The Night Gwen Stacy died'. Next, on to Spider-Man taking off his mask a lot. It's not much of a secret at this point. Peter Parker is about as synonymous with Spider-Man as Clark Kent with Superman, but he really does reveal his identity a LOT! Of course Gwen's father did have him at gun point, but that's nothing new to Spider-Man. Also, what the hell? How did Spider-Man get SHOT!? Spider-Sense, writers! Ever heard of it!? Seriously, it SHOULD be nearly impossible to hit Spider-Man with... ANYTHING!",3,3,7,10 January 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," I loved this movie!
","I don't normally get attached to characters, but I especially loved Dale and Allison!
It's very rare for horror or even comedies to get me to care about their characters, but this movie was an exception!
I see 'predictable' in some of the other reviews, but this is not the case! I was expecting this to go the way of 'Of Mice and Men'. Spoilers for that book, Tucker and Dale are very similar to George and Lennie. Actually very similar! We were just missing the rabbits! Thus, I was predicting Tucker to have to kill Dale due to accidentally killing Allison. Honestly, there were a couple of parts of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat! 'Is Allison okay!??'
First in the cabin, one of the college kids was shooting their cabin with the sheriff's gun. I was expecting Allison to get hit by a stray bullet, and furthering the strife between Tucker, Dale, and the College Kids. But that would have been really tragic and broke the comedic tone. Then, at the end, I was expecting Allison to get hit with a bowling ball right after she took of the helmet Dale bought her. Like, all the college kids were cursed or something, ala Final Destination. So, yeah, this movie is far from predictable!",10,1,1,9 June 2018
28 Days Later...," I was expecting another Resident Evil, but.... =)
","It was genuinely a great movie! I was surprised several times in this film, and I thought I had seen every zombie movie ever made! First off was the believable introduction. Like HIV, the Rage virus came from monkeys. Who wouldn't believe some scientist somewhere had a psychotic virus, and I'm sure those radical save-the-animalists would be the first to die from it! The second part that threw me was the church of zombies! I thought, 'oh, he just kicked the bees' hive, didn't he?' Third was how the dad got turned into one! Just a drop of blood! I never saw that coming! I knew he was getting turned, but I was expecting one to just jump out and bite him, not just a measly drop of blood! Lastly, what I thought was the best part,the most evil creatures in this movie weren't actually the zombies but the soldiers! Overall, I have to say this is the best of the genre! A must see for any zombie fan!",10,2,3,6 July 2011
Bolt," Character Development done PERFECTLY!
","This movie's plot is one of the most creative Disney came up with yet! However, It's the characters that really sold me on this movie! Every one of the main characters are fleshed out and believable despite being talking animals! The most striking is Bolt's realization that his world is a TV show! It also shows how disposable and replaceable actors and actresses are when corporations are involved! Bolt and Penny being effortlessly replaced when they choose to go back to a normal life. It was also interesting how grounded everything was in reality despite the premise. People can't understand the animals, but the animals can understand the humans to great degree. Overall, it was definitely worth the buy! Despite being a kid's movie, the plot wasn't dumbed down, and it was enjoyable for adults and kids alike!",10,2,3,31 December 2014
Schindler's List," I would have filmed it in color.
","The film has this weird gimmick if colorizing specific things like a little girl's coat or candles. It really wasn't used enough to warrant the gimmick. To my knowledge, no actual World War II footage was used during the film. If they had done that, I could understand filming the movie in black and white. There was a small scene that was shot for shot copied from Citizen Kane for some reason. Another odd thing, Hitler was never mentioned in the film. I would have expected at least some mention of him. I don't count that against the film though. As for the story, it jumps around a lot at first. It's just several nameless people being killed by nameless Nazi soldiers. It's horrific violence, which I guess was the point. But then, the story suddenly became more coherent, focusing on Schindler.",5,17,37,17 August 2017
Gran Torino," A beautifully realistic movie.
","I must say I enjoyed every minute of that movie. It came as a surprise to see Eastwood without his walker, though. It must've been very hard throughout the course of filming. Honestly, I hope he isn't still smoking and drinking in real life, like he does in the movie. Bee Vang was a very convincing Thao, just as Eastwood was very convincing old racist. The dialogue is spot on and believable. The ending was amazing! I never saw that coming! I'm sure everyone was expecting Eastwood to relive the old West as Dirty Harry and kill everyone of them with a single hand gun, but that's not what happened at all! I was both surprised and kind of disappointed, but thinking about it more I liked the way it ended. The gang members would never have expected an unarmed old man! He was clearly dying anyway, so going out like he did had to be something he wanted. This movie is a must see. 10 stars!",10,1,4,11 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I enjoyed it better than Episode 7
","It has flaws. Many flaws. For one, I really did not like Rose. She felt like Rey 2.0. She was given knowledge and skills that she should not have had, and they did that finishing each other's sentences that made me cringe in Episode 7.
The animation of Yoda was...horrible. Unbelievably horrible, like worse than Episode 2. He looked like the Yoda in the Clone Wars animated series.
On to what I liked about the movie, Luke was the most entertaining character in the movie. His interactions with Rey were the funniest scenes in an otherwise somber movie. As a shock to no one, Luke Skywalker dies. As with Harrison Ford in Episode 7, Mark Hamill was eager to retire his character and pass the torch onto the next generation. His death was terribly anti-climactic though. Heart attack. Yes, the most iconic character in the Star Wars franchise next to Darth Vader dies from a heart attack. I can see why so many fans hate this movie for that reason alone.",6,1,2,20 December 2017
Jurassic World," A lot of call backs to the original
","If you haven't seen the first film, an idiot billionaire wanted to make a theme park/zoo of live dinosaurs. What could go wrong? Well, Jurassic World takes that concept up to 11. The Computer Generated dinosaurs are passable at best. This movie tries to recapture the magic of the original, but it's really difficult. The biggest problem is that there's a lot of suspension of disbelief. After the numerous deaths and a freaking T-Rex slaughtering people in a city, it's hard to imagine anyone would touch the 'Jurassic Park' concept with a ten foot pole. Not only that, it would be impossible to get insurance on such a theme park/zoo. The T-Rex attack on a city in 'Lost World' would be the disastrous equivalent of September 11th or Pearl Harbor in the Jurassic Park universe. There's just no way there could ever be a 'Jurassic World'. It's just too much of a liability.",9,1,1,27 October 2017
Mama," Mama, I want a refund!
","Spoiler: It's a typical horror movie with a crappy CGI monster! I mean, there was not an ounce of originality throughout the film, pointless jump scares, creepy kids, all topped off with a stupid, stupid heroine! You see someone hide in your closet that's not one of your kids, you... I don't know... Call the Cops! Granted that cops in horror movies are typically just cannon fodder, but it would have been nice to see her reacting to a situation in a believable manner. For that matter, the whole plot is ridiculous! No one searched any of the nearby cabins in the words for the missing girls? Come on! Lastly, the younger girl is all kinds of special needs! When your 'mom' is a crappy CGI monster, do you really held by her? Five minutes earlier, the 'mom' was killing people and terrorizing the little girls, but for SOME reason, the badly written little girl number two thought, 'Hold me, Mommy!'",1,10,19,2 November 2013
Thor," Um...Thor? Really?
","It was a somewhat entertaining movie. Great CGI, you can really tell Marvel did their best with this one. First off is the characters. Thor is quite funny to watch when he's turned human, as he thinks he's invincible, and ...he's not. Loki was a bit weird. I wasn't sure what they were trying to do with his character. I've seen some down right wacky Loki's over the years, but this one was just bland and boring. It's like they were trying to make a good villain for the movie, but then changed their minds half way through, and making Loki a 'frost giant' was just pointless. Honestly, there's really not much as far as villains go in this movie. Sure there's the frost giants, but they're just there. They want to conquer Asgard,but then there's the big 'Why?' because someone like Thor can just go Rambo and kill their entire species. Moving on to Jane. She's your basic stereo-type female scientist, not much to say. She's completely average as far as characters go. Thor's merry men were no better. There's the samurai- looking guy, Xena the warrior princess, a guy that looks like a tall dwarf from the Lord of the Rings, and a blond guy. They're as pointless as the frost giants. Overall, the movie has beautiful CGI, and not much else. Also, I have to add, Thor is just too powerful to really work as an effective hero. Hercules, for example, was a human with god-like strength. Thor is a god, with god-like strength. It doesn't really work, since he doesn't have any krytonite or any weaknesses like that. The worst a villain can do is threaten or kill his loved ones. I'm eager to see how Marvel will try to balance Thor in The Avengers movie.",3,0,3,31 March 2012
Joker," I almost caused a panic at the Joker screening just looking for my cousin!
","TL;DR It's a great film. Go see it! Personally, I will always love Heath Ledger the best as the definitive live-action Joker, but this Joker is now a close second. ...Sadly, the media has lost its mind. I went to the theater with my cousin. I took a quick pit stop at the restroom as everyone should before a movie. My cousin finds us some good seats on the fourth row from the front. I enter the room. The trailers have started so it's quite dark. I go down the front of the screen and scan the room for my cousin. I see several people get up, looking nervous at me. 'Chill, People! I'm just looking for my cousin!' I spot him, very embarrassed, and hurry to my seat. The rest of the screening was normal. I could feel that everyone was on edge though thanks to the media freaking everyone out.",9,1,2,8 October 2019
Hancock," A brilliant new take on the classic super hero genre!
","There are so many things we just don't think about when watching a super hero movie. Like, all those buildings that get destroyed when the Megazord and the bad guy of the week duke it out in Angel Grove, who pays for the repairs? No one ever tried to sue the Power Rangers for saving the world! As for the cast, Will Smith plays the drunken 'asshole' very well, and Jason Bateman does a fantastic job as a mediator. Although,Charlize Theron could have been replaced with any beautiful actress, and no one would've noticed. I know Hancock needed a back-story, but honestly I really loved just watching him trying to fit in to society. I mean, the way people treat him is hilarious when you think, all he has to do is snap one time, and he could kill every living thing on the planet, or declare himself a god and require virgin sacrifices, or anything he wanted, and there wouldn't be a thing anyone could do to stop him! Over all, Hancock is just as under appreciated as a movie as he is a super hero!",10,3,5,22 August 2012
Carrie," A perfect cinema classic!
","I don't really even consider Carrie a horror movie. Sissy Spacek was just to adorable to find threatening, even when she went fully homicidal. Everything she did felt justified. However, if I had to say the biggest issue with the film was the ending. It made no sense at all. Why did they blame Carrie for the gym catching on fire? How did they know Carrie didn't die in the gym with everyone else? There were no survivors except the two antagonists, but they died shortly after. Let's say there were survivors, Did they all unanimously accept that Carrie had psychic powers and caused the fire? Why and how did they blame Carrie? It was like Light Yagami in Death Note, who could kill people by writing their name down and thinking of their face as they do it. They accepted that a notebook could kill people WAY too easily! No court on Earth would have convicted Light Yagami of being 'Kira' because there was NO solid proof! I had a complete opposite reaction to the 'surprise ending', I would have immediately started digging her out, trying to save her life.",9,1,1,3 May 2013
Blade Runner," It's kind of slow, boring, and repetitive
","It's kind of slow, boring, and repetitive. It has this awkward narration from Harrison Ford, like an old noir movie. I watched this as a fan of Bubble Gum Crisis, which plagiarized a lot from this movie. Despite the cringe narration, I liked Harrison Ford's character. He was like Humphrey Bogart. A bit too much like Humphrey Bogart. I honestly don't get why people love this movie so much. It doesn't actually have a lot of action, and they keep repeating that first Replicant attack over and over. I would think a veteran blade runner would wear some futuristic body armor under his clothes. Criticisms aside, The setting is really interesting. I like futuristic settings.",3,3,10,14 August 2017
Bruce Almighty," A whole movie with God not killing a single person? LOL
","The Concept: Truthfully, God does grant powers to His followers throughout the Bible. So, the concept of the movie is not so far-fetched, if you believe the Bible in the first place. Also, His choices in who to endow with powers are often ridiculous as well. Elisha is one such example. The Cast: Jim Carrey is a five star actor as always, and Morgan Freeman is amazing as well of course. The only real issue I have is the God in the movie. I'm guessing the writers didn't actually read the Bible when drafting God's character because the God mentioned in the Bible isn't any where near as friendly as Freeman's portrayal. The real God would have killed Bruce AND his family, friends, and probably most of Buffalo...Just for him complaining.",Null,1,2,25 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars, The Mary Sue Awakens
","Yes, I'm yet another person to point out that Rey is a Mary Sue. The whole movie, I wanted her to fail at least as something, but no. She flies the Millennium Falcon almost perfectly, and can fix any problem it has, despite calling it garbage. Her good combat skills, I understand. She lives alone in a savage desert world with slave traders everywhere.Honestly, the real life events surrounding the movie are much more interesting than the movie itself. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and seeing him back on the Millennium Falcon got me a little teary-eyed. Not much of a spoiler, but yes, Han Solo is killed. Harrison Ford is very old now. He doesn't have the energy to keep acting. At best, he would have had a few cameos in Episode 8. Seeing Rey finishing Han Solo's sentences is actually what made me realize she was a Mary Sue. The movie was also very similar to a New Hope. The empire makes a new 'Death Star' with a very obvious flaw. The heroes destroy it, and it blows up. The end.",3,20,23,6 July 2016
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A timeless comedy!
","The story is very well written! The way Bill and Ted time travel and meet themselves is done brilliantly! I love it when stories come full circle like that! It also shows that Keanu Reeves could act at some point in his career, even if he seems almost robotic now! There were a couple of deus ex machina moments, like the tape recorder, but...it's a travel travel movie! There's no bigger deus ex machina than a time traveling phone booth! The movie is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a late 80's popcorn flick through and through! It has some foul language from Napoleon, so it's probably considered PG-13 now days. Overall, don't take it as historically accurate in ANY sense! It's a comedy, not a history lesson! Sit back and enjoy!",10,0,0,29 September 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Less of a Horror, more of an Action-Dark Comedy
","Cabin in the Woods starts off as almost a stereotypical 80's horror movie as its name implies. However, as it frequently tells you, this has all been done before. It's almost perfect in that regard, but the climax really bothered me. It was the monsters. Instead of fighting amongst themselves, they all worked together to kill the humans. Most of the monsters weren't even the same species! Some of them were human! Why didn't the snake eat the monsters!? This is a very glaring problem! Also, and this is the biggest problem of all, Why the heck is there a button that opens all of the monster containment units at once!? Anyone with half of a brain would never allow such a button to exist! Plus,there was no password either! It's just flip a couple of switches and press a button! Who designed it that way!? That just ruined the movie for me!",1,2,6,4 January 2015
The Proposal," An all around good romance movie.
","It's a bit of a timeless cliché, but it's still good. Off the top of my head, I can't quite remember what movie this most resembles. Anyway, you have the deception relationship, but then over time one of them feels guilty and admits it's all a lie, and runs off, then the couple realize they actually love each other for real and the lie becomes true. Yeah, it's been retold about as many different times and ways as Romeo and Juliet, but it's a good romance comedy all the same. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and charming as always with his shenanigan style acting. Sandra plays the vicious man-eater with a soft heart quite well. It's everything you'd expect from those two stars and more. All and all, I'd highly recommend this movie if you like romantic comedies.",8,1,2,12 June 2011
Beetlejuice," Stop motion animation at it's finest!
","By far my favorite Tim Burton movie as a kid! You can really see the effort and creativity that went into the making Beetlejuice! Few companies even use stop-motion animation anymore in favor of bad CGI! I have to say, I quite surprise that the stoic Batman, Michael Keaton portrayed, was the zany Beetlejuice just one year prior! Keaton definitely has a very broad acting range! Beetlejuice is like one of those fast-talking salesman stereotypes, but it really works! This is also one Geena Davis's best movies, although I found Davis and Baldwin to be rather bland. Honestly, you could switch Baldwin out with David Yost, and Davis with Andie MacDowell, and I don't think anyone would've noticed. Wynona Ryder is very believable teenager with an insufferable family, as intended. Overall, it was a great cast. The story is very straight forward ghosts want humans out of their house.",10,2,3,14 November 2013
