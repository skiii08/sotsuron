Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks and Mr Greengrass
","Without any doubt, this could be an award movie. The subject : Pirates of Somalia, a hot topic and I have to say Â… very good put in scene. I believe Hollywood is spoiling us. I am European and the US movies always have that kind of hero theme ( sorry because of this feeling ). But lately we have very honest movies without that hero theme. That is good news for the cine critics. So, a hot news topic handled with care. Mr Greengrass keeps the tense in the complete movie, you won't turn away your head. Even the origin of the problem is touched when a scene recalls the fishing problem in Africa caused by the richest industrial fishing 'countries'. Even that issue was handled. Mr Hanks and Abdi are doing a great acting job, really outstanding ! Hanks even doesn't have to have lines to say, he is just a good actor you feel the situation. To the end of the movie he is marvelous, just outstanding. It is a thriller, but not just that; at the end you get that feeling, that feeling even you get pity about the situation of these Somalian people, these pirates, and we have to feel pity. In one way, we have caused the their situation they are in. You understand the situation the pirated ended up, the 'why'. You understand the Hank's situation and to the end he is fantastic. Just a great movie. Of course, I couldn't imagine a Hanks doing the job of Mr Costa, the captain of the cruise ship sank near Italy. This must be one of the best roles of the Hanks''s career.",8,2,5,25 October 2013
Gravity," Best visual, 3D movie till today with a superb acting Bullock
","I rated a 10, exceptional, and that it is. I have rated 3 movies with a 10, so it is not my custom way of doing. Certainly better films will come, but today it is one of the best I ever seen. The subject is unique and it is a very hard one not to make a boring movie. It is NOT, you are nailed on your seat. Only 2 actors, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, no site stories, no chases, just Sandra and George and their story to survive in outer space and to try to save themselves. Such a 'clean' movie and such a thriller. Lets make it clear directly : This is a Sandra Bullock movie and she does a superb job. This time George Clooney is just George and providing the movie of some relaxing moments. Sandra Bullock is a good actress and in this movie she proves it. In fact she already did so in Crash, but this one is to confirm it. She has to survive, but she will also overcome her personal problems. Just good acting ! Why she bothers to evolve herself with some crap movies?! You have to see it in 3D, it is a must. The movie will loose a lot when seen in 2D. Their are some fantastic visual shots of earth, of the debris passing by the ISS, of the water floating in space, better said in the theater. The camera-work is done in an almost excellent way. For example when the camera moves in the helmet of Dr Stone, in 3D, it is like you are in her place. The visuals on earth and space is an eye festivity. The story is well done, not complicated, just find the way back you could say and 1:30 hrs is just the time to do so, not boring at all. May be you want to search for some mistakes in the movie. Well there are, obvious. But which movie doesn't have ? Example : On a certain moment it seems there is gravity in space when holding some objects ... OK, that is it. Just go to see it in 3D. It is a masterpiece of today's possibilities in movie making.",8,4,7,11 October 2013
Rush," Not just a movie about F1 and racing.
","I saw the movie poster and the title 'Rush' and that made me decide to NOT see this movie. Then I read the critics and reviews at IMDb and I changed mind. I thought; give it a try. I like F1 and car racing, but a movie should have contents and that was indeed my doubt about 'Rush'. This is NOT a 'Fast and Furious' movie, either a '15 minutes' movie ( Robert de Niro ). This is NOT just a movie about F1 and looking at the laps the cars make. The F1, although present in the movie, is not the main subject. It is the rivalry between 2 pilots, Niki Lauda and James Hunt, which started from the moment they met through 1976, the year of the F1 accident. Their different ways of living, their work and social life. 2 completely different characters put on the screen by Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth. Both not that well known, but they both make a great role, they work fantastic good. It was not a moment boring, it was a pleasure to see Daniel and Chris doing their job and they do it very good !!! Niki Lauda is Austrian and German speaking. Daniel Bruhl talks English with a German accent and parts of the movie is originally spoken en German. This means that it is highly advisable to see this movie in original version and not dubbed.So, it is really a different movie of the other 'racing movies'. We have special effects, we have a bit racing, but moreover : This is a movie about 2 pilots, their life, their target, their professional attitude. And the movie is nice to see for everyone, I think children of +12 included.",8,2,3,30 September 2013
