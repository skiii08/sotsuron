First Man," So boring, we both fell asleep
","I think i understand what the director was try to do but it failed. At no point were you drawn in to this movie. I love history, i love space, i love historical figures. This movie failed at portraying any of that. The only part i felt engaged about was leaving his daughter's bracelet on the moon.",2,2,4,13 January 2019
