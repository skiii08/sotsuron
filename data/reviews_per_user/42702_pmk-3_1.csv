United 93," Very realistic and hits you right on the spot
",I was speechless after seeing this 'movie'. It was like I had been there during the entire film. It also shows you perfectly how complex all of the attacks combined were and how hard it is to decide on how to act as an executive on the right time (which it never seemed to be). When you think all facts are gathered it is history and a new fact turns up. Also complex lines of communication were shown.It shows again how vulnerable we are in the Western world. You can't protect yourself against this without losing your freedom and quality of life. The art is to try to find a balance. Just today (9/11/2008) is again a day to remember.,10,7,13,11 September 2008
