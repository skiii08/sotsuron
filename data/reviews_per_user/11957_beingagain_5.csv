Blade Runner 2049," Must be seen at the cinema
","Im writing this review mainly to say, don't wait for this film to leave the cinema, this is worth seeing at the cinema in its full glory.All actors are up to snuff in this film, there are no real weak performances thankfully, though its visually beautiful its not an eye searing effects blip-vert, and characters have just enough room to develop, decent cinema with nice pacing for a change, OK its difficult for it to surpass the original and it doesn't it, but its probably as good as a follow on movie can get,",8,1,4,25 October 2017
The Machinist," Depressing almost worst kind of Russian Nihilism about it
","There are no real specific spoilers in the following review just theme description and trajectoryThe films seems shot in 'depressocolour' why they insist on washing such films out, to such a degree of dismalness I'll never know, you can use luridity to represent the main theme of paranoid delusion just as well, Bales skeletal weight loss - makes you uncomfortable and scritchy just looking at him on screen, the filmic attention and sound draw inspiration from hitchcocks work but here's something evocative of the Russian gulag about this film, makes you wonder whether the source is drawn the worst period of Russian history, which doesn't seem to match the setting of American culture.If your life is so full of light, that you can handle films this gloomy then drag through it, The plot has some twist but none but a few seem too unpredictable, prosaic plot path sinkhole plunge of it all but the final reveal is alright and reasonable, in its defence the acting is very good if a little turgid on the spectrum of personality types displayed. for me there are allot of other films to watch first before getting round to this, but worthy of attention at some point.",6,1,1,18 May 2016
Ex Machina," Self aware AI thriller
","Far better at tackling very realistically the serious problematic issue of whether humanity should generate a truly self aware sentient AI, far better than interstellar is at physics. must watch you will enjoy if you have a inquisitive mind. Casting and acting all good, dialogue impeccable, this story doesn't waste too much on anything frivolous, its all sparingly done so as to get to the meat of the philosophical matters, no overburden of cgi, just wear needed, this film really nails the idea of a competing intelligence, which is sentient enough to feel the injustice of its lack of freedom, and the idea than any sentience competitive with man might have to be contained, because the potential threat posed would be difficult to establish, because if it were truly sentient it would most undoubtedly lie, and all the ramification of that - on interrelations. The sentience in a way, precludes and nullifies the idea of Asimov's three laws of robotics, coming into play morally.",9,3,6,29 November 2015
Brave," A film riddled with feminist ideology and poor disney stereotypes
","A film based on the tom boy feminist ideology welded to simplistic disney stereotypes.The usual princess story, an immensely privileged tantruming individual portrayed as a victim at the centre of the story, men only good as violent stupid ineffectual oafs for unrealistically un-empowered oppressed women to easily manipulate etc, whilst the lead individual is shown to be superior at all male virtue half the time, she then messes up the world entirely with her youthful arrogance and then practically single handedly recovers, in the usual up a tree down a tree scenario, for her only to end pretty much back at the beginning a little wiser in a way her elders understood, The only in theory beneficial message in the film being to state the arranged marriages are not good, but its probably not watched by any community that might benefit from that message, not that arranged marriages prove completely ineffectual in terms of sustaining birth rates and sometimes making successful marriages, All in all it is a 'cartoon for children' and the parables and metaphors are pretty simplistic, girls get what they want etc, but ultimately the protagonist saves the day, and then gets to write her own ticket and everyones happy, and the adults learn the lessons from the children etc, but theirs no follow up of her still being single at 40 with cats rather than children etc ;) perhaps I care too greatly for more complex realistic parables, On the upside the film is well animated and the quality good, but as per usual as with all essentially kids films, its all just a bit too chintzy disney simplistic, not sure as to the virtue of feeding this kind of fodder to children. and what harm or benefit it really does?",4,1,3,7 March 2018
Cloud Atlas," An Attempt at a film like 'The Hours' that fails to hit the mark
","This film I guess is a valid attempt at a great film like 'The Hours' that just fails to hit the mark. Pretty vapid and bad, the metaphors the morals, the quotes, the philosophy's expressed the time sliced plot switching are all awful, the parables trite, if this is representative of the novel, I pity the novel to. This film seems to be a barometer of those who think they can identify a quality film, whereas really its just an idiot test. The themes are played too much Hollywood / Disney style similarly the stereotyped characters, the oppressed winning through, the cultural reversal, the playing upon other story's too greatly, soy-lent green anyone ? its all so very child like and ham-fisted. And not helped by the fact they have used the same actors for so many parts with only poor make up, to set the characters apart as different from the small range of the actors faces used, and it doesn't really work, nor is it convincing or even logical, and certainly if the intention was to make the cross time parallel character scenario pairings rub nose obvious, its awkward and unnecessary, European's trying to play Asian's, Asian's trying to play western belles and Mexicans etc it just comes off as awkward in fact I don't see how its any less racist than blacking up, you want to portray people of a certain race ? why not simply hire people to play such roles ? instead of using makeup and prosthetics to this extent , or was it a budgetary constraint ? yes one can quite clearly see how it would tickle an actors ego, to be in such a film as they get to attempt to demonstrate their range in the same film, but really its just jarring for the film and there is an effort to try to crudely and artificially stitch the time lines to each other in some ways cross time to end up with some many lives interacting metaphor etc, but some of the lines in this film are heinous and hackneyed, most of the scenario and character relationships you see coming before they're even on the screen practically. The fact this film is rated is so highly is an indictment, I find it hard to believe people cant see through this films general film flam. Its valid to attempt such films but when it fails, its seems more dis-ingenuous, then those films that are at least honest about limited intellect popcorn schlock. It also mildly wreaks to some extent vague populist propaganda of white European's and intolerance of any sort to anything as bad and other globally exported American cultural philosophies. Worst point it plays to a American multicultural audience with ponderous stereotypes, the pseudo Mexican Asian woman (again real bad makeup) who quips 'don't call me a wetback' over the corpse of the evil white gunman who she has bludgeoned to death for shooting her Chihuahua dead, this is cheesy playing to the audience style humour. The philosophical lines such as : 'love could outlive death' and 'it will never amount to more than a single drop in a limitless ocean' which was sadly followed by - 'what is an ocean but a multitude of drops' - I mean really really  if this kind of trite display of child philosophies that appeal to the masses then I guess my review is nought more than  let me see  which rubbish metaphor shall I pick?  A drop of intelligence in an ocean of ignorance?",4,2,8,5 August 2013
