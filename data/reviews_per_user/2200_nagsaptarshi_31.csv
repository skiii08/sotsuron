Ford v Ferrari," Material success vs Excellence- Thumbs Up
","Being a hardcore fan of Christian Bale, I rarely miss any of his movies. But his portrayal of the legendary racer and racing car developer Ken 'Bulldog' Miles in 'Ford vs Ferrari' has simply swept me off my feet. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days rivalry between the car giants Ford and Ferrari where corporate egos of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari changed the complexion of the motorcar racing in the days to come. Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk.
P. S- I am not an F1 freak, yet I loved every frame of it. Such is the power of this movie...",9,2,3,2 February 2020
First Man," A cinematic brilliance!
","First of all, it is not your regular rendezvous with entertainment. It is not a swashbuckling saga of personal redemption.And the best part is, Hollywood at last is not glorifying USA in the cold war versus Russia. Rather it's a complex personal tale of man who endured all the pangs that life could offer in his journey to the 'Moon'. Journey in the literary sense. From the death of his little girl Karen to the loss of his trusted fellow Ed. This is not really a tear jerker. Rather it has been shot in a documentary style giving the viewers a touch of realism.And that is what makes this movie so special. Ryan Gosling as the mourned father first and an astronaut second is just splendid and may end up in winning an Oscar.Claire Foy as Janet is superb. And so are the rest of the cast. Overall a timeless classic which requires little bit of patience of the viewer as the young director Damien Chazelle of La La Land and Whiplash fame takes time to build his characters.And the product he delivers is superb. Be warned, it is not your regular pot boiler. It is rather a complex movie of win and loss, simultaneously. Bravo!!!",8,0,2,12 January 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," You can not save history by killing the present
","You can not save history by killing the present. Exactly thats what was shown here. I mean Dr. Jones did not hesitate to kill snakes to get the Ark. Well, when I was a kid and I watched it for the first time, I thought this was the best movie in the world. Years and decades later when I watch it again, it really does not touch me in the same way. I mean I had to literally dump my logic while watching it. There were thousand of rounds of bullets going past Dr. Jones and none touching him. From land to air to underground to water, Dr,Jones is doing whatever he likes. He kills nearly a hundred Nazi soldiers. I mean its too hard to accept as an adult. In the end, the only takeaway is the theme music. Show it to your teenager kid. He will definitely like it. But in no way it deserves to be in the top 250. There are many better adventure films in the world.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
A Star Is Born," Now I know How Lady Gaga Looks Like
","Well, seeing Gaga donning a character that's pretty terrestrial like us is something extra terrestrial. Yes, she has acted in most part of this film without her usual overdose of make-up. And she has stolen the show with panache. Its hard to believe that the singing sensation of the decade has been acting in just her first movie. An Oscar-worthy performance I believe. Bradley Cooper as the alcoholic and drug addict singer is brilliant as a director and his subdued performance adds value to this wonderfully crafted movie. The songs are superb and so are the lyrics. The movie centers around the couple and the rest of the cast has hardly anything to offer. Quite surprising to see Sam Elliott bagging an Oscar nomination for the supporting actor job with so little screen presence. He has done a terrific job, though. Overall a wonderful movie which has every potential to be a cult in the coming years. Lyrical and poignant- this musical drama is a must watch of this season.",9,2,3,26 January 2019
The Irishman," A movie 20 years late
","The movie is unnecessarily long. There are so many scenes which could easily be done away with. But to add to it a Godfatheresque touch, ace director Scorsese drags it far and far to a point you start feeling bored. Character development of De Niro is brilliant but the same cannot be said about others, particularly John Hoffa or Pacino. On the contrary, De Niro somehow looks nonchalant throughout the movie, while Pacino and Pesci really shine. The de-ageing effect through CGI is ludicrous. I mean, these are old men. Just by some effects you can not make some hepta or octogenarians look young. Had it been released a couple of decades earlier with at least 90 minutes less run-time, it would have been a cult movie. But now its late, very late. Watching two legends Pacino and De Niro sharing screen together for so long is a delight though. Its a good lessons for the highly rated young actors, too. When people want to see a pair on screen, they do not take a call on it fearing they might lose some fans and when they finally take a call positively at the fag end of their career, they have lost their charm. To conclude, it may be a swansong in the careers of the illustrious actor trio by an ace director who is also past his prime. Only if the effort was a little more fascinating. Will give it 7 out of 10 for the love of the actors and the director.",7,2,3,23 February 2020
127 Hours," Triumph of Human Spirit
","Initially I was a bit skeptic to watch another Boyle movie despite being advised by the near and dear ones again and again to watch it.'Slumdog...' is the reason why I was shying away from watching it.Any Hindi movie goer will tell you that they make equal or a better 'Slumdog..' every month or so in India.Yet it created history.And after so many positive reviews on '127 Hours' from all over the world, I thought history repeated itself.And boy,I was so grossly wrong in my preconceived notion about Boyle's caliber.Now lets forget the past and concentrate on what we have in the platter.This is by far the most powerful movie on human will power.It is subtle in its promotion of human spirit as we do not see here one man fighting against hundreds or the triumph of the haven'ts against the have's.Its a story of how a mountain climber trapped in a crevice and destined to die, rescues himself by the sheer will power,self induced motivation and finally the shocking way of cutting off one limb.In just one and half hours Aron Ralston's entire life, his agonies, his regrets, happiness,emotions are brilliantly portrayed.But underneath all the hallucinations,dreams or nightmares, the essence is how he keeps going for long 127 hours despite several odds.I will not get into the details any further.Be it the story line, pace of the movie, camera work,direction,art work,music- everything works so nicely here.Looks like Boyle mastered all his resources after the astounding success of the spicy saga 'Slumdog...' to prove his worth as a thinking director.And he succeeds so brilliantly.It would be unfair not to mention other players of this triumphant.James Franco proves that he deserves much more than accolades from the children for his roles in 'Spiderman'.Simon Beaufoy does great work as co-writer of this brilliantly scripted movie.Kudos to Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle for the brilliant cinematography.And watch out for AR Rahaman for the music composition.He again proves that he is one of the greatest musicians alive on earth and by far, the greatest Indian musician.Finally, I would request all of those who have not yet watched this movie or are skeptic about Boyle as I was earlier, to watch it.Watch it when you are down, watch it when things appear to be impossible to you, because in the end of the movie, you will yourself say 'Impossible is nothing'.Undoubtedly it is Boyle's greatest work and one of the best masterpieces of the past decade.Go,watch it.",9,1,4,18 June 2011
Insomnia," Insomnia succeeds in making me sleep
","After reading rave reviews about the movie, I had high hopes on it.But when I viewed it last night with my wife ,we both said'something was missing!'The movie starts brilliantly;chilling suspense,superb cast, excellent locations.However the speed is lost in the midway once the character of Robin Williams is introduced.Everything is known, no suspense left and then the director suddenly changes the plot.From a murder mystery suddenly the emotional turmoil of a cop becomes the pivotal theme.The conflict of the plots is what makes the second half of the movie a bit dull.Many question remains unanswered.Like, why on earth did the murder of the girl take place?If it was by chance, how did Robin suddenly become a cold blooded killer from an author?The director should have shown something more about his past.Pacino again delivers a brilliant job and looks perfect as an insomniac.However both Robin Williams and Swank could not match his brilliance.Robin I must say disappoints as a villain.So I would recommend it only for the die hard Al Pacino fans.6 out of 10.",7,0,1,18 February 2009
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A bad cop is always the right thing!
","I never wanted to like this movie. Right from its bad title. But I had to.Such a well made movie on redemption, that you can hardly give it a no no. Wonderfully acted by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell who deservedly win Oscars for this, this is a masterpiece of a saga of David vs Goliath in a different way. Loved the journey all thorough. Just missed an award for Woody as there was no option left. A great movie to love, like and share to those who have lost every hope on life yet want a glorious redemption. I am a miser to give it 9 stars.",9,2,3,8 February 2019
Lion," This 'Lion' extracts the human in you
","Lion is a gripping tale of humanity often found missing in the whirlwind of androids and machines, Hollywood is so much fascinated with, these days. It is a poignant saga of an Indian boy lost at a tender age of 5.The film narrates the odyssey of that kid Saroo, through a grey world full of greed, lust, decaying values and finally redeeming himself in a world of light and hope. Ever since the film released or it created so much buzz at the Oscars, (It did not get any though, even after getting 6 nominations!) I was craving for watching it. As the film was not shown in any of the screens near the place where I live, I had to wait for the DVDs to release. And whoa! It was worth waiting for such a gem of a movie. Broadly the movie is divided in two parts. Whilst the first part portrays kid Saroo's never ending struggle in the Indian allays, stations, slums and finally ending up being adopted by an Australian couple, the second half narrates the turmoil of the grown up Saroo to relive his lost childhood. The contrasts portrayed in the two halves mellifluously showcase the differences between the two worlds in the same planet - India and Australia, poverty and luxury, dirty lanes and posh suburbs, pain and love, hunger and abundance, loathe and affection. The gruesome experiences of little Saroo in the streets of India leave you petrified in horror. The reality of the pathos and agonies in an Indian's life has been shot with so much honesty that you are left awestruck at the genius of the director. The scene where the kid with a spoon mimics a young guy in the posh restaurant is there to stay in your heart forever. On the contrary, the scenes in Australia have been shot with extensive hues and colors to symbolize the aplomb in grown up Saroo's life. This was the first feature film directed by Garth Davis and what a splendid job he has done in his first outing! He is sensible and sensitive and the subject he picked for his debut movie is indeed a matter of Indian and International concern. The movie is based on the autobiographical book of Saroo Brierley- 'A Long Way Home', a literary gem in its own merit. But the panache with which Davis adopts this into a movie is simply fabulous. With him being the latest entrant, list of my favorite Hollywood directors is ever increasing.Dev Patel as adult Saroo is brilliant to say the least. His expressions as someone who cannot get over his past even amidst abundance and a secured life are fabulous. The climax scene where he celebrates with his real mother even without understanding her language epitomizes his brilliance in essaying human emotions with élan. With a successful track record already, this young actor has a very bright future ahead. Nicole Kidmanhas done a fantastic job as the kind hearted Sue. She had a quiet spell in the last decade or so. But a riveting performance in 'Lion' catapults her once again in the forefront. Both Nicole and Patel deservedly earned Oscar nominations in supporting casts, albeit without winning. But the show stealer in this magnum opus is definitely Sunny Powar. It would not be an overstatement to say that this little kid has delivered one of the finest performances ever by any actor of his age group in a long, long time. The ease with which he essays the pangs of little Saroo, the poignancy of a child dwelling in an Indian orphanage is mesmerizing. You are bound to love the innocence this kid has in his eyes. If nurtured rightly, he has the potentials of becoming a super talent soon. All other actors do justice to their roles while you long for a little longer screen time of our very own Nawazuddin Siddiqui.The plight of the children in the orphanages in India is a subject hardly any activists have taken up. It is said every year 80,000 children are lost from India alone. No garbed 'Rakshak' bothers to care for them. Kudos to this foreign director for handling this sensitive subject with utmost sincerity and empathy. When Kidman says' We did not take any child because we thought the world is full of orphans who need care', you feel the honesty of the intention of the director. When the movie ends with actual footage of Saroo, I bet you can hardly keep your eyes dry. This is a wonderful cinematic experience you should not miss as the effects of the theme will stir your heart for long. In every street child in India, there lives a Saroo. This movie just opens up our eyes to see them, perceive their grief and care about them.P.S:Throughout the movie, I was wondering why this is titled 'Lion'. The reason is shown in the end title.",9,0,2,3 April 2017
The Revenant," The Brilliant 'Revenant'
","I am not sure why they portray it as a revenge saga.Revenge is definitely a part, a big part of it.But to call it a story of revenge only is like calling a sea just a pool of brackish water.There are so many interwoven philosophies, that when the revenge does take place, you are already taken away to a mystic world, world where vengeance means little, embarking on a journey which teaches you how to survive the worst, life has offered you and yet come up with a spirit to endure more, to invite more and to sustain till the last breath of life becomes everything.Since my teenage, I have always rooted for Leo to win an Oscar every time he gets a nomination since 'What's eating Gilbert Grape'.And every time, as Leo returned empty handed, my heart went down as if it was the last time.But he came back with a bang every time.And continued winning 4 more nominations.And continued returning bare handed.But this time, while I watched the masterpiece saga' The Revenant', something deep inside started saying' Yes, it's the time'.In every frame, in every moment, it makes you feel, this was just made for him to win an Oscar.Because what Leo delivered here, is something you can not look beyond in any acting dictionary to better.What a visual treat Alejandro González Iñárritu has given you in this epic tale of survival!Every frame becomes etched in your mind as if you are living in the world construed by him.When I had watched this movie, it was yet to win 12 Academy nominations.But I was certain that it was a sure entry for the cinematography.The mountains, the river, the water, the blood, the snow, the ridges- everything so vividly portrayed.Tom Hardy did an exceptional job as the villain.It must have been an extreme difficult job for an actor of his stature to portray second fiddle.But there lies his finesse.The background score is fabulous, too.Overall a movie you hardly affor to miss.Fantastic -'The Revenant'.",9,2,5,19 January 2016
Hugo," Visually brilliant, otherwise average.
","When you get to see that Scorsese is out of his comfort zone and making a movie on the early days of movie making, you got to be curious.The product in the plater is good but certainly not the best of its kind.The poster, the ambiance created by the ace director in the trailers of the movie, the going gaga of the people over it certainly make you thirsty for something outstanding. Unfortunately the thirst remains unquenched.The story is bit too tad and takes longer than you can wait for to build up.Then gradually you expect a grand finale, an outstanding climax which will make amends for the lost time.Sadly enough, you leave the movie hall without that.The acting by the lead actors is OK to say the most.At times Cohen or even the maestro Kingsley go over OTT. The kids do alright.So do the others.But nothing special which can compensate for the lacunae in the storyline is there.The mystery about the kid's father's ( why on earth did Jude Law accept that role) death remains unanswered.The chemistry between the young boy and the girl was half heartedly built.But the outstanding achievement of the director was in getting a stage which is visually brilliant.The use of lights and shadows, the tinkering sounds, the visual effects, the brilliant photography makes the film look exquisite.The Academy people were judicious enough to give this film 5 Oscars, all for its technical superiority and nothing for any of the mainstream awards.Overall, apart from its technical finesse, its certainly not of Scorsese's best.And for movie on movie making, Cinema Paradiso remains way better than this one.",6,0,0,1 October 2014
The Intouchables," 'The only trace of our passage on earth'- Perfect 10
","Once your days on earth are numbered, you take a notebook and start writing those beautiful things happened to you during your lifetime. The positive ones will take more than one book to write them down. Those are the things you take away with you to eternity. This beautiful movie is one of those things that give you the feelings how good your life was. Take my word, this is one of the rare movies with heart in its right place. Last time I felt such a beautiful feeling was after watching Green Book. You are right. The Avengers do not move me, the DC does not allure me . To me a good movie is just like 'the only trace of our passage on earth' just what Phillipe had said in the movie about arts. The movie was so poignant yet so much filled with joy just like the way it tells about the disabled- they do not need your pity, they need your company. The fact that it is based on a true story makes you feel even more positive about the people around, about the hues of life, shades of grief. Brilliantly directed, wonderfully acted with beautiful interluding music blended in just the right places, this gem of an art deserves to be applauded while standing. A perfect 10.",10,0,0,8 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Thank God it Ended
","Lots of creepy characters, lots of meaningless action scenes, a vast number of superheroes (None having any purpose whatsoever) together make this extravaganza of buffoonery which had the world dancing to its tune. Thank God the franchise is over, or else we would have to bear the pain of people going crazy and wasting hours over discussing the piece of c.. that it was.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Great Grand Show misses its greatness slightly
","Well, 4 Oscars. You are kidding me, huh! But yes, it has got. Ask them about Psycho? It got 4 nominations. Oscars can be a bit baffling at times. Anyways, not a bad movie. Indeed a good one. But can never be a great without that Oscar tag. Sadly, there was no chance of Ralph Fiennes grabbing an Oscar as his role was not of an protagonist or a supporting cast. It was good all the way. But, never ever a great movie as has been portrayed. An honest opinion.So not wasting much of a webpage.",7,0,0,14 February 2019
City of God," Blood, brothers and Brazil- A Masterpiece
","This is not your regular Mills and Boon story. So be cautioned if you are planning to watch this movie. The way people are gunned down in the movie, you might wonder if even chickens are slaughtered in that way or not. And probably that is the reason , the movie starts with a chicken slaughter.But this is the truest depiction of Brazil in that period. The lawlessness prevailing due to a callous Government regime, the fearlessness of the people due to a corrupt police system, growing addiction of the young generation, lack of education everything has been portrayed in an impartial manner. The hard hitting dialogues, the impassioned ambitions, the rise and fall of the gangsters everything is so credible.You are not going to be bored for a single moment in the movie even though the run-time is over two hours.Those who have beautiful fantasies of the streets of Rio, the voluptuous samba dancers, soccer skills of the youngsters may be shocked to see the harsh realities of life. The film is based on a true story and every detail of the story has been depicted in a documentary style, making it even more enjoyable for those who want to experience the life and cultures of the land of Samba. Overall a must watch for those craving for high quality cinematic experience.No wonder this is regarded as one of the finest movies of all time.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
Room," 'Room' is a winner
","So finally here is one cinematic experience of a lifetime.It starts in a claustrophobic tone, gradually cheers up and finally ends up in an introspective mood.The basic idea of the movie is how we adjust ourselves in different circumstances.Things can be easy even when the externals are odd.Things can be tough even when everything is a bed of roses.It is up to us and how we cope with the change.And only the brave can fight it back to normalcy.This is what you call a layered plot, interwoven with human emotions like joy, sadness, madness,depression and sense of freedom.Brie Larson as Joy (Ma) is brilliant.Her expressions,change of tone,hysteria,eyes lit up the character and its pleasures and agonies.Deservedly she bagged the coveted Academy Award.Joan Allen as the sensitive grandmother does a brilliant job.But it is the kid Jacod Tremblay who steals the show.He is too brilliant actor for a kid of his age.His narration towards the end of the movie makes your eye moist.The other casts do justice to their small roles.'Room' is a winner all through.",9,0,1,14 March 2016
Sultan," Sultan rules over your heart
","Remember the climax scene of 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam'. A devastated Salman talking to God.There was hardly a face in the theater not chuckling seeing his pathetic acting skills in a scene which was supposed to be poignant.That was the lowest point of that otherwise beautifully crafted film.And that made me wonder if Salman would ever learn to act.He had already spent more than a decade in the industry by then.After the ebb, it took nearly one and half decades for him to showcase his acting skills in the lovable drama 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' last year.But this year he shows his elan in even a bigger and better way.As an actor.Pun intended.'Sultan' barring the first half an hour is an outright lovable rom- sports movie made to moisten your eyes in parts and brighten up your spirits all through.I am not going into the details of the story.Rather I would just emphasize on how poignantly Sallu portrays the character of a tormented, heart broken yet innocent fallen star.Perhaps this is the first time he has accepted a role that singularly rests on his acting abilities and not on his machismo or hackneyed mannerisms.And he delivers! Yes, he rips off his shirt.But not amidst the the bikini clad firangi lasses in an exotic location.He unbuttons his shirt to have a pitiful glance at his tummy.To portray the pathos of a pot bellied middle aged frustrated sports star.How beautiful idea!His initial exuberance, jubilation and gradual anger, depression,reticence and finally redemption- all the emotions have been so beautifully portrayed that even if you are not a Salman fan, you start loving this Khan. This is undoubtedly the career best performance of Salman. Anushka looks ravishing in a character which vascilates between ambition and family.Initially she tries too hard to match Salman's charisma but gradually picks up and delivers a decent job.As Akaash, Amit Sadh is endearing. Randeep Hooda, one of the most evolved actors of Bollywood in the recent past, is a bit too over the top.It looks like his character has shades of Brad Pitt of 'Moneyball'. Anant Vidhaat Sharma as Sultan's buddy through thick and thin delivers a standout performance. The direction is good if not great.Dialogues are crispy and corny,too.Camera works are exceptional especially during the first half.Music barring the theme song and the melodious 'jag ghoomeya' does not rise above mediocrity.However,the biggest problem with this movie is its length.Had the editing been bit crispier and the film would have been half an hour less in duration minus a few unnecessary songs, it could have easily been one of the finest movies of Bollywood.But do not undermine the power of 'Sultan'.Even with its flaws, Sultan will rule your heart for quite some time. Don't miss the extravaganza at any cost.After all sports movies are not made regularly in India.",8,2,3,24 July 2016
Pawn Sacrifice," Don't you think it is too good?
","I was bit skeptic on whether I should watch this movie or not.There has been so much of slamming of this movie.It did not even have a wide release.But thank God, I dared to watch.It is one of most intense movies of recent times.From the beginning,your eyes remain glued to the screen.The historic match between Spassky and Fisher has been depicted so vividly, that at times you forget that you are watching a movie.Tobey Maguire has been criticized a lot for his portrayal of the legendary chess player.But I found him too good.His acting was as intense as this movie.The frowning, the clenching, the swing of mood everything was made so much believable.Liev Shreiber, too has done a commendable job as Spassky.The cinematography is excellent.The close shots deserve to be mentioned in particular.Finally, a good film from a brilliant director like Zwick after a pause.Do not miss this movie.",9,30,39,19 February 2016
Uri: The Surgical Strike," How's the movie? A masterpiece, sir.
","The general mood of the nation is somber after the terrorist attack at Pulawa. Like everyone else, I am, too depressed. So, just to get out of the gloom, the pensive mood, I thought of visiting the theater to watch 'Uri', Which I have deliberately skipped watching so far considering it as an election propaganda of the present day Government. How wrong I was! In thinking too much about the political motive behind the making of the movie, I was about to miss a masterpiece. This won't at all be an over statement to say that this is perhaps one of the finest flicks ever made in India. The screenplay is the real king of the movie. There is not a single moment of melodrama in the entire 138 minute journey. There were ample scopes to make it a tear-jerker and spoil the slick look .But this is New India.They know how to make movies of international standard sans those age old songs and dances,jingoist war cries, hyperbolic villains or skimpily clad vamps. Contrary to the popular belief, there is hardly a scene to glorify any person or a party.It's a hardcore action movie in a warlike situation.Right from the first scene, the debutante director makes his intention clear. He has a solid story in his platter and he chooses to execute it in style.And the result is- a classy entertainer. Vicky Kaushal has yet again proved why he is being considered as one of the finest young actors of this country. At times I wondered if he really is an army man hiding in Bollywoof for a secret mission! So great is his portrayal of Major Vihan Singh Shergill, a man on a mission to avenge the brutalities inflicted on his fellow men. Paresh Rawal in the Ajit Dovalesque character is credible as ever.The others, too do justice to their limited yet meaningful roles. The cinematography is fabulous and at times make you believe that you are watching a Hollywood movie directed by some League One Director. The dialogues are crisp and soul touching. Overall, an out and out entertainer executed in classy style.Do not dare to miss this one.

Steve Jobs," Steve Apple Jobs
","This is more of a well made documentary.Portraying the ruthlessness of the great Apple man,this movie although meticulous in making, gets a bit flat at times.There is not much emotion, true to the title character himself.I expected this to be a kind of redemption story which it is not.From the beginning till the very end it remains sugarless.There are moments which with just a pint of emotions would have been more appealing.However, this film stands tall in the department of acting.Michael Fassbender does a wonderful job in the title character.He is stern, stoic,ruthless and at times a bad human being abusing everyone including his near and dear ones.Kate Winslet as his Secretary is simply a winner.Her character so opposite to that of Jobs has so many shades- sympathy,affection,loyalty,sensitivity,care- you name it you have it.And Kate does more than a brilliant job to express every emotion.Her unsaid love for Steve is a treasure of this movie.Overall a good movie, albeit greatness in some aspects.",7,0,1,16 March 2016
Joker," Joker- The Film of the Decade
","The basic difference in the movie-making styles of Hollywood and Bollywood is that while Bollywood is adept in making an inspiring tale like that of Anand Kumar to a comical, nonsense trash like Super 30, Hollywood makes a once in a generation movie from a DC comic book character and adds a gem like Joker in its treasure trove. The movie right from the word go grips you, gets into you, grows within you, questions your own sanity and does not leave you hours or days after the end credits have rolled. Backed by a tight screenplay, this latest offering from the director Tim Roth of the Hangover fame, this movie has a chilling undertone in each and every frame. Joker follows the basic theorems of movie-making. There are no unnecessary complications or ostensibly layered outlook, which makes this an edge of the seat thriller. The background score, especially in the transformation scenes, is scintillating. Many people have touted it as a tribute to the Scorsese style of film making. But to be true, barring the Departed, Scorsese never played it so simple in any of his movies. Joker in every sense is a path breaker. It won't be an overstatement to say that Roth has actually outshined another maverick filmmaker of this generation, the great Christopher Nolan in portraying the character of Joker, even though his movie on the same character has different premises.A commentary on this great tale will be incomplete without talking about its protagonist Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Legend says that he actually lived in the skin of this character for the last couple of years. His devotion, his sacrifice, his understanding of the character-everything is reflected in every single moment of this movie. This is something you don't believe can exist. He is so normal in portraying an insane, abnormal, complex character like Joker that you start believing as if it's happening for real. The pain the society inflicted on him, the fear of failure, and the depression of being a loser in life and finally liberating the inner pathos through his vendetta and seeking pleasure in bringing anarchy in the society- every emotion has been made visceral by the ace actor. If he does not get the Oscar for this, I think millions of movie lovers like me will lose faith in the credibility of the Academy Awards. Like Vivien Leigh of Gone With the Wind, Humphrey Bogart of Casablanca, Jack Nicholson of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Meryl Streep of Kramer Vs Kramer or Natalie Portman of Black Swan, Joaquin Phoenix will be remembered for the decades to come for his iconic portrayal of this iconoclastic character.
P.S- Phoenix makes Joker so real, you may start loving the negative shades. The real movie starts after this movie ends on the silver screen. Get ready to face the Joker in you.",10,1,1,11 October 2019
Parasite," 'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food
","Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre.",9,11,16,9 February 2020
Halloween," Thank God I consumed Rum before watching Halloween
","I must admit had I not consumed rum before watching this movie, I would have been really really scared.In fact, I am a person who can be easily scared by movies with this much quantum of scare.Its basically a small budget movie with perfect use of cast, light and sound.Its a bit slow in the beginning and starts getting over you as the movie progresses.Gradually it grows over you, makes you feel scared, really scared and you start worrying about your near and dear ones as such psychopaths exist around you.The climax was the highlight of the movie as the intensity of the eerie nature of the movie reaches its height.There are a few lacunae in the movie.There is no character development.Why there was so sparse population downtown on a festive day that also remains unexplained.But in the end, it is a satisfying scary movie.But as I have already told you, a pint of my rum was helpful in overcoming the fear...Hope you enjoy this classic.",8,0,0,13 January 2018
Marriage Story," An earnest and poignant portrayal of divorce
",It is pathetic to see that imdb has kept it in Comedy genre. This will mislead a lot of people like me who are not actually fans of Hollywood comedies.Such a foolish idea! This is rather a very poignant and realistic tale of separation of two beautiful people. This is not for the Avengers lovers. This is rather a slow paced drama created with much empathy and sensitivity. The protagonists are superb in their roles. Adam Driver in a low key role excels. Scarlett Johansson as always is brilliant. Do not miss this even if you are happily married. Just to learn a few more things to add to your relationships so that you don't end up like them.,8,4,5,25 March 2020
Blade Runner," A very ordinary movie overhyped by its followers
","I know this review is going to be hated by many but I am just writing my own feelings. Why do they love this movie so much? I mean what was special in it? Some flying cars, a depressing milieu, some overacting- is these what make this a top movie? I was not at all entertained by this one. Was it a futuristic movie? You will probably laugh at the pathetic portrayal of the future. There was a scene where the protagonist looks at a picture and the the director forgets that he is actually portraying past from the perspective of 2017 and the picture is black and white. You know what I mean. He shows past from 1982 only and not 2017. Its indeed a very poor movie overhyped for some unknown reasons. Watch it yourself and judge my review.",4,1,3,8 May 2020
A Walk to Remember," Sweet, Inspiring,Uplifting
","Well, this movie has received mixed reactions from the critics.There have been efforts to thrash the immaturity level of the movie as well as Mandy Moore's acting skills.However both are unjustified.In fact, the director succeeds in making one of the most romantic tales of our time.And Mandy Moore manages to deliver her role brilliantly, bringing on screen the cherubic look the role demanded.And her expressions were simply loving.I was not sure whether I really wanted to watch this movie or not.Was thinking that it might be just another movie about the college going teens, their 'American' way of living and some torrid affairs.Hell, I was wrong.This movie is an inspiring tale of love, of unfailing faith.Its about sacrificing.Its about rising in love.Just finished watching the movie with my wife and I must tell at the end we were just holding each other and silently shedding tears.Then we realized we have many things to do for each other,: things which we had promised to do long ago but could not do.If you have watched it, well and fine.If you have not yet, then you are really missing something which should not be missed at least by them who still believes in the power of love, believe in something ' which can't be seen, but can be felt'Forget about the critics, forget about movie making, go and watch this movie.It is surely gonna make you feel a lot better at the end and make you realize that you still have many unfinished things in your list.",9,4,6,19 August 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," There are thousands of Bollywood movies better than this.Then why SM?
","First of all let me say that this movie brought Oscars for three Indians, AR Rahaman, Gulzar and Russel Pukutty.So there was a big reason for the Indian audience to cheer for Danny's team.But frankly speaking, the movie lacks substance as compared to many Hollywood films made in 2008 and also below par than many Bollywood flicks made every year.May be it was with this movie that Western audience got a touch of the flavor of Indian style of film making and Indian way of living.And for this it is a landmark movie in its own right.But then,winning 8 Oscars is a big deal, Isn't it and any Indian would say if that could win 8, what was wrong with the likes of Rang De Basanti,Taare Zameen Par or Lagaan? All of those beautiful movies earned a niche for themselves by their merit, which unfortunately SM could not achieve.I would never say it is a trash but then again its not a gem either. P.S: For those western audiences who think it deserved eight Oscars,I recommend a few Indian movies like the one I already mentioned + Chak De India,Parinda,Satya,Company,Shiva,Parzania,Black Friday,Swades,Ab Tak Chappan.The list will be too long to be accommodated here.So skip SM and go for the ones I recommended. The final thing, thanks to SM and Danny for at least bringing Indian style of film making to the western world, which is a wonderful achievement and deserves loads of accolades.",6,2,3,4 July 2010
13 Hours," When Bay becomes a sea- superb
","Finally a Michael Bay movie without his typical style.13 hours is an honest depiction of a heroic struggle of a number of individuals stranded in a confusing situation at Benghazi, Libya.The plot takes care to develop the characters. In fact half of the first half is meticulously used to develop the characters and the tempo. But once everything is in place, BOOOM. Once the movie started taking gear, you cannot practically even blink. The director does not make any effort to make any political commentary. He simply shows the events through the eyes of those who were there. Unfortunately, this was the lowest grossing film of Bay's career. Maybe this will become a cult movie in the coming years. Strongly recommended.",9,1,1,10 May 2020
The Martian," Unimpressive saga of personal victory
","When was the last time they made a simple and humane out-of-the world movie? The theories of rocket science definitely are marring the beauty of film making in all the recently released movies of this genre.The Martian is the latest entrant in the category.After nearly two and half hours of being grilled, you are left with little to cheer for in the climax.Acting, cinematography everything was alright.But the biggest failure of this movie is that it never is gripping at any point of time.When this movie earned seven Academy Awards nominations, I was a bit worried that The Revenant may get defeated by it.But after finishing watching it, I am sure, it has chances of returning empty handed.Go, watch this movie only if you have ample time to waste.",6,1,5,6 February 2016
The Fighter," Perhaps the best redemption movie
