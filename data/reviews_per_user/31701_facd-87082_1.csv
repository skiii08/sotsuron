Walk the Line," Perfect duet
","Walk the Line is a delightful and plausible biographical music drama of 2005. This movie reveals the life story of the great musician Johnny Cash. We see his childhood and the way he became a star. In the picture we witness his relationship with his second wife. We see an amazing life story of a talented man, whose life was full of different events: incredible ups and downs, the tragic loss of his beloved, and the meeting with true love ...The film is interesting and atmospheric. I really liked this musical drama. I enjoy biographical films and this one is inspiring, and the story of John Cash is shown realistically. Joaquin Phoenix is a talented and good actor, and starring in this drama he looked decent and acted gorgeously. The role of talented Cash is extremely complex and contradictory, but Phoenix coped with it with a bang. Reese Witherspoon fascinated me in this movie. She acted so charmingly and cleanly that she even got an Oscar for this role. I liked the duet of these actors and it was nice to watch them together. Walk the Line is a strong, beautiful, and clean film that revealed to us a bright and realistic life of an excellent musician, and it's definitely worth watching.",Null,1,1,11 April 2018
