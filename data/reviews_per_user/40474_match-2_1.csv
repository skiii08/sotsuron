Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie is everything it should be, the beginning of the greatest tale ever to grace the screen.
","'The Phantom Menace' has all the glitz and glamour you'd expect from a film directed by George Lucas, but it also is a fantastic example of why Star Wars is true greatness.  It is a very fine line that has to be minded to bring in the new generation for an audience and continue to impress the loyal fans that have worshipped this movie for over two decades, this movie masterfully does both.  The duels are fantastically intense, and the sheer beauty of the worlds is awe inspiring.  I was entertained and amazed throughout the entire film, and I recommend it not only to the tried and true Star Wars fans all over the world, but to those who are just beginning their journey to a galaxy far, far away.",10,0,1,18 May 1999
