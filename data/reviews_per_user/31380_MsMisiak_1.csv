Casablanca," Casablanca Party
","We determined, independently, 'Casablanca' as the greatest film of the 20th century, and held a themed party on Jan.31,1999 in its honor in Destin, FL at the 'Beachwalk' cafe.  All the wait staff dressed in costumes, entrees were themed, the movie was on wide screen, and Bogey and other cast look-alikes dressed up and circulated.  I played Sam, the piano player.For those classic movie fans who like this sort of party, please visit the 'BeachWalk' in Destin!Much obliged,:) Mary",Null,1,1,4 April 2003
