The Incredible Hulk," A much better start to the franchise
","The incredible Hulk tells us the story of a scientist on the run named Bruce Banner (Edward Norton). We get glimpse of an experiment gone wrong and catch up with Banner in Brazil. Banner is looking for a cure for something and since we all know what the film is about it isn't much of a mystery. Through an accident at the soda factory Banner works at a drop of his blood makes it to the US in a bottle revealing his location to General Ross (William Hurt) who is hunting Banner. An elite group of soldiers is sent to Brazil led by General Ross and a special forces legend, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). As Banner is pinned down he transforms beating several special forces agents and Blonsky. After his escape Banner seeks out his lost love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to help him find a man who may be able to help him. As General Ross, who is also Betty's dad, closes in on Banner he convinces Blonsky to take part in several super solder experiments to help him fight the Hulk leading to the creation of another monster.All in all this film is far better then Ang Lees 2003 train wreck the Hulk. The FX were brilliant and the Hulk looked great. The Hulk was very real looking and felt like a character not a cool addition to the film. The action was smooth and we got a good villain instead of hulked out dogs.I thought Edward Norton was perfect as Banner both in his stature and quit desperation for a cure. It was really cool to see a skinny and weakly looking Banner turn into the huge and powerful Hulk. Tyler, Hurt, and the other actors also do a fantastic job of contributing to the story. Roth is great as an aging soldier presented with the chance to become everything he used to be and more. He provides a great glimpse into how power corrupts.The script flowed well getting rid of the cheese the seeped out of Ang Lee's Hulk. It was funny in a realist way and still communicated what was happening. The only real issue with the story was how crammed everything felt. At times I wished I had seen more of Banners time alone and how it got him to where he was. I guess I also wished Norton had had the opportunity to really let us see Banners pain in being alone.I must say there were a lot of tips to Hulk fans as well. The scenes that mirrored the old TV show, the use of the TV show theme, Lou Ferrigno included in a cameo and as the Hulks voice, the purple pants, Hulk in the rain with Betty. All of those things pushed my geek buttons which was a lot of fun.The only problem this film really had was that it came out in the summer when we got Iron Man and The Dark Knight. I think that those two films helped to bury a very good story. Not that those films are evil it just may have not been the best idea to release this film in the same summer as those two.",7,3,5,22 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My dear lord how can this be!!!!
","I love Star Wars! The original three that is. I was so excited when I heard this film was coming out. My mind swam with the possibilities of what was to come, but I had to calm myself so that I didn't get my hopes to high. I didn't want to go in think this was to be the greatest thing ever and ruin it for myself. Luckily I didn't have to ruin it cause Lucas did a real good job of it himself.We start off finding out that there are trade issues or some political blah blah blah and some group we have never heard of have created a road blo... I mean, space block preventing something from happening on this planet called Naboo. The child queen is upset cause no one listens to the problem (that happens when you are only 13, talk about teenage anxiety) and Jedi are sent in to sort the whole thing out.Here we meet the stale and unresponsive Jedis. HOW CAN THIS BE? These guys are played by two fantastic actors (Liam Neeson and Ewen McGregor). How does Lucas get such bland and flat acting from these two great guys? Well anyways these Jedi are real dumb and get pinned in a room and have to fight off moronic battle droids (not really scary just real annoying and dumb) and end up on Naboo with a Jamacian alien (I don't understand either).Here is the First major issue, Jar-Jar Binks. Every time he opens his mouth I wish to shot myself. he is a useless character who provides no comedy, no insight into what is happening and creates no feel of caring for his people from us. A useless tool used by Lucas to let us know he has made so much cash selling action figures he can create an all CGI character, WWWOOOOOOOWWW! The rest goes down hill from there. We get racial and prejudice slurs from the Jedi, moronic plot devices and stupid dialog from the writing, FX that are so easy to see through it makes me embarrassed for the FX guys. Lucas force feeds us useless things that we have no need of (why does Qui-Gon really have to explain the midiclorian thing?) and then gives us even more ridiculous stuff to remind us this is a prequel to the others, did you forget, PROBABLY NOT!! We meet R2-D2, what a coincidence that he happens to meet Luke and Leias mom and dad, C3PO, yet another strange coincidence but get this Anikin made him *barf*. Oh, and get this, Anikin apparently has the hots for the queen, I wonder if they will get married especially after all the cheap moments of the 10 year old hitting on Natalie Portman.Lucas writing style has really gone down hill or he just doesn't care anymore. Watch A New Hope and then immediately watch this film and you will be surprised at how childish this one seems. I challenge ya to do it.",1,1,3,17 May 2006
Star Trek," This is Star Trek People
","After years of telling people why I like Trek they can see a film that puts the original series into full light.Star Trek follows the creation of the greatest crew to explore the far reaches of space. The opening scenes show us a dramatic and moving battle between the USS Kelvin and the time displaced ship Nerada. This battle introduces the villain Nero (Eric Bana) and shows us the birth of James Kirk. Jump ahead 25 years and we see Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) take two different paths to Starfleet and the adventure to stop the vengeance filled Nero begin.Lets start with the amazing story. The script perfectly captured the characters, drama, terror, and passion of the franchise. One scene at the beginning of the film was so moving I had tears in my eyes. Just the beginning reveals the quality of what is in store for old Trek fans and the new ones to come.Star Trek does an amazing job of capturing everything that makes Star Trek brilliant. Being a crazed fan since childhood I tell you this film communicated all the qualities that make Star Trek great. While us Trekies get our fill the film does not turn off new fans and in fact shows them the charm and beauty of this franchise (if I had a buck for every non-Trek fan friend who has asked to borrow my DVDs). Gone are the things that weighed down the last three Trek series (techno babble, the need for a deep understanding of TOS and TNG, etc.).The actors were brilliant perfectly capturing each character. I seriously felt like I was meeting old friends after years of their absence. Chris Pine was smart in not trying to imitate Shatner but was still able to show some of Shatners Kirk mannerisms. Quinto had a tough job in the film considering that Nimoy was also in the film. Even with this mirror image Quinto played Spock perfect. Nero was a fantastic villain providing us with a great excuse for a restart.The special effects are beyond description. The sheer beauty of it all was to much to take in on the first showing. Lucas needs to take lessons from these guys.If you have not seen this film you must. Heck, it is probably hitting dollar theaters soon so no excuses.",10,5,10,29 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Holding judgment for now.
","I didn't put down a star vote yet cause I don't think it is fair to rate this film with out seeing the last movie, which comes out next year. The evil tease I know it is.The first Pirates movie was amazing showing us Depp at some of his best and adventure in ways we forgot it could be. It would be very hard to follow that up and while watching this film I wondered, did they try to hard? This film starts with the apparently ruined wedding of Elizabeth and Will. We are never really told why it is not really happening, though it is an out door wedding and it is raining. While we observe Elizabeth on the ground apparently in grief some officers show up and arrest her and Will for helping Jack in the last film. They then convince Will to go to Jack so that they can collect jack and his strange compass.Sounds like a good plot and things sound even more interesting when you learn that Jack owes Davey Jones (not from the Monkees) his soul for allowing Jack to capn the Black Pearl.The acting was again amazing as were the FX in the film. The cast of soul captured pirates who serve Davey Jones look amazing and some what smelly. THe problem I found with this film, and I hope the next will fix, is that it was a lot like the first in plot but lacked the imagination and pace of the first.I found my self watching many useless scenes in which nothing was served except to make the film well over two hours (the fight in the bar when we meet the now bum like Norrington served nothing for the film at all and was so boring). We do get to see many of the old characters in great light and hear many well written references to the first but they get lost among useless and drawn out film.There were other plot tools I found some what dumb as well. The romantic triangle between Elizabeth, Jack, and Will was painful and did not seem honest to any of their characters (at least Elizabeths and Jacks).This film did have many fun parts in it and was good and all but was not great or fantastic. I found myself wishing they had left out much of it and explained other smaller things (I got some being a history buff and all but found some others wondering about them), like who are the bad guys after Jacks compass, who is Davey Jones, w2here did the two funny British soldiers go (man I missed them).Like I started off saying, this film may end up better when the last one is out and I can put lots of stuff together. I hope that next one does not drag however and allows us to return to the magic of the first Pirates movie.",Null,0,0,21 July 2006
Crash," A message that is easy to ignore
","Crash is a film that was supposed a great commentary on race relations in our country. This was stated as being a film that made us seriously look at who we were really like on the inside challenging our internal perceptions.The story follows several characters through out a disturbing group of events all involving racially charged situations. We get everything from a racist perverted cop, a clean young self righteous cop, yuppie victims of a break in, a mixed race couple in which one is racist against the others race, and a few more. The actors do a very good job but fall victim to an overloaded film. It is hard to find time to care for may of these characters plights when there is no time to really get to know them. The best example is when there is an attempt to make us sympathize with the racist cop. We have seen several instances of his disgusting behavior and that is it when suddenly we get a sob story about his father. While this is not a bad concept it is meaningless in this film because we know nothing of this character except that he is a jerk and the sudden family story seems cheap and fake, especially when it is the one and only time we hear it or see this personal weakness. most the other stories follow suit making the film a series of cheap and emotionless shock spots.This leads into the greatest flaw with this film. I have lived in many different places in the USA. Each has its own levels and different types of racism that appears at times. The one true constant however is the deep and subtle racism that effects each place. Individuals are not double faced but they are shadow minded not intending or even holding anything evil but allowing this shadow of image to impact them mildly. This shadowed racism is what infects most of America and when many are confronted on it they are shocked at what they were not even aware of.Crash wished to confront people with its multiple stories. The failure comes in that each situation is over the top. Each story presents us with a situation which easily disgusts us and makes us see how clearly wrong the act is. As I listened to others after the movie had ended most were saying how they could never imagine being like the characters they had just seen. It is to easy for the average person to walk away from this film saying 'Wow, I am so glad I am not like that' because the average person is not like that.Crash needed to follow two specific people involved in a confrontation of the subtle issues each of us face not the extremes that shock us. The shock must come from the realization that I am just like this person who I have learned holds things they never knew.Crash is a failure and cheap stylized social commentary. It is sad that so many hold this film as a great commentary on racism. If anything this film continues to allow people to ignore what they might be holding close and hidden.",1,3,7,4 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas how dare you!
","I am a huge fan of Star Wars. I enjoy the original three films a lot and think they are intelligently written adventures. This film is anything but that.The dialog is so strained and poorly written I wonder when SW became a soap opera instead of a space opera.The special effects are so heavy I am surprised anyone can swallow them. Lucas has become so focused on what he can do with computers he never thinks about if it will look authentic. To much green screen and not enough reality. I cringe every time I see a CG character because they are so clearly fake. Spend some of your millions on extras Lucas.The plot is so miss focused. We are supposed to see the rise of a great evil. Instead I see the rise of one real whiny kid and a politician not a great evil (unless you consider politicians the great evil). Where is the evil power that threatens to crush all that is good.Avoid this film, it is a good excuse to sell action figures and that is it.",2,0,1,5 April 2006
No Country for Old Men," Weakness comes in the lack of meaning
","No Country for Old Men is a sad indicator of films today. There are many great actors but they move around in a shallow story doing their best.The story is supposed to follow a Texas man who comes across the remains of a drug deal gone bad. He soon finds two million in cash and in a series of poor choices ends up being hunted by a psychotic killer. An old sheriff is the lone law man who seems to understand what is happening making the final connections between the bloody drug deal, other murders, and the Texans running from town.In all the actors did a good job which helps to elevate the gross flaws in this film. We get a rich and psychotic man, a lone Texan trying to survive, and on older sheriff seeking his dreams of what the past was. The problem comes that there is no depth to the story or to the characters beyond a few words and poorly written scenes.The story shows us no meaning behind anything we see in the film. It is like watching a poorly done newscast. I see people and know of events but they are so distant from us the viewers. Why do I care about this man running from the killer? Who is he? What is his life like? What is this sheriffs desire for seeking the old times? Where is the wisdom he seems to have grounded in? What is the sheriffs desire in combating the evil he sees growing in the world he lives in? What is this killers hidden code? What is his role in this entire thing? These empty characters move around on the screen in bloody shot outs and fights giving us little to care about. No emotion is felt through out the film and when characters do die they are easily shrugged off as simple objects.Beyond the character issues we have a poorly executed story. We know nothing of what is taking place beyond, man hunts man and kills others. Several 'major' players are introduced to fill us in but their scenes fills nothing in and is to short to make us care about the story as a whole. We also meet smaller players who are supposed to give us insight into the story and other characters but once again their actions and involvement amounts to nothing.This film points out how shallow the movie industry has become. No one cares about growth and story, they simply wish to see stuff move around, things to blow up, and people to get shot. With a few exceptions shallow stories like this and others will continue to dominate the theaters with wild applause while quality is ignored.",3,4,9,28 November 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Fun but that is about all
","I loved the first two Xmen films. They were done with deep thought and great detail. THis film lacks both of those things in my opinion.We find the Xmen in a time of big change. Jean Grey is supposedly dead, causing Scott to fall into a deep depression and eventual leave his friends to morn for her at her final resting place. Jean isn't dead, has apparently killed Scott and is a little off. A private company has been able to create a mutant 'cure' and is willing to help all mutants who want it. The government is more friendly but likes the idea of weapons based on this cure. Then Magneto is ticked about this entire cure thing and is forming a big army of miss placed mutants.We soon learn some very interesting things. The company making the cure is holding a mutant child (named Leech)whose power eliminates the power of other mutants. They have been experimenting on the kid to get the stuff isolated. Jean has a split personality, the Jean we all know and an unstoppable all powerful side called Pheonix.As the movie continues Jean losses control over Phoenix and she becomes the worlds most powerful mutant, sought after by Prof X and Magneto. She ends up killing Prof X (supposedly) and joining Magneto. Magneto gets his army together and they attack the company to kill the kid and Storm leads the Xmen to stop him.That paragraph above was about as long as the movie was.This film had no deep story and was not thought out very well.Why is only Magneto upset that they are experimenting on this kid? Do the Xmen not care? Did the company adopt the kid? Is no one fighting to free the poor thing? How come Pheonix does nothing in the film except cause some damage for five minutes at most? Why is the most powerful, self absorbed, pleasure driven being around a stooge for Magneto? HOW THE HECK, does no one think of getting Leech near her to get rid of her powers? Home come Wolverine is the only one who can kill her? Why is the great mutant battle a bunch of guys just running at each other? You have a blockbuster budget and all they give is a dude who hugs ya and then gets like a porcupine? There were great ideas for possibly three great movies here. The Leech kid and saving him, Magneto makes an army of mutants, the Pheonix goes nuts and must be stopped. I think the makers of this film just thought it was all to cool to pick one and so made a very short (it is the shortest of the three) mixed up movie.Again, it was entertaining but it wasn't as deep or well done as the others in any way shape or form.Wait for it to come out on DVD, then see it.",5,0,1,2 July 2006
The Dark Knight," This is what Batman is.
","The Dark Knight finds us in a new Gotham city. Gotham is no longer the city of despair but a city in which criminals are scared to work at night. Batman's campaign against crime in his beloved city is working, until a new player enters Gotham. In the middle of a heated election for district attorney Gotham receives a new type of criminal who is not motivated by money or power but by sheer desire for chaos.This film is practically perfect in every way. The acting is amazing making every character worth my attention and feeling. Aron Eckhart gives us a fantastic Harvey Dent as the white knight of Gotham fighting to be the clean district attorney. Gary Oldman is a powerful James Gordan and creates a human grounding for the audience. Christian Bale gives us another tortured and driven Batman which is exactly what batman should be. Finally I have to say that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. I was both scared and entertained by the Joker which is what I have always felt from the character in the comics.The action was both clean in the sense of blood and guts but still very painful. Each horrific act by the Joker hits you hard. This is part of the brilliance of the Nolan's story telling. I felt every punch and evil act and it made me react with out showing me cheap blood and stupid gore. My intelligence as a person wasn't insulted and my eyes weren't assaulted, it was brilliant. The brilliance is not in the action however but in what this movie shows us in the story.TDK shows us a world in which our fears about evil and confusion about how to fight it are thrown in our faces. I find in this world we get scared to call evil evil which causes us to become weak when we are hit upside the head by it. In TDK evil is present it is true and good must fight to the bitter end to expose it and finally to stop it. What must good do to stop it however? What lines can good not cross and is that a weakness on the side of good? How TDK deals with these questions is fantastic. My one problem is that this film probably should have been rated R and not PG-13. With that aside this is a masterpiece of a film.",9,4,14,11 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," One very good movie
","No movie adaptation of a book is ever perfect. It is a fact of life. However there are times when the essence of a book is captured very well and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of those movies.It is Harry Potters fourth year at the magical school of Hogwarts. This year things are a bit different as Hogwarts plays host to two other schools all of which will compete in the legendary Tri Wizard Tournament. Things do not go as planned and soon Harry finds himself competing in a dangerous contest facing dragons, enchanted mazes and much worse.The Goblet of Fire is a very good addition to the Harry Potter franchise (we can all call it that now). It is great to see the actors mature as the films have and how things at Hogwarts have deepened as well.The actors all do a great job with one exception, which I will talk about later. The scenes between Harry, Ron and Hermoine are all well done and you can see the chemistry between the kids. Add to this the amazing talents of the original adults and Brendan Gleeson fantastic job as Mad Eye Moody.The story is well adapted from the book. Again it is not perfect but it isn't supposed to be. Perfect adaptations end up being maxi-series on TV. The writing was genuine however and the interaction between characters should great insight into the book and characters.The FX are amazing and very well done. The blending between what was real and CGI has been refined well and these FX masters show their talents off well.My only issue with this film is Michael Gambon, who has been playing Albus Dumbledore beginning with the third Potter film. He took the role after the death of Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two films. In the first two films and in the books Dumbledore is a silent yet strong figure who has the mere presence of authority and respect. Richard Harris portrayed this perfectly in a silent yet refined way. He gave Dumbledore an air that every move action and word was carefully chosen with deep intellect while making the character as whimsical and off beat as in the book. Gambon lacks this skill in the most horrid ways. I am not bashing Gambon in anyway, he is an amazing character actor. Being a character actor however is his greatest flaw. He exaggerates, throws his arms, explodes his voice, looks as if he is on the verge of lost control, all of which Dumbledores character is not and does not. In so many scenes Dumbledore is more of a bumbling old man seeming to need more aid from a nurse than the wise and whimsical guide he is in the first films and books.I look forward to the next Potter film but hope, with all respect to him, that Gambon will be replaced by a much more refined and controlled character.",8,1,2,26 August 2006
Hancock," Fun but lost itself
","Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero, but not your usual hero. We first meet Hancock passed out on a city bench being prodded by a kid to wake up and help the cops. Hancock wakes up, slaps a passing girl on the rear and grabs a bottle of whiskey before flying off to help the police.This gives us a great introduction to this movie showing us what is in-store for us. Hancocks attempts at helping out the people of LA end up causing major damage due to Hancocks lack of tact and his supposed selfish motivations. As expected Hancock is hated by the city officials and most citizens because of his reckless actions. Eventually Hancock saves the life of Ray Embery (Jason Bateman) a PR man trying to use his skills to change the world and failing at it. Ray sees in Hancock a lonely person desiring to do what he thinks is right but finding hate instead of appreciation for his actions. To help Hancock turn public opinion Ray begins to guide Hancock in how to be a better hero.This is a really creative film. It takes the hero film fad out there shows us what it could really look like in our world. The best part is every character is well done with one exception. Will Smith shows us a hero who is just like you and me hiding his confusion and hurt behind his actions and attitude. Bateman is a fun counter to Smith being honest about the stupidity of Hancock in a real caring way. The only person I felt was weak as a character was Charlize Theron as Mary Embery, Rays wife and a mystery for Hancock. I don't know if Theron can really be blamed for her character seeming off however.In the story we get a great setup for seeing a cool growth in Hancock. Theron's character Mary kind of ruins that for us. We learn of a mystery to Hancocks origin and when all is revealed it cheapens a lot of the creative story telling done so far. Mary just doesn't fit into the story that was being created and it feels forced to create the drama around her, Hancock, and Ray that the movie makers obviously want.While this is a major issue with the film it doesn't totally destroy it. The film is fun, witty, and has good action. Even with a big bump in the story Hancock is still a good film and makes some cool insights into the superhero type story.",6,0,3,22 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Bang, you thought it was all good didn't ya?
","When I first saw this movie I thought Lucas had made up for past mistakes on Ep I and II. After seeing it again, and a few more times, I can say that I feel he has made a movie worse then the others.Again Lucas' focus on CG is disgusting. Nothing is real, and it feels that way. It is a fake screen and the actors are not interacting with any reality at all, and therefore seem to fall short of their abilities (for those who have them). Add to this the cheap make up for Palpatine after he fries himself with the lightning. Yoda still looks dumb as well.Hayden Christensen has been a bad choice, IMO, since the beginning. He whines real well but he strikes no fear at all. Anakin goes from a whiny kid wanting to protect the Jedi who go to arrest Papetine, to a Sith in less then five minutes. When did this happen? Where is the growth and the motivation? We get one image of him fearing the death of Padme, but there is no connection between this and his loss of his mothers. He does not grow into doing anything to protect Padme. Anakin just suddenly says, 'You know what, this Jedi thing sucks. Lets go dark.' He then goes and slaughters children. What the heck happened here? Did I miss the actual third movie and this is three and a half? Vader was the complete bad guy. He struck fear into ya the moment he came onto the screen. He didn't make me chuckle when he fell to his knees in a cheap scream when he finds out his girl bit it. Show some real evil come on!!Padme is reduced to a birthing machine making her death and naming of the kids useless. It has no feeling and makes you wish they would just take the kids and ditch the scene.Yoda confuses the crap out of us when he tells Obi that he is talking to Qui-Gon. Wait, didn't he die? Can you please exp.... OK never mind. If you want to know what he is talking about please go purchase the official novel for a mere $40.Jedi are apparently really stupid and weak according to this movie as well. The troopers are so sneaky and able to hide their little full helmet nods and the raising of their really bulky weapons and wipe out basically the entire Jedi order. These are not the Jedi we saw in the first movie that is for sure. They can protect my toilet for as good as they are.Lots of bells and whistles for this film with no melody at all. I hope this is the end of all SW stuff cause Lucas is going no where fast with it.",2,0,3,5 April 2006
The Good Shepherd," A historical car wreck
","The bay of Pigs Invasion is about to occur and we find ourselves following a veteran CIA agent named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon). As the invasion falls apart Edward finds himself in the midst of an investigation to discover why the plan failed. As he unravels a mystery surrounding a strange set of photos and a tape with potential clues we get glimpses into his past and the creation of the CIA during the Cold War.Thus goes the star packed film directed by Robert De Niro who also has a role in the film as General Bill Sullivan. Other stars include Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, a brief spot by Joe Pesci and an amazing and underused performance by Pushing Daisies star Lee Pace. The film was written by Eric Roth who it is clear cared little for anything historical in the film, but I will get to that later.As for the actors they did a good job with the exception of Matt Damon. Matt Damon is a hit and miss actor in my mind playing stupid rolls and then amazing ones. In this film he is easy to shrug off in a situation that demands a standout performance. I think the problem is that while Damon is a good actor he is not good at changing who he is for a part. Actors like Johny Depp and Russell Crowe can completely disappear in a part where Damon can not. Many times I found my self watching Matt Damon act not a guy named Edward. This was very distracting, especially given the slow nature of the film and character.Other characters were well acted but suffered from shallow writing. Edwards's wife Clover (Jolie) is never given enough time to show her struggles beyond being easy to get in the sack. Edwards's son Edward Jr. (Eddie Redmayne) is supposed to be the major tragedy in the film but is so poorly developed his crisis is useless.De Niro is a very good actor but as a director he needs some practice. He allowed so many slow and drawn out moments that led to no where for the characters or plot. The quiet nature of Edward and the poor ability of Damon to fit the character made these moments even longer and more painful then helpful.While these things were all flaws the one that bugged me the most was the gross historical errors in the film. While historical films need some freedom to tell a story a direct change in the historical facts is a disgusting irresponsible act on the part of the movie makers.The entire film balances on the concept that the bay of Pigs failed because of a leak in the CIA and its general negligence as an agency to control it's information. This is horribly inaccurate and denies the real problems with the Bay of Pigs. Any quick study tells us that there was no leak and this makes the entire story in this film pointless and useless as a commentary on the subject matter.",4,2,5,8 December 2008
