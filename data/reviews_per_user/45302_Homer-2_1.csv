Alien 3," Underestimated sequel
","The Alien series is unique in several aspects - all parts have different directors, each director among the best in the world, and - most important - the producers allowed them to implement their unique styles on the films. And that's the reason the quality of the series stayed almost at a constant level - in opposition to almost all other sequels in movie history.Part one introduced the terrific idea and part two is a perfect action movie. Fortunately they didn't try to copy one of these in part three (it could only have become worse). Instead Alien 3 puts more emphasis on the characters and the (depressive) mood. The visual style is awesome and the great collection of odd looking people is only surpassed by the cast of 'Der Name der Rose'. The movie has some lengths and some plot holes but nevertheless it impresses me a lot every time I see it.8/10",8,1,3,19 June 2001
