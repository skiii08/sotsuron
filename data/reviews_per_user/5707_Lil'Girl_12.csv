Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Return of the Spectacular
","It was certainly a feast for the eyes: the costumes, sets and locations. What an imagination! The effects were truly breathtaking. While I don't generally watch films for the special effects, something definitely has to be said for this one. The technical wizardry involved in making this epic must have been something of a phenomenon in itself.Undoubtedly, the highlight of the film is the pod-race. It was reminiscent of another epic -- Ben Hur -- although without the obvious contemporary references. The similarities there are quite compelling.The real flaw in the film I believe, is the dialogue or lack of it. It lacks the snap and go of the previous films or the recent Matrix. But perhaps it's unfair to compare it with the other sci-fi rage of the season which was doing something quite different. The dialogue, it seems to me lacks the intellectual depth and sophistication of ideas which drew me to The Matrix. But perhaps that will come later in the sequels.But then I did not go and see this film for that reason. Star Wars is and will always be a good old fashion adventure film about the battle between good and evil.",8,6,8,9 June 1999
Elizabeth," Elizabeth is dead, Long live History
","Well, I've finally seen the much talked about Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett is quite a revelation indeed. Both Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are nothing short of chameleons. Dazzled though I was by the performances by all concerned, there was a nagging feeling that the film as a whole could have been better. It was overall an interesting study of a queen and the political turmoil which surrounded the early part of her reign. But not a great film.Oh, it's not that I'm offended by the ahistorical enterprise. No one seriously believes that film makers are really that concerned with what actually happened. Oh no, it's not that at all. The problem seems to be that the makers are so caught up the 'sexiness' of what might have been that what was probable about the woman herself became subverted. I don't for one moment naively believe nothing naughty occurred beneathe the veneer of religiousity However, no matter how beautifully it was all portrayed, one comes away dissatisfied that Elizabeth has had to fight for her place in life and in art.",7,0,0,14 December 1999
The Mummy," Entertaining Silliness
","I suspect that nobody is supposed to take this film seriously as the film itself is suggestively tongue-in-cheek. If it had been a straight horror flick, I don't think I would have given it a second thought but as some reviewers indicated that the film was more of an adventure film a la Indiana Jones, I went along for the ride.The Mummy has the feel of an old B-movie but certainly with a much bigger budget and more spectacular special effects. The introduction, which is silliness itself, contains some stiff, cheesy acting and narration, making the way for a whole range of comedic moments. The result is pure entertainment mixed with absurdity.Particular credit must go to its cast, who looked like they were enjoying themselves during this rollercoaster ride: Brendan Fraser, with his goofy good-looks, was a delight, battling with mortal and undead villains. Rachel Weisz, was having fun looking like she was an expert in Egyptology and of course, John Hannah as her brother, showing uncanny timing for one liners.I confess I had a good laugh out of this. I don't think anybody seriously thinks they're getting a history lesson out of this. If they do, well, they're in for a disappointment. Ultimately, the association with Indiana Jones is fairly minimal. The Mummy is first and foremost an adventure film exploiting bits and pieces of known history as it sees fit.(A word on special effects in general: With the release of Star Wars, the Matrix and the Mummy, many have criticised the overemphasis of special effects above human actors and good storytelling. I think it is important to see special effects as much an art and a craft as any other forms of film making. Special effects are tools at the film maker's disposal and to be used according to how they would like to present their vision of something beyond the ordinary. There must be a place for all types of film making without this kind of constant barrage of censure of blockbusters. Each film should be judged on its merits - ie, the degree of success it attains in its execution. Comparing Her Majesty, Mrs Brown with something like The Mummy would be like putting apples and oranges on the same footing. This talk about High Culture vs Popular Culture has gone on for more than a hundred years and there doesn't look to be any resolution in sight. Incidentally, Shakespeare and Dickens were not elevated to their lofty status until after their time.)",8,0,0,20 June 1999
L.A. Confidential," A Rare Hollywood Outing
","This is probably a little late in coming but better late than never. Like many, I'm still not sure how Titanic managed to win 11 Oscars and get ahead this film. L.A. Confidential is easily one of the best films made by Hollywood in a very long time. A tight script and all-round stellar performances by the cast. As an Australian, I was particularly heartened by the performances of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. They were truly outstanding and it is a sad reflection of film industry politics that they were not even recognised for their magnificent efforts. It is a film worth getting your teeth into.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
X-Men," Super Hero Tale With Heart
","Admittedly my expectations weren't terribly high. However, I am glad to say that this one exceeded all expectations. It is rare to see such good acting in an action adventure film. This one actually has a soul and even looks suspiciously thoughtful. Hugh Jackman is fabulous and so are the Shakespearean actors.  With the sheer force of their skills, they provide the film with its classy feel. Looking forward to meeting up with them all over again. Of course, there'll be a sequel. They'll have to have one just to explain Wolverine.",9,0,0,24 July 2000
The Princess Bride," A Gem of a Tale
",This is most certainly one of my favourite films. The witty dialogue and plot twists continues to charm and amuse even after multiple viewings. It is certainly one of the most quotable films... absolutely hilarious. The sword fights and bantering are the highlights of this intelligent and satirical film. A real gem. One of few films that deserve all the accolades it has received.,10,1,2,21 June 2000
Pulp Fiction," Crass Fiction
","I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of 'humour' isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point.",1,52,114,19 August 1999
Titanic," How we almost abandoned ship
","Admittedly, this film did nothing for me. It isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst either. (Although my husbane would beg to differ -- he wanted to leave after an hour of Jack and Rose prancing around the decks). I persevered feeling that I paid good money to see this epic and would see it through to the end. Unlike the assertions of previous comments, I did see the film early on in the piece and wasn't led by the hype. No matter how much they tried there wasn't much chemistry between Leonardo or Kate. (I'm still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers) Needless to say, I didn't get goosebumps looking at Leo and Kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated forever.Still, I wasn't totally devoid of feeling. I was transfixed by the last hour or so of the film. By the many faces, who realised the inevitable, who accepted their fates quietly and bravely right to the tragic end.That, ladies and gentlemen,  is the real story of the Titanic.",6,1,3,18 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," The sense of sight
","The less that you know about the film the better. Knowing too much could spoil it for you. Suffice to say, the film cleverly manipulates the point of view and leads us down a certain garden path. Should be seen if for nothing but the superb acting and the fairly original plot.",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his best
","My favourite Hitchcock film, it must be said. It has all the elements of a good thriller: suspense, intrigue and plays all sorts of lovely games with the mind. The best thing is that most of the action happens in a tiny room in the middle of town.",9,0,2,19 August 1999
The Matrix," Sci-Fi at its Best
","I thought I'd add to the chorus of approvals and thumb my nose at the naysayers. From my observation, most of those who dislike the movie don't really get the nuances of the film. Certainly it's not a picture for everyone and of course there are going to be gaps in aspects of the narrative. But what work of science fiction has ever been totally gap-proof? (Hence, the expression 'science-fiction') As one of those who enjoyed the movie thoroughly and saw it more than once, I believe it contains all the elements of a good movie: humour, a freshness about it, and a lot of great action sequences. Will Star Wars measure up, I wonder?",9,0,0,18 May 1999
Gladiator," Sword Wielding Fest
","Okay, I enjoyed it in spite of the blood, body count and gore (or maybe because of it). It was well-paced and well-acted. The fight scenes were satisfactory and Russell Crowe looked liked he did know how to hold a sword. This viewer still doesn't know what to think of the ending... seems rather bizarre to me. I guess it was necessary for the two foes to come to a head but I'm not sure that it was entirely convincing to do it in the way it was done. Still I enjoyed the performances of several decent British actors and of course, Russell Crowe is always stunning.",8,0,0,7 May 2000
