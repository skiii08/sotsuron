Iron Man 3," No plot, no characterization.
","Man, this movie sucks. Just so bad. Its just so disappointing that people keep making movies this bad.spoilers - nothing really, but just being safe. After spending 3 movies establishing Tony Stark as the King of Cool (V1), they've decided to 'character develop' him. So here come these panic attacks (V2),....except they're so unbelievable that I found that I was rolling my eyes while sitting in a theatre. If you have to *tell* the audience that you're having a panic attack,... Robery Downey Junior does his best I suppose, but its just not him. And nobody can pull off being the 'King of Cool' and simultaneously having a panic attack. Just not possible.And of course, he's having these panic attacks because he has no armour and needs to fight the bad guys,....except by the end of it he's had 50 armours all along but just didn't use them??? Huh? And he has no panic attacks when he should be having them, like when people are shooting at him and he has no armour. No, that wouldn't be cool to see the King of cool cower,...so he's awesome of course. But then when we switch out of action mode into 'character development' mode, he can tell everyone that he's having a panic attack so that we know what's happening; (all the meanwhile fully maintaining his King of Cool persona,...he's having the coolest panic attack you ever saw).Then there's the Tony Stark V3 when he's around Rhodney. Well I'm still cool, but now I'm a military dumb-dumb since I'm around 'Rhodney the military guy'. Please ignore the fact that I just kicked a whole platoon's worth of bad guys with only a hand glove and a machine gun because clearly now I don't know the first thing about guns or ammo or shooting,... face-palm.It just sucked so bad. And then there was bad guy(s). Oh watch out for this one. The '#2' bad guy (AIM) had so little substance that it wasn't even funny. At the end of the movie try to figure out what his motivations were. Was he trying to be a rich industrialist? Well he seems to already have infinite wealth and control. Was he trying to get his little science project off the ground? Well, he was pretty much there already. Compare him to Magneto from the X-Men movies or Norman Osborne from the Spider Man movies and that 'character' just comes across as so lame.Anyway, if you like Michael Bay movies this one's for you. More bang! More boom! than the other 2 movies. Spend 5 minutes thinking about the movie after you walk out and it sucks,....bad.OK SERIOUS SPOILER HERE. 'I'm Iron Man'. 'Does the man make the machine or does the machine make the man'. Well that little catch phrase seems to have wagged the dog. I'm the man, that's why I spent 3/4 of the damn movie running around without armour despite being, you know, and Iron Man movie. And now I'm going to destroy all of my armours because I'm really Tony Stark the man. Except now I'm going to claim 'I'm Iron Man!' as my last line in the movie. Jeeez. Seriously, run around the whole movie with no suit. Then show us that you have 50 suits. Then destroy them all because you're Tony the man. Then end the movie with 'I'm Iron Man'. Who the hell thought that up. Gawd, Jeeez.",3,2,4,16 May 2013
