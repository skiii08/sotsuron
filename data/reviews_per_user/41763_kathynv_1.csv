"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," funny and sweet with sad undertones between the laughter
","As much is missing from the lives of the three principal characters as the details they reluctantly show.  All the drag queens (plus Robert, later) are hiding their pain and feelings and are making the trip through the desert a lot more difficult than it had to be.All are hiding in secrets and feelings, and I got the feeling that this film could have a had a lot more talking.  (not a usual comment for me) The juxtaposition between the harsh desert scenery and the drag queens' flambuoyant bus and manner of dress was an amazing piece of eye candy.I loved the scene where the fellows party with the Aborigine people.  Two despised castes of Australian society meet under unforeseen circumstances, and both profit buy it.  Loved the Didgery Doo being played along with the 1970's eight track 'Mod' music - for once it really worked.A great movie, funny, but not a roll on the floor larf-festival, funny and happy in how it makes you think.  Or you could watch for the costumes, and that would be a treat as well.",Null,1,3,1 November 2003
