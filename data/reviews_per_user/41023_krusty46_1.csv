Ali," Slow
","This movie is very confusing and very slow in the beginning and middle.  It picks up a little towards the end, but it is not enough to save the movie. Their tagline is to forget everything you thought you knew.  Well, I knew virtually nothing and I still feel that way. Characters were just popping up and I had no clue who or what they were for the first half of the movie. Will Smith was good (not award winning).",5,0,0,27 December 2001
