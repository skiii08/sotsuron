10 Cloverfield Lane," Slow paced even watching in fast forward
",Start off watching this and it got very boring very quickly. Watched the next chunk in fast forward which still gave me the gist of it. Watched the end at normal speed and still just as boring as the beginning. How this has an above average rating beats me!,1,0,1,10 March 2018
It," Awful remake
","How this won awards I do t know. It's slow paced (partly as probably the producers want to squeeze out a sequel). The original actors were far better, particularly when looking at the new bill and the new clown, the pair of them can't act, they sound like they are just reading off a script that they aren't even convinced by. The film has no enthusiasm, the jumpy scenes take the 'jump' out of the word 'jumpy'. No wonder the only actor I recognise is the boy who ended up in stranger things.",1,2,4,12 August 2018
