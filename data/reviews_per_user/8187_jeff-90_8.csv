Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," effects great, everything else weak
","I'd just like to say one thing - the kid Jake Lloyd that plays Anakin is simply a horrible actor.  He was so bad that it was painful and detracted from the film.  I know he's young, but I have seen dozens of performances by young actors that were excellent.  Every line he said made me wince.",5,0,3,25 November 2001
Brokeback Mountain," most overrated film ever made
","I am absolutely stunned at the reviews here, are there really that many closeted gays out there ? The comments crack me up - 'exquisite silences'- LOL. Another way of saying that there are huge chunks of this movie where not only does nothing happen, no one says anything. Heath Ledger getting critical acclaim... for NOT talking, as he is on screen for a good 1:45 and says about 100 words.10 years from now, or maybe a lot less, people are going to wonder if the Academy was collectively on drugs when talking about how this thing easily won Best Picture.We do know the answer to the question 'how many professional film critics are gay', which is obviously a helluva lot. there is no other explanation for the high praise of this snooze-fest.",4,7,64,25 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," fun but also laughably bad
",Just silly really.  Inane dialogue that had half the house laughing out loud and NOT where Lucas intended.  Does anyone know or care about the 'plot' ?God this series misses Hrrison Ford...,5,0,2,21 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," now THAT'S what I call a movie !!!
","I'm 40, have read LOTR 5 times since age 12, most recently a few weeks ago. I've waited 28 years for this film and was prepared to be disappointed. Instead, every sight, scene and sound that I imagined in my mind's eye was far surpassed by this film.  Some characters are missing, some dialogue is dropped - sometimes for no good reason.  A scene or two is changed from the book just for the sake of more action.  Saruman's motivation is changed, they don't get their elven cloaks, no Barrowwights, etc.Guess what ?  It doesn't matter.  In fact, when you realize that 3 hours has flown by and the movie is over you don't worry about what's not in, you worry about how you are gonna wait a year for the next one.  No, I take that back.  I'm worried about when I can see it again.  There was no way to keep everything in without going well over 3 hours - just be glad the studio let them do the full 3.This is Braveheart, The 12th Warrior, Last of the Mohicans, Excalibur and a couple of monster movies all rolled into one.  And PLEASE, see this in the best theater you can find, one with a big screen AND great sound.  It needs and deserves the best environment you can find.  God, just something simple like the sound of the horses was scary.A very rare 10 from this viewer.",10,0,1,19 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," mediocre in every way
","Kenneth Branagh was funny. That's it for the good points. Not very exciting, not very suspenseful, not very funny.  The Ron character is incredibly annoying and the rip-off of the Lord of the Rings has accelerated.  It was bad enough before, with Harry as Frodo, the kindly wizard as his mentor, the evil wizard as enemy, but now...Dobby as the Gollum rip-off is the most annoying character since Jar Jar. They even throw in a giant spider ala Shelob, but not nearly as well done of course.  I could forgive all this if the movie was at least exciting.  This series is played out already and there are 4 more to come !  Ugh, spare me...",4,1,5,6 July 2004
Bull Durham," good film but rips off Long Gone
","Long Gone was an HBO film from 1987 that is a GREAT movie. Bull Durham simply steals 90% of the plot and characters, adds big name stars and becomes the movie everyone knows. The grizzled veteran, the hot shot rookie, the sexy local girl, etc. I like BD well enough (though as usual Costner has the acting range of a Louisville Slugger), but it will always be down a notch in my book for the blatant ripoff of what I consider a grittier, better film.Costner isn't as good as William Peterson, Sarandon isn't as sexy as Virginia Madsen.funny line from her bio 'Her brother, actor Michael Madsen, refuses to see any of her movies in which she appears naked.' that eliminates just about every film from her 1st 10 years except this one.",Null,1,4,16 October 2004
The Thin Red Line," plodding, dull, ponderous, etc
","From excited anticipation to total disappointment in 175 minutes.  If Malick wants to wait another 20 years before directing another movie that's fine with me.  This was like watching a poorly done nature show interrupted by unknown soldiers getting shot.  A totally self-indulgent, philosophical mumbo-jumbo of nice photography.  No character development, no suspense, no plot, no humor.  When the 'film' was over the whole theatre just sort of numbingly shuffled out the door, everyone aware that they'd just wasted 3 hours and $7.75.",2,1,3,10 January 1999
The Island," great premise ruined by Michael Bay
","this is almost like two different movies. The first half sets up a really interesting, intelligent sci-fi premise, which COULD have resulted in a great, scary, thought provoking classic. Instead, one of the biggest hacks in Hollywood does his usual over the top treatment - non-stop action, stunts, music, quick cuts, slow motion, wreck everything, logic out the window - and the second half turns into one long stupid chase sequence. Bay just can't help himself, because he has zero intelligence or attention span he assumes the audience doesn't either. So disappointing. 5/10 PS Interestingly enough the concept of memories being passed down through DNA is now close to being proved possible.",5,0,5,21 January 2014
