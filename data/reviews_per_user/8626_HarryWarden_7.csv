The Ring," Mediocre remake of a horror masterpiece!
","To the untrained eye of 'John Q Moviegoer,' this might appear to be a strikingly original ghost film, but in reality its a pointless and half-assed retelling of the scariest film ever made (with typical Hollywood 'bigger is better' excess).Dreamworks didn't release the original over here for a reason...because they don't want people to see the superior version! Do yourself a favor, track down the original Japanese trilogy (bootlegs can usually be purchased on EBay). Not only is it scarier, but it makes more sense!Just goes to show that imagination and not money (the remake literaly cost 60 times more) dictate how scary a movie is. Fun fact: The producers of the remake saw the original and were so blown away that a 1/2 hour later, they bought up the remake rights. My question: If you thought it was the scariest and greatest thing you've ever seen, WHY REMAKE IT?!? Sheesh.Don't settle for anything less! See the original!",1,2,7,19 October 2002
The Hills Have Eyes," Scary and intense! A remake that beats the original!
","We've seen dozens of remakes in the past several years: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ring, Dawn of the Dead, The Fog. None could hold a candle next to the original films.Could it be? After all this time, do we finally found a remake that's actually superior? You're damn right! The Hills Have Eyes is not at all like the other remakes in this ungodly trend. It's not a cheap cash-in. It's a movie made with respect by horror filmmakers for horror fans.Sure, it has its share of problems: There are too many cheesy false scares, they added a corny patriotic subtext, and it sticks so close to the original that fans will find little in the way of surprises. But it's a leaner, meaner animal than Wes Craven's original film. The characters are more believable, the mutants are scarier, and the whole thing is incredibly visceral! This is the first studio horror film in years that I've liked...mainly because it doesn't feel like a studio horror film.Funny side note: A girl next to me in the theater was silently weeping through the last half of the movie. Guess it made an impression.",9,280,437,4 March 2006
Alien vs. Predator," A slap in the face to two brilliant franchises.
","Let's get one thing straight: I've been a life-long fan of both franchises. The first two 'Alien' installments remain two of my all-time favorite films. They're what turned me onto the horror genre. Hell, I even dug 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection'...warts n' all. And I worship and adore BOTH 'Predator' movies. I know these six films inside and out. I know the name of every single character. I can quote every line of dialogue.I read all the 'AvP' comic books. I played all the 'AvP' video games. This was a match made in fanboy heaven...and I wanted to see a big-screen adaptation more than anything. I waited impatiently for over a decade...and it took Paul Anderson only 100 minutes to destroy everything.This movie does not feel like an 'Alien' or 'Predator' film. It feels like 'Jurassic Park IV' with the title creatures in place of the dinosaurs.The characters? Not a memorable one in the whole lot. Lex is one of the most generic and dull heroines to stumble through a feature film...and surprisingly, the supporting cast displays even less energy. Even Lance Henriksen - our one ray of sunshine - isn't in the film long.There isn't a single good or fresh idea in the script. The whole pyramid/training-ground concept sounded good...until Anderson started crafting his own mythology around it. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that it's stupid beyond words.The fights between the beasts are so badly shot and edited, I didn't care for one solitary second. It didn't stir up one bit of emotion in my inner-fanboy. And the creatures look HORRIBLE. The Aliens seemed okay...but the Predators are absolutely wretched. They look like goofy WWF wrestlers and in no way resemble or act like what we saw in the other films. It's really hard not to chuckle whenever they appear on screen.I won't even get into the continuity errors, and just plain bad ideas, that saturate this film. Let's just say, that it lived up to all my fears...and created some new ones.Paul Anderson has not made a movie for the fans. He's taken a beloved franchise, stripped it of it's soul, and marketed it to 10-year-old boys. I've liked many of his films and I've been defending him for years. I was even excited when he was announced as director, while most people groaned. But all the naysayers were right.Out of all my brutal movie disappointments, this easily ranks #1.",2,0,4,12 August 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men. Out with a flush.
","What a depressing experience.The big final showdown of an epic story...and I felt NOTHING. Not one little stir of emotion. This film was exactly what we all feared it was going to be: No tact, no style, no substance. It's just sad that such a wonderful intelligent series had to deteriorate into a hollow studio FX show. Mr Ratner, you certainly lived up to our low expectations.Every frame of this film feels rushed. A slew of characters were killed and cured, and I didn't even bat an eyelash. Ideas are barely explored and none of the characters get any real focus. Aside from Wolvy, Storm, and Magneto, every mutant feels like an obligatory cameo. All the actors, save for Ian McKellen, act out-of-character and hurry through their lines like they just want to get out of the movie.To be fair, this isn't entirely Ratner's fault. It took everybody working together to screw this one up. The script is atrocious. The dialogue is flat out embarrassing - it's almost all composed of badly-timed puns and quips, and some unintentionally hilarious lines ('She was sealed up in a cocoon of energy.'). The mutant cure is barely explored and nothing that was set up in the previous two films ever really amount to anything.There's a sense that Fox controlled everything here and used everyone involved as their puppets to milk the fans of their cash. This is not the X-Men we know and love.I saw this with a packed house at the Mann's Chinese in Hollywood. The theater was full of screaming X-fans and the excitement level was over-the-top. Five minutes into the film, it was dead, as if a giant vacuum had sucked all life from the theater. The 'Snakes on a Plane' trailer (which was more brilliant than anything here) got a bigger cheer than anything in X3.'Nuff said.",2,7,11,26 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Even better than the book! Jackson triumphs!
","While I'm a huge fan of the novels (I won't dispute that it's among the best literary works), Tolken DOES possess flaws...flaws that I think Peter Jackson is correcting with the movie trilogy. 'The Two Towers' was always my least favorite book, mainly because it all feels like setup to what happens in 'Return of the King' and was a little too quiet after 'Fellowship.' However, Jackson's film not only tops last year's 'Fellowship' movie, he also improves on the book!People fail to realize that if you filmed the books page by page, the movies would be a total mess. The stories are divided up in a way that doesn't pay attention to structure...something three feature-length films hinge on. What if 'Fellowship' had just ended when they got out of their boats? Not only do the new scenes add more meat to the characters and story, it also tops the scope of the first movie and gives each running storyline a fullfilling climax. These films are the perfect adaptations of the novels. Jackson has taken the most difficult and complex translation in film history and made it into a masterpiece of story and beauty that we will probably never see the likes of again.   Also, all the harsh criticisms I see here seem to be made by people who don't have the slightest clue about filmmaking. People like 'Grrr from England' are just literary snobs who don't deserve to have an opinion, because their complaints are silly and ungrounded.",10,0,0,21 December 2002
Mystic River," A big-budget 'Movie of the Week'
","If 'Mystic River' is this year's leading Oscar contender, cinema is in deep trouble. Simply put, there is nothing in this film that you don't see in your typical NBC 'Movie of the Week.' It's that generic.This is one of those movies that thinks it's more important than it really is. The problems don't lay in the direction, but the writing. This small-community-murder-mystery story is something we've seen 100,000 times over. Every plot point you can see coming miles away. The characters are all over-emotional Lifetime TV cardboard cut-outs. And the dialogue? It only exists to spoon-feed the film's subtext to the audience ('Sometimes I think all three of us got in that car' Oy.) So why does material this cliched attract such an A-list cast? Easy. Because such emotionally-charged (yet under-developed) characters give these actors the spotlight. It's an ego-trip. Nothing more.Just because a film tells a tragic story, doesn't make it subversive or Shakespearean. Sorry, but I'm not fooled by this.",1,34,55,17 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of cinema...
","I'll keep this simple:'The Return of the King' perfectly completes what is the single greatest cinematic achievement in the history of film. Never again will audiences be this captivated and emotionally invested in a journey so rich and beautiful.Sure, cinema will never lose it's power and will continue to enthrall us until the end of time. But it will never burn as bright as this.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
