The Blair Witch Project," Surrender to its atmosphere-the only way to appreciate it
","I think that anyone who wants to see a good thriller and is convinced that he will see one, if one decides to see BWP, then one won't be disappointed. Don't listen to what others may tell you, watch it to make up your mind yourselves-and watch it alone! Don't bear with anyone making silly comments while you watch it! Only then will you appreciate the value of BWP, that is FEAR at its utmost degree. For that matter, it can only be compared to the Exorcist.10",10,2,3,4 June 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Second-rate comedy
","I've been avoiding Indiana Jones like the plague until tonight when I decided to see what it's all about. And boy was I in for a treat! I was laughing so hard at every action scene! The music was so laughable, Harrison Ford played worse than Paris Hilton sings and every clich√© imaginable was there.The plot is virtually non-existent during the first half of the movie and when the real action finally kicks in, you see Dr. Jones escaping from difficult situations with unbelievable ease, the ridiculous music score serving as another way of applauding his actions. Those were the best bits. Because then you have the totally random ending that turns your laughter into a WTF expression.The characters are paper-thin - not to mention Spielberg's obsession with the Germans (or anyone non-American or non-Jewish) who have to be depicted as either superevil or superstupid.Unintentionally funny, totally predictable and a waste of money and film. How anyone with an average IQ can enjoy this is beyond me.",3,54,124,24 October 2008
Fight Club," A movie that must be seen more than once
","Ok, so the plot may have a couple of holes, but so what? The way I see it , this is a hymn to human potential, the power within every one of us that some times is so well hidden, the existence of which even WE cannot realize, let alone handle and use. Maybe we won't get to discover it the extreme way the main character does, yet we can sit down and think after watching this film about how much (or little) we can relate to him. And this is just one parameter of the film to analyze. In a movie that gives you so much to think about, a few faults here and there can be overlooked. Also, with this movie, Norton proves that he's probably the best actor of his generation. 8",9,0,1,16 June 2001
The Others," If all thrillers were half as good...
","The Others is an almost excellent thriller. Kidman is excellent in her role, very convincing, and so are the two children, which is rare to see in movies lately. The film is not very frightening, although it contains a couple of shocking scenes. But the best feature is the superb photography; the fog scene in particular is one of the best of its kind, I reckon. The Others undoubtedly deserves numerous Academy Award nominations. One of the best films of 2001.9",9,0,0,21 December 2001
Liar Liar," Best line : 'You can make a living out of making faces!'
","Liar liar is pretty much a one-man-show of a movie. Nobody could carry out the main role but Carrey, simply because it was built FOR and AROUND Carrey - it's quite obvious. I hardly laughed more than 3 times during the whole film, because it was so predictable! The whole story could be used for an episode of any sitcom. Even the tv-like closing credits suggest that. It's certainly much better than Dumb and dumber, but then which movie isn't!!!! Oops! Sorry, I can't lie today!5",5,1,5,9 July 2001
Man on the Moon," Carrey does it again!
","I actually don't know if i'd have liked Kaufman if I 'd got to watch any of his performances, but from what I saw in this movie, he wasn't very funny. Notwithstanding that, I sympathized with him watching him go through all those ups and downs; and that's all due to the excellent direction and acting - mostly, of course, Carrey's acting.  DeVito and Love may do their best in this movie, yet it seems that there's not much space for them and the characters they impersonate end up seeming  a little shallow. Apart from that, though, this is a very good movie, whether we like Kaufman or not; because, in my humble opinion, we're supposed to comment on the movie here, not him.When he's not making all those weird faces in crap movies, Jim Carrey is a brilliant actor. Truman show and this one are here to prove this. Please, let us have more of that, Jim!8",8,0,0,25 July 2001
Saving Private Ryan," A visual treat
","One of the best war films ever made, Saving Private Ryan is raw and shocking. Not only because of the gore scenes, but also because of the camera-work. Using a steadycam, combined with the absence of music soundtrack during the breathtaking battle scenes, gives a realistic and natural feel to the film. War films are hardly an opportunity for actors to showcase their talent, as more focus is set on the viewer's visual pleasure, but in this film time is taken to describe many of the characters.Generally Saving Private Ryan is almost excellent and highly recommended.My only objections are as regards the choice of Hanks for the main role (a role more suitable to Clooney or Crowe, if you ask me), and Damon's teeth; it's remarkable that a soldier that's been through hell for a long period of time could easily be the protagonist in a toothpaste ad. :o)9",9,2,4,29 January 2002
The Producers," Funny enough
","This movie IS funny, all right, but not as funny as everyone claims it is. Ok, there are two or three hilarious moments, but what is there beyond that? I kept smiling throughout the movie but I hardly laughed. It is definitely cleverly written though. I wouldn't argue about that. Actually , I think that The Producers' best feature is the underlying comment it makes on the unreasonable acclaim that cheap products (plays, movies, songs etc.) get from the masses sometimes. It is a very good satire, I just wish there had been a different ending, perhaps a less 'easy' and obvious one. It is worth watching, though. I haven't regretted watching it by any means.almost 7",7,3,6,26 October 2001
Final Destination," Just OK
","The problem with Final destination is the HUGE plot holes - eg whatever happened to Alex's parents in the second part? Secondly, I think the idea behind it might have been better exploited if some supernatural events had been omitted - eg water creeping back into the toilet. And please , someone teach Ali Larter how to act! Yet the action sequences are excellently filmed and the ending is just... awesome, although it actually made me laugh! Finally I hope Devon Sawa will choose his next roles carefully - he deserves more than to be another stereotype thriller character.

Born on the Fourth of July," Realistic but flawed
","I had seen the Deer Hunter a couple of months ago and comparing the two films was almost inevitable. Both films tackle with the same subject: the fate that awaited those who managed to return to their homes from Viet Nam; the attitude towards them by their family, friends and society in general. Although Born on the Fourth of July seems more realistic than the Deer Hunter (and certainly more cruel), at the same time it is irritatingly overemotional at times and contains boring drama cliches. Overall I had the feeling that Stone tried to force viewers to cry, pushing situations too far. Cruise is very good, but he didn't convince me totally. Some scenes though, are definitely worth a look.6",6,0,3,13 January 2002
