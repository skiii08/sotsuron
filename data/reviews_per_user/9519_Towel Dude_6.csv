Requiem for a Dream," Overrated
","Aside from Ellen Burstyn's brave performance, I found nothing original or striking about Aronofsky's drug epic.  For months, I've read about how this movie will grab you by the throat, punch you in the gut, and pummel you with its depiction of drug hell.  I was all set for the ultimate visceral, heavy metal, hardcore, ultra NC-17 experience.  Boy, what a letdown.  What is actually there isn't very groundbreaking. Nothing in Darren's movie hasn't been already shown vividly in movies like 'LESS THAN ZERO'  and the much, much, better film, 'TRAINSPOTTING.'  Aronofsky does have some clever camera moves, and his rapid fire closeup images of getting high, accompanied by weird sound fx, are OK.....for about 5 minutes.  But then Darren's bag of cinematic tricks wears out its welcome, and things get repetitive..... very repetitive - Yeah, I know, they're addicts and that's all they do, but the thing is, the piled-on images ultimately have an opposite effect.  Instead of immersing me deeper into the hell of addiction.....it actually distanced me - left me thinking how much this movie plays like an MTV video. So 'nightmarish' scenes of attacking refrigerators, infected arms, electro shock therapy, and TV diet gurus have no impact or payoff.   Finally, why was this movie rated NC-17???  Alot of R-rated movies are far more graphic.",4,0,1,26 November 2000
The Girl Next Door," Risky Business 2
","Good fun, 90's version of Risky Business.   Substituting 90's porn industry for 80's call girls.  But the seamy subject matter, isn't off putting, because the smart script offers life lessons and insight that is rare in today's teenage sex comedies.    Like Cruise's film, this movie is about a likeable high school dweeb who dreams about 2 things ; getting into a prestigious college, and hooking up with hot babes.  Using RB as a blueprint, the film's arc is familiar, but still vastly entertaining. Clever, funny dialogue, energetic performances, and real sweet chemistry between Elisha and newcomer Emile.  Does it need to be emphasized again about how stunningly gorgeous Ms Cuthbert is?  Wow.  I'm in love.  Movie even uses a couple of songs that were heard on Risky Business soundtrack. Enjoy.  Thanks for reading.  Bye.",7,0,0,11 April 2004
Closer," love, sex, fight, swear, strip....
","I'm sure this film is gonna win the Oscar for best screenplay. Why? Cause every other word of dialogue is 'fawk this' or ' fawk that'. Academy voters admire profanity in films. Proof? Other films that won the writing Oscar, like Pulp Fiction and Good Will Hunting, had 70%profane dialogue . The plot?? Four pretentious people meet each other by accident, interact, fight, fall in love, fall out of love, cry like babies, fight somemore, and disply urbane wit by cussing each other out. All the while classical music, mawkish guitar, and New Wave music plays on the soundtrack.However, worth the price of admission alone, is Natalie Portman's stunning scene with Clive in the strip club. Whoever was running the camera, deserves major cinematography kudos for showcasing Natalie's gorgeous body. she is so hot. Her body is a 10. Alas, the film is not. Thanks for reading.

Cold Mountain," One of the year's best
","Cold Mountain.  Good movie.  Nicole is soooo pretty.  I fell in love with her all over again.  She's supposed to be starving and suffering.  Didn't look it.  She is so breathtakingly beautiful.  Renee is so funny and spunky. Lots of oddball characters and B list star cameos.  My favorite was Natalie Portman in a heartbreaking performance.  Best war battle scene of 2003 ( the turkey shoot in the bomb crater ).  I didn't think Minghella had it in him to display such intense, in-your-face carnage.  Return of the King battle scenes come in a distant 2nd to this ferocity.  The movie's ending had me crying like a woman.  Easily one of my favorite movies of 2003.  Thanks for reading.  Bye.",9,1,1,27 December 2003
Hellboy," Yawn
","Man, this movie was a big let down.   I simply didn't care what happened. Del Toro is great visually, but lousy in simple storytelling. All of Del Toro's intriguing CGI fx and makeup effects, and fancy camera moves, cannot save a movie that fails to involve and entertain you.  A plot that is totally arbitrary in setup, villians that have no palatable threat or menace, annoying sub characters ( fishman, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor )and a hero with good presence, but nothing interesting to do.  One thing puzzled me : ***  SPOILER  ***  after Fire Chick torches the squids in the sewer, next immediate scene is of our heroes being interrogated and tortured. **** END *** What the hell?  I thought the projectionist made a reel change mistake, but no.  It seems 5 or 6 minutes were just lopped off to keep the film under 2 1/2 hrs, leaving me and the audience, stratching our heads. But by that point, I didn't care.  Bye.  Thanks for reading.",5,0,1,3 April 2004
Die Hard," Hollywood's best action movie
","Die Hard = best action film Hollywood has produced.  Here's why. Endurance.  To me, it's the only measure of movie quality. And Die Hard is the only action film that still gives me a colossal charge of adrenaline every time I see it. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Terminator, Enter the Dragon, etc -vastly entertaining films, making a huge impact when I first saw them, but they fail the biggest test of all - repeated viewings.  I just don't get the same monumental thrill, time and again. Die Hard never loses that intense, visceral impact it had on me when I saw it on July 29, 1988, 4:30pm show. Saw it three more times that year, and many more times on video.  A great ride every time. Willis has never been more commanding on film - McTiernan  I don't think could ever top his heavy metal action masterpiece.",10,0,1,25 August 2000
