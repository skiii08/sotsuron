The Benchwarmers," The Benchwarmers
","OK I know some of you think this is a stupid movie, and it is stupid but its so funny that I laughed the whole way trough. The main reason I liked this movie is that it doesn't give away all the jokes in the trailers you see on TV like in Click where they use all the jokes in the trailer and when you go to the movies and watch it you wont laugh as much because you know most of the jokes. But in Benchwarmers they add inn a bunch of Colorful characters that spice up the movie. And I think Jon Heder is perfect in his role in this movie and he adds a little Napoleon Dynamite feeling to it. The worst thing about this movie though is the child actors there just something about them that makes this movie so childish. But if you like stupid movies with stupid humor(like I do) You will definitely like The Benchwarmers.",6,0,0,10 July 2006
