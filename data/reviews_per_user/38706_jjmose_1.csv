The Blair Witch Project," Scary as hell!
","This movie is to my generation what The Exorcist was to my parents.  I have never been as frightened at a movie as I was last Friday, in fact I still can't shake the last scene from my mind.  Don't worry, I won't give it away. I have been listening to the local radio stations say the movie is overhyped and that it's hard to watch and not believable... I personally feel that they are saying it b/c they don't know what else to say, they left the theater b/c they were so afraid, LOL.  The lack of special effects and documentary style of filming is what makes this movie so special.  The filmmakers allow us to use our minds, and that in turn allows the movie to be frightening to everyone, not just those who are scared of blood and guts (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, etc.)  Overall I can honestly say that this was just about the most enjoyable, and frightening movie going experiences I have ever had... I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to be scared out of their pants!",10,1,2,11 August 1999
