Minority Report," Spielberg's best film in years.
","'Minority Report' is probably one of the most brilliantly crafted films in a long time.  It is slick, cohesive, well directed, and unfolds at steady pace that neither rushes or drags.  The action and visual effects are masterfully realized, but are not the intended centerpiece of the film.  But, by no means is it perfect.  I will say this, however;  It is Steven Spielberg's best movie in nearly two decades.The cast does a fantastic job, from main characters to peripheral ones. Yes, Tom Cruise did a good job, but he is surrounded by a plethora of other fine performances that it really would be unfair to single him out.  The 'pre cog' Agatha is so convincing that you can simply feel her exhaustion and frustration.  Max von Sydow is, as always, fantastic.  His motivations are just a single example of the complexity and crafting of the script, brought to life by a solid effort from a seasoned and talented actor. 
One thing that is striking about the film is how clear it unfolds.  It is a science fiction plot, as well as a mystery that grips and compels the characters into action, and resolve itself logically.  However, I had a problem with the choice of the way the film ends, which I will discuss later. I was afraid that the story would come under the hammer of pretensious direction, but Spielberg manages to avoid the un-eveness of A. I., allowing for the strengths of all the talent involved to come through.The best feature of 'Minority Report' is the action.  It does not overwhelm the film, and reminded me why I used to like Spielberg so much.  It was beautifully staged, edited, and was engaging and exciting.  I found myself feeling the same enthusiasm that was generated by the action in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which in many respects has some of the greatest action sequences of all time.  I was thinking 'Aw Cool' while also concerned about what will happen next.  This, in union with the impressive visual effects, made for a perfect marriage of visual and narrative elements.  These scenes have their place in the story, and do not feel unnatural or disjointed.While I liked the film, I did have a few problems with it.  The most glaring problem for me was the tidy 'wrap-up.'  It just felt out of place, and seemed to bury the darker elements of the film with a sugary resolution. The world goes from a Steel-blue, sterile environment to a Golden paradise, where all the problems of the past 145 minutes are made 'OK' within the span of under two minutes.  I am not averse to happy endings, but this was just silly.  I expected nothing less from Spielberg, but I was almost impressed that he managed to avoid slipping into sap that when it happens, I could not help but feel disappointment.In the end, I was impressed with 'Minority Report.'  It has little of the critic-pandering ambiguity of A. I. (not to be confused with ambitious film making, which A. I. most certainly was not!), and manages to be something that is so rare; a good science fiction movie.  This one can be classed with 'Blade Runner', 'Planet of the Apes', and 'The Matrix' as what Science Fiction has the potential to be.  Entertaining, smart, and beautiful.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Problems abound in this bizarre prequel.
","Being a Star Wars fan for so many years makes it very difficult to judge the latest installments in the saga with a clear, unfettered eye.  After seeing Episode I, I felt disappointment, but at the same time there was something admirable about the whole thing.  It was a strange, stilted, but creative film, and it had a very consistent tone and feel.  I had problems with little Anakin, and Jar Jar, and the deadpan acting, but somehow you could see this film as a credible epic.  In short, I liked it.Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, while short on Jar Jar and long on great visuals and action sequences, is all over the place.  It has no genuine, consistent tone.  There are moments of violence, darkness, and serious subject matter, and then the next moment there is a cheap laugh. The film wants to be dark and mature, to deal with the duality of good and evil, but it does not have credibility or the screenplay to make the audience believe (or Make-believe) in what is going on.  In other words, the film fails to entertain.There are wonderful scenes in Episode II, and there are chunks of it that I wish could be transplanted into a film that is less insulting to its audience.  I felt as though I was being jerked around, manipulated in a bad, non-escapist way.  What should be handled with subtlety (such as the 'love story') is so blatant that it is awkward and almost laughable.  In the tender moments between Anakin and Padme, the dialogue is so awful that you feel your stomach twirling in agony.  At certain points, audience members either laughed out loud or sighed (or sobbed with horror)at the romantic exchanges that were supposed to touch your heart. Glances, body language, and, well, less speech could have saved George all that trouble in digging up old cliches and inventing new ones that manage to be worse than the old ones.When weighing in what Episode II amounts to, one is left with this feeling that there was something good in what they have just witnessed, but its hard get past all the garbage.  What was good was the speeder chase through Coruscant, the Jango Fett/Clone business (that costume goes a long way), and the occasional flourish of ACTING from Ewan MacGregor.  Sometimes, if you could get through the wretched dialogue that was coming out of his mouth, Hayden Christensen did exhibit some shred of talent.  Ultimately, however, the film is only recommendable for the 'coolness' factor of its effects, and the incredible designs that were created during pre- and post-production. What should be the 'soul' of the film, the screenplay, the characters, the direction, all seem to be just there, but with nothing new to offer us. Lucas once said that it is not the effects that are important, but the characters and the story that made a good fantasy, and that effects are just a tool.  It seems that he has forgotten his own rule, and has given us a pretty thing without a soul.",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," A genuinely mixed bag
","There are spoilers in this review, so be wary.'The Matrix Reloaded' is so full of 'stuff', so brimming with ideas and images, that one barely has time to recover between each sequence.  In essence, it tries to be so much that in the end I felt somehow mixed about its overall result.To be sure, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is involving and diverting, but it tests your patience with a somewhat bloated and bizarre introduction.  The audience is introduced to Zion through magnificent special effects shots. The central characters are all there, and immediately we are reminded of the romance between Neo and Trinity.  However, instead of taking care of re-introductions in a quick and orderly fashion, we are subjected to a seemingly endless rock video-type dance party, intercut with a sex scene between the two leads.  I have to admit that I was not expecting this from a Matrix movie, and I am not entirely sure it works.  Perhaps something can be said of this blatantly sexual imagery, and how this is what makes us human (or some crap like that), but a few seconds would have sufficed to make the point.  Instead, the audience is treated to a good chunk of film that resembles something from MTV, only with an R rating.There is another rather pointless scene in which a character explains how chocolate cake can have an orgasmic effect upon a woman. This is illustrated in a strange and graphic special effects sequence that seems like it would be more at home in a Ken Russell movie.  Whatever point that is being made by this scene could surely have been done in a more subtle manner, or simply alluded to in a less trashy way.  Eroticism is fine in certain contexts, but I really felt that in the midst of this film it just seems out of place. Perhaps I am being prudish, but it simply did not work for me.There is action galore throughout 'The Matrix Reloaded'.  There are several major sequences that take up plenty of screen time and totally achieve the goal of diverting and entertaining.  However, the first film had a degree of urgency and danger with regard to Neo, who had not developed his powers fully.  This time, Neo is totally unstoppable, and while I enjoyed the martial arts scenes for the effects, choreography, and sheer energy, the outcome was all but too clear.  The Wachowskis recognize this for the car chase, the true action centerpiece of the film, and place Trinity and the always fantastic and engaging Morpheus in the line of danger.  All of the action is very much over the top, and while I did get a kick out of it, it felt as if everything else had taken a back seat to the explosions.  The original Matrix used action and effects to tell the story.  This time, it is well-known by the filmmakers that most people are filling theatre seats to see how the new sequences will top what came before.  This approach does not translate into a better film, and as result, a degree of understatedness has been lost in exchange for bombast and flashiness.As with the first film, the question of what exactly the Matrix is allows for plenty of mind-bending, barely logical plot twists.  I am amazed at how well this premise allows for interesting narrative switches.  There are still dangers and threats, and a set of rules which limit the characters, but the potential for suprises is very much present.  But no one should expect to be as blown away as when they saw the first Matrix.  There is a lot of familiar ground recovered, but thankfully the plot does not slavishly ape what came before.The performances by the leads are very much as strong (or as weak) as they were the first time around.  Laurence Fishburne is fabulous, serving as the solid center around which everyone else orbits.  Carrie-Anne Moss is as wooden as she was in the first outing, but not unlikeable.  Keanu Reeves is still barely getting by, but frankly I do not mind him in the role. Most of the secondary characters are really not all that engaging, and even though various romantic subplots are introduced, I could really care less about any of them.  Perhaps a less cliched approach would have done better to introduce some humanity into the story.  Instead, we get a series of soap opera-type love triangles and a stupid subplot involving a new character who struggles between his duty to Morpheus and his duty as a husband.
There are a lot of problems with 'The Matrix Reloaded.'  Sure its a good time at the movies, but the story could have been told far more effectively without cliches, sleaze, and somewhat superfluous special effects.  There is a great movie in here, but it is somewhat buried under flourishes of mediocrity.  Is it worth your movie fare?  Yes.  Is it as good as the first one? No.  But then again, few sequels are.  While it may not be as awful as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it is definitely not the Empire Strikes Back.6.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,15 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better action is not enough.
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a competent piece of diversion for adults and children alike, but it fails to transcend the medium.  While slick and well-made, there is still something forced about the whole endeavor, in terms of the acting, pacing and some of the visual effects. Daniel Radcliffe is noticeably more comfortable with his role than he was in the first film, which does aid in connecting with the character, but I still find it difficult to be transported into the events of the movie.  In other words, the performances failed to engage me.  However, I was impressed that the film reflected the dark tone of the book, which could have been very easily glossed over by the studio who hopes to profit.  The action sequences are appropriately intense, and the portion in the Dark Forest admittedly scared me to death.  The effectiveness of this and other portions of the film made it a more enjoyable experience than the first.  Despite all that, many of the problems in the Philosopher's Stone persist, holding what could have been an amazing adventure film back, and simply making it a decent piece of entertainment.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
