It," Hiliarious
","I saw this movie at the drive in with a friend and her 10 year old daughter. In the beginning, the Georgie scene, the 10 yr old ends up crying because she's scared. After that, it was all laughs. Pennywise looked like a teenaged Easter Bunny and kind of sounded like he had something stuck in his throat. I don't understand the following this movie gets at all. It isn't scary and it isn't horror. It's downright, straight up, comedy.",3,0,0,6 January 2018
The Polar Express," Beautiful but not good at the same time
","I saw The Polar Express when it was first released with my family. I remember that my dad loved it and I thought it was TOO long. I still dislike it and think it's too long. The message of the story is that you need to 'believe in order for things to happen' sounds like religious based instead of Christmas based. Believing in something doesn't mean that it's true, it doesn't mean that something or someone exists, and it doesn't guarantee that you will get what you want.",5,2,5,6 January 2018
