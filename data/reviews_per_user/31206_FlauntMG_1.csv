The Ring," Better than Ringu...??
","For those who haven't watch the original, spare the nonsense sixth sense imitation and blair witch because Ringu (the original flick) was released way earlier than than those two movie. The original ring, Sadako (later named Samara in the remake) remains as the the main perspective rather than telling nonsense incoherent meaningless tale about a woman and her son. Sadako who played by Rie Inou just simply amazing in Ringu compared to rather dull 'jason wannabe' Samara which for me just ruin the whole show. Hideo Nakata was hailed as 1 of the greatest director (and not horror film director alone)in Asia because the way he tell the story using only sound, camera view and angle and sheer excellence acting by the cast, way difference and 'not pathetic like' Hollywood stereotype gory and nudity involvement horror flick. The point is this movie trying ever so hard to delved upon the original film but did they succeed, i believe the answer is NO. The story telling is slow and incoherent. But the worst part is u just cannot sense the fear in Naomi Watts and that's just so unforgiveable because in the original Ringu almost all the cast did they job brilliantly, U can sense the fear in Reiko eyes when she discover the tape. And u can sense her uneasiness and shaking by just looking at her body movement. Now, that i call a 5 star horror acting is all about.My verdict: ** out of *****",Null,1,3,6 April 2003
