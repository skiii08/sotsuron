Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars for Kids?
","At first I did not like this movie very much, but the second time I watched, it turned out to be OK. It didn't give very much for the old Star Wars fans, but seemed more like trying to recruit new fans from a very young public.Episode I is definitely not the comeback the original Trilogy deserves, but still makes a decent movie. I usually hate kid actors, but Jake Lloyd does a really good job in my opinion. The same doesn't go for all the actors though.The plot itself was alright. I like how it was somehow really obvious that Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious played everyone for getting the place as Supreme Chancellor, but still did it so smoothly. Otherwise the plot was very plain: Jedis rescuing people again and again while destroying droids in exchange of stormtroopers.One thing I really dislike was Jar Jar Binx. He was annoying all the time, he was stupid and contributed with absolutely nothing. He did absolutely nothing useful at all in the entire film. It was like the jokes were for 6-year-old children. Then I got thinking, maybe this movie was really meant to attract a younger audience? I mean the whole tone of the movie was really friendly to children. Why was George Lucas ignoring the old fans?Otherwise it was at times creative with some of the animations and details, making it able to stand up for another view. My opinion, it's not a bad movie, but it seems a bit too childish to be able to take it seriously.",6,6,10,14 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Most Boring of Them All
","The Attack of the Clones continues the story with teenage Anakin starting to discover his darker side, while unknown powers continue to threaten the Republic and a mysterious Clone Army is discovered from a distant system. Although the film is very rich in content, it somehow manages to become boring.This was an even bigger letdown than Episode I. Much happened and it was very important considering the future events, but somehow it all fell flat. When the movie ended I thought nothing important happened in it, but when I thought back on it, I realized it was important to the storyline. Why did it become boring? When I think about the film, the first that comes to mind is the tiresome romantic scenes between Anakin and Padm√©. They didn't get to me at all and bored me out. I think it should have concentrated a bit more with Anakins inner struggle like Episode III. Plus it made important events such as finding the army of clones and the pursuit for the Sith Lord seem like minor subplots.Overall it is an important piece in the puzzle, but I think has no rewatching value.",6,1,4,15 January 2012
