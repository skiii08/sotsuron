Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Okay to watch but if it was not Star Wars it would not stand out much
","Well I am surprised to see as I read some of the reviews that a lot of people think the movie was ok rather then good. Thats about where I stand. As a whole it was ok, but there was just to many little things which brought it down. To name a few:1. Acting - Though the main character acting was good the non main character acting was not. During the space battle towards the end the acting was rather dull. Unlike the first Star Wars where you were drawn into the fight I felt as an outsider during this battle.2. Too much predictabilty. Yes I know it is a prequel and so you know what is going to happen but they over loaded it during this movie. An example being Anakin during the space battle. It seemed to easy for me that Anakin made it through that ships shields into the landing bay and manages to blow the ship up. Then just as the Jar Jar rase is about to die all the droids stop working.I could go on but it would take too long. Overall Lucas put too much time into special effects and not in plot. Unfortunately most people will not agree with me because it's Star Wars.",4,0,1,23 June 1999
Batman Begins," A Triumph
","I expected this movie to be enjoyable when I sat down to watch it. I was enticed by the trailers and was ready to be impressed. The first ten minutes of the film had me rolling my eyes and questioning every directorial decision by Nolan. Where was this movie going! Suddenly, it clicked. Ducard showed up in Wayne's cell and from that point forward I was in heaven. First ten minutes of skepticism forgotten.Everything about this film I found fantastic. The performances, for example. Brilliant. Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne in a way Keaton never could have. Michael Caine provides some dry humor while being utterly believable as a caring confidant. Cillian Murphy's understated Crane was deliciously creepy and smug, and the Scarecrow scenes were inventive and fresh. Liam Neeson was goddamn extraordinary. Rutger Hauer/Morgan Freeman were decent, and Katie Holmes serviceable.I wish the other Batman films had never been made. This is not a prequel, folks: this is a re-start. Burton's films, while in line with his body of work (quirky, creative masterpieces), are NOT true Batman films. Keaton sleepwalks through the role and Batman is done a disservice. Bale nails both Wayne and Batman in a way never captured in a live-action film before.Found the scene where Bruce's parents are murdered surprisingly powerful. Nolan truly is a dramatic talent. THe entire Bruce Wayne backstory borders upon brilliant, with bale and neeson proving they are incredible actors who can deliver a believable yet forceful performance.Yes, the action is choppy, and yes, the film ends jaggedly. What happened in the aftermath of the fear toxin? Never explained. Very minor quibbles. These are the only faults I can find with this film.The score is perfect, the performances fantastic, the writing very decent (some corny one liners could have been excised, but who's counting). All in all, an incredibly film that I saw twice and loved both times. This movie needs to be enjoyed by everyone, so that a sequel can be made. Please see this movie. Nolan can learn from his mistakes and improve upon his triumphs. The next film can only get better. See it so there will be a next film! And forget the crappy Burton Batmans ever existed - these movies are different and better.10/10",10,1,2,18 June 2005
