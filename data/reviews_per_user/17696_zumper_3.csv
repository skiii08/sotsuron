Ford v Ferrari," Brilliant movie
","The movie has it all. Comedy, drama, villany, action and very good acting. There is nothing to dislike. Give yourself a favor and go to the movie to see this masterpiece. Everything in the right doses.",9,1,1,7 January 2020
Fury," Unrealistci biased bad movie.
",Biased piece of ... well you know. really abd move with bad fighting scenes. A tiger can pick a target as far as a mile and do not need to advance toward shermans. And german tank crews were well known for hiting their targets from first round at large distances. Really lame piece of junk.,4,2,5,2 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars almost mistic atmosphere is done.
","This girl felt off a tree and raised as a jedi. For a true star wars fan this is a spit in the face. Even Darth Vader one of the most powerful force sensitives needed years of training. This chik just took a force pill right after she's birth control medication and here she goes. Mr. Disney sir, if you are drunk, please go home. We had enough. As bad as the other character, Kylo Ren, who's acting like a 12 years old with psychotic episodes.",5,5,6,16 May 2018
