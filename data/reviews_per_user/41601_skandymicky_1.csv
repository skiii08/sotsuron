United 93," touchingly human
","United 93 is different from the other plane-related action movies I've seen. It's not a documentary on September 11, and yet you watch some news on TV; there are terrorists, but that's not what scares you the most; there are human stories but they don't hit you singularly. I watched all the events of September 11 from around the world, and yet I felt my eyes watering, so I wouldn't recommend the movie to relatives of the victims. It made me pray against the odds for a different ending, even though I knew precisely what was going to happen. I think it gives to not Americans a real look inside the pain of impotence, especially hearing the phone calls speaking of love instead of haste. That's more touching then all we saw on national telly. Loved it",9,12,26,29 April 2006
