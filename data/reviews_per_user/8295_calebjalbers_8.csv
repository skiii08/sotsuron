10 Cloverfield Lane," Couldn't wait for it to end. Or something to actually happen.
",Spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen to movie the plot along. It was less fun to watch these people in a bunker than it would be to actually be stuck in such a bunker. Got so excited when she finally did escape and there were monsters outside. But then it ended.,4,0,2,1 November 2019
Zootopia," Favorite Disney Movie Ever
","The ideals represented in Zootopia are more relevant to the real world than any other Disney movie I've seen. There are the more obvious principles of social justice on full display here, such as the themes of diversity and tolerance for others-obviously embodied by the primary duo of the film being 'natural' enemies: a fox and a rabbit. What sets Zootopia apart though is how well it treats the issues and how the themes apply not only to issues of racial bias, but to all forms of intolerance of any number of personal traits. The themes of inclusion extend to all groups or persons who might feel othered for any reason.Zootopia also features strong themes of believing in yourself and in others. Of breaking out of the mould of what the world tells you are your limits or how high you should aim. Or even the value of having any notion of reaching after your aspirations at all, instead of settling for the familiar well-worn path of your parents and those around you. The idea of daring to tread the unpaved road.From a cinematic perspective, the characters are great and the world is both beautiful and intriguing. Ample amount of humor too.",10,1,1,19 April 2020
500 Days of Summer," Zooey is cute. But everything here is just awful
","I was forced to watch this when it first came out because my best friend liked it somehow. Almost couldn't forgive this. None of the characters are particularly likable or even stand out. It's just dull. And the movie is built around you feeling for this dude, but you can't empathize for him because he's a freaking loon. Zooey (whose character's name I had forgotten until I remembered the name of the movie) tells that guy (who cares what his name is) exactly what her expectations are and he just can't handle it. But the movie acts like we're supposed to side with that guy as if Summer keeps playing games with him-even though she repeatedly tells him exactly what she's looking for to make sure he doesn't get the wrong idea. And that is the plot. Which is less exciting than watching this guy break plates with a frown. Which is the highlight of this movie. And what's with the parentheses on (500)? Hipster garbage. I hate it so much. Zooey is always a cute person but I can't even like her in this. World, listen to me. Let's all agree not to include this movie in any time capsules or culture pods sent into space so that if some apocalypse does occur we can at least have the silver lining of knowing this movie ended with the rest of the world. 2 stars for Zooey. But don't see this movie whatever you do. Probably used in Guantanamo.",2,7,11,1 November 2019
Juno," Has Michael Cera
",Tried to watch this once; I'm still scarred. Oh it's terrible. Cheap and dull.,2,0,1,1 November 2019
Now You See Me," Not worth watching.
",The acting and production is well do e enough. But the plot and 'tricks' are quite mediocre. The movie tries so hard to be clever but fails hard because it's so predictable. Which undermines the main draw of the movie.,4,0,2,1 November 2019
Frozen," Mediocre at best
","This film is heralded as some sort of triumph of feminism or reawakening of classic Disney magic. It is neither of those things. There are very few positive messages at all, and quite a number of concerning issues that arise. None of these characters have any trait that is particularly worthy of emulation, and don't acquire adequate character development to attain such a trait. The younger sister (a shut in who probably has never seen a boy her own age before) decides over the course of one night that this rando that came to her sister's party is who she wants to marry-he is a prince after all! Then friend zones the blonde peasant until-surprise!-prince guy turns out not to love me! I better go find blonde bro because apparently he does! And so naturally only this burly man can save me from my sister's tantrum witch curse. Elsa is the awful role model that no little child should look up to. Take a minute to try to think of her positive traits. I'll wait... other than that she loves her sister enough to come save her (though not enough to have talked to her much in the last decade or so). Then there's their proportions. Just like barbie before them, if any human had proportions like these two they would need immediate medical care. No one is shaped like that. From their bug eyes that take up all their triangularly pointed faces, to their tiny waists. It's unnatural. If you want a positive role model, look to Mulan or Hermione or Emilia Earhart or Marie Curie. Cleopatra even! But not some deformed, emotionally unstable damsels in distress. This movie is awful.",3,3,8,4 November 2019
A Quiet Place," Nice Drama. Let down on thrills
","Fantastic performances from the cast all around, but the story left a lot to be desired. Kept waiting for something to happen which never did. Lots of plot holes that don't make sense while you're watching and even less when you start to think about it. But the cast is very connectable! Nice little story about a family living in the country, oh and sometimes there are monsters I guess haha. Good to watch as a drama, not a thriller.",6,1,2,27 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Strong Lead Character With Disappointing Ending
","The film has a lot of good things going for it, and is probably the best of the recent DC movies (not that the bar is high). Wonder Woman herself is excellent, and makes a strong argument in favor of including more female superheroes. Positive messages are here, but not epic feels in your heart. One good character is not enough. I'm sure other people liked Chris Pine's character more than I did though. He wasn't bad, just not particularly interesting. They seem to have relegated him to the traditionally female role (which itself needs to be fixed) of being 1 dimensional and without much depth or thought. Like his character exists entirely as a romantic interest and as eye candy; which is typically how film treats women. That aside, everything works well together until the finale. Which has the result of establishing a lot of forward momentum throughout the film only for that momentum to cause hard skidding against the ground when the end falls flat on its face.",7,1,3,2 July 2020
