Conquest 1453," Fast & Loose with history
","The flick is pretty lame. I realize that historical dramas take liberty with the details but his goes 'way beyond and acceptable norm. On top of that it's full of 'B' movie clich√©s, (bare-armed, helmet-less warrior heroes, etc.).Most egregious, perhaps, was Mehmed entering the Hagia Sophia (by himself) and declaring peace & love -- in fact he ordered it sacked. Mehmed also allowed his troops three days to pillage the city, (a standard practice admittedly); thousands of Christians were massacred and over 30,000 sold into slavery. Only after that did Mehmet declare an amnesty and eventually invite Christians and Jews as well as Muslims to return to the city.",6,1,2,25 December 2013
