Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," hohoho...
","In 1999-2000 Ali G was the funniest thing on UK TV (late night Channel 4 - remember?), with Baron Cohen brilliantly dissecting the thorny issue of race whilst being hilarious to boot. This didn't last, however, as on his own stand-alone show (and film) the Ali G character quickly becoming a tired clich√©. Then came Borat - funny, original, sharp ... alas, he's gone the same way. Let's get it straight - this film is bad, really bad. At times it looks as if the film will use Borat to expose the hidden underbelly of American life, to our amusement. Instead, Cohen opts for the easy option - sex gags (every 5 mins), gay gags, women gags, disabled gags, 'funny foreigner' gags - that's reeeeeeeeaaaaaaal original Sacha. This laziness extends to the material itself - half the scenes here have already been shown in pared-down form on the UK TV show (the dinner, the rodeo etc.). That said, I give the film a '2' as there are some interesting things here - the horribly obnoxious New Yorkers for instance, or the insight we get into the right-wing fundamentalist types. But these are few and far between - both the above mentined scenes end with an oh-so hilarious piece of slapstick/physical comedy.In short, if jokes about faeces, penises, vaginas, 'retards', prostitutes and masturbation are your thing then go see this film. The audience of juvenile males with whom I saw this cinematic abortion loved it.",2,11,23,4 November 2006
The Prestige," If anything can happen, then nothing happens
","Two magicians really don't each like other.Possibly there's an interesting obsession/revenge film in that plot outline somewhere, but not in this shockingly over-rated bore-fest.Someone once said, 'if anything can happen, then nothing happens'. It's boring. Having no limits isn't liberating - it's dull. Throwing a gazillion twists, having characters radically alter their personalities on a whim, death, suicide, betrayal yadda yadda!Less is more. Unless you're Christopher Nolan - in which case, just chuck absolutely everything you can think of at the screen and hope some of it sticks. Newsflash - it doesn't. Throw in some of the worst British accents this side of Dick van Dyke and hey presto - you've got the Prestige. IMDB top 250?! oh please.2 stars - 1 each for David Bowie and Michael Caine, both of whom somehow got roped into acting in this turkey.",2,3,4,26 January 2020
The Godfather: Part III," An unfairly treated film
","After having read so many negative things about this movie, I was a bit worried that it might ruin the Godfather saga. How wrong I was. Part III is a worthy addition to the saga and has being unfairly treated by various film critics and fans.You really feel for Michael Corleone as he tries to completly eradicate the shadows of his criminal past and move on to be respectable.The film interweaves this with a shady conspiracy dealing with the Vatican and the murder of the reformist Pope John Paul I.However unbelievable this may sound, it has it's roots in real life.As the film goes on, you see how Michael has changed from a murderous near-tyrant to a older more human person.***MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW***A very beautiful and emotional part in part III is when Michael's son, Anthony, plays a love song in Italian on an acoustic guitar.The scene is mixed in with footage from part I at Michael's wedding.It's a very poignant scene and is not only the best in the film, but one of the best in the saga.***END SPOLERS*** The film is not without it's faults, however.Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone is awful in all her scenes.I cringed every time she appeared and she would of ruined the movie had it not been for the excellence to be found elsewhere. All in all, The Godfather Part III is a brilliant film.Don't listen to the critics and watch the film.You won't be disappointed.",Null,0,1,29 June 2002
