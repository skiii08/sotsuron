The Legend of Bagger Vance," Simply excellent
","I really enjoyed the way director Redford captured the period of this story. The cultural folkways were pitch perfect. Leads Smith, Damon, and Theron are uniformly great and are backed nicely by a mored than competent supporting cast. All of the dramatic, mystical, and romantic elements worked perfectly. Strongly recommended, 8/10.",8,0,1,13 January 2004
Vertigo," Haunting tale of love and loss
","To lose the woman you love once would be bad enough but to lose her twice with the added complication that she is one and the same is something altogether tragic. This film is so great on so many levels, it is hard to find the words to adequately praise it. Kim Novak certianly gave her finest performance here playing a very complex range of emotions with subtlety and a superb craftsman's touch. Stewart, in what I think is his finest role, also delivers a very multi-layered performance. There is yet another brainy bespectacled sidekick for Scottie in the tradition of Shadow of a Doubt and Strangers on a Train. Numerous San Francisco landmarks highlight the exquisite cinematography and Bernard Hermann's score hauntingly resides in the memory. The trick of zooming in and simultaneously pulling the camera back for the the illusion of depth also demonstrated great ingenuity. 10/10.",9,2,3,14 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Under-appreciated
","It is understandable that so many people underappreciate this movie for two reasons The first is simply the large fan base. It is virtually impossible to please so large a group. The second reason, which could alleviate the first, is that many people fail to look at The Phantom Menace as the first chapter in the saga. The movie has to not only stand alone but also lay the foundation for further chapters. Sadly many have overlooked the sheer creativity and inventiveness of Lucas and his team in creating this science fiction masterpiece. On another note many have accused the film of using ethnic stereotypes. Watto is seen as being a stereotypically avaricious Jewish merchant while the Viceroy (who oddly is wearing vaguely Catholic looking ceremonial attire) is seen as a scheming Oriental tyrant replete with a World War II Hollywood Asian accent. And then there is Jar Jar Binks with his Jamacian pigeon English and Stepin Fetchit characterization. Only Lucas can say for certain whether the characters were intentionally modeled on such stereotypes but I doubt it given the universal themes of the Star Wars saga. It's also interesting to note that no one complains when anyone, even a minority, makes fun of Arnold Schwarzeneggar's accent but if someone were to poke fun of say Jackie Chan's accent, there would be an uproar. I guess that's a double standard we live with but I digress. As pure film, The Phantom Menace is a visual masterpiece. We'll have to wait until Episode III to see just how well Episode I served as the first chapter. Even as a stand alone film, though, it one the greatest science fiction epics ever.",9,17,35,4 November 2003
The Sound of Music," Lives up to its reputation!
","The musical is not my genre of choice. I prefer classic film-noirs which are about as diametrically opposed to musicals as a genre can be. That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended, 9/10!",9,1,7,8 May 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," First class entertainment
","This movie can be recommended on the strength of Spielberg's gift for narrative film, the exhilarating stunt sequences and the fact that Harrison Ford in his prime was the quintessential action-hero. I personally enjoyed The Last Crusade the most because of the chemistry between Ford and Connery but I appreciate the arguments that Raiders is the zenith of the series (So far. I believe there is a fourth installment in development).",9,0,0,16 November 2003
Chinatown," Even better on subsequent viewings
","This film starts out slowly and methodically and gradually builds to one of the most shattering climaxes in film history. I don't usually gush about films but in this case I think extravagant praise is justified. Master screenwriter Robert Towne's script gives the actors some of the best material any screen performer has ever had. What else can be said about Jack Nicholson's, Faye Dunaway's, and John Ford's performances that hasn't already been said. They are simply perfect. It was interesting to read in Dunaway's biography, My Life Looking for Gatsby, how unpleasant and even abusive director Polanski was toward the cast, particularly towards, her but even to Nicholson. Yet the final result of their collaboration is a film that is exemplary in every facet, 10/10.",9,0,2,9 September 2003
Fight Club," Unforgettable film
","I am a big fan of Michael Jackson and noticed that the video for his single 'Who Is It' was directed by David Fincher so I rented a couple of DVDs by this same director whose style caught my eye. The first DVD was Seven and it is a masterpiece which I won't comment on here. The second DVD was Fight Club and I am not exaggerating when I say I was truly mesmerized by this film. I found Mr. Fincher's shot selection unique and creative in practically every scene and I found the story impossible to draw myself away from. Although I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, I believe Edward Norton should have got top billing for Fight Club. He is definitely the anchor of the film and he pulls off his character's insecurities, affirmation, and paranoia  superbly. This film deserves the plaudits it has received, 8/10.",8,0,1,4 March 2003
Citizen Kane," Groundbreaking classic
","I found Citizen Kane to be a technically innovative and fairly engaging film. It is a great parable about what is really important in life: a childhood filled with love (ie. Rosebud). I wouldn't say that it is necessarily in my top one hundred films of all time but I can appreciate the arguments of those who say it is. What is undeniable is that it is a classic cinematic masterpiece whose pioneering techniques of visual storytelling influence filmmakers to this day. Recommended mostly for historical significance, 7/10.",7,0,2,9 December 2003
Amistad," Difficult subject matter
","As 'entertainment,' if you can call a movie dealing with the subject matter Amistad concerns itself with 'entertainment,' the film is very powerful. The problem I have in endorsing it as much I might want to is I'm not sure how much of the content is historically accurate and how much has been improvised for dramatic purposes. Anyhow the mutiny aboard the Amistad in 1839 (not that long ago when you think about it) and the subsequent trial of the insurrectionists made for compelling viewing. All of the principal actors were directed perfectly by master director Spielberg. For me, Anthony Hopkins' (such a superb actor) Adams is deserving of special praise. Down through the ages, all peoples have been subjected to the torment of bondage. Amistad powerfully tells the story of a group of Africans' struggle against their oppression.",7,0,2,15 November 2004
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men make one happy viewer!
","While the term masterpiece is often bandied about capriciously, in the case of director Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men the word can be most aptly applied. It is absolutely marvelous to behold the layers of twelve distinctly different men peel away to reveal their fundamental cores as they fulfill their civic duty as jurors who must decide on the fate of a young man accused of murder. The characterization and interaction of the twelve men will fascinate any viewer who enjoys films that explore the triumphs and failings of the human condition. Intriguing premise, perfect casting, intelligent dialogue, and superb direction all make me give 12 Angry Men the the highest possible recommendation. 10/10. Go see it now if you haven't already! 12 Angry Men is a truly unforgettable film experience!!",10,0,1,21 January 2003
The English Patient," A moving World War II period piece
","I thoroughly enjoyed the unraveling of the mystery of The English Patient. I hadn't read the book, but I found the film to be exotic and romantic. The performances are all top notch with Binoche deserving special mention. This film has some truly unforgettable images. It most assuredly deserved the Oscar over Fargo. A true classic, 10/10.",9,1,4,20 December 2003
Elizabeth," Very good historical drama
","First I want to say I know this film slightly deviates from or speculates upon actual historical events, but it nonetheless stays close enough to the historical record so as not to offend sensibility. On the filmmaking aspect, Elizabeth is a triumph. Outstanding location shooting, costumes, and cinematography are evident. Director Kapur is blessed with a fantastic cast and he utilizes each of its members wonderfully. In my opinion, Cate Blanchett should definitely won the Oscar over Gwenyth Paltrow for her portrayal of Elizabeth. A great film, 9/10.",8,0,1,15 February 2003
Billy Elliot," Very moving drama
","I appreciated the dramatic aspects of this film more than the comic but they mesh together nicely on the whole. The whole film felt very realistic and plausible and not glossily manufactured like most Hollywood productions. Perhaps that's because it's British. The youngster who played the title character was also marvel, having to not only possess that singular accent but also be able to act and dance. The rest of the cast is also very strong in their roles. Good movie, 8/10.",8,0,0,12 February 2004
Batman Returns," The decline begins...
","In the original Batman, the villain, the Joker was a sufficient force to oppose Batman. In Batman Returns, apparently the producers didn't think that any of villains alone were of sufficient magnitude so they pitted three, the Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max Schreck, to face our hero. Although it should be noted that the Catwoman is not merely a villain but a love interest as well. Like in the case of the Joker, the Penguin's origin was modified from his origin in the comics. It is more grotesque and the character himself as portrayed by Devito is more grotesque and revenge minded than his comics' counterpart who is more concerned with material gain. The materialistic villain in Batman Returns is Max Schreck. Digressing slightly, I just want to say I am a huge fan of both Devito and Christopher Walken. Batman's role is actually slightly diminished since the villains, in addition to fighting him, predicatably turn on each other. Again like it's predecessor, the props, sets, and special effects were state of the art for their time. Thankfully Burton stuck around to helm this one as well. He would be conspicuous by his absence from the director's chair by the time the next installment was released. Solid entertainment, 7/10.",7,0,0,13 February 2003
L.A. Confidential," Terrific!
","Being a big fan of film noir, I really enjoyed this film. You are in the world of Raymond Chandler here. But not only is there an intriguing crime mystery to watch unravel, more importantly there are meaty, well-defined, and interesting characters to take you on the journey. Bud White, Exley, Jack Vincennes, the tabloid writer, the Veronica Lake hooker and the police chief amongst others are all very interesting and their various plot threads weave together seamlessly and convincingly toward a very satisfying, not to mention searing, climax. Anyone nostalgic for the Los Angeles of the period will be in awe of the of the way the film captures the atmosphere of that time and place. One of my favorite films, 10/10.",9,1,4,31 May 2004
X-Men," An excellent comic book adaption
","The X-Men is great motion picture entertainment. With its restrained pacing and devotion to character development, it also moves beyond mere entertainment and explores deeper issues such as tolerance. For the most part the special effects are convincing. An exception is a scene where a ship landing on water clearly appears to be a model. The cast is first rate but Jackman's Wolverine clearly steals the show. Now that Halle Berry has become a bigger star, her role in the sequel will no doubt be expended. My favorite scenes were the philsophical exchanges between Stewart's Xavier and MacKellan's Magneto. This movie was great on the big screen but the impressiveness of its panoramas and special effects diminish somewhat on DVD, even on a big screen TV. Still a terrific movie that provides more than escapist entertainment, 8/10.",8,0,0,26 February 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Very good entertainment
","While this film isn't revelatory, it is very good escapist fare. There is a sense of adventure and Butch and Sundance are slick and charismatic. I enjoyed the action scenes and liked the chemistry between stars Redford and Newman. Ms. Ross (The Graduate) also added to the mix in a most satisfactory way. All in all, I felt the film brought to life the legend of Butch and Sundance with the perfect mix of drama, comedy, and action. Recommended, 7/10.",7,0,2,5 December 2003
The Beach," Good as a Di Caprio vehicle
","While the film seems to be a meandering collage of genres, it is held together securely enough by the presence of its talented star, Leonardo Di Caprio. I want to say that I'm not praising 'Leo' because of his looks or because he is a 'heartthrob.' I simply enjoy the performances of this immensely talented young actor and found his work in The Beach to be up to the high standards he has established for himself. Besides 'Leo' the film is also memorable for its breathtaking cinematography. A better than average film, 7/10.",7,0,1,4 March 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Very stylish
","In this modernist interpretation of the Bard's classic, the fine performances of the leads Romeo, Juliet, Tybalt and Friar Laurence, are overshadowed somewhat by the stylized update of the classic setting. Still, one must admire the verve and audacity of the director for attempting and executing successfully, for the most part, his vision. However, I'll never forget my elderly Shakespeare professor's expression of indignation when she discussed the film version 'with the cars and guns.' I myself found the film moving to the point of tears so to me it was an unqualified success. Recommended, 8/10.",7,3,6,28 October 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," A tame Taming of the Shrew
","No one will mistake Stiles and Ledger for Taylor and Burton but there are a few enjoyable moments in 10 Things to make it a marginally worthwhile teen oriented adaptation of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. The likeable teen cast which features many recognizable faces besides the leads do a competent job bringing their characters to life. Unfortunately too many of the characters are written as stereotypes of what the writers think teenagers are supposed to be like. We have all seen these characters many many times before. And the writers couldn't resist having the climax be at the all important prom as if that plot device hasn't been used a million times before. Still despite the clichÃ©s, I found myself interested enough to see it through. 7/10.",7,0,0,14 March 2004
The Bourne Identity," Better than Bond
","I haven't read the book so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the film as an adaptation but standing alone I thought it a very  impressive espionage thriller. Damon (with his Chicklet like capped teeth) was very believable as Bourne and the rest of the cast was more than competent. The stunts and martial arts choreography were very exciting and exhilarating and were executed (no pun intended) most impressively. I look forward to further installments in the franchise. Recommended, 8/10.",10,0,1,11 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great fantasy film
","I hadn't read any of the books when I saw this at the cinema. I still haven't read any of the books now that I saw it on DVD (the regular edition) recently. As a film, I appreciated the dedication of the filmmakers in bringing to life the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth when designing the costumes, makeup, props, sets, and digital effects. The acting by the prestigious all-star cast was also very competent. My only complaint is that in Hugo Weaving's character (Elrond), I could always hear Agent Smith of Matrix fame. Still, this very minor quibble aside, I look forward to viewing the remaining chapters in the trilogy.",8,0,0,3 December 2003
The Caine Mutiny," Outstanding film
","The Caine Mutiny works well on so many levels. It is a great insight into navy life, a first rate legal drama, and an unforgettable character study. Jose Ferrer and Fred MacMurray are superb, and indeed so is the entire cast, but the film clearly belongs to Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg. It's a real treat to see 'Bogie' in a film where he isn't a gangster or a romantic with a gruff exterior. Bogart spectacularly conveys the sheer complexity of his character: the quirks, the devotion to duty, the demand for perfection, the refusal to accept his own fallibility. It is a truly exceptional performance. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",9,62,82,25 February 2003
The Thing," Terrific cult sci-fi horror thriller
","This being my first John Carpenter film, I must say I was very impressed by The Thing. Right from the beginning, the film draws you in, and never lets up on the tension. The film's special effects and models hold up well even today. Other than Kurt Russell, I wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. The Universal DVD has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",9,1,2,16 May 2003
Armageddon," Summer of '98 hell
","Loud, noisy, jingoistic junk that was a waste of money and of time for the talent involved. The actors, directors, producers, etc. have all been involved in worthwhile projects but this isn't one of them. Other than a few scenes between Affleck and Tyler, this film has no redeeming value whatsoever.",1,1,4,17 November 2003
North by Northwest," Outstanding spy thriller
","This film is enjoyable on so many levels. In addition to being his usual dashing and debonair self, Cary Grant also plays being flustered very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint (who hosts a very interesting documentary of the film on the DVD) is elegant and graceful in the tradition of Grace Kelly which Hitchcock loves so much. James Mason as Van Damme and Martin Landau as Leonard wonderfully underscore their villainy thereby make its implication more threatening than the actual execution (no pun intended). Van Damme and Leonard also appear to have a homosexual undertone in their relationship. There are so many memorable moments in this film. My favorite is the encounter between Roger and Eve on the train. Superb film. Highly recommended, 9/10.",9,0,0,18 March 2003
Doctor Zhivago," Very good romance epic
","There are many facets of Doctor Zhivago that make it a film to recommend. Omar Sharif as the title character is convincing as a handsome and idealistic doctor. Julie Christie as Lara his soulmate is equally superb. The actress who plays Zhivago's faithful wife Tonya is also perfectly cast though her undying loyalty to Zhivago is a questionable character trait. Rod Steiger has a memorable supporting role. In addition to masterfully handling his cast, director David Lean gives us a chilling (beyond the weather) glance at the upheaval of the revolution. There is nothing positive about communism in practice. This murderous ideology is responsible for at least 30 million deaths in Russia and 40 million in China, not to mention millions more in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world. As a scourge of humanity it is worse than Nazism. The film does meander at points but the performances of the leads, the beautiful cinematography, and stark realism more than compensate for any shortcomings. Recommended, 8/10.",8,3,4,18 March 2003
The Shining," Nicholson's tour de force
","I am glad to note that my viewing of The Shining led me to conclude that the reputation of this film is deserved. What else can be said about Nicholson's performance in this film? His descent into madness  is simply astonishing. On my second viewing, I increased my esteem for Ms. Duvall's work. She isn't a glamorous actress and that is why she is overlooked quite frankly. The child actor was also excellent thanks to his innate child qualities. Unforgettable imagery permeates the entire film. In short, it is a brilliant exercise in psychological terror. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",9,0,1,30 October 2003
Apocalypse Now," Great acting
","I should begin by saying I've never seen the original version of this film, only the extended version on DVD. I really was impressed by the caliber of acting in this movie. The scenes with Brando's Kurtz are truly unforgettable and Martin Sheen as the protagonist is in top form too. Obviously the material they are working from is top notch. The smaller roles like Robert Duvall's and Harrison Ford's were more than serviceable as well. The photography was spectacular too. IF this is the way the U.S. really conducted it's operations in Vietnam I can see why they lost to the more disciplined and committed Vietcong. I don't think we got 'peace with honor.' I believe that the U.S. Government didn't do all it could to win the war. I think traitors and conspirators whose interests were only their own, not America's, stabbed the American fighting man in the back. One day I hope there is a reckoning. By the way I rate the extended version 8/10. The reason I don't score it higher is that by my tastes it's not a film that I really want to see again. Still it is undeniably a masterpiece.",8,1,1,3 July 2003
The Patriot," Cartoon version of the Revolutionary war
","This film left me with fixed feelings. I will begin with the negative and end with the positive. What bothered me most about The Patriot are the carcicatured portrayals of the British. I know they are supposed to be 'the villains' but often their cruelty is over the top, especially Jason Isaac's character. Another annoyance is the presentation of the battle scenes. While they are spectacularly choreographed and filmed, it's absurd when characters (eg. Martin's family) are viewing them like a football game instead of ducking for cover. Despite these quibbles, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Mel is absolutely convincing as the alternatively grieving and raging patriot. I found some of the death scenes so moving I started crying. The supporting cast is also superb and took their direction perfectly. I also enjoyed the detail payed to the costumes, props, and hairstyles. The Patriot is NOT an accurate historical docudrama but it is a rousing and entertaining well above average summer movie. Recommended, 8/10.",7,16,32,11 March 2003
Save the Last Dance," An intriguing teen movie
","I think the primary factor determining whether the viewer will enjoy this film is whether he or she has a liberal or conservative attitude. The film does a fair enough job of exploring complex societal issues to influence young and impressionable people who at this point in their lives may not have had much exposure to such topics. I appreciated the acting ability and dancing of the two lead actors. The supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all, an interesting viewing experience.",7,0,2,9 December 2003
Spider-Man," Superb adaptation; has a lot of parallels with Smallville
","Sam Raimi's Spider-man has a lot of parallels with Alfred Gough's and Miles Millar's Smallville television series which chronicles the adventures of a young Clark Kent. Both Peter and Clark are high school students struggling to fit in. Both have a love interest that seems out of reach; Mary Jane for Peter and Lana Lang for Clark. Both budding superheroes come from modest households and yet also have warm and caring adoptive families. Both of them have rich best friends who flirt with the darker side of human nature; Harry Osborn and Lex Luthor. Eventually both their best friends will become their nemeses. And the fathers of their best friends, Norman Osborn and Lionel Luthor, both extend genuine fatherly admiration for Peter and Clark respectively.As for the movie itself, Spider-man is an excellent translation of comic book to silver screen. Along the way there were some liberties taken, like the fact that Peter's ability to shoot webs is another result of the genetically modified spider's bite rather than his manufacturing of web shooters as was shown in the comics, but all in all the spirit of the source material is maintained. The action sequences and CGI were thrilling upon first viewing in the cinema and they hold up fairly well today although it has to be remembered that technology pushes ever forward. But the action scenes are only a secondary pleasure of the film. The primary pleasure is in watching the relationship between the characters unfurl. At the risk of sounding like a sap, I thought Tobey and Kirsten did a marvelous job in showing how young Shakesperean romantic love develops. I truly felt the euphoria that such an emotion generates. To use a cliché, the two had great chemistry. The warmth and caring of the Parker household was also very touching and the tragedy of Ben Parker's demise, frankly, gets to me every time. To me, however, the most intriguing relationships are the ones between Harry and Norman and Harry and Peter. The viewer can empathize with Harry's yearning for love and recognition from the senior Osborn and the jealousy he must feel at his father's interest in Peter. The scene where Harry concedes that his father was 'right about M.J., right about everything' and Norman admits that he 'hasn't always been there' for his son was played to great effect by James Franco and Willem Dafoe. The relationship between Peter and Harry is also a marvel (no pun intended) to watch unfold. We see their almost brotherly camaraderie at the field trip turn into understated awkwardness and tension over Harry's interest in Peter's girl. The mutual empathy over the parallel losses of their fathers briefly brings them together again until Harry swears a vendetta against Peter's alter ego meaning they are now enemies. Great stuff! I can't wait to see how this develops in further installments of the franchise. All the secondary characters are well cast also. Special mention must be made of Bonesaw (played by real life wrestler Randy 'Macho Man' Savage) and J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons who to a degree reprises his role as Sheriff Pearl Johnson in The Gift which not coincidentally was also directed by Raimi). If I have one minor quibble it would be that I wish that the Peter's first love from the comics, Gwen Stacy, could somehow have been written in. She is such a great character. Then again, to do so would probably dilute the Pete-M.J. story arc. The two-disc editions have a wealth of info and special features, more than enough to satisfy the most ravenous curiosity over the film.",9,2,4,11 June 2005
The Fast and the Furious," Very good entertainment
","I had initially dismissed this movie as just mere satisfaction for the testosterone seeking crowd of young teenage males enthralled by 'fast cars and hot women' but after having viewed the film I was surprised by how much I liked it. Yes those aforementioned elements are addressed much to the appreciation of the film's target audience I'm sure but Vin Disel and especially Paul Walker's charisma made their characters very interesting and even sympathetic. I actually cared about their fates. The rest of the supporting cast also complemented the leads nicely, especially Rick Yune (Die Another Day). I'm not really that fascinated by cars (I think they are noisy and pollutive) but this introduction to the street racing sub-culture was informative. The stunts were also nicely done with minimal special effects. Solid escapism, 7/10.",7,1,2,26 February 2004
Pearl Harbor," A moving World War II epic
","I have to wonder how much of the criticism of this film is a personal attack on Affleck and not actual analysis of the film. I thought the romantic triangle and the relationship between Affleck's and Hartnett's characters were quite moving. The action sequences were exhilarating and the film had a look of authenticity to its period. I am not enough of an historian to know if every depiction is factual. Perhaps it wasn't politically correct to set a romance in such a sensitive setting in US history as Pearl Harbor, a la Titanic, but still the zeal of the critics seems overblown. I even thought the Japanese perspective was given fair consideration. On another note the later use of atomic weapons on Japan was justified, even Japanese generals later agreed, as it saved countless American lives that would've been lost had a conventional force tried to take the archipelago. I think it even saved many Japanese lives that would've lost resisting that invasion. On the film, my score: 8/10.",1,2,3,17 November 2003
Die Hard 2," Pointless except as a moneymaker
","I like the first and third Die Hards a lot but I didn't care particularly for the second installment. The villains were clichéd and not interesting at all. Every character was predictable and the action sequences while by no means poor were not as harrowing as in the other two films. Still, good diversionary entertainment, 7/10.",6,0,2,7 September 2003
Gone with the Wind," Definitely NOT the greatest Hollywood film of all time
","There are many things I liked about Gone With the Wind: Vivien Leigh's defiant petulance and perseverance as she ran riches to rags to riches again, Clark Gable's roguish gentleman frustrated by Scarlett's unrequited devotion to Ashley. And of course there is Mammy. The cinematography and vibrant colors are also breathtaking to behold. I can also appreciate the ambition and the scope of the picture and how it holds up perfectly today. I haven't read Margret Mithcell's book but I think I read somewhere that there is at least one major difference between the film and the book. In the film a black laborer saves Scarlett from being raped by a white hoodlum but in the book the ethnicity of assailant and savior are reversed. I don't know if this change was made for political reasons. I rate this movie 8/10. In my humble opinion it is not superior to Casablanca or Citizen Kane. In fact I think there are dozens of movies I think are better than GWTW.",8,1,2,23 February 2003
Legends of the Fall," A very good historical drama
","This movie is worth watching for the performances turned in by Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn, and the incomparable Anthony Hopkins. The film was very moving thanks to the heartbreaking romance and the sadness and waste of young men cut down before their prime. I love historical dramas because of they way they bring the past alive. The hopes and dreams of the times vivify what I've read in history books and novels. I think Legends of the Fall won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. If it did, it was deserved. The cinematography of the landscapes is breathtaking. If you have the chance, see it on a big screen TV for this reason alone. Recommended, 8/10.",8,3,5,11 March 2003
Days of Thunder," Average movie
","The worst thing about this movie is that all the plot arcs and indeed the whole plot is entirely predictable. That said I did acquire a new appreciation for the skills and mental makeup needed for stock car racing although I still think that watching cars going around and around on a track isn't the most exciting spectator sport. The cast did well with the material. Robert Duvall in particular was memorable in his part. For better or worse, this movie has the Simpson/Bruckheimer machismo stamp all over it. 6/10.",2,1,3,18 July 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Soulless sequel
","Despite The Lost World's impressive technical achievements and special effects, the film felt disappointingly empty. The talented cast plays mostly cardboard characters whose only job is to support the real stars, the dinosaurs, which are admittedly spectacular. I thought Jurassic Park III was considerably more enjoyable than The Lost World.",6,1,1,30 December 2003
JFK," Even better on the second viewing
","I thought JFK was considerably more enjoyable on my second viewing of the Oliver Stone masterpiece. During my initial viewing there was a lot of information to process and at times it felt as if the characters were not interacting as human beings but merely spouting facts for the benefit of the audience. Stone himself says in the DVD interview that he wished he could've included an intermission. Nevertheless this film is so relevant beyond the facets of mere filmmaking (by the way the performances and direction are top notch as would be expected). Beyond even the question of JFK's assassination, the film examines the very checks and balances that allow for the existence of the American Republic ('not an empire' as Pat Buchanan correctly points out). Riveting, 9/10.",8,1,11,4 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy
","Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!",7,2,3,12 March 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Unfairly savaged
","First I should say I never saw the TV series. It was before my time. Now, while MI:2 borrows from several films, especially Notorious, Entrapment and Goldeneye, it by no means deserves all the criticism it has received. The action sequences, especially the pre-credit, motorcycle chase, and martial arts finale, were exciting and creatively filmed though Woo's trademark touches are bordering on self-parody. Dougray Scott made for a good nemesis and his henchman was nasty as well. In an age of potential bio-terrorism the plot has some relevance. Post 9/11, I don't think they could've done the pre-credit sequence. On the negative side Hunt has all the heroics to himself and Newton didn't make for the most alluring love interest. Still this franchise is more interesting than Bond though I wonder if it can generate twenty films and/or survive the exit of Cruise. Overall, 7/10. Bring on MI:3!",8,2,4,17 November 2003
Annie Hall," Terrific writing
","I love the writing in this film. It is charming, witty, and often very humorous. The literary, religious, and cinematic references were very much appreciated. And of course the writing's full vitality is reached because of the performances of Allen and Keaton primarily. It takes such strong material to make the generally unheroic appearance of Allen sympathetic. If you are ever in the mood to wash out the bad taste of the latest mindless special effects blockbuster, I suggest popping the erudite Annie Hall into your DVD player 8/10.",8,0,1,10 December 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Great acting but...
","Girl Interrupted is worth watching for the superb performances from Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Jolie deserved the Oscar she got for her role in this film of the rebellious wild child hiding an inner need. Ryder is also great and communicates so much without dialogue thanks to her oh so expressive eyes. The supporting cast headed up by Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave is also more than competent. The film falters though because the plot isn't very defined. Then again that could be by design given that the film is derived from diary entries. Nevertheless I found it somewhat unrewarding at the end. I agree with the imdb average, 7/10.",7,2,2,4 March 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," A true science fiction epic that lives up to its reputation
","I should mention that when I watch films, acting is the component I am most interested. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the acting is more than compotent, but it's strengths are in other areas of the cinematic endeavor. It is the sets, the props, the special effects, and the score that are the strengths of this film. Needless to say director Kubrick and his collaborators did a masterful job in envisioning and bringing to the screen their very convincing concept of the future. Praising Kubrick's directorial abilities is much like nonchalantly saying Shakespeare was a great writer! Great science fiction film, 8/10.",8,0,3,12 February 2003
The Graduate," Inspiring and uplifting
","Despite the fact that at 29 or 30 Hoffman wasn't too much younger than Bancroft, who was 36 at the time and in fact had to be de-glamorized for the role, and that Benjamin wasn't a particularly sympathetic character, I really enjoyed this movie and in fact cheered loudly at the end. Two other quibbles are that Elaine, though very pulchritudinous, doesn't have very deep dialogue and that the movie will seem very dated because there is no longer quite so deep a divide between generations. I should also mention that the soundtrack is one of the best ever for a motion picture. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",9,1,2,30 October 2003
Mission: Impossible," Underappreciated
","Despite the somewhat impersonal and antiseptic feel of this summer of '96 blockbuster film, MI is an excellent espionage thriller. It relies more on plot than mindless action. The plot is not incomprehensible. Just pay attention! If people don't get it, it's likely because they are so used to getting hit over the head and expect everything to be spread on a platter without any active thinking on their part. The action sequences feel as if they serve the story not vice versa and among the highlights are the truly memorable break in to CIA headquarters and the sequence on the train. A competent cast brings the various characters to life. As far as box office receipts go, Ethan Hunt appears to have surpassed James Bond as the public's superspy of choice. But will Hunt ever have 20 films? Only time will tell. I look forward to MI:3.",9,2,3,17 November 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," An interesting character study
","For some reason this very thought provoking Stanley Kubrick masterpiece (an art house film marketed as a standard star studded Hollywood blockbuster) reminded of the 1955 William Holden - Kim Novak film Picnic in that it's about the way two people love each other both sexually and emotionally. Like that film, the plot here is threadbare and serves only to observe the relationship between two lovers. In this case we see how the the two partners in the relationship react to imagined and almost fait accompli infidelities. I for one was yet again very impressed by the always technically meticulous Kubrick and the performances he elicited from his cast. On a side note, I think the actor who played the costume shop owner also appeared in Cruise's MI:2.",10,0,2,6 February 2004
Psycho," Simply brilliant
","Psycho is perfect in all aspects despite, or perhaps, because it was very unconventional (I cannot discuss this in detail without giving away a lot of the plot). The pure craftsmanship of the film is a joy to behold. The casting was perfect, there were plenty of surprises and needless to say scares, the music was very evocative, and in certain contexts there was even a great deal of humor. I think Hitchcock said somewhere that it was a comedy! Maybe he meant it in jest. Unlike a lot of films which fade from memory as soon as you leave the theater or take out the DVD, Psycho stays in your mind. Highest recommendation 9/10.",9,1,2,28 September 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," A true American classic
",Countless people have expounded on the merits of this film. I agree that most all of the plaudits are deserved. My favorite scenes in the movie are Atticus' summation argument and the restraint he showed after being spit in the face by Ewell. May we all take the lessons of this film to heart...9/10.,8,0,2,4 June 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Solid World War II prison film
","This film has much to recommend. There are terrific performances, especially from Alec Guiness, superb locations that were photographed well, terrific sets, and most of all a compelling story. The sum, for me personally, wasn't as satisfying for me as for most. Still I respect the accomplishment of this film though I don't care to see it again.",8,1,3,26 September 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Brilliant in every aspect
","This film, based on Ken Kersey's novel which I haven't read, was simply spectacular. It had a very unique blend of comedy, drama, horror (of the worst kind), and tragedy. Jack Nicholson conveyed the complexities of his character so perfectly, it's hard to adequately praise him. Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched, the ultimate authoritarian conformist, was the perfect foil for Nicholson's free-spirited and idealistic McMurphy. The supporting cast had actors who would go on to become big names like Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Vincent Schiavelli (Tomorrow Never Dies). One of the best films I've ever seen, 10/10.",9,1,3,19 December 2003
The Green Mile," Powerful and moving
","The best decision made by the makers of this film was to take the screen time to establish all the characters and their relationships with each other. If they had trimmed the movie to the standard two hours, the impact of the story would've been greatly diminished. All the actors are perfectly cast and the important themes are presented in an evenhanded fashion. The emotional payoffs at the end are some of the most rewarding I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel, 9/10.",9,1,3,16 May 2003
Paths of Glory," Outstanding war movie
","In Paths of Glory, Kubrick brilliantly explores military ethics. The entire cast led by the immortal Kirk Douglas (né Isadore Demsky) is first rate. Strong characterizations abound throughout. Even by today's standard the trench warfare scenes are brutally represented, as they need to be. Highest recommendation, 10/10.",9,1,2,14 December 2003
Carrie," Very good entertainment
","I saw this movie on DVD the other day and have to say that I was more than moderately entertained. There are some interesting messages in this film about fanatical religious devotion and peer acceptance. Standout performances from Spacek and the actress who plays her mom also highlight this film. A young John Travolta isn't given much to do but he does his job well. I think Nancy Allen, who plays Travolta's girlfriend Chris, is the same actress who plays Murphy's girlfriend in the Robocop movies. There are many great images in this film, especially Carrie's reaction after 'the prank' and the reaction and aftermath of the girl at the grave. All in all, a very good horror flick. A minor complaint about the otherwise insightful DVD documentary: couldn't Travolta be coaxed into giving an opinion or two?",8,0,0,28 January 2003
Shrek," Has hidden messages
","Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land.",7,8,12,30 April 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Outstanding suspense thriller
","Silence of the Lambs is a truly memorable suspense thriller which deservedly won the Oscar for best picture and Oscars for Hopkins and Foster. The best scenes are the ones with Hopkin's Lecter especially when he is conversing with Foster's Starling. Hopkins internalizes wonderfully throughout, and, wisely, he and director Jonathan Demme avoid taking his character over the top. Highly recommended, 9/10.",9,1,1,27 December 2002
Ben-Hur," Intense religious epic
","I saw this movie recently on DVD while doing a detailed reading of the Holy Bible. I recommend this movie because of the lavish sets and Charlton Heston's charasmatic Oscar winning portrayal of the titular character. A quibble I have with the movie is the accents of some of the characters. The Roman naval commander who later adopts Ben Hur has an English accent! Except for the actress who portrayed Esther none of the characters have a Semitic accent. Most of the players don't even have a Semitic appearance, most notably Heston. Still this is religious epic not to be missed by any adherent of the Bible or any film buff. 8/10.",8,1,3,30 November 2002
The Deer Hunter," Superb war drama
","Despite the fact that the first act of the film might've been trimmed to better effect, The Deer Hunter nonetheless remains one of the finest war dramas. High calibre acting, excellent location cinematography, and an intense sense of realism vis-a-vis the characters' interactions made for a memorable cinematic experience. Regarding authenticity, as for example that of the Russian Roulette torture scenes, of course it is usually better to adhere to documented facts, but artistic liberties are not a cardinal sin if the final product can me improved. These things have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Still this film merits a very strong recommendation, 8/10.",8,9,19,14 November 2003
Rear Window," Perfect craftsmanship
","Rear Window is a perfect example of a filmmaker's craftsmanship. In the setup, Hitchcock lets the viewer indulge in his or her natural predilection for voyeurism along with the protagonist. The huge apartment set is perfect for this. There are enough clearly delineated characters that the viewer can usually find at least one to identify with, marginally if not more (besides everyman Stewart of course). Even the villain elicits some sympathy for his circumstances. The actors aren't really challenged by the material but they perform admirably and the incremental increase in the suspense is perfectly paced. I should also mention that glamorous Grace Kelly models some very chic fashions. Another winner from The Master, 9/10.",8,1,4,14 November 2003
The Matrix," Landmark film
","I remember I saw this in the summer of '99 when the The Mummy and The Phantom Menace were also released. Although Star Wars was commercially more successful, I think The Matrix has left more of an influence on cinema since then. The combination of then state of the art special effects (I think it beat out Star Wars for the Oscar), spectacular Hong Kong martial arts, technophobia, and philosophical discussion over the nature of reality replete with quasi-religious overtones left an indelible mark on moviegoers. Though his performance is quite serviceable, the film wasn't dependent on Keanu Reeves to carry it. The rest of the cast is also efficient. On another note, I think I read somewhere that DC Comics writer Grant Morrison came up with the concept but according to him it was pirated by Warner Bros. which owns DC. Whatever the case, it goes without saying that The Matrix is a landmark film.",9,0,1,9 November 2003
Casino," A Scorcese Masterpiece
","What else can be said about Martin Scorcese? In Casino he directs another incredible unforgettable film. Once again partnering with the incomparable Robert De Niro and another of his favorite collaborators, Joe Pesci, he once again elicits superb performances. He also gets Sharon Stone to give the best performance of her career. The fact that the very talented James Woods would sign on to be the fourth wheel is a testement to Scorcse's reputation. Even Don Rickles adds something. He has an expression that if you mess with Ace, dire consequences will ensue. Great story, great attention to detail (eg. the spy plane running out of fuel), incredible acting = Sorcese masterpiece, 10/10.",10,3,4,13 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A superlative sequel
","Although it has aged somewhat, this film was magnificent in convincingly creating a seamless alternate reality. I saw this after Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones so perhaps that's why I'm not so in awe of it as other viewers. Nevertheless I appreciated the attention to detail, the competent acting, superlative special effects (for their time), exploration of universal themes, and sheer entertainment of this science fiction masterpiece, 8/10.",8,1,2,1 February 2004
Braveheart," Slightly overrated but...
","The reason I am not in as much awe as others of this movie is that I saw The Patriot (also starring Mel Gibson) and The Last Samurai before I saw Braveheart. The battle scenes in those two later films are clearly influenced by Braveheart so it deserves credit for that. With Gibson making the soon to be released The Passion (which, having conservative Christian sympathies, I am really looking forward to) it is interesting that he cast himself as a Christ like figure. I'm sure most people know this but what is presented here is not entirely factual history but an interpretation of a myth. Nevertheless the movie is well acted, skillfully choreographed, lavishly produced, quite moving, and a nice window into English history of that period. Highly recommended, 8/10.",8,0,2,27 January 2004
The Breakfast Club," A very good teen drama
","Although this movie was before my time, I really admired the effort of the the director to show how young (and older) people shouldn't try to categorize their fellows. We are all complex human beings with individual strengths, weaknesses, desires, hope, fears and so forth. This idea was brought to life by good ensemble work on the part of the cast. For many of them it was the highlight of their careers. Recommended, 9/10.",8,0,1,1 November 2003
Gladiator," Entertaining 'swords and sandals' epic
","I remember I watched this at a sneak preview screening and from the earliest shots I was drawn into the world of ancient Rome. I found all aspects of the production to be first class: the script, acting, choreography, sets, props, costumes, special effects, and so forth all successfully recreated that long past era. I'm not sure of the historical accuracy but all in all, I found Gladiator to be a truly  excellent film, 9/10.",8,0,1,22 January 2004
The Wedding Singer," Charming romantic comedy
","There are enough romantic and comic moments in this film to make it worthwhile. Adam Sandler is in full poor shmuck mode and it works in this script. Drew Barrymore is as cute as ever and that's all she has to be in this role. Throw in a stock villain and some eighties nostalgia and you have a nice hour and a half diversion, 7/10.",7,0,1,13 June 2003
The Birds," Open to interpretation
",I agree with 'cordedpoodle' in that The Birds is a metaphor for nature and chaos conflicting with human society. I enjoyed the open-ended story such as it is and found the characters to be very convincingly portrayed by the actors. The chemistry between Hedren and Taylor was terrific and their relationship developed in a very satisfying manor. The periphery characters of Mitch's 'clinging' mother and in his still jealous previous love interest were also first-rate characterizations. The only character I thought was somewhat extraneous was Mitch's daughter. The direction and pure craftsmanship of the film were also of the first order. I think Hitchcock said that he used 371 trick shots or so in the film. The Hitchcock Collection DVD I watched had excellent supplementary materials and the picture and sound were very sharp. Another feather in the cap of The Master. 9/10.,9,1,1,23 November 2003
Jurassic Park," Another Spielberg classic
","I remember when I first saw this at the cinema and how the entire audience believed what was happening was real. It's easy to forget how groundbreaking this film was and what a masterful job Spielberg did in integrating the human story into the more flashy science fiction side of the film. The new Universal DVD has all the extravagant features one could ask for to fully appreciate the creation of the film. A true classic, 9/10.",8,2,4,13 January 2004
From Here to Eternity," Very moving
","Although this film is best remembered for the romance between the Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr (both of whom are very good in their roles) characters, especially their sensual encounter at the beach, my enjoyment of the film was mostly derived from the stories of Prewitt and Maggio, played magnificently by Montgomery Clift and Oscar winning Frank Sinatra respectively. Prewitt's endurance, physical and psychological, to the abuse he receives for refusing to fight is very inspirational as is Maggio's defiance of the sadistic Ernest Borgnine character. I am not ashamed to say when Prewitt played his trumpet in tribute to his fallen friend, my eyes welled up in tears.",9,0,0,31 May 2004
