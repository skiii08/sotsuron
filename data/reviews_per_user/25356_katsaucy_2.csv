The Sound of Music," I love it!!!
","This has to be my all-time favorite movie! I know ALL of the words. I have tried to watch it the very least once a month since 5th grade (when I watched it every day)Everything about this movie is meant to make you feel good, and after you watch it you do. Everyone, even if you are in the lousiest mood, cheers up when Maria and the Childern sing 'My Favorite Things'!I recommend it to EVERYONE,whether you like musicals or not.",10,1,7,4 April 1999
Elizabeth," In a word: Excellent!
","This is a great movie. Cate Blanchette is awesome and Joseph Fiennes is great! I think this movie is great and it gets 5 stars from me. The acting, directing, and everything is just great. I really enjoy this movie. This movie is an interesting portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I.",10,0,1,11 June 2000
