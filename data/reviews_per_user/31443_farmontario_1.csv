Ford v Ferrari," I Blew A Piston!
","What an awesome evening I just experienced! Drawn into the music, scenery, old time 70's feel which is and will always be the best movie era of movie making period!
All the perfect flowing racing, chivalry, the cars in that era and of course beat on acting. I can't say enough and won't anymore, just watch the movie and zone out to just yourself and you'll have flashbacks to your own era if you were around in them years.
Way to go to everyone who made this movie!",10,2,3,19 January 2020
