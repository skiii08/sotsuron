Source Code," One of the best action movies I've seen!
","I'm usually very picky with movies; there's very few movies who make it to my favorite list. If a movie I'm watching hasn't impressed me already from the beginning, I easily get restless and in some cases even leave the room. However, Source Code got me completely HOOKED.I decided to watch it since I heard Jake Gyllenhaal was the main character (I've seen what an amazing actor he is from previous movies)but it wasn't Jake who made the movie golden. The actual plot is what caught me off guard and kept me interested. The movie was breathtaking from start until finish, not leaving a single second where I'd feel bored. Even if the amazingly good looking Jake Gyllenhaal himself would've sat next to me while I was watching it, I still wouldn't have taken my eyes off the screen. Such an exciting story with unpredicted scenes and originality. I remember getting frustrated when I could tell that the movie was ending because I just wanted more, hoping that they'll make a sequel to it. It's not a typical action movie where there's tons of explosions and gun shots. Source Code had a certain class to it, holding back unnecessary action with a flawless plot. By making the Source Code the producer killed off the stereotype of action movies. It's quality over quantity in this one and I'm very pleased to have watched it. I hope all other action movies that releases in the future will be as interesting as this one.If you want to have a movie night with your family or friends I suggest this one without any doubt. It has everything in it; the hot guy (how old is Jake now again 'cause you can't tell by that gorgeous face), the pretty girl, the golden story, the perfect ending you wouldn't be able to guess and of course some of that physical action you expected from watching the trailer. I won't give it a 10 because I've seen better movies but I'll still give it 8 for not letting me down and being worth my time. Not a single second of my night was wasted and time well spent is exactly what this movie is about, right?",8,0,1,26 December 2011
