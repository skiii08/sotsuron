Marie Antoinette," Agree & Disagree
","I am basing my comments on those of hafsol.Although I find hafsol's review to the extreme negative, I must say quite a lot of it is true and agreeable. Marie Antoinette was a very extravagant and ostentatious queen, yes, but Coppola's view of Antoinette as being a young princess thrust into a totally different court from the one she was born into is a very good part of the movie. True, maybe Coppola did make Antoinette a very gentle and innocent woman, but then again what was a queen to do surrounded by fortune with a husband barely noticing her? Women need love and affection! The scenery was ultra-superb and the costumes and accessories marvelous...but the songs...hmmmm...could have kept with the era I'm afraid!! I'm not saying Coppola shouldn't have any right to make the historic biopic as she saw Marie Antoinette, but she could have stuck more to the age. But hey, those costumes and wigs were extremely beautiful (altough other wigs could have been included which do not look like white dye applied to the real hair with a lot of hairspray!!) Many keep saying Kirsten Dunst doesn't have a thing good in portraying the Queen. Personally, I like her! Not because I'm some kind of fan of Spiderman or anything, I just liked her. In my point of view Sofia did actually manage to make Kirsten look from a young 14-year-old to a woman. I liked Kirsten in the role. But Asia Argento...Madame du Barry was blonde! Personally I would have actually preferred Angelina Jolie...she has a more seductive and mistressy look and stamina...but anyway. And Jason in the role of Louis XVI...NO WAY HOSE!!! If one sees 'Affair of the Necklace' by Charles Shyer one would see how great a resemblance Louis XVI is in that movie to the real dauphin. As for Jolie Richardson, another triumph in look-alike! I was, in agreement to hafsol's comments, very disappointed with the ending! No guillotine, no Jeanne de la Motte Valois, no Cardinal de Rohan, no necklace...too much interesting material left out! Should Sofia have made a similar ending to her movie as that of 'Affair of the Necklace' would have been grand!!",7,0,1,27 June 2007
Troy," More action, less myth!
","First of all, I must say that the movie, with all it's settings, costumes and dialogue, was superb; but...what is it with movies of Greek Mythology not having any mythical scenes? I mean, considering how wonderful the costumes are, not to mention such a perfect cast of actors and actresses, I really would have been quite eager in seeing the Judgement of Paris! I would have found Angelina Jolie in the part of the red-haired goddess Hera, Famke Janssen in a golden war-dress as Athene and Rebecca-Roijn Stamos semi-nude with long falling golden curls as the beautiful Aphrodite quite breath-taking! p.s. Does anyone know if the sequel of The Odyssey is coming out with Sean Bean as Odysseus (as in Troy)? If yes, PLEASE help in making the director remember to put the Sirens in!",7,1,2,30 June 2007
