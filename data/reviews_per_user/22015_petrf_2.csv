The Blair Witch Project," First time in the movie I fall asleep
","Heather bugged the **** out of me. She was one and only witch. As someone wrote here before, it seems like marketing joke and most of that $40.000 was spent on advertisement. I never fall asleep in a movie, but this piece did it, I was sleeping.",Null,0,0,11 October 1999
Forrest Gump," I feel sorry for people who don't like this movie ...
","Forest Gump is one of the best movies I've seen. People who don't like, or are bashing this movie, just simply don't know what life is about. You have to be without a soul to dislike this movie.",10,0,3,26 July 2002
