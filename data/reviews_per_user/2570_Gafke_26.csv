The Blair Witch Project," Genuinely Creepy
","Three young film students - Josh, Mike and Heather - pack up their filming equipment and head out to Burkittsville, Maryland on an autumn weekend to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a local legend which continues to haunt the surrounding woods of the small town. The three strike out into the forest with their camping gear and are never seen again. One year later, their film footage is recovered. It's a great basis for a horror movie. What could be worse than actually finding a roll of film or two only to discover that, upon development, it contains the dark and horrible story of a missing persons last moments on earth? The hype surrounding this film was so well done that people still believe to this day that what they are seeing is real. And while the hype may have gone a tad overboard (I don't think, for instance, that this is the scariest movie EVER made) The Blair Witch Project is still a very good, well made pseudo-documentary/ horror movie. Made with hand-held cameras and boasting no special effects whatsoever, Blair Witch takes us out into the middle of the dark and spooky woods and leaves us there with the three unfortunate college kids. It's kind of like being dropped into a particularly vicious retelling of Hansel and Gretel. Strange noises echo through the woods at night, the disturbing laughter of children can be heard and many odd and primitive symbols, made of sticks and resembling crude, miniature scarecrows, are left dangling in the trees for us to find. They are all keys to a mystery which only gets larger and more sinister as the film progresses. The threesome are soon lost and find themselves wandering around in circles, unable to escape from the cursed woods, and this, for me, is where the real horror of the film lies. It can happen and, witch or no, your imagination can conjure up any number of monsters out there in the darkness, heard but never seen, but all of them waiting to eat you. Josh, Heather and Mike begin to fall apart, turning on each other and just as quickly holding on to one another as the woods loom up and consume them. Nothing is ever seen, no answers are given and the mystery surrounding the Blair Witch and the exact fate of the threesome is never solved. We are left to decide for ourselves if the stories are true and the evil rumored to be within the woods is real. The premise here is simple and the film itself very realistic. It's easy to see why it frightened so many people upon its release - at times, it's like watching a snuff film without the sex.Gritty, well-acted and genuinely disturbing. People who suffer from motion sickness should probably avoid it, since the constantly jouncing camera IS rather nauseating. People tired of car chases, obligatory sex scenes and CGI monsters should check this out - it's a very cool throwback to the ghost stories told around campfires. Very well done.",8,0,1,20 May 2005
The Ring," Creepy, but not as frightening as I'd hoped.
","I bought into the hype, I admit it.  All I kept hearing upon this films release was 'Oh my god it's SOOOO SCARY!!!'  So I went to see it with a group of friends, preparing to be scared out of my skirt and really looking forward to it.  Well, the film was beautifully shot and genuinely creepy, but not at all as scary as I had hoped it would be.Everyone knows the story by now: A weird videotape with disconcerting, but seemingly unconnected images, has the power to kill anyone who views it exactly seven days later.  A group of teens view it and, sure enough, within a week they are all dead.  One girl's dreadful corpse is found horribly bloated, ghastly discolored and waterlogged, in her bedroom closet.  This is the one scene that literally made me jump, but it was very brief.  The rest of the film concerns the efforts of this unfortunate girls Aunt to solve the mystery of the video...a mystery that becomes more urgent when she views it herself and receives a creepy phone call from a little girl who simply tells her: 'Seven days.'  A warning to people who are irritated by ambiguous endings (like me):The mystery surrounding the murder of a little girl remains ambiguous to the films final scenes.  We never truly know why she was so inherently evil, how she created the video or why she refuses to rest.  These questions are left for the viewer to answer.  However, you will see some really good performances, some absolutely stunning scenery and a startling climax featuring a dripping wet ghost emerging from a television screen.  However, I couldn't help but feel that the film was about 20 minutes too long and the plot rather flimsy if thought about too hard.  Still, it's a pretty decent ghost story that will succeed in scaring many a viewer.  The ghostly images on the cursed videotape itself makes this movie worth watching.",Null,1,2,28 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," VERY Well Done!
","I've seen the original 'Dawn of the Dead.' I loved the original 'Dawn of the Dead.' I loved this one too, probably because I didn't see it as a remake, I simply accepted it as an updated retelling. I can also accept the fact that both of these movies ARE JUST MOVIES! So, I'm going to skip the purist arguments and just review the damn film.In the first five minutes of 'Dawn of the Dead' we are introduced to the blase, perfectly normal ho-hum life of a nurse named Ana, who just wants to go home after a long shift and see her man. They have a nice, quiet evening together and fall asleep in each others arms without a care in the world. The next five minutes that follow Ana into the next morning are a violent, brutal shock. Instant carnage erupts as the little girl next door attacks Ana's man. Infected and mortally wounded, he turns on Ana. Within two minutes of awakening from a peaceful sleep, Ana is blood drenched and in shock, hurling herself out of the bathroom window only to see a world gone mad. Her peaceful neighborhood is in ruins, her neighbors are the undead insane, feasting on the few living left. As she escapes the burning ruin of her safe little world, the camera pulls back and gives us a glorious crane shot of apocalypse. The distant city is ablaze, the roads are overrun with ghouls. There is nowhere to go. It is indeed an awe inspiring, overwhelming sight. There is no safe place left. The feeling of isolation and growing fear is enormous. From there, the movie centers on the refuge of a local shopping mall, which is littered with clever in-jokes that are never pointed out or lingered on too long. (The Gaylen Ross store? Nice...) The survivors gather together hesitantly, each eyeing the other with suspicion. There is no time to grieve for the dead with survivors straggling in, some injured, some not...and some on the way to ZombieLand. No one knows who to trust, and not everyone is what they seem. They still manage to forge hesitant friendships and there are some genuinely comic moments involving a long-distance chess game, the bored mallers taking target practice on some appropriately nicknamed zombies, and a great rendition of Disturbed's 'The Sickness' performed Lounge Style. Finally, after a horrific quadruple death scene which wipes out an entire family, the survivors can take no more. They have a plan to escape and make for the ocean, and from there to a distant and unoccupied island far away from the overrun mainland. This movie certainly owes much to the original 'Dawn of the Dead' but there are also touches of 'Day of the Dead' and Fulci's 'Zombi 2' here as well. All in all, this film succeeds. It is strong enough to stand apart from the original. It may not bypass it, but it is a powerful entry in the zombie genre. The gore is understated, though brutally shocking when it does make its appearance. The real drive of the story here are the characters. These are not meat-for-the- grinder disposable heroes at all; they are very real, and very sympathetic. I found it very easy to imagine myself in their situation, and this is the films strength. The performances are wonderful, totally believable and the sorrow very genuine when one of the cast falls. There ARE truly fates worse than death, and this films shows you every last one. This is NOT a film about zombies. This is a film about staying sane in a world gone mad. Despite a downbeat ending (for anyone who sat through the end credits, that is...) this is a film I would see again and again....just like the original.",10,2,3,20 March 2004
The 13th Warrior," Beowulf meets Die Hard
","In the early years of the 10th century, an exiled Arabian nobleman falls in with a band of Vikings. Disgusted by their poor hygiene and their barbaric ways, he nevertheless reluctantly agrees to accompany them to a distant kingdom, where an unspeakable menace terrorizes the land. This is an interesting interpretation of the tale of Beowulf, with the monster Grendel transformed into the fierce Wendol, a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who have somehow survived long past their time. Despite the fact that Banderas is the title character and credited as the star, he is not the hero here at all. The band of 13 is led by the huge and intimidating Buliwyf (read Beowulf), a hero among his people who must battle both the Wendol and their deadly 'mother.' Alexander Gudonov lookalike Vladimir Kulich is the hero of this film, and delivers a strong, amazing performance. Banderas spends much of the film bumbling, stumbling, screwing up and trying to keep up with the Vikings, who look upon him with contempt but finally, perhaps grudgingly, accept him. Okay, so it's not entirely historically accurate and suffers from production problems and an occasional overdose of testosterone, but it's not a bad movie by any means. The casting is great, with standout performances by the aforementioned Kulich as well as Dennis Storhoi as Herger, Banderas's translator and only friend; the handsome Scottish actor Tony Curran (in an unlikely kilt, but who cares?!?!) as the Celt Weath and the woefully underrated Richard Bremmer as the intimidating tattooed redheaded (and damn sexy!) Skeld. The film was worth watching for these three men alone, but then, I am female and perhaps a bit prejudiced in my opinions. These guys are HOT! But, I digress... Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a bone strewn cave lift this movie well above average. There's something for everyone here; fans of horror, fans of action, fans of classic literature should all find something to enjoy about this film. It may not be the best film ever made, but its still one of my very favorites.",10,172,212,17 January 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Bloody Brilliant! Literally!
","'Shaun of the Dead' is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time, it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time, PERIOD! Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.Shaun (Simon Pegg) isn't having a very good week. His co-workers have no respect for him, his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really, Shaun isn't such a bad guy, but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed, flatulent, video-game obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough, the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening, it quickly becomes a race against time: save Shaun's mum, rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with, 'bitey' zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun, armed with a cricket bat, is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!This film should be seen side by side with Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here, but there is one very unexpected and Savini-worthy moment in 'Shaun' when the zombies rip a living man to shreds, yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and, though I usually hate gore, very well done. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in 'Shaun.' There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. I don't want to give away the incredible ending of 'Shaun' except to say that the living dead are not immune from pop-culture commercialization, and though loved ones may die, video games are forever. SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is 'Shaun of the Dead.' I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars.",10,284,340,5 June 2004
The Others," A Masterpiece of Gothic Horror
","World War 2 has just ended, but Charles Stewart has yet to return home to the island estate where his family await him. His wife, Grace, is a highly stressed woman. All of the servants have recently quit without notice, leaving Grace alone to care for the two children, Nicholas and Anne. To Grace's relief, three new servants arrive and offer their services; Mr. Tuttle tends the grounds, the mute Lydia takes care of the housework and the wise old Mrs. Mills becomes the children's new nanny. Nicholas and Anne are both highly photosensitive children and can never be exposed to sunlight, or else they will die within minutes. Therefore, the curtains are kept tightly closed and the gloomy mansion is lit only by weak candlelight. But although Grace seems to be getting her life back under control at last, something sinister seems to have invaded the mansion. Anne swears she has seen 'others' in the house: an old, blind woman and a little boy. Grace suspects Anne of making up stories but soon, she too is hearing odd noises. Footsteps can be heard upstairs in rooms locked and empty. A grand piano plays by itself. Voices and whispers echo throughout the house. As the emotionally fragile Grace begins to fall apart, the terrible truth becomes unavoidable: the house is haunted. But who, exactly, are the ghosts?This is such a great, classy ghost story, genuinely frightening without a drop of blood anywhere in sight. Nicole Kidman delivers a knockout performance as Grace, who is so tightly wound up that you keep waiting for her to explode at any given moment. The entire cast is awesome, if you want to know the truth. Fionnula Flanagan is kindly and sweet, but also scary as hell when she wants to be. Alakina Mann is seriously creepy as Anne, the somewhat sadistic older sister. The mansion and its surrounding grounds drip with Gothic horror, shrouded in mist, silence, neglected gravestones and fallen leaves. I suppose I ought to have seen the great twist ending coming, but I honestly never suspected a thing and was exhilarated by the revelation. Highlights include a scary voice in an empty storage room, a music room door that slams shut in Kidman's face, some eerie photographs of the dead and, of course, the great scene between Grace and an old, blind woman wearing her daughter's dress. Truly creepy stuff! Fans of films like The Changeling and The Eye will really love The Others. This is one of the best ghost stories I have ever seen, boasting an intelligent script, an awesome cast and a well thought out story filled with twists and turns and true horror. 10 stars.",10,0,2,3 January 2006
Silent Hill," Trippy
","I don't play video games, so I went into this film with no pre-conceived notions or expectations. I came away pretty impressed and a little disturbed.Rose and Chris Da Silva are worried about their adopted daughter, Sharon. Little Sharon has been sleepwalking and speaking, while still asleep, of a place called Silent Hill. When Sharon nearly falls to her death during her latest sleepwalk, Rose decides to confront the issue head-on. She packs Sharon into the SUV and heads for Silent Hill, West Virginia. But Silent Hill is a ghost town that the locals don't like to speak of and which is contaminated by an ever burning coal fire deep in the bowels of the earth. After a freak car accident knocks Rose out, she awakens to find Sharon gone and a rain of ash falling from the sky. Silent Hill is indeed a ghost town, populated by demonic mutants and the ghosts of the damned. Rose is led by grisly clues deeper into the tragic history of the town and a terrible secret which involves her adopted daughter. Aided by police officer Cybil Bennet, Rose must face the dark demons of Hell and prevent history from repeating itself if she is to save Sharon.This is quite a freaky film, though surprisingly not as gory as I had thought it would be. After a somewhat slow first 20 minutes or so, the film descends into rotting horror as air- raid sirens warn of The Darkness, deformed creatures lurch out of the shadows and the patina of normalcy literally melts away with the approach of evil. Standout characters include the sorrowful Dahlia, played by Deborah Kara Unger, who looks like the worlds oldest and saddest Goth woman, and the hideous creature known only as Pyramid Head, who stomps into view with a horde of cockroaches at his command. Radha Mitchell does a great job as Rose, playing her as a realistically frightened woman, but also as a determined mother who will stop at nothing to save her daughter. Jodelle Ferland is great in her double role of Sharon/ Alessa, a sweet, haunted little girl one moment; a creepy, frightening little monster the next. Sean Bean as the hopelessly lost Chris Da Silva is perfect; you can feel his frustration and panic. Alice Krige too is unnervingly chilling as Christabella.The atmosphere of this movie is great - ash covered cemeteries, drippy basements, abandoned schoolrooms - all very creepy and menacing in their utter stillness. The violence, when it comes, is quite brutal. Skin is ripped off, bodies are roasted, limbs ripped away by barbed wire. Pretty gruesome, but not overly so. The demons are the real attraction here: besides Pyramid Head, there are also twisted torsos spewing black acid, deformed beings in nurse uniforms wielding scalpels and, in the scene which freaked me out the most, a man with his body bent double and his feet over his head crawling across a bathroom floor. I've never played the video game so I really can't tell you if this was a faithful adaptation or not. But I can say that it is very original, quite spooky, satisfyingly bloody and even rather disturbing in several parts...and I don't scare easily. All in all, a very good horror movie.",8,31,49,22 April 2006
Alien," Classic Horror
","Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film 'IT! The Terror From Beyond Space' Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this 'haunted house.' There is no escape from the horror within.The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed.",10,6,10,14 January 2006
Predator," Fun
","This film is one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  A bunch of steroidal pro- wrestlers...I mean, a small group of special forces soldiers (and one pro- wrestler) are sent into the humid depths of the South American jungle on a top secret mission.  A bunch of cool explosions and one pretty prisoner later, the mission is accomplished...but the movie has just begun.  Something is stalking the unit through the green hell of the steamy jungle, something not human.Predator doesn't waste time with character development, or even much in the way of plot.  It's basically a chase film, but that's fine.  I don't always want a brainy, intellectual film...sometimes I want cinematic junk food, and this film fits the bill perfectly.  The self-camouflaging, tarantula-faced, green-dredlocked monster is really very cool, standing well over 7 feet tall and blasting the crap out of the overly confident and testosterone drenched soldiers with some pretty spiffy weapons.  Even Arnie gets the crap kicked out of him... a guilty pleasure in itself, considering the fact that I live in California and paid full ticket price to watch the crap-fest that was 'True Lies.'  Seriously though, this isn't a GREAT film, but it's good fun, a sort-of bare bones 'Alien.'  If you like nasty, scary monsters and sweaty soldiers getting slaughtered, have a few beers and watch 'Predator.'  You won't regret it in the morning.",Null,1,1,26 March 2004
The Thing," Intelligent Splatter
","This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.",10,331,393,28 December 2003
The Village," Shyamalan meets the Brothers Grimm
","This is my favorite film by M. Night Shyamalan, so far.In an isolated valley somewhere in rural Pennsylvania is a village. Life is simple and the villagers are content...for the most part. Bordering the valley on all sides are the woods, where no one may enter, for it is said that Those We Do Not Speak Of dwell within these woods, and will kill anyone who dares cross over the border. However, when young Lucius Hunt is seriously injured by a disturbed young man, his devoted betrothed Ivy Walker insist that she be allowed to go through the woods and to the towns beyond, where medicines can be purchased for Lucius. However, there are some serious problems to consider. Ivy is blind, the towns are vicious, violent places where no one is safe, and Those We Do Not Speak Of must be considered as well. If Ivy wants to save Lucius, she must learn some of the truths behind The Village, a place founded by her father for the sole purpose of creating a sanctuary for those who have suffered losses in the distant towns.A lot of people felt ripped off by this film, which turns out to have nothing to do with either horror, monsters or aliens as was the case with Shyamalan's other films. But I was expecting the dramatic final twist, because that is Shyamalan's trademark, and so I was not disappointed when it was revealed. The Village is a love story set against a Grimms Brothers backdrop. It is very much a fairy tale, complete with true love, rumors of frightening beasts, superstition and brave quests. It is also a story of hope and desperation, and though the village elders perhaps have not made the best decisions, they have made them for the right reasons. The Village is also a very beautiful film, filled with misty nights, dark woods and green fields. The effect is very calming. The village becomes a place where you wouldn't mind going yourself, and it is this atmosphere of peace and beauty that make the scares all the more effective. Joaquin Phoenix is at his best here as the quiet Lucius, a serious young man with a strong streak of compassion. Bryce Dallas Howard is amazing in her first big role, playing the blind Ivy. She is lovely and strong and totally believable. There isn't a single person in this film who does not deliver their very best performance. William Hurt as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver as Lucius's mother, Adrian Brody as the simple minded Noah, Brendan Gleeson, all are wonderful. If you like old fashioned fairy tales filled with darkness, innocence and love, you'll want to see The Village.",10,0,1,5 February 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A good, gory retelling
","Three generations of the Carter family - father Bob, mom Ethel and their kids, Brenda, Bobby, Lynne, Lynne's husband Doug and their baby Catherine - are driving across the New Mexico desert en route to San Diego. Looking to cut some time off of their drive they unwisely follow the directions given them by the slightly creepy gas station owner and head out onto a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Unbeknownst to the Carter's, another family lives in the high desert hills, a clan of irradiated mutant cannibals who set a clever trap for the Carter's. One minor car crash later, the Carter's are stranded in the middle of nowhere. Bob Sr. and Doug head off in opposite direction looking for help, leaving the women and children alone. When night falls, the cannibals descend upon the Carter's, raping, killing and stealing baby Catherine away. What's left of the Carter's must now become as savage as their tormentors if they want to survive and get the baby back.This is a shockingly faithful remake in some ways and an entirely new story in others. Fans of the original film will be happy to see that the storyline does not deviate very far from Wes Craven's original tale, but fans of Aja will be quite pleased with the gratuitous gore on display as pick-axes, baseball bats and even po'd German shepherds are used as weapons. The film is very bloody and tense with a grim, filthy atmosphere; you can almost smell the rotting body parts. Everyone turns in great performances despite some moments of clunky dialog. The desolate scenery is a character all its own; hellishly hot and red, littered with vultures and crows. My only major gripe with this film was that not a lot of time was spent with the cannibal family. They don't have a lot of dialog and what they do have isn't the greatest. The idea of Family Versus Family that was so prevalent in the original film is missing here, and instead it's Family Versus Monsters. Which is fine, but as a fan of the original, I really would have liked to see the mutants interact with each other more and been given a sense of their family dynamics. And Billy Drago, perhaps the most severely underrated actor of his time, has perhaps three minutes screen time total and one line of dialog despite the fact that his name is in the opening credits and he's playing Jupiter, the head of the mutant family. Will somebody PLEASE give Billy Drago some decent screen time for gods sake! That said, I did enjoy this remake very much. It was impressively faithful, but it was also willing to present some new ideas. The script is idiotic in several places and there's some downright silly music towards films end, but these are perhaps petty gripes on my part. All in all, it's a fun two hours of blood, scares and horror. As far as remakes go, this is one of the better ones I've seen.It may take place in 95 but this film feels very 70s-ish; gritty, brutal and nasty. Fans of the original will want to see it at least once, as will fans of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn.Pretty good.",7,25,49,10 March 2006
The Shining," Disturbingly Excellent
","I'm really not sure why Stephen King doesn't like this film. I mean, if I were King, I'd be making a bigger fuss over 'Maximum Overdrive' if I was going to complain at all.The Shining is the story of the Overlook Hotel, a huge and beautiful place where the rich and famous have been spending their summers for nearly a century. However, when winter comes, the Overlook closes down for the season and a caretaker is left behind to look after the grandiose estate. The previous caretaker didn't work out so well; seems a touch of cabin fever drove him to slaughter his entire family with an ax...or at least, that's what everyone says happened. So enter Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his terribly insecure wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their 5 year old psychic son Danny. The Torrances move in and settle down for a long winter within the deserted Overlook, but they slowly learn that the Overlook is not deserted at all and that many of the previous tenants never left.Like the festering house in the Japanese ghost story 'Ju-On,' The Overlook is less a hotel than it is a malignancy which infects everyone who comes into contact with it. It works as slowly and insidiously as a cancer, fatally poisoning you before you are even aware of it. Poor little Danny, who is either gifted or cursed with a powerful psychic gift (which Overlook chef Dick Halloran calls 'The Shining') is very much aware of the sickness that is the hotel and the many restless guests within. But it is Jack whom the hotel ensnares, quickly and easily, using his bad temper and his alcoholism to turn him against his wife and son. As the winter snows pile up and literally trap the family within the guts of the hotel, Jack quickly descends into madness and the profane ghosts become stronger and more insistent, all but shoving the ax into Jack's hands.This is one of the best ghost stories ever put on film. Much like the unseen entities in 'The Haunting' the restless dead drive the fragile living into doing the dirty work for them, forcing them to feed new souls into the already crowded halls. The ghosts are very visible here: ghastly and robotic, they take the forms of butchered twin girls, a rotting woman in a bath tub and an ocean of blood crashing down an elegant foyer. The violence is surprisingly minimal, usually presented in aftermath shots, but they are powerful and disturbing shots that literally froze me in place. The acting of the entire cast is exemplary and the hideously creepy opening music sets the tone for the rest of the film, implanting a heavy sense of dread that never lifts until the end credits roll. This is my absolute favorite Kubrick film, and should not be missed by anyone, horror fan or no. 10 huge stars for this morbid masterpiece.",10,2,3,2 June 2004
Van Helsing," Sadly Disappointing.
","I had such high hopes for this movie.  I really did!  I loved the 'Mummy' movies and Hugh Jackman was so wonderful in the X-Men films, so I was sure that 'Van Helsing' would be great.  I was wrong.'Van Helsing' simply tries to do too much.  It starts out as a promising homage to the old black and white Universal Creature Features, and ends up a confusing, overdone mess.  Everyone is here: Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, a couple of werewolves, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and some pretty cool looking vampirebrides and their hideous offspring.  One would think that with such an ensemble cast, this movie would be a thrilling rollercoaster ride.  But it's not. I'm not sure how such an action packed, monster filled movie can be so dreadfully dull, but I found myself falling asleep within 15 minutes.  Hugh Jackman was good, as heusually is, and Kate Beckinsale as the butt-kicking beauty was only slightly less effective, but the dialogue is corny, (and sometimes, much too modern for the Edwardian setting) some of the acting borders on frantic and annoying(especially in the case of Richard Roxburgh) and the plot simply tries too hard to mash together too many stories into a two hour time slot.  Frankenstein'sMonster was quite likable and very cool to look at, and David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR) provided some nice comedic touches, but I simply grew tired of cast members endlessly swinging across great chasms on ropes and sexy vampirewomen going on and on about killing their victims instead of just going ahead and DOING it, already...a point addressed by Kate Beckinsale late in the film. The ending was both cheesy and a total downer but by that point, I was justhappy to see it end.I wanted to like this film, and I tried, but ultimately, I found it to be empty, emotionless, lifeless, flat, uninvolving, and shockingly dull.  It's a large piece of stale eye-candy...which is a huge shame because it had the potential to be asummer blockbuster.  Sadly, it fell a few hundred miles short of achieving that goal.",Null,0,1,29 May 2004
Aliens," A Great Sequel!
","57 years have passed since the attack on the Nostromo by a single Alien warrior, an attack which left only crew member Ellen Ripley alive. Suspended in cryogenic hypersleep, Ripley has been drifting in space all this time and is revived, only to learn that everything she knew is gone. Also during that time, the alien planet on which the deadly eggs were first discovered has been colonized. Now called LV426, the planet has been made habitable by atmosphere processors, but contact with the colony has been lost. A rescue mission of intergalactic Marines is sent in, and Ripley is brought along as a reluctant adviser. Ripley's fears are soon confirmed: the colony has been obliterated by the aliens and the survivors used as incubators for their embryos. Only one little girl has survived the destruction, a shell shocked second grader called Newt whom Ripley takes under her wing. As the Marines too fall prey to the aliens, Ripley and a small band of survivors find themselves stranded on LV426 with little hope of escape. With their equipment damaged and the planet's damaged reactors threatening to blow the entire world into a nuclear ruin within hours, the small group plans a dangerous escape mission. It becomes a race against time as the aliens close in, and when Newt is kidnapped by an alien warrior, Ripley comes face to face with the source of the alien colony - a huge and fiercely protective Queen Alien who is determined to take personal revenge on Ripley.Where the first Alien film was a Gothic horror tale, Aliens is an action movie through and through, but still a damn good movie. The aliens are everywhere in this tense and exhausting sequel. There are gory chest bursters, sprays of acidic blood and, most impressive of all, the Alien Queen Herself, a gigantic and deadly mother with absolute authority. I love the standoff scene between her and Ripley, in which the Queen dismisses her bodyguards and the two mothers face off, each determined to protect her young. The cast is top notch as well. Weaver makes a triumphant return as the battle scarred Ripley, who is NOT a fearless, ass kicking warrior woman, but a deeply frightened yet determined person with a truly heroic streak. Carrie Henn (who amazingly never made another film, either before or after Aliens) is perfect as Newt, the bright and solemn little girl with a pair of lungs like a car alarm. One of my favorite underrated actors Michael Biehn is here as well, playing Marine Corporal Hicks, a possible love interest for Ripley and father figure for Newt. Bill Paxton has entered into film icon territory with his portrayal of the cocky, but ultimately blubbering Pvt. Hudson, whose wails of 'It's a bug hunt, man! a bug hunt!' have become a part of cinematic history. Cult film favorite Lance Henrickson is here too, playing the slightly suspicious but ultimately likable Bishop, an android who could have made Nexus proud with his More Human Than Human personality.This is a really great sequel to the original masterpiece film Alien. It doesn't try to mimic or reproduce but instead veers off into a whole new direction, filled with fast paced action and a good, strong, intelligent storyline. It's fun, it's tense and it's scary, but it's also smart. The swarms of aliens in this one are really freaky, and no more so than when they find a way into the locked down base through a ceiling panel. This film never lets up for one minute and includes a great 'just when you thought it was over' ending that will have you on the edge of your seat. An awesome film!",9,0,1,14 January 2006
The Exorcist," What to say?
","I've been hesitating to review this film even though it's one of my all time favorites. I mean, what can I say about it that hasn't already been said? This film is a true classic, simply because it was so far ahead of its time.I can remember seeing TV advertisements for it when it was first released, and I couldn't have been any more than 3 at the time. I got my first chance to see it when I was 12 and mom was working late. Of course, she never would have permitted this, so I kept it a secret...until one of California's routine earthquakes sent me screaming out of my violently shaking bed in the dead of night two weeks later. Fortunately, mom was too busy laughing to be mad at me.Anyway... I'm not going to waste time rehashing the plot frame by frame. Everyone knows what it's about by now; even non-horror movie fans know who Linda Blair is and often refer to her as the 'Pea Soup Girl.' Blair gives an astonishing performance as the twelve year old girl possessed by the 'Devil,' although stunning opening scenes shot in Iraq reveal the devil in question to actually be an ancient Sumerian (or Assyrian) demon known as Pazuzu, a bringer of hot winds and fever. No matter. Pazuzu's motives are never made clear as to why he has chosen this one little girl, but that's not the point of the film. Blair is not the target here; everyone who must sit helplessly back and watch her suffer are the true victims. The priest who is losing his faith, the atheist mother with the bad temper and the priest whom Pazuzu has battled before. There are moments of sheer subtle genius in this film, as Karras sits in a bar and admits he has lost his faith as the song 'Lord I Was Born a Rambling Man' plays in the background, as Regan and her mother innocently wrestle over a cookie, a scene which will be repeated later in the film with the laughter replaced by screams and the cookie replaced with a crucifix. There are also moments of perhaps unintentional humor, as doctors light up cigarettes in hospital corridors and prescribe Ritalin without blinking. True 1970s stuff here. The effects are still quite shocking even 30 years later; gross, upsetting and sick. In particular is the voice of the demon, as performed by Mercedes McCambridge. It is a shocking effect, a multi-layered chorus of the damned speaking in Legion out of the mouth of a little girl. It disturbed me more than the green puke or even the terrible ripping sounds that accompanied the crucifix scene. Max Von Sydow is wonderful as the kindly but strong Father Merrin, who literally battles to the death for the soul of a little girl he has never really met and will ultimately never know. The ending is both devastating and triumphant, and was not at all the 'downer' that I have heard other people refer to it as. What can I say? This movie is a masterpiece, right up there with 'Rosemary's Baby'. You can't say much about films as great as these that hasn't been said already, but even if I'm repeating what the masses have already confirmed, it's better than saying nothing at all. This movie is a classic. It always will be.",10,1,2,17 December 2003
28 Days Later...," Smart and Scary
","A trio of well-meaning animal rights activists break into an experimental lab somewhere in England, intent on freeing the monkeys within. The only problem is that the monkeys, cruelly wired up and forced to watch loops of violent images, have been injected with 'rage,' a neuro-stimulant which produces uncontrollable homicidal anger. Within seconds, one of the activists has been infected by a monkey bite. 28 Days Later (a ha, we have a title!) nearly all of England, and possibly the rest of the world, has been decimated.Enter Jim, a young bicycle courier whose last memory was being struck by a car. He wakes up in an empty hospital and soon wanders out into the wasteland that Britain has become with no idea of what has happened while he was asleep. He soon comes face to face with the hordes of infected, as well as with a handful of survivors, including a tough, pretty girl named Selena and a father and daughter who have turned their London flat into a fortress. I have heard '28 Days Later' compared to 'Dawn of the Dead' (the 1978 version) more than once, although '28 Days Later' is not a zombie film, per se. It is indeed a 'plague apocalypse' film, and a damn good one at that. The infected definitely do resemble zombies...really incredibly FAST zombies; no shuffling Fulci monsters here. The virus spreads quickly and is most often spread by bites from an infected, not unlike the zombie contagion. There's even a free shopping spree scene a la 'Dawn of the Dead.' But there's also a scene like that in 'Night of the Comet' and I don't hear as many comparisons drawn between that film and DOTD as this one. '28 Days Later' is an intelligent, tense and powerful film, more than able to stand on its own no matter what it may or may not have been inspired by. The second half of the film, which finds our small band of heroes ensconced within a pseudo-military base with a handful of crude and desperate soldiers, is more harrowing and tense than any scene up to that point. Once again, it is the humans who are to be feared, not the monsters outside, and a deadly three-way battle between humans, soldiers and infected was both frightening and exhausting to watch. Everyone turns in an excellent performance, and a highly satisfactory ending left me exhilarated.This is truly one of the best and most original new horror movies I have yet seen.",9,3,6,24 March 2004
The Evil Dead," Original splatter
","The Evil Dead takes a not-so-new premise (young people go to a secludedcabin and are killed off) and gives it some new twists.  The fivesome, not content with the usual distractions of alcohol and sex, instead lug an antiquatedrecording device up from the sinister cellar and start listening to the tape which is still loaded up on it.  The recording, made by the previous tenant, details his discovery of a Book of the Dead, bound in human skin and inked in humanblood.  When the incantations within are spoken aloud, ancient demons arisefrom hell and possess the living.  The recording awakens the semi-dormantdemons who are lurking outside the cabin in the woods and soon, the fivesomeare under attack from outside and from within.This is a low budget effort filled with black humor and innovative special effects. It is one of the first films to feature over-the-top gore, as the possessed literally explode in showers of pus, vomit, guts, blood and oatmeal-y goo.  The plot is nothing special, but it doesn't really matter: it's all about the gross outs.  A girl is raped by a tree, another girl slowly chews off her own hand, a pencil becomes a deadly weapon and the possessed all sport milky-white contacts and layereddemonic voices that rival Mercedes McCambridge.  There's also some greatcamera work here, as demonic POV shots skim over murky swamps, crashthrough windows and race through the house to sneak up on the last survivor. This isn't a film about plot or performances; it's all about effects and this film boasts some incredibly good ones considering it was made in 1979.  It alsomanages to create a great, menacing atmosphere  as the forest and even thearchitecture turns on the group, trapping them all within the cabin andpreventing their escape.  Followed by Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, this is still (in my humbleopinion anyway) the best entry in the series.  Incredibly original and strangely funny, this is gore done well when gore was still something new.",Null,0,2,10 May 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," Insane, Gory Fun
","This is a wild, crazed, demented, sick, loud, gore-splattered, profanity-laden, explosion-heavy, hot and sexy vampire film. It's also a lot of fun if you can stomach all the previously mentioned elements.Seth and Richard Gecko (played by George Clooney and the amazing Quentin Tarantino) are fugitives on their way to Mexico amid a storm of bullets and fire. After hijacking a motor home and the nice family it belongs to (jaded ex-minister Harvey Keitel, daughter Juliette Lewis and son Ernest Liu) the strange group is heading for a notorious Mexican strip joint called The Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the group has no way of knowing that the bar is staffed by some really nasty vampires.Some of my favorite people are in this odd little flick: the aforementioned Tarantino (who has never done anything that I don't like), the amazing Keitel (totally cast against type here and doing an amazing job as always), the smolderingly beautiful Salma Hayek, playing the sinuously sexy dancing vampire Satanica Pandemonium, and Cheech Marin, who actually has three roles in this movie but who stands out as the doorman of the Titty Twister, enthusiastically announcing all the varieties of, um, women and their sexual organs to be found within. It's absolutely hysterical...but only if you're not easily offended by the common nickname for house cats being used to describe the female genitalia. Quentin Tarantino also does an outstanding job in his role as the delusional Richard, who imagines he hears crude come-ons from any and every woman he spends too much time around. Keep an eye out for early evidence of his now notorious foot fetish in the scene he shares with Salma, her white snake (nice Bram Stoker touch, by the way) and her bare feet. The violence is explosive and virtually non stop by the third act. The make-up effects by Tom Savini (who also has a role as a biker named Sex Machine) are pretty damn cool, but as with every film that Tarantino has touched, the real action lies within the words spoken by the actors. The script is fast and clever and as incredibly funny as it is offensively sick. This is half vampire film, half Spaghetti western with a little Reservoir Dogs thrown in for good measure. And it's really damn fun too. Fans of Tarantino should enjoy this, and vampire fans tired of the same old formulaic films might just enjoy this odd side road into new territory. The easily offended should stay far away. The rest of us without an ounce of PC will be laughing our tasteless butts off.",8,1,2,17 April 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Flawless
","This is indeed a rare film, a sublime masterpiece, Roman Polanski's crowning achievement. Based upon the likewise-flawless novel by Ira Levin and virtually unaltered by Polanski, Rosemary's Baby is a work of art, a classic which stands alone to this day, never to be surpassed.Everyone knows the story by now; Mia Farrow is the sweet and innocent Rosemary Woodhouse who, along with her actor/husband Guy, finds the perfect apartment in New York. Despite a disreputable history, it seems the catalyst of good fortune for the happily married young couple. Their friendly, if somewhat brassy, neighbors are played to absolute perfection by Ruth Gordon (who received an Oscar for her efforts) and Sidney Blackmer. Despite some foreboding nightmares and the unfortunate accidental (?) death of a young woman, life is good for Rosemary and her husband, whose acting career seems to finally be taking off. But there's always a price to pay for good fortune. Unbeknownst to poor Rosemary, her husband has literally made a deal with the Devil. Shortly after a romantic dinner, some chalky chocolate mousse and the mother of all nightmares in which Rosemary is raped by a beast whilst her neighbors and husband look on, Rosemary discovers she is pregnant. But the pregnancy is a difficult one, her neighbors are not what they seem and the inevitable closes in around her over the course of nine long months time. Rosemary comes to believe that she and the baby are in danger, that her baby is a potential sacrificial victim for a coven of witches. The truth, however, is much, much worse.I've always thought of Rosemary's Baby as the blackest of black comedies, and of Rosemary as the butt of a very long and drawn-out practical joke. Fans of modern day horror films, used to gory death scenes and disposable heroes, will probably not appreciate the pace at which this film moves or its wry sense of humor. This is indeed a shame, because this film is everything that a good horror film should be; intelligent, subtle and almost rather dismissive of its own brilliance. The films climax is practically shrugged off by the characters who have brought it about. And Rosemary finally realizes that perhaps the only way to beat them is to join them; there is no fiercer predator than a mother defending her child, and as she accepts her role as the Mary of the Profane, we must wonder; will she triumph after all?I've hesitated to review this film for a long time, simply because I couldn't think of anything to say about it that hasn't already been said. It's a masterpiece, a work of art, an inspiration for many films to come, some good and some not so good. It continues to loom large over the genre, virtually untouchable and yet always accessible. No fan of film - horror or otherwise - should miss this. It truly deserves every word of praise it has ever earned.",10,4,6,22 March 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Denn die Todten reiten schnell
","It's strange...  People either love this film or hate it utterly.  Me? I liked it despite its many flaws, but I am also prejudiced where Gary Oldman is concerned.Bram Stokers Dracula is NOT by any means faithful to the novel penned by Bram Stoker, but it tried harder to stick to the original storyline than the Lugosi version did.  Combining the tale of Stokers immortal vampire with the biography of Vlad Tepes the notorious Impaler, this film is a rich, full feast of colorful visual metaphors that just about leap off the screen and slap you in the face.  The sets are gorgeous; elegant manor houses, cold forsaken castles, misty woods filled with graceful wolves.  The actors are slightly less effective than the scenery, I'm sorry to say.  Keanu Reeves is (as he always is outside of his Bill & Ted role) stiff and lifeless, his English accent so weak it practically needed crutches.  Winona Ryder irritated me very badly, emoting so hard I kept expecting her to explode as she bulged her eyeballs and gasped like a fish, clumsily stumbling through the entire movie.  Anthony Hopkins was rather enjoyable as the weirded-out Van Helsing.  But this movie belonged to Oldman and no one else. 
Oldman's Dracula is a powerful character, complex and stunning.  He is cold and cruel, sweet and sorrowful, sadistic and sexy.  Oldman has always been one of my favorite actors.  Always, he makes me believe in the characters he plays whether it's a despicable cop, (The Professional) a stupid junkie, (Sid & Nancy) a bumbling Shakesperean misfit (Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead) or a 400 year old vampire who has damned himself for the sake of love. Hey, anyone who can manage not to laugh during his love scenes with the ridiculous Ryder has my deepest respect.No, this is not a flawless film, but it has its beautiful moments; absinthe and blood, sepia-toned silent films filled with lust, violence and sex hand in hand rather than one standing in for the other, and Oldman's performance is strong enough (in my humble opinion) to carry the entire film to its satisfying end.",Null,0,1,10 December 2003
Halloween," Classic Slasher
","Halloween, believe it or not, was not the first slasher film of it's kind. It was also not the last and continues to spawn imitators to this day.  Four years before 'Halloween' was released, the slasher film 'Black Christmas' came and wentwithout much notice, even though it boasted a more seasoned cast and aslightly better budget.  So why was Halloween more popular than itspredecessor?  I don't know for sure, but I have a few theories.  #1  It has a great, catchy score going for it.  #2  It didn't take itself quite as dead-serious as Black Christmas did and provided more than a few laughs, and #3 SEX!!!  Halloweenmay not have been the first slasher film, but, if memory serves me correctly, Halloween was the first slasher film to suggest a direct correlation between sex and death.  The point of Halloween seemed to be that young, sexually activegirls die and good, virginal girls live.Michael Meyers, very much like Rhoda in 'The Bad Seed' was just born bad. He is six years old when he commits his first murder, stabbing his sister to death after she finishes having sex with her boyfriend.  Showing no remorse, or any other kind of emotion for that matter, Michael is locked away in an insaneasylum to await his 21st birthday, when he will stand trial for his crime. But on the eve of the trial, Michael escapes and heads home to Haddonfield. 
No reason is ever given for Michael's urge to kill, nor is it explained (in the first movie, anyway) why he chooses the three main targets of the film; Annie, Linda and Laurie.  Laurie is the good girl, the plain Jane with a brain wallflower played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Her two friends, Annie and Linda, are far more popular, better dressed and more confident, and seem to like having Laurie around ifonly to make themselves look even better.  Both have boyfriends and aresexually active.  Laurie is a little afraid of boys, and this may be what saves her. She is suspicious of the mysterious man who seems to be following her and her friends around, but her friends never take the threat seriously.  For them, the shadowy form of Michael is either a potentially cute guy to flirt with, or a creep who needs to 'buzz off.'  Linda and Annie never consider the danger.  Lauriedoes, and she is on the alert for the rest of the night.  Annie is the first to die, after stripping down to her underwear in front of the window and having asexually explicit phone call with her boyfriend, whom she is on her way to pick up when she is murdered.  Linda drinks beer and has sex with her boyfriend in the parents bedroom, and even flirts with Michael (thinking he is her boyfriend in a ghost costume) brazenly baring her breasts.  Her boyfriend is stabbed todeath, she is strangled, and Laurie, left alone across the street, is next. 
Laurie, shy and afraid of men as she is, cannot seem to fight back at first. She runs, screaming for help after finding the dead bodies of her murdered friends. But when no one will help her, she learns she must help herself if she wants to live.  Her maternal instincts kick in when the killer invades the house where she is babysitting two small children.  Laurie screams and whines and doesn'talways use good judgment (and, compared to today's butt-kicking heroines, she seems pretty wimpy and spineless) but she manages to fend off her attackerlong enough for help (in the form of Dr. Loomis - Donald Pleasance) to arrive. Laurie has survived, but the boogeyman is not dead.  She will have to bestronger next time.Halloween showed us what happens when young adults engage in premaritalsex, the consumption of alcohol and marijuana and attitudes which suggest that they are too big for their britches.  But it's also just a good, scary little film to watch with the lights off, if you're not one to be bothered with pseudo- psychological insights.  Michael Meyers is a dark angel of judgment and death, making examples of Linda and Annie and pushing Laurie back into her place. Laurie, who chokes and coughs over a joint that Annie has no problem with,now understands; she is not meant to fit in with That Crowd.  She has beensingled out forever, and now sees the danger that awaits her there. 
Halloween is a classic of the genre and should not be missed by  horror fans. No excuses: you cannot call yourself a true fan of horror until you've seen this film.  Michael Meyers has indeed achieved immortality, right up there withJason, Freddy, Pinhead and many others.  He will never die, and neither will the impact this film made on history.",Null,1,2,14 March 2004
Carrie," Queen Bees, Wannabes and Carrie...
","Nowadays, we have literal truck loads of books on how to deal with our tormented teenage daughters. We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film 'Carrie' already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film - to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens, who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period - incredibly late - finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out. Of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing. With her the onset of her menstrual cycle, her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately, no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell, her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody, fiery apocalypse, as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course.Carrie is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed. It features great performances by Sissy Spacek as the severely damaged Carrie, Piper Laurie as her delusional mother, Amy Irving as the one teenage girl with a streak of compassion and guilt and Nancy Allen as every nerds nightmare - the Popular Girl with no morals, no feelings and no mercy.For having been written by a man (Stephen Kings first novel) this is a powerful portrait of what it is like to be a teenage girl...and an outcast one at that. The hope, the anger and frustration, all are strong and realistically portrayed. This is a film about the monster within us all.",10,85,122,10 January 2004
The Sixth Sense," Very Good
","I have to admit right up front that I had the 'twist' ending figured out about 20 minutes into this film. That didn't stop me from enjoying it, however.Bruce Willis is a child psychologist who has recently taken young and troubled Haley Joel Osment under his wing. It seems that young Haley can 'see dead people.' As Bruce's marriage slowly dissolves and Haley suffers from cruel ridicule inflicted by his classmates, the two form a bond and try to find a way for Haley to accept his lot and somehow turn his frightening experiences with the dead into positive ones.There are more than enough frightening moments here, as Haley encounters the ghost of an angry, abused woman in his kitchen, a constantly vomiting little girl and a slave locked inside of a coal chute. There's also a great moment featuring Willis and a tape machine, when revelation strikes him with the force of a fist. All of these encounters are spooky, eerie and unsettling, but also highly satisfying, especially in the case of the poisoned child whose murder Haley solves. The film is quiet and sedate, even a little washed out, but highlighted with brilliant spots of red at climactic moments. It reminded me quite strongly of 'The Ring' and its Japanese predecessor 'Ringu' with its stark, cold landscapes and profound silences. I was a tad disappointed that I couldn't be surprised along with everyone else at the twist ending, which indeed was quite a nice shock, but I still very much enjoyed this innovative ghost story.",8,0,1,2 June 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The original and best of the Elm Street series!
","The teenagers of Springfield, Illinois are having nightmares. Tina and her best friend Nancy learn that they're dreaming about the same creature, a hideously burned man in a dirty red and green sweater who bears an odd weapon; a glove with razor fingers. When Tina is brutally murdered in her bed one night, suspicion falls upon her volatile boyfriend Rod, who was the only other person in the room with Tina when she died. But Rod swears he didn't do it, and tells Nancy that he too has been suffering from terrible nightmares in which a knife- fingered man is trying to kill him. Nancy begins to suspect that something evil is happening within their dreams, and that perhaps the boogeyman is real. When Rod turns up dead in his jail cell, Nancy is convinced that a ghostly killer is stalking them in their sleep. Her mother, worried for Nancy's sanity, takes her to a dream clinic where her sleep patterns can be monitored. When Nancy awakens screaming from a nightmare with a bloody slash mark on her arm, she shows her mother and the doctor what she has pulled out of her dream: the battered fedora that the killer always wears. The hat bears a name tag: Fred Krueger. Nancy's mother recognizes the name and soon tells Nancy the story of a brutal child killer who had terrorized the town many years ago. When he was released on a technicality, Nancy's parents and the parents of the other nightmare-plagued children hunted Fred Krueger down and burned him alive. Fred Krueger is dead, but he's found a way to return and wreak vengeance upon the children of his killers. Nancy knows that she must find a way to stop him before he kills her and everyone else on Elm Street.I just sat down and watched this movie again the other day and it's still damn impressive. The acting isn't always the greatest and it looks just the slightest bit dated, but it's still a really damn good movie. It's power lies in the fact that sleep cannot be avoided. In so many other horror movies, the victims are nothing more than vapid cattle wandering dumbly up the slaughterhouse chute and calling out: 'Is anyone there?' as they go up. They purposefully get themselves into stupid and dangerous situations and therefore we feel no real pity for them when they are eviscerated. However, in A Nightmare On Elm Street, all the characters have to do to endanger themselves is to go to sleep. Even the most hardcore insomniac (like myself) knows that eventually, sleep will come for you; it is unavoidable. We cannot blame our cast for wandering around doing stupid things in their dreams, because how many of us have had dreams in which we show up for work naked? Very rarely are we in control of our dreams, and in A Nightmare On Elm Street, the only person in control is Freddy Krueger. Robert Englund as Freddy is flawless. Before this movie was released, the boogeymen of horror films had always been hulking, silent, expressionless shapes usually hidden way behind masks. Not that there's anything wrong with that! But Englund gave us a new kind of Boogeyman - a smartass. Freddy is hideously burned, covered in scar tissue and has all the fashion sense of a wino, but he's cool. Not content to simply disembowel his screaming victims, Freddy has to tease them a little first, flirting, humiliating or showing off. He makes Tina watch him cut off his own fingers and smiles at her like a drunken uncle who's just pulled a coin out from behind her ear. He sticks his tongue in Nancy's mouth via her telephone. He doesn't waste his sense of humor on the guys in this film, but there's plenty of sequels in which he makes up for that. This is such a great, innovative film, filled with pretty cool special effects, disturbing sound effects (including scraping metal fingernails and baby goats bleating in terror) and creepy music. The boiler room is an especially unnerving set, complete with hissing pipes and dripping chains. A young Johnny Depp and his feathery 80s hair make their debut in this film as well, and though his character is about half a million miles away from Captain Jack Sparrow, the raw talent is still very much in evidence here. This remains the best movie of the Elm Street series, with a few good sequels and some really crappy ones. But Freddy is always worth watching.",9,87,102,8 December 2005
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Pretty Good
","This is, visually, a stunningly beautiful film.  However, I must agree with Lestat that the whining of Louis (which goes on for centuries) is most annoying.  Louis, a poor-me twenty something plantation owner in 1700s New Orleans, is a reckless drunk, devastated by the death of his wife and unborn son in the throes of childbirth.  He spends his time gambling in seedy taverns and whining about his miserable life.  So, instead of putting an end to his sorrow and committing suicide, he decides to become immortal and spend eternity whining some more.  This gets on the nerves of vampire Lestat, the one who made Louis a vampire in the first place.  Tom Cruise (who only ever seems to play Tom Cruise) is an unlikely vampire, though he doesn't do a completely awful job in his interpretation of the arrogant, sadistic Lestat. Dunst is the Vampire Claudia, the eternal child who plays her part flawlessly, enjoying her immortality, her bloodlust and the power of being an immortal.  She gives Lestat a run for his money in the sadism department, merciless as she cuts his throat and instructs Louis to dump the corpse in an alligator-infested swamp.  She is the fiercest and most frightening of the vampire trio.The second half of the movie is where the true power lies, as Louis and Claudia arrive in France and are greeted by the ghoulish Theater des Vampires, led by Armand.  Antonio Banderas in no way resembles an angelic red-haired seventeen year old boy (which is, according to the Book Purists I've spoken to, how Armand was described in the books) but he plays his part with grace and elegance.  Stephen Rea as Santiago is wonderful, a cold, cruel killer who enjoys every second of his sadism.  The theater itself is a wonderful set, filled with catacombs and dusty skeletons.  The plot explodes as Claudia is found guilty and sentenced to death for her execution of Lestat, and the Theater burns to the ground as Louis finally gets a backbone and exacts a brutal revenge.  This scene alone is almost worth suffering through an hour of self-pitying slop from Louis.  The ending was also most welcome, virtually turning Louis, the thus-far established hero, into the butt of a very long joke.  I didn't love this movie, but I liked it, my only large complaint being the whining of Louis.  But my personal preference has never been for incessantly complaining Pretty Boys anyway.  I never cared much for the books and have never been a Book Purist anyway, even with books I truly loved (i.e. The Lord of the Rings).  It was a decent vampire film with some truly stunning moments.  It was better than most.",Null,1,2,3 January 2004
