The Blair Witch Project," Haunting
","This movie was truly haunting.  Horrifying ending... left me wondering (and I still wonder) what really happened.  Leaves a lot open for you to fill in on your own, and that makes it even scarier, since you can make your own conclusions and scare yourself all over again hours, even days after seeing it.  Great job Haxan Films!",10,1,3,30 April 1999
