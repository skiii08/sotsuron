Iron Man 3," The epic film that wasn't
","With the multi-movie build up of man invents machine - man becomes one with machine - machine begins to consume man sequence, and an iconic villain played by a first rate actor, I was prepared for an experience equal to The Dark Knight, or maybe better. Iron Man 3 wasn't that film. Instead, opportunity for profound and gripping face-offs between villain and hero was traded for sitcom oversimplification and scene by scene over played gimmicks. The basic premise had good ideas, but the final product looked like it was edited by a studio executive committee with no understanding of the comic superhero world at all instead of a visionary director.Iron Man should be a regular guy who, through his own invention, becomes a hero through the power the machine gives him, and as a regular human the task takes it's toll physically and emotionally. The narcissist Tony Stark denies to himself the personal decay and revels in the attention Iron Man brings. The denial doesn't change the fact that the machine is taking over and Tony is falling apart as the role of superhero overwhelms and begins to destroy him. Instead, in Iron Man 3, the script forgets this and trades it for scene-by-scene stunts and uncharacteristic nonsensical decisions by what should be a supra-genius.Also, the villains in Iron Man should be powerful, but realistic using clever tactics in a battle of intellects when the machines prove equally powerful and battle to a stalemate. Instead, in this film, the many iterations of Iron Man suits are destroyed without discretion, like they are not the brilliantly designed symbolic source of power they are intended to be, but just disposable props. The villain in Iron Man 3 could have been an epic and unsettlingly realistic psychopath with the Mandarin, equal to or greater than Heath Ledger's Joker. Instead, what we got in IM3 was a false villain just pretending to be evil and a real villain with unbelievable powers seemingly made up as the film went along just to be invincible only until the end when it was convenient for him to disappear and the movie to be done.I can ignore the false villain because the concept could have been brilliant, but it wasn't and made the story a joke. I can accept another villain amped up with some type of power, but not when it is so outrageous and inconsistent that one scene has no relation to the next. Tony should be coming up with a brilliant solution to overcome the villain's power when the brute force of the suit didn't work. For that to happen the villain's power must be consistent and in IM3 there was no consistency at all.The bottom line on this film is that the Iron Man world is still intact if you ignore IM3, and I think you should.",2,2,4,12 May 2013
Passengers," Definition of Script Problems
","In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do.The story centers around a star ship with 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members placed in hibernation for a 120 year trip to another star system to colonize another planet. This part of the story is plausible and even thought provoking. Even the ship itself is based on realistic designs. The science behind this background is sound. The ship is traveling at half the speed of light to a star system 60 light years away for a 120 year trip. Passengers are placed in hibernation to make the trip. So far all of this works and is interesting, but this is about a 5 minute background setting. After that things fall apart. Two passengers are accidentally awoken 90 years too early and face death from old age out in the void of space before reaching a destination. To make this plot work, the unbelievable is required. First, no one is watching the ship, not even automation. If this was a real ship, when an anomaly is detected the crew would be awoken to take care of the problem and put back into hibernation even if they do not take shifts over the century long trip. Second, there is no way to get a person back into hibernation in any way whatsoever. On a trip like this, that disbelief cannot be suspended, because it is too absurd to imagine. There are other things about this story that cannot be disbelieved, but the ones I have mentioned make this plot fall apart.One aspect that is interesting, but not properly explored is the reference to The Shining that dominates the movie. When this reference is first introduced the parallels to the insanity that develops from isolation or even possibly a haunted ship were obvious and the prospect exciting. However, the movie does not explore this and the reference is relegated to a running joke. Unfortunate.The setup of the plot has so many possibilities, but you will end this movie realizing that it is a classic example of a problem script that piles on the increasingly absurd and unbelievable in an attempt to cover the holes.",4,37,61,10 April 2017
Suicide Squad," I was expecting more
","I was very excited to see this movie. I'm not familiar with the characters from the comic books, but a gang of super villains turned super heroes seemed like a lot of fun. What I discovered was that the super villains weren't so super, the graphic design was bland and the action generic. All of which did not lead to an engaging movie. The short of the story: Post Batman vs. Superman, Batman puts a few bad guys in super villain prison, an even badder guy shows up, a proactive political type takes the initiative to let the bad guys out to get the badder guy and save the world. Sounds cool, right? The problem is that, for the most part, the characters and action were flat with no payoff. Back in the good ol' Arnold/Sylvester 80's action movies you got a story setup where the only way out was through, action that was ridiculously over the top but creative, comic relief (with quotable cheesy one liners) and a satisfying ending of poetic justice. Suicide Squad did not follow this formula and would have been better if it had. Where did it go wrong? First, the characters. The only character with a real attempt to add dimension to was Deadshot. The only real problem with Deadshot was that Will Smith played the character and Will Smith has a tendency to be Will Smith in every movie. There was some backstory on Harley Quinn and Diablo, but nothing that added any real value to the story. All of the other supers were basically red shirts.One of the biggest letdowns for me was Harley Quinn. Before seeing this movie I read so much about how she was the highlight of the show, but the character really missed being a lasting classic character on so many levels. I was expecting a complex mix of manipulative powers similar to Black Widow, but more flirty with a big dose of Hannibal Lecter. What we got was an attempt to convince everyone she was crazy by saying off the wall things and laughing all the time. The same is also true for the Joker, who goes hand in hand with Harley. What made classic insane characters work like Hannibal and Heath Ledger's Joker work so well was that they were based in real characteristics of mental illness and the criminally insane, not the superficial 'voices are telling me to kill everyone' that we get here. Criminal insanity is the inability to tell right from wrong, or as I see it, complete loss of any type of empathy for others or a conscience. It is often accompanied by a view that the whole world is doomed anyway, so why would you work to better it or care what happens to it, which would be an easy perspective to pull off with any of these characters.My biggest issue with this movie is that the super heroes were not very super. It seemed that they needed saving more than Generic Soldier #X. Even in the universally panned BvS each character had complimentary abilities needed to solve a problem. Except for Deadshot no one's abilities were used very much at all.The real mystery of the movie was why the director approved faceless potato men as the graphic design of the villain army soldiers. Not scary.The Good? I gave this 2 stars solely for Viola Davis. She shows how a good actor can turn a sow's ear of a script into a silk purse. She knocked the character of Amanda Waller out of the park so hard that she seemed out of place here. This character was the only redeeming aspect of the movie. Amanda was the politician trying to save the world, but in the process was more evil than any of the super villains. It was a dose of reality that may be lost in the shadow of a bad movie overall, but was brilliant in concept. A subtle yet chilling badness that should have been applied to Harley Quinn as effectively. Both characters could have been equally strong and vicious, but yin-yang opposites. That could have been interesting to explore.The verdict? Pass on this one. If you want good over saturated superhero movies re-watch The Dark Knight and the original Avengers again, or maybe one of the X-Men movies.",2,35,62,7 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not the good Star Wars, but had its moments
","Even though there were elements of this movie that were beyond ridiculous (i.e. Palpatine (I'm back!) and where did that 'largest fleet of absurdly over-powered star destroyers in the galaxy' come from), it was not the intelligence insulting abomination that The Last Jedi was. It had some genuinely interesting moments and largely got back to the 'used universe' that made the original unique. Now I understand why so many directors quit these movies for 'creative differences'. I expect it is because they are largely Disney board of directors written. This is not the end to end excellence of Rogue One or the Mandalorian, but it's watchable and maybe even re-watchable for the interesting elements thrown in. If you are a Star Wars fan you will be going to see this no matter what it was, but fortunately it is watchable and interesting on a scene by scene basis. Just don't think too hard (or at all) about the story.",5,7,12,22 December 2019
Dunkirk," Not What I Thought It Was Going to Be.
","This was one of the biggest movie buildups of the summer. Before I went to see it I was picturing a Dunkirk version of Saving Private Ryan with realistic war scenes around a set of characters that you got to know and care about, and followed them through some type of struggle.If you separated each scene from the movie they were visually fantastic. But, when you put them all together you still had only a series of great looking clips, not an engaging movie. The lead characters were virtually indistinguishable from the other 400,000 soldiers. You never got to know them as individuals, so it had no impact when something happened to them. Nothing was ever explained, so if you don't know the historical context you still won't know the significance of the event, or even what really happened after you see this movie.I've seen much more interesting and clear documentaries on TV. If you are going to this movie expecting it to be the next big thing, you will likely be disappointed.",6,14,23,22 July 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Epic Letdown
","It seems like the superhero movie-making crowd stopped trying a few years ago. The original X-Men movie went into many of the character's backstories and had a plot with plausible motive and execution. The team had to work together to figure our how to defeat the villain, who really wasn't a villain. And, they were normal people trying to make sense of and cope with extraordinary powers. It was a film beyond just the fighting. X-Men Apocalypse didn't really bother much with story and got right to the video game-like throwing magic around until time ran out then the villain got overpowered where he was not overpowered by the same magic before. For those just looking for good fight scenes, you have probably seen better fighting on the Mortal Kombat video game.Marvel had a golden opportunity with the Apocalypse character. When you have the first and greatest mutant who ever lived you can tell the greatest background story of all time. The background story basically came down to Apocalypse stealing powers, not using them in any smart way, then seemingly forgetting them when the clock ran out and it was time to roll the credits. I would have liked to see where Apocalypse came from, how he grew into the being he is now and when he got to the 1980's have more profound objectives than just destroying everything. Typically, 'bad guys' are perceived as heroes by those that follow them, and are doing the right thing from their perspective. As a many thousands of year old being Apocalypse should have had an objective that was right in principle, but unacceptable in execution. Instead we got 'Insert generic bad guy here' So many character opportunities were missed out of uninspired convenience. Jean Grey, at this time a teenager, suddenly knew she was the Phoenix and how to control it. The Phoenix isn't controlled; it's released and should be a menace in its own right. If super powerful beings were to battle they should have told parallel stories of Apocalypse and the Phoenix and had them meet time lines. Also, as a side note, the fact the Quicksilver is Magneto's son was started but fizzled and never went anywhere. Could have been a great plot element there. Another opportunity missed.Cameos that fell flat: Wolverine with a different backstory (remember we are on an alternate time line). And, Psylocke, who is one of the great characters in the comics, at least looked the part this time, but ended up a shallow one-dimensional character. She was presented as a main character, but nothing at all was told about her and was more of a set piece.Probably more disappointing than the lack of story was the performance from the actors. X-Men typically has top rate actors that I like in other films, such as McAvoy, Fassbender, and Isaac. However, all of them just phoned it in this time. Jennifer Lawrence brought Katniss to the X-Men. Not sure if she phoned it in also, or if this is just her range.If you thought Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron were special effects cop outs you should skip this one. If you are fans of the X-Men comics there really isn't anything to see here either. I gave this one 2 stars simply because the Quicksilver slo-mo scene was cool, but that's about it. If we want better movies we need to stop supporting bad ones with our dollars. I'm sure Apocalypse will make gargantuan sums, but I'm confident that it won't be analyzed in college literary classes. As the claimed last film of the X-Men series Apocalypse does not close on an epic finally, but more of a slow painful death.",2,14,27,31 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Maybe Storytelling is a Lost Art
","Bottom Line: The Last Jedi was a pointless story with pointless character deaths that undermined the Star Wars universe.
Maybe Disney knows how to make money and good movies are just not the way. This new trilogy is doing very well for Disney, but is a mashup of recycled clips that completely miss the point of why they were there originally. Middle movies are always difficult, but The Last Jedi was particularly devastating to the Star Wars universe. As a Star Wars fan, I'm a little tired of the 'good guys' being the underdogs and fighting the big evil. These movies would have been much more believable and interesting if the Republic was starting to reestablish itself and the First Order was becoming a credible ISIS like threat. Snoke ended up being a non-player in this new universe, so they should have skipped him completely and had Kylo Ren as a want-to-be emperor instead of a want-to-be Darth Vader.
These movies have no discernible theme, so far. The original 6 were about the redemption of Anakin through a prophecy that said he would destroy the Sith, but left out that he would destroy the Jedi and himself in the process (the force needs balance after all). The Jedi were the imbalance and Anakin set the force right by embracing the dark side and destroying them all. These larger themes are forgotten in this new trilogy leaving them hollow with little more to think about than what merchandising will come from them. What is more difficult to grasp is that most of the plot elements dead ended leaving you with the feeling that you wasted all of that precious screen time.
One of the greatest tragedies was how R2-D2 was left as a nostalgic prop. In the original 6 R2-D2 was the one who guided the fate of the galaxy by subtle influence on everyone else, and was the only character who knew the whole story from beginning to end. In The Last Jedi he is nothing more than an old robot and his significance was missed completely.
A few interesting things that occurred if we view the movie as a series of clips, Force Skyping was an interesting addition to a universe that did not have this type of communication in 1977. The concept of good and evil being a matter of perspective, how arms dealers sold to both sides, and how the Force is bigger than the Jedi were more realistic elements then the black and whiteness of the original view of the world.
There are too many ridiculous plot elements to go through here, such as the resistance fleet very slowly getting away for the entire movie, and Rey being upset by Kylo Ren not wearing a shirt as if the destroyed AT-AT remnant she was living under in the desert her entire life as a scavenger had strict fashion protocols.
Overall, it's another mish mash of recycled concepts that miss the point. Just watch the original trilogy again and sit this one out.",2,70,107,24 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Expected Better
","Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot to live up to. The first Avengers managed to take 6 unique characters and do them all justice in the story, all while providing a good buildup of action. Avengers 2 tries to up the ante and ends up being a mess of unexplained and unrelated pieces. If you are out for an action packed superhero movie you will probably have a good time at Avengers 2, but it will not stick with you as a classic. Add a dozen or so more superheros to the usual lot and you have people and creatures wielding all types of unexplained powers for reasons unknown. All comic book movies require suspension of disbelief, but Avengers 2 goes the trending route of powers that make no logical sense to get out of situations that back characters into corners or are needed to end a scene that has no flow or purpose.Some elements only touched on would have made a better film. The exploration of Hawkeye's family would have made a good story element if it was developed. Superheros have people waiting at home for them too, like real world soldiers. The romance of Black Widow and Hulk would have worked if done well. Girl falls for the ultra-nerd/ultra-bad boy even though she knows it will lead down a dark path. Could have worked, but didn't. Tony is so concerned about saving the world that he is destroying it. Started that line, but didn't flesh it out. Captain America is trying to find himself in the world. Could have been an fascinating journey. Next movie maybe. Thor, the god who knows more about the universe than any mere mortal, ends up being just a dumb hammer swinger.On top of all that add characters like Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch who were inconsistent and served no purpose in the story. If I did not read about them ahead of time I would have not known who they were. Throw Vision into the mix who appeared briefly, can wield Thor's hammer and reappeared by the end of the film long enough to say goodbye. Oh yeah, Ultron, he was in it a little bit. Didn't really catch what he was trying to do, but the world was going to end somehow and the Avenger's had to stop him. Tony wanted to create some type of special project that was never explained and somehow Ultron came out of that, but accidentally and not as part of the program. Didn't really explain how.I'm being difficult on this movie because I really like the original Marvel movies and hate the trend away from story telling and towards incoherent action.What was good about this movie? Robot zombies. That was awesome! Hawkeye admitted that maybe he should have a weapon better than a bow and arrow. Maybe the Super Ironman too. Would be good to see more of that, except it beat up the Hulk and that wouldn't happen. Kind of tired of Ironman being indestructible and invincible. It's a tin can. It can be destroyed.Anyway, Avengers 2 will make a Gozillion dollars and millions will enjoy it. However, I want the story telling back in Marvel movies.",5,5,13,3 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Next Generation
","So, was it good? Short answer Yes with an If, long answer No with a But. SW:TFA is what seems to be a trend with JJ Abrams films; outstanding visuals, but a week story that misses the big picture.Short answer, yes the film is a good time at the movies and very enjoyable to watch, but misses a lot of potential because the story was recycled and superficial.Long answer, the original Star Wars saga combined concepts of religion, politics, and classic tragedies/comedies of the human condition. The Force Awakens recycles snippets of popular situations to create stunning visuals, but lack any substance forming a 2 hour long trailer. The story lacks the depth of the original as if the point was completely missed. All six original films can be summed up as the redemption of Anakin Skywalker. Where this new series needed to go is to complete Anakin's prophecy of bringing balance to the Force and explain what that actually means. Real world example: Adolf Hitler died in 1945. His actions were terrible and brought that terror to the whole world during his life, but the events he set in motion lead after his death to the rise of the United States as a superpower, cold war and sparked a technological revolution that shaped the world as it is today. The world did not go back to the 1920's after his death. It continued to be in a type of chaos for decades eventually becoming something completely new. This is the type of post Anakin direction this story needed to go. How did his actions in life continue to shape the galaxy after his death?The opportunity for secondary story elements was lost also. In the vacuum of power left by any totalitarian ruler you will see many warlords try to fill that void. Kind of sort of hinted at but not really illustrated to any great degree. Showing the dead remnants of the empire, using the leftovers and getting back to the dirty universe was a fantastic choice by Abrams. However, the larger structure of society trying to reorganize was absent. The Rebels of the old empire are now referred to as the Resistance. Resistance from what? An example of a recycled concept without thought to why. The enemies should be the resistance now, resisting the reformation of the Republic or some other type of democracy.In TFA there is a new Death Star like ship/weapon that must be destroyed. This new movie needed something new and different since the circumstances that created the Death Star no longer exist. The Death Star should be an obsolete concept in an age long past. The new Death Star like ship and black masks seem like they were thrown in because Star Wars had cool stuff like that, and does not recognize that these elements were manifestations of a deeper story. The Darth Vader suit came about when Anakin gave up his humanity, not just because it looked menacing. Also, Stormtroopers are in the new movie, but are much the same as they were before. What I was hoping for was an illustration of what would have happened to them when the sole direction in their lives 'the emperor' was gone. Do they become vagrants since they are not genetically capable of self-direction? Do they desperately search for someone to follow? TFA doesn't really address that. Instead we get Fin who is a Stormtrooper deserter with a weak explanation as to why that doesn't follow any common sense in relation to the previous series. A different explanation could have worked better that fit more with the history of the Stormtroopers; flawed methods to create them outside of Kamino maybe, leading to imperfect soldiers with anomalies?The Good: It was a lot of fun to watch and visually stunning. The Bad: A week superficial story that missed too many opportunities for Godfather-like greatness.",7,0,8,27 December 2015
Warcraft," Best of times and worst of times
","Any time a popular video game is made into a movie you can expect epic cheese to ensue. Did this happen with Warcraft? Yes and No. The good: The Orcs. Not only was the CGI top rate, the characterization of the Orcs will have you cheering for them and not the humans. The not so good: The Humans. In contrast to the awe inspiring Orcs, the humans were straight out of a renaissance festival. The characters were stiff, uninspired and always costume clean. The very cool: Landscapes. If you are a Warcraft fan the movie brings the game environments to life. We have beautiful renditions of Stormwind, Ironforge, Elwynn Forest, Deadwind Pass and the Dark Portal.How about the story? Not too much to see here. The Orc story is OK. They need to find a new place to live and pick Azeroth. There is more to the Orc story, but I will let you see that for yourself. The Human story dealing with the Orc invasion is lackluster. The Warcraft universe can be every bit as rich and deep as The Lord of the Rings. However, you don't get that kind of story here. But, what you do get is not bad, from the Orc side. The battle sequences have a reason for being in the movie and are not mindless fighting like many recent superhero movies. The sequencing of scenes was a little odd though, making the movie often look more like flash cards of cut scenes. I'm a big fan of the games so this was OK, but if you are not the story is hard to follow. I would not consider this to be a stand-alone movie, as it does not explain anything going on.Bottom Line: If you are fan of the games it is visually impressive and the story is passable. If you know nothing of the games you will probably be lost and bored.",5,8,15,18 June 2016
