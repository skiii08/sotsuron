The Blair Witch Project," i really don't know what to say
","first i thought this will be a movie like hell. but it didn't turned out to be a one. this is not a bad movie either. to be honest this wasn't scary for me. this was rated as a pretty scary movie in every web site. so i thought checking this out. but it was not for me.but the ending is awesome, i was scared in the end. but that's all. don't expect too much. just go and watch it. and you will have a good time. actually not a total scary one. but a good movie.i enjoyed watching it. if you are looking for a total scary evening like when you watch 'THE EXORCIST' then this is not the movie for you. anyway recommend it to watch it and enjoy this fresh idea.",5,0,1,16 April 2010
