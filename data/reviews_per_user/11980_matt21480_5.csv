Requiem for a Dream," Intense, powerful and thought-provoking
","I still remember the first time I saw 'Requiem for a Dream' at Michigan State several years ago. I think this film will always stick with me for one reason or another. The film is hardly pleasant, but in many ways it is about as perfect a modern film as I have seen. Yes, this is high praise, but it is well deserved. The acting especially by Ellen Burstyn as the ever hopeful Sara Goldfarb is amazing in its seductiveness and completeness. Burstyn was Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman longing for past memories and future moments. The actors suck us right into the story and combined with Aronofsky's direction, Clint Mansell's haunting use of the Kronos Quartet, Jay Rabinowitz's editing and Matthew Libatique's camera-work the results are spell-bounding. The story about 4 people and their battles with addiction is heartbreaking, but it is the way it achieves this effect that sticks in my mind. The last 15 minutes are an exercise in editing, cinematography and craftsmanship by the cast and crew. This is an unforgettable film about addiction and longing that made me think for days after I saw it. A 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,12 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," One of the best of the year...
","'Brokeback Mountain' by Ang Lee is an exercise in acting and subtle moments. There have been few films that have portrayed homosexuality and for that matter male sexuality with such honesty and intensity. Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) gives a terrific performance of a man lost in world where he doesn't quite know what he wants or how to show it. The amazing part of Ledger's performance is the subtle nature of the role itself. The character is a like a firecracker of emotions both seen and unseen. This is what gives 'Brokeback Mountain' its core. This is not just a film about homosexuality, it is a film about love, longing and the ability (or lack thereof) in displaying love and it is one of the best films of 2005.",10,10,12,12 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A mixed bag of pirate fun and non-sense
","Most people who go and see 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' probably already know what they are getting themselves in for. Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), Captain Barbossa (Rush) and Will Turner (Bloom) are back in what amounts to a series of adventures, misadventures and somewhat confusing double-crosses. Basically, Lord Beckett now controls the seas having Davy Jones (Nighy) and the powerful ship The Flying Dutchman under his control. The film basically follows the Swann, Turner and Barbossa as they try and save Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and stop Beckett and Jones from ending piracy and sea freedom forever.The strong points of the film by far are Depp's performance and the visuals. The photography, art and set direction are all terrific combining picturesque ocean scenes with detailed seeded locales (Shanghai and the pirate hangout) that look like they are out of 'Blade Runner' or 'Star Wars' only on the seven seas. Then, Johnny Depp does a great job once again as the goofy and eccentric Jack Sparrow. Depp adds some needed humor and lightheartedness to what is a bit overlong affair.The weaknesses of the film, in my opinion, are that because it has several story lines going at once and it needs to combine them altogether by the end into fitting denouement, the film ultimately gets a bit muddled and confusing. Some of the stories and characters end abruptly and other scenes seemed rushed or done as plot devices rather than anything else. As just one example, Swann's escape off of the Flying Dutchman is beyond making any bit of sense. Other than Bootstrap, where is anybody??? Plus, a few of the scenes near the conclusion are a bit heavy-handed and sometimes tacky.All these complaints aside though, everything you expect and want from your comedy/adventure movies are here, some solid action, funny characters and scenes and at least one great performance (Depp). While the film is a bit too long at 2 hours and 47 minutes, it doesn't always feel that long, during the action and comedy sequences the film moves at a steady pace, it's only in some of the dialogue heavy moments that the film really slows. Ultimately, I give 'Pirates 3' a somewhat generous 7 out of 10, it is a bit slow and heavy-handed, but you certainly get your money's worth.",7,1,3,29 May 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A terrific horror-fantasy
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is one of the best fantasy films to come around in a long time. The story deals with a young girl, Ofelia, who in the midst of the war and rebellion in Spain uncovers an amazing and haunting world filled with strange creatures such as the Faun and Pale Man (both played wonderfully by Doug Jones).What gives the movie the its strength is that unique mixture of reality and fantasy. Ofelia's world blends the harsh realities of war and violence with the joy, wonderment and fright of fantasies and lets the audience interpret for themselves what is truly going on.Everything with PAN'S LABYRINTH is top notch from Guillermo del Toro's artistic direction to the terrific acting and beautiful make up and set design. This is an incredible movie and anyone who enjoys fantasy, horror, foreign or drama films will probably love it. 10 out of 10.",10,1,5,2 August 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Long, but excellent
","Few films can approach 'Return of the King' in terms of scope, awe and sheer emotional storytelling. The acting by the entire crew from Viggo Mortensen to Christopher Lee to Elijah Wood is top notch. I also believe what separates 'Return of the King' (and the trilogy in general)from all films of its type is the use of a serious (almost intense) cinematic approach to the material. Science-fiction, action and fantasy films often are almost always tongue-in-cheek because of the implausibility of the storyline. However Jackson and crew approach the material with the correct amount of humor, visual style and tone to create a unique fantasy adventure, which truly honors Tolkien's vision. Peter Jackson creates a terrific conclusion to Tolkien's novel and in the process created a trilogy by which all action and fantasy films and epics will be judged by for years to come.
