The Avengers," what an overrated movie
","a rating of 8.8 on IMDb made me think this movie must be really fantastic, but it is not...weak plot, boring during the first 1.5 hours, no introduction to the characters, only the end gives a bit of what i actually expected. maybe it is because i am not a too huge comic fan, or that i had only seen hulk and Thor before (which i actually really liked), it was a really disappointing show. also the film appeared to be very dark with the 3D glasses on and i was not the only one in the audience who had a hard time staying awake. as other reviewers mentioned as well the different size of hulk in various scenes is a bit irritating. overall i had expected a lot more.",2,19,42,11 May 2012
