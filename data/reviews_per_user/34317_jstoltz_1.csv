Requiem for a Dream," Pass the Valium please...
","Wow... this is without a doubt the best movie I've seen in a while and rates on my all time top 10 at number 3. The weird thing is though, that I NEVER want to watch this movie again... Among other scene, the blood splashing on Harry's face when they amputate his arm will haunt me forever. A couple of movies tried to tackle the drugs issue by showing users slowly declining into total addiction which leads to death or insanity, for example Trainspotting and Basketball Diaries, but Requime is the only one to show you exactly how bad it can get without the 'feel good' ending. All I can say is 'wow'...",Null,1,2,8 September 2003
