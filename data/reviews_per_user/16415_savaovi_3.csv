The Blair Witch Project," Quite unimpressive
","I'm disappointed. The plot and the characters really don't add up. They go into some huge woods with food for only 2 days? They only have a map and one of them kicks it into the creek??!! They p...s themselves in fear yet they keep filming? They follow south and though they only walk during the day they walk in a circle? What, the Sun makes circles in the sky? How dumb can you be? They are a group of teenagers with no survival experience so I guess it is normal that they behave like morons for most of the film, but where are their instincts? If there is something that can defeat fear, that is the auto-conservation instinct: that instinct can turn a damn coward into a hero. Something scares the s...t out of them every night and they don't bother to build anything that resembles a weapon? I thought that was one of those movies that are completely boring until the end and then the final scare makes your skin boil with goosebumps and you think 'It was only one scare in the whole crappy movie, but it was a damn good scare'. I was wrong. The final scene was not scary at all (much like the whole movie). Where was the witch? Or was it a serial killer? Did the teenagers die? Well...I don't give a damn...and that is bad rating.",3,2,4,21 June 2011
Amadeus," Brilliant!
","I saw this movie 5 times and I loved it every time. What if it's a historical fiction? Without this movie, Salieri's works would be unknown today to the general public. The film itself has everything: funny moments, emotional moments, great script, the costumes and settings are a delight to the eye, the acting is perfect. Yes, perfect, and that goes even for the smallest roles. First of all, F.M. Abraham's interpretation is a masterpiece. He plays both Salieri as an adult and as an old man. And he does an exquisite job with both of them. Tom Hulce is a great W.A. Mozart: flamboyant, funny, pantagruelesque, playful and solemn at the same time. All the actors did the best with their parts. I remember the scene where Mozart's maid cries before Salieri...just look at her facial expression. The horror is so real! Or when Salieri reads Mozart's manuscripts: that is the look of a transcended man; Salieri looks like he just had an orgasm. This movie has a lot of strong points, but the acting is the best of them. I have mentioned just a few, but Orsini-Rosenberg, capellmeister Bonno, Emanuel Schikaneder, Katerina Cavalieri were all played masterfully. This movie is a titan of it's genre. 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,22 January 2011
300," 2 ways of seeing this movie
","This film has a dual nature: it's a bad historical movie and a good action one. It's the story of 300 Spartans that defied 600.000 Persians, but the 5000 Greeks (mainly arcadians) that fought there too are not even mentioned. That's why it's a bad historical movie (one reason from 300 others), but it's not the only reason. The fights have rhythm, the choreography is good, it's fun to watch. Yes, the film is racist: the good guys fight for peace and freedom (now where have we heard that before?) and the bad guys come from the Middle East and have suffered genetic modifications. If they put a mustache on Xerxes, I could swear he was Saddam or Osama. Do you know what is a bad historical movie and a good action movie all in one? A propaganda film.",8,3,5,3 March 2008
