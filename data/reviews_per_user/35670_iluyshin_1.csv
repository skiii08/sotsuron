Sucker Punch," A decent movie with forgettable characters
","From the outset of the movie you can tell that the visual styling of which Zack Snyder is famous for is there in all its glory, Every aspect of the film looks fantastic. The movie starts out with the 'main character' Babydoll enduring some horrific events which lead to her being committed to a psychiatric hospital. The hospital is were the journey begins and you get transported to this alternative view of reality and there once again you're transported to a new reality where a quest must be completed and this is where the film sores. These quests areas are amazing and are beautiful to watch with great music and combat. I would like to make this clear they were steam powered Germans and not Nazi's, it was clearly WW1. But sadly while all this amazing action is happening you just don't care about the characters performing it, You never build an attachment to any of them as they're so flat and dull. Babydoll says about 5 lines in the whole movie and she has no expressions bar 1. Ultimately the movie ties together the some amazing scenes which will make every nerd happy but the characters fail to make an impression and story is vague at best, really it seems more like random encounters in a video game.It is still an enjoyable watch and worth a watch.",6,0,4,2 April 2011
