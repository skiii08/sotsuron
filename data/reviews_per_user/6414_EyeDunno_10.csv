Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar-Jar Stinks
","I was fortunate to have watched all three Star Wars films when they were on the big screen way back then. When I first learned of it, the whole title sounded too dumb. 'Star wars,' my brother boasted. The method of thinking in film days then was that any space title probably was something worth *wasting* your money on. Droids named R2-D2 and C3PO? Well... all the scoffing was whisked from my mind the first moment that the titles rolled off into the galaxy and that humongous battleship rumbled into the screen from above. There was no need to create any cute or funny characters because the story line stood on its own. So why on Earth (or Tatooine for that matter) did all involved approve of Jar Jar Binks and the silliness the character portrayed in Phantom Menace? Jar Jar Stinks was a menace the moment he made his entrance, and it simply took away even more from a half-decent film, that was supposed to give us an idea where all that celestial war-making originated. I give Phantom a 6 because it's a necessary evil to watch to understand what was going on with the Federation for Star Wars fans. But Star Wars buffs are a refined bunch, and should have been respected more than to be subjected to Stinks and the abundance of cute-kid scenes that permeated a decent amount of Phantom Menace. When Anakin shared the quiet scene with the queen, I rolled my eyes because the acting seemed forced. His character was simply too young. He seemed not believable enough to pull it off. I felt as though the filmmakers were trying to bring a young-kid generation into the Star Wars fold, to expand the marketing and popularity of 'Star Wars.' Only problem is, Star Wars is already a force in and of itself, and it didn't need help to expand its reach - kids these days don't need to be patronized. If Phantom were produced with more deference to sophistication, it would have been a better flick, and more would have wanted to see more. I still have yet to watch the second and third episodes, simply because ep.1 turned me off that much. It seemed like several characters were being created to add another avenue for profits by fast food chains and toy stores. That Jar Jar was one of the few characters who hadn't succumbed to the dark side, that I wished would have been done away with by a single swipe of a light saber, the moment Stinks made his entrance. I watched Star Wars I again, just the other night and was simply perturbed as that Gungan spoke and acted foolish. It so went against what Star Wars seemed to have overcome when Episode IV debuted in 1977, it being an intellectual movie about life and death in another galaxy. Now thinking of it, I have to give Phantom a 5-star rating.",5,0,1,8 July 2008
Citizen Kane," An Influential Film for an Essential Movie Collection
","A great classic influences those following classics that result from ground-breaking collaboration of writing, acting, direction, and production. Anyone who studies cinema history understands that Citizen Kane should always be mentioned as an essential, influential work. You'll never, ever see it remade. No one would dare try to make it better, because they can't. Some call it dated, yet it was made in 1941. Even today, it will knock the pants off most films that are hammered out by the studios and independent companies, alike. Citizen Kane is as influential and controversial today as it was even before its release. There was uproar when the owner of Hearst newspapers attempted to sabotage the production of Citizen Kane after discovering that Kane, the main character, was based on Hearst. Today, there is debate on whether the film should be considered a classic. A number of people call Citizen Kane 'overrated.' If you agree, that's fine, because I'm not about to dissuade you. But there are also people who don't like more current classics like 'Shawshank Redemption,' 'Schindler's List,' or '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They claim that these films (and a number of others on the IMDb Top 250) 'put you to sleep.' Or, they beg to ask, 'What's the point?' The point is that so many more people feel it's classic, rather than crap.The pacing of Citizen Kane is quite deliberate, in order to peel back the many clues needed to answer the mystery of the last words made by Charles Foster Kane, a recluse newspaper magnate in the mansion that sits among darkness and decay, similar to his very legacy. An investigative reporter is given the task to discover the meaning of 'Rosebud,' exhaled in a whisper of Kane's final breath. I enjoyed how the mystery of Rosebud unfolded, especially with regard to the film's surprising climax. All of those characters left behind to (oft-times, begrudgingly) give their accounts of how Kane influenced their lives, as Kane's quest for fairness succumbed to his thirst for power. The style of storytelling was ground-breaking in its time, as Kane's persona emerged through the performance of Orson Welles and the Mercury Players, who helped put together a fitting, brilliant, and outstanding ending. Make sure to spot Nat King Cole's film debut, playing the piano at the night club.",10,1,3,1 August 2011
Glory," Denzel Washington's defining role.
","I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War 'must-see' dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. 'Trip,' his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: 'We men, ain't we?' I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and 'Searles' (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.",9,1,1,3 July 2013
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A silent film that speaks volumes (Criterion's Voices of Light version)
","What a beautiful and yet startling movie. I am currently watching it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). It's outstanding, from the acting and cinematography to the words and music ('Voices of Light,' performed by Anonymous 4 which was composed by Richard Einhorn who was said to have been inspired by the movie). This is a gem that needs to be seen by real film buffs (who would opt to view the film without sound, as director Carl Theodor Dreyer preferred) and current directors and producers. When I first began viewing it, I thought it had been filmed very recently. All the techniques used, from the placement of lights and cameras to the intimate close-ups of the faces of actors are stunning, almost shocking. As a still photographer, I feel the camera work by Rudolph Mate is tremendous -- there were angles used during the filming of the 1928 movie that still aren't used today. It's so powerful yet also unsettling; even with today's cinematography, Rudolph Maté's lens forced the viewer to see the pain up close, the insensitivity of the judges and guards... Maté's compositions must have been kept off-center to give the viewer a sense of imbalance. And when the film climaxed, camera movements rocked back and forth, or were swept upside down and even trampled on.I wish I could have watched the making of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc,' to see how the film crew and actors developed the movie. Word is that Dreyer insisted that no one wear makeup, which was unheard of in the making of movies in that time. He apparently was also obsessed with being factual and wound up relying on actual transcripts of the church trial. I am glad this movie has been released in video. Please, be sure to at least view this film with the 'Voices of Light' music track, if not purchase it. I strongly recommend it, over what I recently saw in what may be the original music, a simple piano track. That version left me rather underwhelmed. I had to save the best for last: actress Maria Falconetti. She never made another film from my understanding. Watch her body language and expressions, her tears and her eyes. One wonders if her heart was so involved in becoming her character, that perhaps she chose to not remain in films?",10,3,6,3 June 2001
It Follows," Pretty Creepy!
","Let's get the frustrations out of the way. First, when someone breaks into your house call the police. When something happens, TELL someone. That's the horror mantra that It Follows pursues. But I DO understand why they wouldn't tell. No one would believe them. Because as everyone knows, It is only seen by the chain of sexual adventures from one person to another. The characters all seem to have parental issues and have wrapped themselves in their own world, with hardly a care of being caught for things like smoking or even casual sex. And that is the worst of it. The kids are on their own to deal with a monster that pursues someone who had sex with another that It had been pursuing. The religious references usually seen in films is abandoned too. What would YOU do if you suddenly see yourself pursued by It, and no one else sees It? This is a good concept, and the film is left with questions that beg for a sequel. Will there ever be a cure or action to stop It? Why does It follow? And, just what is It? I certainly hope as the filmmakers pursue making sequels and/or prequels to It, that they explain some things. I did wonder if this is some veiled attempt to morality-preach, as there was no religion or family structure whatsoever. And the film took place in a city of complete and utter decay, symbolizing that perhaps, whatever people touch is doomed. It Follows seems like a cat, or brussels sprouts: you either like it or absolutely hate it. It goes against how young people trend: the film shows them embracing all things retro and rejecting technological things - no Facebook friends in this film. That seems like a gamble, since most of the generation are about Twitter and Instagram. Anyway, I enjoyed it enough to hope for a follow-up film to learn what IT is all about.",8,36,73,5 June 2015
Shine," Terrific movie, average DVD
","Bear in mind that this was one of the first generations of DVDs thatwere released, and so many of the additional features that weenjoy now were never added in these earlier release titles. I dohope that 'Shine' is re-released with more in- depth features,including something that focuses on David Hefgott, the pianist thatthis movie is based on. I truly hope the decision is made tointerview or document Helfgott in some way. Nonetheless, themovie is outstanding. I would urge those who enjoyed this film tocontact FineLine Pictures, who released the movie, and urge themto create a special edition DVD to include this. The real David Helfgott actually contributed as a musician (pianist,of course) for this wonderful film about his life, dramatizing hisstruggles through his childhood and breakdown as an adolescent.Yet it isn't about gloomy and depressing accounts but aboutsurvival and living to the best of one's abilities. Those who havelittle patience with people who are schizophrenic may become abit uneasy at the performance of Geoffrey Rush who played theadult Helfgott. Rush's acting was impeccable and very believable,which is why some might be a little agitated or confused at thestuttering and incomplete and rambling dialog by Rush'scharacter. But have patience in getting to understand Helfgott as the movieprogresses. It can confuse the viewer since there are flashbacksand flash forwards. But you know, this was one beautifullyproduced movie. It has had high replay, because the film simplytouches the heart. Just relax and allow the movie (and Helfgott'scharacter) absorb you. By the end, you'll really FEEL how much of ajourney that David Helfgott traveled to arrive where he did.And for those who enjoy Lynn Redgrave, my gosh. Her portrayal ofGillian was superb. Redgrave didn't even get any type of top billingand she didn't appear until late in the movie, yet I felt like Gillianand David were my own family by the end. The DVD's special features include a movie trailer, a video clip ofan award presented to Rush (look for Nicole Kidman and TomCruise together in the audience) and a somewhat unusually-formatted Q/A with director Scott Hicks (about a dozen questionsare displayed and when you select one, a video with an answer byHicks plays). 'Shine' wasn't meant to be a tearjerker movie, but it got to me. Isometimes can't watch even the trailer without getting a lump inmy throat. Lovers of piano concertos and also those who appreciateclassical music would be especially grateful for this cinematicgem.",Null,1,2,25 September 2003
Zombieland," Thar's adrenaline in them thar zombies!
","Went with my fiancée to see this, and from the opening scene it was a bang-bang kind of film, action from one scene to the next, but with enough humor to take the gruesome edge off. Plenty - I mean *plenty* - of gore and laughs to boot. Those who have a weak stomach might think twice about Zombieland. Even I squirmed during some of the more intense violence. And this is the new wave of zombie. Forget the slow meandering living corpses with outstretched arms, moaning and groaning. They kick, scream, run, yell, jump and hoot -n- holler their way to feast. I enjoy the honest spin, how the protagonist gives the true low- down on survival skills. Much of what he shared had me nodding in agreement. The producers take the road less-traveled to give an honest approach of how to cope with zombie life, as though they sensed the frustration of audience members who wind up screaming in frustration at how stupid main characters tend to deal with dead people. Near the end of the film I had to knock a point off for a small dose of stupidity (in my mind) with the main character who paused a while. I felt like kicking him in the britches. But the plot twists and terrific spin by the climax had me sold completely. All in all, it was well worth the price of admission, plus a bucket of popcorn and soda! Just do yourself a favor: Wait past the end of the credits, okay? I had a feeling with such comedians that there had to be an end scene. That isn't a spoiler cos I'm not telling you what it is!",9,0,4,8 October 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Don't Rent Shawshank.
","I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in 'The Shawshank Redemption;' when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Citizen Kane.' It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10,601,681,21 November 2005
Amélie," Look Past the Unattractive Box!
","Almost 50% of the voters gave Amelie a perfect score, about twice as many people who voted '9' for this film. I was one of the majority, but I want to give you some insight to help you find more to understand about Amelie.I first heard of this movie after seeing a less- than- attractive cover in a DVD rental store. A woman said that she was hesitant to watch Amelie because of the pale look of her character on the box (in the movie, she's not pale in any scene). I decided to rent the DVD after reading enough positive reviews here.From the opening scene to the movie's conclusion, Amelie drew me into its world. View this movie with an open mind and don't take it seriously. It's a very light- hearted film, even though wheels on the plot power forward by a tragic event. Amelie is a well- written, acted, scripted, and produced movie. And as the credits rolled at the end, I wanted to see more of Amelie, who was a wonderful and genuine character, one you wished lived in your own neighborhood. And I also believe that both women and men would really enjoy this. Most guys would fall in love with Amelie's eyes, and more women would enjoy the sensitive style of creatively showing a woman's emotions. But I get the sense that a few women may not care for Amelie's character, honestly.The original music (no lyrics) of composer Yann Tiersen will stay in your head, even if you can't get past the subtitles. Tiersen did a fabulous job of creating a score that suits every scene it's played in. The audio is rich and expansive, and can be enjoyed with even the most basic speakers.'Amelie' makes me wish that I had learned French, and I envy anyone who understands the language for being able to understand the dialog without having to read a translation. It can be a little difficult to have to watch two things at once -- subtitles and a movie -- because early on, you'll feel like you're missing the movie everytime you have to read the translation. But trust me on this, 'Amelie from Montmartre' is a movie that you'll enjoy watching again and again. It's a rare treat to find a movie that doesn't get 'tired.' And as you watch 'Amelie' again, you'll enjoy more of the cinematography and the lush, saturated colorful scenes.The DVD has many different options to dive into, which is a great thing since you'll probably fall in love with 'Amelie.' One thing I would like to address is a criticism of too much sexuality in the film. First, North American culture is very conservative compared to the French, who view sexuality as another thing to enjoy in life. U.S. filmmakers may not understand the sensitivity in which director Jean- Pierre Jeunet filmed the sexual scenes, which were not at all gratuitous. I found it odd that someone suggested there was too much sexuality when 15 couples were shown engaging (creatively framed) at around 1/2 second each. Amelie was torn by her desire for companionship and intimacy. Her fears are unnatural in such an open- minded country where sexuality is not considered perverse or dirty.PS- For lovers of traditional blues, watch for a B&W clip on the television of an elderly one- legged man tap dancing midway through the movie. His name is 'Peg Leg' Sam (Jackson), and there are two CDs of music that this late singer recorded, 'Kickin' It' and 'Early in the Morning.' Well worth the search.",10,0,2,13 September 2003
The Sixth Sense," See the movie. Don't ask why. You'll know afterwards.
","One of the finest suspense movies. I am not a Bruce Willis fan, but he certainly surprises me with his character in this film. Usually I don't feel for ANY of his characters (like in Armageddon), yet enough people talked about 6th Sense that I decided to go with my girlfriend. WOW. I must say that your hair may stand on end (especially the ones on the back of your neck), and for some scenes I almost jumped out of my seat. But I have to say that although the child does 'see dead people' (as quoted in the trailers and tv spots) it isn't like some kind of zombie movie. Dead people aren't moving about with that tacky moaning and grunting that I had at first suspected. The casting, direction and plot are superb. The lighting of the scenes heighten the suspense as we found ourselves feeling for all the characters, including Willis'. See the movie soon, while it's still in theaters. But please go with someone. You'll want to talk about the movie long after the end credits roll.",Null,0,0,14 September 1999
