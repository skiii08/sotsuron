The Mask," Jim Carreys funniest movie.
","I love this movie, I'm almost ashamed to admit it. It's big and dumb, but it makes me laugh. I guess because Jim Carrey was new to me, I was delighted with everything he did. And Cameron Diaz clearly is a STAR from the moment she enters the film. Peter Reigert is great as always, and the film is just delightful. It has an energy and a zaniness about it that seems to come naturally, whereas with the Farrelly brothers films it all feels forced to me. Worth a rent......",6,2,5,15 May 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Classic subverive film making.
","In the form of a cheaply made cartoon. I saw this with a full houseof kids and adults, who were laughing so hard they could hardlyhear the dialogue. I was shocked at a few scenes, but overalllaughed through the whole thing. And you know what, it's also oneof the best musicals made in the last 10 years. I'm not kidding,these guys have out done Disney and their bland musicals by along shot. I bought the CD and catch myself singing obscene lyricsas I drive to work. Watch out!           .",7,3,3,18 June 2001
The Killing Fields," A stunning film.
","Absolutely beautiful and moving. It's rare that a film is also moral and can touch you without being preachy, but this is one of those films. Filled with superb acting and camera work, a well crafted story (based on a true story no less) this film should be rereleased on a regular basis. I can't say enough good things about it except go and rent it you won't be sorry!!",10,1,3,13 March 2001
Pearl Harbor," Bring your earplugs.
","And not for the battle scenes. Bring them and use them any time you seethe stiff wooden actors open their mouths to spout out the lamedialogue. It's much more fun to write your own with your friends, as theaudience was doing when I saw it. A movie that provokes unintentionallaughter is actually kind of fun- don't get me wrong. But this one alsopurports to have a larger meaning. Don't be fooled, you'll learn nothingexcept that bad movies make lots of money. I give it a 3 on a scale of10. The three is for the big explosions!  They went boom real good!",1,0,0,3 June 2001
All the President's Men," A modern classic
","One of the few films to make journalism romantic and exciting- at least journalism that is based in reality. If you ever want to feel like you know what happened with Watergate, even though none of us ever will, rent this film. Featuring great performances by Hoffman and Redford, a tight script and terrific music, you will not be disappointed......",10,2,3,17 May 2001
