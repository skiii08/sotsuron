United 93," Cliché Ridden Garbage
","All the glowing reviews of this make me question if I saw the same film as the rest of you. What I saw was chockablock full of disaster movie clichés and terribly annoying quick camera movements, obviously there to maximise drama and forcefully grasp at heart strings. This is attempted to such a degree that it becomes literally slapstick. How many of these passengers and crew narrowly miss missing the flight? Whether it be by being late, being transfered or almost choosing not to go? How many of these passengers and crew have small children, if not brand new babies? It seemed as though all of them did.I do grant that the terribly unsatisfying drama above connects events, newscasts, phone messages and conversations which are accurately replicated from the information seen on the many documentaries made about the horrific events of that day, but these alone do not suffice for a film.There is nothing to gain from this film (aside money for it's producers and some national pride). There is no moral to this story, No entertainment value, It's not informative.This event is an important one to be remembered as it has shaped the world in which we live today. This cheap drama, only belittles this event, and turns it into a bad cartoon.",1,41,99,4 May 2006
