Moneyball," Brilliant!
","When it comes to rating a film, I look at 3 things: Storyline, script, and acting. The storyline for Moneyball was intriguing. The funny thing is you do not have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the story because it lines up more with an underdog overcoming the odds scenario. However, if you are a baseball fan, it is definitely a plus! Aaron Sorkin is a genius. Everything he has written or created is always witty and brilliant. I think of the Social Network, A Few Good Men and The West Wing series. Moneyball lines up quite well next to all of those films. As far as acting goes, Jonah Hill was fantastic. I had a hard time wrapping my head around him being in a more serious role, but he pulled it off with flying colors. Brad Pitt has had better acting roles, but he did a decent job portraying his character. This film is a must see and I expect it to win some academy awards.",8,0,2,26 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Amazing end to an unforgettable trilogy
","Christopher Nolan, Christopher Nolan, Christopher Nolan! I was wondering how this trilogy would end. Not that I had a doubt that it would be a great film, but I wondered how it was going to tie together with the other two. My slight doubt went completely away after watching The Dark Knight Rises. It could not have been any better. People keep saying that this was the best of the 3, but I think it fit where it needed to fit. I would have to say that it was the best that it could have been for being the epic conclusion. Batman Begins was the best it could be for being the first film that defined who Batman really was. The Dark Knight was the best sequel it could be. They all fit perfectly well together. The storyline and script was very well done and the actors played their roles great. I will have to be honest, I was a little skeptical of how Catwoman would be in this movie, but Anne Hathaway nailed it! Bane's character was brutal and intense. It was nice to see how Bane and Batman could physically go round for round. The story of Batman sure has come a long way since Tim Burton. I saw The Dark Knight Rises on IMAX, and it was totally worth it. You can really see where the $250 million went on a large screen with amazing sound. I highly recommend this film to anyone.",9,2,5,25 July 2012
