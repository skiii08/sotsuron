Sucker Punch," worst piece of crap I ever saw
","why would anyone make a movie like this and worse, why would anyone *watch* a movie like this is beyond me. gratuitous and meaningless 'fiction', bad-ass female characters that would be better fitted for a pron movie - at least one would hope that would be more interesting - shallow characters, meaningless plot... how low can one go for the sake of what?... manga characters played by 'real' people... hell, for a moment I thought it was a Quentin movie but even he wouldn't lower himself to this masquerade, sorry QT for even thinking that. think of all the homeless people that could have had a decent dinner and warm clothes on the budget of this abomination. Phew!",1,3,14,7 October 2015
