Stop-Loss," Anti- military
","I have two sons that have both been to Iraq and they don't know anyone that has had a stop-loss or come back so messed up like everyone of the guys in this movie. I was literally angry at the end of this movie. I am so very proud of both my sons and proud of every military man and woman that goes over or even remains here that is in the service. I don't know if this is a spoiler but I checked it because it tells some of the thoughts and actions of some of the actors. The parents and friends of the servicemen didn't even try to talk with them, they dropped their lives and ran with them. War is terrible and many lives are lost, but that is no reason to turn your back and run to Canada or Mexico. I am proud to be an American and stand beside keeping terrorists out of my country...",1,9,25,2 July 2008
