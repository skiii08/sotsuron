The Avengers," Message to Marvel : Get rid of Hawkeye !! Please !!
","As superhero movies go it's a good, not great, but good movie. BUT, the Hawkeye character... Boring with no personnality. Jeremy Renner looks like a guy in tights going to a halloween party. He's fat, out of shape, and Marvel uses a double for the arm sequences so we might think he's muscular. FAIL !!
Like, could he disappear and never come back, like, never see him again in a movie. I Don't know like, send him on an island with Noah Ringer.",8,0,2,23 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Had this been the first Star Wars Movie, il would have been the last Star Wars Movie.
","Who wrote that piece of ,,, ? there is no continuity of the story. We still don't know who is Rey, her parents were nobody (An easy way to spare some intelligence in the storyline), how come she can fix the Millenium Falcon, why is the force with her, Luke Skywalker is now homeless and drinking out of the mammel of a space walrus and they waste 30 minutes of the movie on a boring space chase. I Don't Believe George Lucas wrote that for one second. Di$ney i$ probably making Ton$ of money but they ruined a 6 episode masterpiece.",2,25,35,20 January 2019
