The Avengers," Decent, but Generic
","It's a fun movie, but the plot is very generic and shallow. The villains in this movie are extremely weak. Without giving away the plot, at no point does the viewer actually feel the superheroes are in danger.I have an irrational hatred of Captain America so I am rounding down from the 6.5 score that I feel it deserves. (His quote about Hitler directly contradicts his role in the film, he's a filthy hypocrite that gives the AMERICUH!! vibe.) It's a fun watch, but this is evidence of the dumbing down of cinema for a worldwide audience.Overseas markets are big money, but because cultures are so diverse, to appeal to the world the movie is forced into a least common denominator. I often find % of sales worldwide to be indicative to how dumbed down a movie is.",Null,5,11,22 July 2012
Citizen Kane," Very Difficult to Review
","Let me start off with- this movie is not my favorite.Especially compared to modern movies, this movie is way too slow (the camera moves way too slowly, and the plot advances pretty slowly as well).But taking into consideration the time that it was made, this movie is simply amazing. It does everything right. The quality of conflict is high- one truly grasps the troubles of Charles Foster Kane. Its message is simple, yet effective.Don't see this movie with the high expectations of 'Greatest Movie Ever'. See it for what it is, and it will be enjoyable. Hype kills everything, and this movie is no exception.In short, for the modern viewer, everything about this movie will be disappointing, simply because all of the innovative things that this movie does has been used to every other movie after it. It's also in black and white, so the on screen effects will hardly amaze anybody.But at the heart of any movie is its story, and the story is quite enjoyable. After all, most of the time, we watch a movie for the plot and the plot is one of the best.",Null,0,1,28 May 2012
Forrest Gump," Shawshank Robbed, but this is Great
","I'd say this is a 94/100 type movie, it sticks in my mind as something that don't forget easily.Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film, as his portrayal of somebody who just isn't too bright is spot on. There are also several lines in this movie that are classics- in particular the 'Life is like a box of chocolates' line.I don't think it's a particularly deep film for the most part at first, because the story is quite simple. But simple stories can and are often times quite deep- take Aesop's fables for example.It's a shame that in the back of my mind that I have to compare this to Shawshank, because that's my favorite movie and they both came out the same year.",Null,5,8,25 July 2012
The Dark Knight," Pushes the limit for Superhero Films
","I was annoyed by all the hype that this movie got, but this movie actually turned out to be really good.I tend to judge movies (especially superhero movies) by the quality of the conflict (the main focus of any plot line, I'm sure your English teacher will tell you).The conflict, in turn, is driven by the villain. Without giving anything away, Heath Ledger's Joker was simply a villain that could give Batman a run for his money. I have never seen such a powerful villain, not because the Joker has super powers, but because the Joker truly understands Batman. I was also tired of incompetence in villains. We've all seen it before- the villain screwed up epically and the superhero quickly takes advantage.The Joker is not prune to mistakes, let me tell you that much.It is obvious that Nolan was inspired by 'The Killing Joke' by Alan Moore.",Null,3,5,28 May 2012
Psycho," A Classic that's actually GOOD
","Classics are often underwhelming, because they are often described as the pinnacle of filmaking, whereas in truth, films get better and better.The presentation is the most obvious- black and white cannot compare with color (but works in this case!). Ranking movies is a bit like ranking 'which firearm is the best?', because while there may be classics, the newer ones have the benefit of the knowledge of the older ones! Movies look at the old ideas and improve upon them. People might not agree with this, but I think it is nostalgia that is ruining their perception.THAT said, this movie is actually quite thrilling. I enjoy watching classic movies for the insight in how filmmaking has improved as an art, but usually have low expectations because we all have been spoiled.Everybody probably knows the plot by now, but if you don't, it's worth a watch. As long as you have a decent attention span, you'll be fine.",Null,1,2,22 July 2012
WALLÂ·E," A Unique Experience that's GOOD
","This is an 8.5 movie for me, but I rounded up just because how unique it was.Granted in an era of slient films, every film had no spoken dialogue. Even then, however, there were dialogue cards and such. This movie simply uses movement and context as expression.I didn't find the plot to be TOO unique or amazing, but I did enjoy the plot. It wasn't too deep but had some worthwhile themes.How Pixar managed to get me to CARE about the characters was pretty amazing, it truly manages to prove that actions speak louder than words.I don't think this is a movie that I will watch over and over, but it was something that I enjoyed.",Null,0,1,25 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Great Film, IN CONTEXT with the Trilogy
","When I judge superhero movies, I judge them by the villain. Bane is excellent and truly challenges Batman.Other reviewers have done already an excellent job with describing this film, so I will point out some random bits- As a standalone film, the Dark Knight was the best film by far.As a trilogy, this is the best film by far. Why? It uses the previous two films quite extensively and subtly. There are many things that I can't reveal without spoiling, but pay attention in particular to the dialog in the first two movies.All you need to know is that this is one of the few times that the villain kicks some butt. If you're the type of person that loves slaughterfests of the bad guys by the good guys, this is not the film for you. Bane is formidable. In fact, I think he carries out his plan even better than the Joker.",Null,2,5,22 July 2012
