The Ring," A thrill ride, not a masterpiece
","A lot of people seem to be bashing 'The Ring' for its seemingly nonsensical, absurd plot.These are the folks who tried to make sense out of a movie that aspires to be little more than a fun suspense experience and little else.Not that there's anything WRONG with that. For every 'Citizen Kane', there must also be a 'Charlie Chan', so I'd have to say that apples need to stop being put up to oranges.'The Ring' leans very heavily on suspension of disbelief. Yes, the premise is wacky. Yes, there's no rational, empirical reason for some of the events that transpire within it. If there were, it would take longer and probably be laughable. The point is that what is happening on the screen is happening whether you like it or not, so play along and see where it goes. After all, when we sit down to watch 'Lord of the Rings', do we complain endlessly that orcs, elves and dwarves don't really exist? When we watch 'Silence of the Lambs', do we debate in circles for hours how fast it would take Lecter to skin a man's face off that convincingly?Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Not everything has a grand and glorious deep meaning.",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
American History X," think about it...
","The buzz about this movie (as best listed on the back of the VCR packaging) describes it as a movie about 'the consequences of racism'. I actually would have to say it goes a bit further than that. Certainly, the movie revolves around racism and ethnocentrism, but I believe that functions more as an accessible vehicle to explore what virulent, phobic HATRED creates for both an individual and his community.I was living in the state of Alabama when this film came out, and it didn't play in many theatres in the local area. I always wondered if that was because the content was believed to be too strong for the populace. 'American History X' can be too strong for certain viewers, largely because it's a serious, provocative film with little comic relief. It also brazenly depicts a life experience of antagonism and conflict that may bother viewers who live a more sheltered existence.Norton's portrayal of his character is well done, playing both his hostile 'prior' character in flashbacks and his at-first-inexplicable 'post' persona with a convincing performance in both roles. Furlong's 'younger brother' character is a little more two-dimensional, being depicted largely as a 'follower' type, but that apparent weakness is necessary in order to give Norton's Derek the needed urgency to tell his story.All in all, a cerebral 'what-if' exercise in issues still confronting America today that should resonate with any thinking person.",Null,0,1,25 December 2002
