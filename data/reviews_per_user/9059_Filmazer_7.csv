The Avengers," In a classroom, 'The Avengers' is definitely an 'A' student but not necessarily the brightest or the most creative.
","If you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie, like myself, you will not be disappointed. You will exactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer, no more, no less.Every superhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertaining.The surprise here is the Hulk, whom I think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies. Accolades to Ruffalo, who did a great job with Banner. (I'm not sure if he can be as good as Ed Norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble, he's perfect and I can't say the same with Ed Norton if he is to reprise his role here.) The CGI version of this Hulk is also way better than his previous versions - rightly proportioned, just the right tone of green and with an improved face that looks just like the comic version and even a bit like Ruffalo's. Simply awesome!My gripe(s) with the movie though is with its overly simple and uninteresting main plot. Tom Hiddleston is a charming lad but alas, Loki as the lone villain against such a powerful team is simply too weak and a non-threat. Throughout the movie, I never quite felt that anyone (except perhaps Loki himself) was in any kind of serious Jeopardy. Btw, speaking of weak enemies, how about an alien army (more like a skirmish team) on hover-boards? Hmm....looks familiar....don't they work for Skeletor? Perhaps that's what the whole portal thing was about. Together, it feels just like a plot-line pulled from an episode of 'He-man and the Masters of the Universe'. Also, if the alien mother-ship can be so easily destroyed, who needs the avengers? Just launch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal, duh!Aside from that, there really isn't much else to complain, especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team more than anything. Walking out the theater, I wanted to see more, and agree with Joss Whedon when he said the sequel(s) will be smaller in scale. By that, I hope he means only the amount of CGI shots, not what is at stake or the magnitude of the catastrophe/adversary the avengers has to face, since the team bonding/friction seems to be the true strength of the franchise. (Leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please, since we have probably all seen enough of that by now.) Besides that, it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging. It will then be perfect.",8,3,8,27 April 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Stranger Tides Of Boredom
","Another disappointment and wasted opportunity in what could've been a fantastic rollicking adventure.First of all, I must say that I've always had a love/hate attitude towards the series. I love it simply because of its genre, the excellent production values, character designs and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the scale still always tilts towards 'hate' and this is why: The script for 'On Stranger Tides' is horrible. It is pure Hollywood lazy/formulaic scriptwriting with zero inventiveness. Characters are put in place just to drive the plot along, like gears inside a clock. They are lifeless and evoke no emotion. It is reflected also in the acting, as you can see quite clearly that most of the actors are just hamming it up and going through the motions to get to the end. (Apparently, the focus is on the 'end' and not the 'journey' here.) Even though I like the character Jack Sparrow, I haven't seen him in an adventure that was worth his salt. In this installment, he downright feels like a side character, as there is really nothing at stake for him other than a failed attempt at creating a past love interest whose life needs saving for stupid reasons. (Daughter of Al Swearengen turned to pirating on the high seas? c'mon!) There are too many things wrong with 'On Stranger Tides' on too many levels that if I go on it will just seem like pure whining - which isn't my motive at all. In short, nothing made any sense nor drew any of my feelings or even 'stirrings' as Jack Sparrow would like to put it.Sad to say, I wanted to like this movie. The ingredients are all there for a great adventure but somehow they messed it up. (for instance, if they had made the final minutes of the movie to be the introduction instead, it would give it much more energy and swagger.) Just my two gold coins.",5,1,1,25 May 2011
Man of Steel," The S on Superman might as well be $
","In the movie, we are told that the S stands for hope in Krypton. My question is: hope for what? What hope is there in a society where its entire population is cloned and predestined to become whatever the high council decides for them? At the end of the movie, I've decided that it simply represents hope for movie makers to milk more money out of our beloved Superhero, through ticket sales and product placements.Quite fittingly, this incarnation of Superman seems both immortal and mortal at the same time - immortal because character development is so poor and shallow that the minimal amount of human/mortal quality feels either fake or it got totally lost in the chaos of the CGI effects; and mortal because Zack Snyder was actually able to murder Superman.(I used to like Snyder, starting from the remake of The Dawn of The Dead and then 300. I did not even mind Watchmen and Sucker Punch, but his credibility as a creative director has really taken a big hit for me this time.) I wonder when big name directors can turn around and realize that the overused dark and gritty tone does not always make a movie more realistic and suited for adults. It only makes it more like video game graphics.This is by no means a horrible movie. I sat through the whole movie without much of a yawn and there were even a few 'close to memorable' moments. Unfortunately, that is about all the good things I can say about it.Simply put, there is just nothing spectacular about this movie that I can remember to recommend it.",6,2,5,27 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Still thinks the Spidey from The Electric Company is the best, lol!
","I have to start my review by saying - how many times do superhero movies have to end with a boss fight at the top of a hi-tech research tower? Geez, come on writers, write! Don't just repeat what others had done or put in scenes that ought to be there because of genre! Sorry I had to get that off my chest quickly because it had really bugged me for a while.Now onto the review......ok, maybe there isn't much else I would like to say that hasn't already been said.Good movie but not a Super movie, simply because so much of it has already been done, not just in superhero movies, but movies in general. Nerdy boy gets bullied, nerdy boy falls in love with a pretty blonde intellectual girl; finds a way to overcome growing pains, etc, etc.I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's version, and I think this one has a better visual tone that fits in better with the rest of recent Marvel entries (albeit with lamer CGI). However, I will not deny that Sam's rendition is a little more light-hearted and more fun to watch in parts than this.I have no doubt that the makers wanted to get this reboot out quickly so that they can move on to fresher stuff in sequels. And for that purpose, this is a strong enough start.Ultimately, it's still worth the cash to go see I guess, but just stay away from the 3D version! There's nothing 3D about this movie, it's a missed opportunity and a total rip-off!",7,1,4,4 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Mildly Entertaining - especially for Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans.
","I have never seen the TV series of Dark Shadows but have seen all of the movies that Tim Burton had directed (all except Ed Wood, one of TB's finest, yet don't ask me why.) Compared with his more recent movies, I would put Dark Shadows somewhere between Sweeney Todd and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory/Alice in Wonderland in terms of entertainment value and classic Tim Burton.However, I must admit that due to the poor reviews by critics, the movie's poor trailer and the memory of disappointment generated from seeing his last few movies, I went to see this one with much lowered expectations.During the first half of the movie, I was mildly entertained and was thinking:'This isn't so bad, I'm quite liking it.' Perhaps the best part was its middle, when we were treated with a montage displaying the high point of the film - when Barnabas has just been inducted into the Collins family and was seen taking charge in reviving the family to its former wealth and glory. The segment was appropriately accompanied by The Carpenters song 'Top of the World.'Unfortunately, as the name of that song suggests for us - there is only one way to go when you are at the top of the world - and hence the movie just went downhill from there on. It became neither funny nor serious, character-driven nor plot driven. It just doesn't know where to go and became quite a mess that stopped building interest for the audience. It became a personal performance reel for Johnny Depp's Barnabas.With all said, I still think the movie isn't bad, there are some endearing aspects that is hard for me to put into words. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's Tim Burton's resistance of growing up as an artist/director. The odd thing is, I don't wish for anything better despite its flaws.",6,4,9,12 May 2012
Inception," Using difficult words don't make a good book.
","I thought this was a good movie, but I also have to admit that I am a little puzzled by the buzz it generated among movie-goers.While I've enjoyed most of director Nolan's works, I found this one to be missing something. It did not captivate me as much. For a story about dreams, there's nothing in the movie that felt dream-like or creative to me. It felt mechanical and laborious.I did not understand the responsibility and work the architect has to do. There were no perplexing mazes in the dreams that I had hoped to see. The character Ellen Page played was only a plot device to lead us into Dicaprio's unresolved issues with the past, nothing more.Maybe I am not intelligent enough to fully appreciate this movie sure, just as I don't understand some reviewers with their difficult choice of expressions. But to me, some of the best books are for children.Oh, I think I know what was missing in this movie that I mentioned earlier. While trying hard to make audience wonder and calculate it just loses heart.Still a good movie but just weak at the joints it seems.",7,10,18,16 August 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Not spectacular, but still a noteworthy...
","...addition to 'The Avengers' canon of films.I recommend this movie if you are any of the below:1) You are a completist and would feel wrong to have missed an installment belonging to the Avengers series of films despite speculating that it is a filler movie made only to grab your money.2)You love to stare at Chris Hemsworth's bulging biceps.3) You love superhero movies, even if its plot is pretty standard with few or no surprises.4) You are single male and have nothing better to do.My gripes with the film may be more of a problem with Hollywood movie-making these days than with the film itself. Production feels uninspired and run of the mill. The plot, props, action, effects and gags are all neatly in place to generate just enough wonder and excitement for the average viewers so they don't fall asleep.During the movie, we are told that there are nine realms, but each one is nothing more than a snow globe when compared to the diversity of Earth. Apparently, in all the other realms, people can travel between dimensions but still fight with swords and axes. Whereas on Earth, we have all manner of weaponry but knows sh*t about the universe save a few super geniuses who like running around strip naked and whatnot.So there you have it.If none of what I've just said sounds like a major turn-off, I will say that this is good entertainment equivalent to regarding an extra value meal at Macdonald's being a good meal sometimes. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and steer clear of the movie to save yourself from having to cry about it later on the boards.",6,2,7,31 October 2013
