Blade Runner 2049," Great but didn't love it.
","One has to applaud the director and team for spending so much time on the details. It looked fabulous, sounded spectacular, and the story... well let's say I came for the ride and wasn't expecting much. Don't get me wrong I love the original movie but not so much for the story. For me it was always the theme of the movie, the visuals and the world that sparked my interests. It's the lack of further exploring that theme that was setup in the first movie that was my real disappointment. Yes, there is the whole reproduction aspect, but to be honest it could have been further explored. Also it missed some of the grit of the first movie. It looked too perfect. The acting was all right. Loved all the new actors and their parts. Harrison was alright but not great, not his fault but his part very underwritten. I did enjoy every minute of the movie, but just didn't love it as much as I would have wanted. At times it felt as they were so protective and honoring the first that they were scared to push it in new directions.",8,2,5,27 November 2017
