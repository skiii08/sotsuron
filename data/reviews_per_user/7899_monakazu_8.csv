The King's Speech," We can know the little part of history
","This is a heartfelt human drama movie. I was surprised to hear that this story is not fiction. One prime minister of The United Kingdom have heavy stammer and he is not good at speaking in front of many people. He tries hard to improve his speaking. Most people may think he will get a good way to get over his stammer and he can speak in front of citizens at the last of the movie, and I thought same thing. But It's a little bit different than we expected. Even when the story is going and the rest of movies become short, he cannot speak well. In the last scene, he succeed the speech on the radio, but he doesn't become perfect speaker. What he does is making good way of his stammer, and he does it with one wonderful Doctor. He makes good use of intervals of his words and rhythm of his speaking, and succeed the speech. It makes us realize this story is true again. In addition, the actors are excellent. Of course the acting of stammer is great, but the acting of people around the prime minister are also excellent, for example, his wife who always support him, his doctor gives him many advice. We can know one of the prime ministers have problems which everyone can have, and there are many wonderful people who support him hardly in the history.",10,0,1,26 July 2016
Life of Pi," Quiet but hot movie
","The story is fantastic. All people watch this movie with exciting, and they think about what will happen next the boy and the tiger. Most of the location of this movie is on the ship, but the situation is changing gradually and some accidents like reaching the desert island and seeing the beautiful light of shining fishes are happened, so viewers have no boring time and always care about what will happen. In addition, There are reality. During the journey oh the boy and the tiger, they make a good friendship and all viewers may have an illusion that human and wild animal can understand and share each others feeling. But at the last scene they reach the land, the tiger walk away to the forest with no looking back him at all. I like that scene so much. That tells us the fact that human and animal cannot understand each other perfectly. I think that makes the movie more real.",10,0,1,26 July 2016
The Intouchables," Beautiful
","This is an amazing movie! I think the most important thing to impress viewers in this movie is the sound. This is French movie, so the situation is Paris and of course people speak French. Most Japanese including me are not familiar with French, so French characters speak in this movie is a part of the elements which impress us strong. It sounds like music, and it tells us something which we can understand just because of we don't know French. In addition, actors facial expression is also remarkable thing for me. There are some scenes which have no dialog, only back music. In those scene, characters facial expression tells us a lot of things. And, I think the music in this movie is wonderful. The beautiful music makes us think about many things in each situation. Sound elements tells us its story so quietly, but strongly.",10,0,2,25 July 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fantastic
","This is very wonderful action movie. The most interesting point I think of this movie is 5 main characters are strangers and enemies each other at the first. But they have same purpose, and become like co-wokers, and finally they become friends. And the location is the space and many planets which don't exist in real, so the world view of this movie is so vastitude, and that make people enjoy watching. There are many elements, for example thrill and battle and friendship and so on. Especially, the friendship and teamwork of main characters are beautiful and heartfelt. During watching, I was sometimes moved my heart by their behavior to protect their friends with sacrificing themselves. This movie is of course good for people who like Marvel series and action movie, and also family can enjoy.",10,3,7,26 July 2016
Jurassic World," Reality
","I don't know Jurassic park which is the first movie of this series, but I can enjoy watching it. The genre is kind of fantasy, but there are also horror elements in this movie. At first, Jurassic world give people dreams and fun. But one accident happened and situation changes from peace to dangerous dramatically. A lot of people are killed, and those scene is hard to watch for me, but I like the reality of this movie. Human dreams to control dinosaurs and get the technology to do it. However, in the last everyone realize that human and dinosaurs cannot live together. While the story is going there are friendship between human and dinosaurs, but everything is changed at the last of the movie. I think that is so real. This movie tells us the story with reality, but also tells us friendship and love, so I like this movie.",8,2,4,26 July 2016
Les Mis√©rables," Wonderful musical movie
","This is the one of musical movies. Some people don't like musical movies, but actually, I like that. Some people says singing suddenly is very strange and I agree with that, but I don't care about that so much because the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well. In this movie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than usual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way they want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills. This movie shows a view of the Les Miserables world so well. We can enjoy everything about Les Miserables same as the play.",10,1,1,26 July 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," The life, and how to live it.
","I don't know how to say about this movie. This is the movie which tells me its theme the strongest of all movie I have ever watched. I think the theme of this movie is Living. The location is the prison where most people may lost their hopes, but people lives there spend their life in their own way. There are many problems which we don't want to recognize it is true in prison. This movie shows that there are a lot of people manage to live in such a terrible place. All People have different life, and all people live desperately and all people will die someday. The way to live is different like the life. Some people finish their life by themselves, and others try to keep their life hardly whatever happened. Nobody knows what is right and what is wrong, but one thing I'm sure is they everyone can have hopes and it doesn't make us unhappy. Having hopes can lead us to our future, even if it takes a long time. I learned those from this movie. I think the more I watch this movie the more I can learn from that, so I want to watch this movie again and again.",10,0,0,25 July 2016
Minions," Happy family movie
","When I heard that this movie is popular for adults not only children, I didn't know the reason. However, after I finished watching it, I understand why this is popular among people in wide age. The story is so simple that everyone including children can understand, but there are many elements make this movie interesting, for example dreams, hopes, friendship, loves, funny, and so on. Minions have dreams to find the worst and the strongest boss. They always do their best to make their dreams come true, and they try to get over many problems while their journey. The interesting thing I think is that we cannot understand the language minions speak hardly. Some parts of their speaking sounds like English, but others are just sounds we can expect that is their language. But we can understand what they mean as if we can know their language in each situation from their facial expression and tone of voice. That is important elements to make this movie interesting and funny. I'd like to recommend all people in all ages, not only family accompanying small children. This movie makes you laugh, exciting, and happy.",8,0,0,25 July 2016
