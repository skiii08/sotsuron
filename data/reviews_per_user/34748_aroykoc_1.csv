Hereditary," Generic flick with good acting
","The title pretty much sums it up. A dead child whose spirit haunts its grieving family and house (correction: remote mansion, it's always a remote mansion). What else? Seances w/ finger touches, candles in dimly lit sequences, sleepwalks, demons, psychics, screams etc. Exactly what you expect from your everyday supernatural horror movie, only this one comes with a very strong lead (Toni Collette) on the one hand, more than two gratuitous hours of running time on the other. Let's just say that the typical 80 mins would be just as good for this one, as neither its overlong build up nor its conclusive 'revelation' make, eventually, any difference at all.I really don't know why they keep making movies like these. I mean, you can tell that the director is talented, having crafted his scenes carefully and with vision. Why choose to channel this talent on an overplayed theme and storytelling that hasn't been able to make a difference over the last 30 years?
Rhetorical question, of course. I can only guess the an$wer.See it or don't see it. At best, you'll have just one more girl face to add in your 'little freaks from movies' list since The Exorcist. At worst, you'll finally take that oath you've always wanted to stop wasting time on interchangeable, clichÃ© filled basics that only stand out for not standing out in anything. Personally, I'm out.",5,1,4,7 November 2018
