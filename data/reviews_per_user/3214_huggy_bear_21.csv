The Blair Witch Project," If you have an imagination, watch this one; if not, leave it alone!
","I have to admit that I watched this one twice before I really came to appreciate this film for what it is.  No big stars, no big budget to work with but they still managed to pull this thing off in a big way.
If you can not picture yourself lost in the woods, cold and damp, scared of something you've come to see but hope you wouldn't, then you really shouldn't watch BWP.  You either love this one or you hate it.  I have heard both sides.  So if you haven't seen it yet, rent it, what have you got to lose?  While watching this, put yourself in Josh's or Mike's place.",7,0,2,3 February 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Great Movie
","What a great flick.  Another Spielberg classic, as well as Tom Hanks.  It is unreal that this is a true story, of how a 17 year old kid could pull something off of this magnitude.  It is kind of hard to believe that one person could fool so many people, but I guess that shows that perception is 95% of the solution.  Put on a uniform, surround yourself with gorgeous women, and you too could fool the FBI?  Great movie.  Don't pass this one up.",8,1,2,17 May 2003
Se7en," Brilliant!!!!!!
","Well acted, good thrills, just brilliant.  Not a bad thing to say about this movie.  What a true crime drama/thriller to keep you guessing.  Even when the sadistic killer is 'caught', the drama doesn't end.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Good flick.",7,1,2,18 April 2003
Insomnia," No Mork From Ork In This
","Williams at his best.  Brilliantly acted and thrilling movie.  Not only was the scenery great, but the suspense kept you in this movie till the end.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who like dramas and suspense movies.  Oh, and if you really want to see Robin Williams, check out this movie instead of One Hour Photo.",6,1,1,11 April 2003
We Were Soldiers," Good Movie
","AS always, I will keep this short and sweet.  Very good movie, well acted, well directed.  Gibson at his best.  Truly touching at some points, not all war scenes.  Points out that not only do the soldiers suffer in times of war, but the wives and children left behind also.  The scenes of the cab riding up, knowing after the first visit, what he was there for, were harrowing.  My heart went out to all the wives who had to go through with that.  Shame on our Government for that aspect of the war.",8,3,6,15 January 2003
Final Destination 2," Lots of strange ways to die!!
","If nothing else, you will see some weird ways to be killed.  I will not say anything else, other than someone had a real good imagination.  Other than that, pretty silly.  Yes, it did have it's moments, just as the first one did, but all in all, just about a carbon copy.  The layout of this has pretty much run its course by now.  I mean, how many times can you cheat the Grim Reaper?  Also, trying to keep track of the explanations of why all the deaths were happening, and who was next, just a little much.  But, not that bad of a movie.  Good entertainment.",6,0,0,13 September 2003
American Pie," Very Funny Movie
","A must see.  This has to be on of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Of course, it is a carbon copy of Porky's, but nonetheless, it was still hilarious.  It just mainly deals with teenage boys and their 'quest' for sex.  That is all it is, and all it was ever billed to be.  And it goes over great.  I admit, I was not too excited about renting this, but now I am glad that I did.  If you don't like raunchy stories about teenagers, and if you didn't like Porky's or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, don't rent it. Otherwise, if you had half a life in high school, and remember the things that you got in to, rent it and laugh your *ss off.",9,0,0,16 March 2003
Heartbreak Ridge," Good Entertainment, but Silly
","Pretty good movie, with Eastwood playing Gunny Highway, a crusty old Marine Corps. DI.  But let's leave it at that.  Just about every other scene in this is absolutely silly, just plain dumb.  I mean, I can assure you, having been there myself, that Marine Corps. training is nothing like depicted in this movie.  Recruits falling out in formation with wild ass looking hair and earrings?  Yeah, right!  But, hey it was 1986, what do you expect?",6,1,3,20 September 2003
Spider-Man," Great!!!
","I loved this movie.  Simple and to the point.  My favorite, the Green Goblin!!  The action scenes were great, and I have to say, I would see this one again.  Dafoe did a great job as the Goblin, and the special effects were outstanding.  Better than Batman, by far.",8,1,1,17 January 2003
The Fast and the Furious," This movie sucks!!!!!!!
","Real quick here, this is pure crap.  I haven't seen anything this bad in quite a while.  The acting was a joke, there was no plot to this testosterone nightmare, and frankly, if action is what you're craving, then by all means, see 'The Matrix' or 'Last Man Standing', but steer clear of this mess.",2,1,3,21 February 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Cheesey but Fun!
","Great acting all about this movie, just finding one part of it believable is the trouble.  Yeah, I know, it's only entertainment, but hey, at least some of it can be believable.  To say that anyone could talk eleven people into robbing a casino without telling anyone is highly unlikely.  But I have to admit, it was a fun movie to watch.  Nice to see the underdog come out ahead.  I would recommend this.",5,0,1,21 October 2003
28 Days Later...," Good....but could've been better
","Started off with a bang, but slowly receded into this long, drawn out trek through England to find survivors of the 'infected'.  Actually, not all that bad.  There were suspenseful scenes here and there, just not enough of them. I really was expecting this one to be rather dull, but fortunately, it was a pleasant surprise.  Don't expect a lot of good fx, just well acted and the scenery was terrific.  Real dark and gloomy, reminded me of the original 'Night of the Living Dead'.",6,0,0,27 August 2003
Event Horizon," Pretty Good Sci-Fi Flick
","Not a bad watch for a late saturday night.  This one had its share of thrills and twists, but I have to admit it did get a little stupid towards the end.  Pretty good special effects and the acting was good also.  You can see the comparison though to the Alien series, but who cares.",6,0,2,27 September 2003
The Evil Dead," Great Horror Movie
","This is one of the classic horror films ever, not only of the '80's.  The effects were second to none, and the movie is damn scarey.  To have a film this good done on a shoe string budget in the early '80's is pretty damn good.  This is one that you should watch if you are a horror movie buff.  I will have to admit, the first time I saw this (1985), I couldn't sleep well that night.  This is one that all horror films should be judged by.  I have seen way worse so called horror movies made on a much larger budget that just really sucked!!!  Word to the wise here, do not rent the sequels, they are horrible, not scarey at all.  They turned this classic into a comedy in the sequels.  Ain't that a shame!",7,0,1,27 January 2003
Halloween," The best, bar-none!!!!!
","I first seen this movie when I was eleven years old, and I've watched it I bet over twenty times since. Just a classic horror movie, with superb acting and a great story line.  Not your average blood and guts you see today, but so much suspense, and the music just curls your toes.  The closet scene at the end of the movie was the best!  If by some reason, you have not seen this movie, rent it now.  If you are a horror movie buff, it is a must see. Forget the Friday the 13th jokes, this one is the original.  Forget Jason, Michael is the man!!",9,0,0,7 February 2002
Tombstone," A Must See
","You have to see this one.  Kurt Russell is at his best, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday gives one hell of a performance.  This is one of the best movies ever.  There is enough action throughout to keep anyone satisfied. The all star cast is second to none.  The chemistry between Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is great, and the flow of the movie never slows down.  This is one you have to see, no doubt about it.  Best movie ever, hands down!!!",9,8,12,27 January 2003
Signs," A+.....Would watch it again.
","I have to admit, I was really skeptical about this one, but I rented it and loved every minute of it.  I'm no science-fiction buff, but the suspense and the acting were superb.  Never will I bore anyone here and go over every single scene of the movie, but I will say that hey, if you have an imagination, rent it.  If you are one of those 'prudes' where everything has to be perfect, stay away.  This is good entertainment, and I would recommend this to anyone.  Oh, by the way, the people who bash this film, well they probably would rather watch Yentl....go figure!!!!!!!!!!",8,0,1,23 January 2003
Identity," What a STUPID Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I agree with Crawl_1 100%!!  What a gigantic waste of time.  This one started off really good, but trailed off rather quickly.  There was some good thrills here, but come on, after a while and continuously seeing those damn red room keys showing up, it gets a little rediculous!!  And the ending, absolutely the worst ending I have ever seen!!  STUPID!!  Just the whole consept of what this movie was trying to portray......oh, nevermind, I will just stop right here.",3,1,4,7 September 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Something a Little Different
","As this was the first of many 'Freddy' movies, it was great at the time (1984), a new type of horror movie that had a fresh new idea.  By far the best of all the laughable follow-ups, and a classic you have to see.  The ending is a little weird, but that is what kept this movie from being so predictable, unlike the other '80's slasher horror movies. A true horror classic.  A must see!",7,0,0,17 January 2003
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Absolutely Dreadful
","This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  Oprah, you have got to be kidding!!!!  So bad, I fell asleep watching it. Great cast, with Cruise and Pitt, not to mention Christian Slater, but God please, to push this as a horror movie?  Wish I could comment a little more on this one, but I'll save my energy for another time!",1,12,36,3 February 2002
Evil Dead II," Don't waste your time
","I'll keep this short and sweet....if you are a TRUE horror fan, don't waste your time nor money on this sequel.  The first Evil Dead is a classic, this sequel was, well, like watching Married with Children.  Horror mixed with humor does not work.  I mean, the wasted time in this flick on the possessed hand that he cant escape from?  Too much.  Definitely not a horror movie.",4,1,5,14 January 2003
