Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," waste of time
","If I could write this in one line, it would be a sentence about the waste of time and money to see this movie, and that Sascha should pay us to watch this. The mean and demeaning aspects of the film have no artistic value and little entertainment value. His playing dumb to trick and exploit people is inexcusable. Furthermore his lying about there being no script when Pamela Anderson appears in the movie adds a bigger black mark to his credibility. How some women rated this so highly is mind boggling, and perhaps those women should re-evaluate this terrible movie.While there may have been worse movies to watch. This one is also insulting and demeaning. We talk about world peace and tolerance, and this movie advocates exactly the opposite.",1,1,4,8 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Lack of continuity spoiled the film
","While the film got my attention, its 'pulp fiction' level of violence and extreme evilness made it difficult to find of high cinematic achievement. Its lack of continuity and requirement of reading between scenes also made it difficult to watch. For example the near encounter of Sheriff Bell and Chigur at the motel was as unrealistic as Chigur being hired to find the money. The lack of an ending with Chigur seems intentional so that a sequel of more gratuitous violence and gore will be pushed on to the public. While film makers should have the creative license to make the movies they want, members of the audience also have the right to not see films of extreme violence and evil that have little cinematic value. I will not pay to see the sequel.",4,4,9,24 March 2008
