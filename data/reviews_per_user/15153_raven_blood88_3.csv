Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm at a loss for words...
","Wow. What was Lucas thinking? First off, the acting is wooden and boring, especially the kid who plays lil Darth Vader. I swear, they could have just painted a face on a plank of wood and stuck hair on top of it and it probably would've acted better. None of the other characters is even remotely interesting. And Jar Jar Poopforbrains was a waste of time and brain cells. Darth Maul was a pointless villain who had about ten minutes of screen time.The story of lil Vader's birth was disgusting, and an insult to all Christians at best. (I know there was a lot of that in the originals, but it was more subtle.) I almost puked when she claimed she was 'immaculately conceived'. Please. Let's refrain from insulting Jesus and Mary. Thanks.The 'love' scenes with Vader and Padme were so boring. Natalie Portman at least acted like she might've had feelings for 'Annie'. But as for him, he might as well have just not said anything. His lines were stupid and his acting (as I shall stress again) was the worst I've seen from a child actor in my entire life.They seriously should have stuck with 'Planky Mc-Two-by-Four' for 'Annie'. Or maybe they could've gotten Haley Joel Osment to play lil Vader at least. At least that kid can act. I really think that Lucas was just lazy and didn't care.Laughable at best. 1 out of 10. (I'd give it a zero, but IMDb's too generous.)",1,1,3,28 September 2006
Nacho Libre," Vulgar, at best...
","I watched this film at a friendly get-together after we voted which of our various films we should watch. As the film began, I knew this was going to be bad news. However, I swallowed back politely, and endured this agony. (*Possible spoilers*) First off, this film slams and makes fun of the Catholic Church so much, it almost made me (a very devout Catholic) want to puke. Nacho is the worst and most exaggerated bad Catholic monk I have ever seen. From his whole destroying rosaries and various other religious objects to make his lucha costume, to his flirting *EWW* with the local nun. (Did the director even grasp that monks and nuns do not flirt, and remain celibate?) Why didn't they just make them 'in training to be celibate religious people', then the relationship could have worked? Oh, but wait! I keep forgetting. That would have been the smart thing to do.The rest of the film consists of forgettable farting and potty humor, which isn't even remotely funny. I don't know about you, but seeing Jack Black's beer gut and butt crack are not my idea of a good time. I swear, this film should not have as high a rating as it does. Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Catholic. Who knows? But I can guarantee, even if I wasn't Catholic, I probably still would have hated this. 1/10. (I'd give a zero, but sadly that's not an option here.)",1,2,5,29 August 2008
Aladdin," A Disney Triumph.
","Ever since I was a little girl, I always remembered loving the Disney movie, 'Aladdin'.It brings the classic 'boy-finds-lamp' tale, and transforms it into a stunning animated success. With a wonderful score, and a cast of some of Disney's most beloved characters, 'Aladdin' is a hit for the whole family.+ SPOILER ALERT + The hero of our story is, (natch) Aladdin, a poor orphan who yearns for the life of a rich man. After a wicked alchemist named Jafar - who seeks nothing but power - tricks Aladdin into getting a Genie's lamp out of the 'Cave of Wonders' (for his own selfish benefit); his plans go awry, and Aladdin winds up keeping the Genie (played by the brilliant Robin Williams).Trying to win the heart of the beautiful Princess Jasmine, Aladdin asks the Genie to make him a wealthy youth named, 'Prince Ali'. With the Genie's help, Aladdin becomes a hit, and everyone likes him (except Jafar).As the story unfolds, Aladdin discovers that Jafar has stolen the lamp and had been using it to gain the Sultan's power. But our hero stops the evil man, and brings peace to the kingdom. But he also wins the hand of the Princess, in marriage.10 out of 10 for this one. It's a must have for Disney lovers, young and old.",10,1,2,24 June 2006
