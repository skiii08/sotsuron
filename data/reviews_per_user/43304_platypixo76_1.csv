The Ring," Scary!
","I saw this alone, at night, and it was a bad idea. The movie was meant to scare, and it did an excellent job. From the opening scene to the horrifying finale, I was absolutely, 100% terrified. The movie starts off innocently enough, with two girls, Katie and Rebecca, watching TV and talking aimlessly. However, the conversation soon turns to the 'cursed' tape that Katie had seen last weekend. Both girls laugh it off, but there is still a heavy tension in the air. A series of disturbing things begin happening, such as the TV downstairs turning on and off by itself. Katie is killed, and Rebecca, after witnessing the horrible death, is sent to a mental hospital. The rest of the movie goes on show how Rachel, Katie's aunt, unravels the mystery behind the strange tape.The plot line is interesting, and the scares were genuine.I have never seen the original Ringu, so I can't compare it to that, but all on its own, this movie was pretty good. Just don't watch it alone at night!Overall, 7/10.",7,1,2,26 September 2009
