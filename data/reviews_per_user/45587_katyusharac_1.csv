Come and See," Best movie ever made about WW2
","First of all, Come and See explains the violence and cruelty of War never falling to agitation or exaggeration. Film shows what had happened during WW2 with all of its reality. It is worth to see violence and inhumanity of Germans (not Nazis) and sense of humor of Russians. It is very ironic finding an empty vodka bottle in the forest. Film is only reason why I am hating Germans.Come and See is better than Saving Private Ryan. Acting of Aleksei Kravchenko is legendary.I felt myself as I was living in Belarus during WW2 which was invaded by Germans. It is the director's ability. It is very disappointing that babies being killed could not have find chance of living.",10,3,4,24 November 2009
