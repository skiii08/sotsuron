Ali," Boring and exaggerated
","Nope, Will Smith can't play Ali.  Nice try though.  He almost had it at the Press conference scene.  But, the exagerrated scenes ill-behoove the Ali legend.  If you want to see the true Ali, watch WHEN WE WERE KINGS.  Best Boxing Documentary of this century.",5,0,0,22 November 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Best...comedy...ever
","When this movie was recommended to me as 'funnier than the Holy Grail', I laughed. Just to prove this person wrong I bought a copy on DVD for $9 and watched it as I called in sick from work. This movie was hilarious. The humor will have you rolling on the floor in fits of hysteria. It's like a snakebite. It creeps up on you until you're on the floor dying. All the Python members are beyond comedic. Of course, you have to recommend Pontius Pilate, Reg, and Mandy. But the list is too long to even recite. Words can't express how funny this movie is. Just see it. It's the best Monty Python movie that they made and they made some great ones. ('Camelot...it's only a model')Just remember, if you're punished by crucifixion, it could be worse.",10,1,4,15 October 2004
Fight Club," Incredible movie about life, fighting, and masculinity/femininity
","Fight Club's simple title, aptly chosen by the author, betrays the extremely relevant tones that the film conveys. The film, one of the better adapted movies from a novel, offers social commentaries so scathing and obvious that they will most likely force you to reconsider your daily routine and lifestyle.Possible spoilers.The movie's main character, quite appropriately, has no name. He is instead referred to by the pseudonyms that he provides while crashing various self-help groups. His motive for doing so, insomnia, serves as the focal point for the film's plot. The narrator/main character, while seemingly asleep, actually becomes the founder of a national organization of everyday people who defy society in multiple ways: picking fights with innocent people, setting up underground fight clubs, and even destruction of corporate symbols. The main goal of the film is to take society's clichés and stereotypes and reexamine them, hoping to decipher the truth about why we have so quickly and wholeheartedly embraced them. The places this movie takes you will shock and astonish you in several ways. The plot is only increased by the perfectly appropriate and understated performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, respectively. One movie that everyone should watch once before they die.10/10",10,6,13,26 November 2004
Terminator Salvation," Terminator 4: The Legend of Marcus Wright
","I enjoyed Terminator: Salvation for what is was: an exciting, decently-acted (could have actually been better, in my opinion, considering the quality of actors that are Christian Bale and Sam Worthington), action-filled Terminator movie. While not as enjoyable as T2, Terminator: Salvation tells an intriguing story that draws on elements of the first 2 Terminator movies stylishly.The most intriguing aspect of 'Salvation' is the story it tells of Marcus Wright, a convicted murderer who is given a second chance at redemption. Marcus Wright's subtly powerful performance (well, not so subtle at some points, but overall...) is the best thing about the movie. Recommended for fans of the action genre, and extremely recommended for fans of the Terminator series of movies. This movie far exceeds T3 in every aspect.",7,0,1,30 January 2010
Watchmen," A completely faithful superhero movie for adults
","Watchmen is one of the greatest novels I have ever read, certainly one of the greatest Graphic Novels in the history of the genre (personally, I think From Hell may have been the superior work by the author, but that's neither here nor there). From the moment I first read this inspired piece of literature, I imagined the Watchmen Movie. I heard the characters voices, Rorshach staring down the surrounding inmates at Sing-Sing prison, while declaring 'None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. You're all locked up in here with me!' Dr. Manhattan monotonely asking Laurie Jupiter/Juspeczyk 'Why should I save a world I no longer have any stake in?' Dan Dreiberg absent-mindedly reminiscing about past battles with ally Rorshach: 'Those were great times, huh Rorshach? Whatever happened to them', and the simple and callous reply from his old friend as he walks away: 'You quit'.I would hear these voices, but I resigned myself to the fact that Watchmen was, as Alan Moore has said, unfilmable. The superheroes are made up for this one particular story, based on golden and silver-age heroes that most of the Spider-Man/X-Men movie-going crowd has never heard of. The story is awash in brutality, sex, philosophy...and there is no catharsis; no simple solution to humanity's problems at the end. The real enemy is not a purse-snatch or a 'serial supervillian' that can be defeated through superior fighting skill, but rather the ever-growing spectre of nuclear destruction. The enemy in Watchmen is the complete and utter destruction of the human race! What role can a costumed vigilante possibly play in such a scenario? And how can this be made into a live-action movie?!?! The brilliant Zack Snyder has answered these questions for me, and turned me into a lifelong fan and admirer for the faithful, classy, stylish, and overall brilliant way he has brought Watchmen to the movie screen. This is a movie with tons of heart, and you can feel the love in each and every scene. Snyder's passion for the source material is evident in each frame, each action scene, each line of dialogue. The characters sound like I imagined they would sound, and they look the way that Dave Gibbons drew them. From the god-like Dr. Manhattan, to the uncompromising (in every sense of the word) Rorshach, to the beautiful Silk Spectre, I may have never seen a truer translation of a graphic novel, at least not since Sin City.Bravo and congratulations to Zack Snyder for not dumbing down a complex and sophisticated graphic novel to satisfy mainstream audiences. And though the ending, and the main villain's plan was slightly different than in the original graphic novel, the outcome and effect was the same.Bottom line: This is the best that anyone could have possibly done in creating a Watchmen movie. I would not have changed a thing. Well, other than make the film run 5 hours. But that might be pushing it.",10,1,8,6 March 2009
Gandhi," Perfect performance by Kingsley
","Gandhi is not a perfect movie.Far from it.  Cliches are multiple.  Story, despite being based on historical events, is nevertheless predictable.  The use of background is hardly original.  However, the movie is still entertaining on its own merits.  Richard Attenborough did a very good, if not great, directing job. 
What forces me to give this movie a 10/10 is one man:  Kingsley.  In his impassioned, restrained, and accurate portrayal of one of the most amazing men who ever lived, Kingsley, a relative unknown at the time, provides one of the most awe-inspiring performances that I have ever had the privilege to see, and most likely ever will see.  I recently read a post for this movie that stated that the viewer will forget that he is observing an actor portraying Gandhi and believe that he is viewing the Mahatma himself.  This is entirely accurate.  Ben Kingsley plays the Mahatma Gandhi with such heart and emotion that I, just for a second, found myself believing that I was watching a documentary.With his portrayal of Gandhi, Ben Kingsley has placed himself, along with Marlon Brando in the Godfather, Roberto Beignini in Life is Beautiful, Liam Neeson in Schindler's List, Bogart in Casablanca, Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, upon a pedestal reserved only for the most magnificent actors ever to grace the screen with their presence.  I honestly believe that Kingsley may have provided the greatest performance ever seen in any movie. If that does not merit a 10/10, I don't know what does.",10,7,14,4 June 2004
Batman Begins," I'm forced to give this movie a '10'
","While Batman Begins is not a perfect movie, it is the closest the Batman franchise has ever come to touching and translating the should and essence of what is truly Batman: his character, his psyche, his passion, and his rage.'Batman Begins' is, as most know, the story of Bruce Wayne, not Batman. This is an ironic statement however, because as the movie transitions it becomes clear that Bruce Wayne is in fact the mask. Batman is what Bruce Wayne became the moment that his parents were shot. Rather than possessing a focus for his rage as in the first 'Batman', Batman is forced to take his vengeance upon the general criminal element in Gotham City.'batman Begins' captures the essence of the character in rare fashion. When the movie ended, I clapped...and I haven't done that for a while.",10,0,1,5 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," Excellent comic performances
","What sets 'Meet the Fockers' above the level of standard comic shtick is the wonderful original performances of Hoffman, Streisand, and De Niro (and De Niro's wife as well, her name escapes me). Hoffman and Streisand completely sell the role of Gaylord Focker's parents. Hoffman in particular is brilliant. He brilliantly conveys the sensitivity, quirkiness and eccentricity that must be inherent in two people who would bestow the moniker 'Gaylord Focker' upon their son.Possible spoilers...Hoffman's ex-attorney turned stay-at-home father completely fits his comic persona, while Streisand is hilarious as a sex-therapist without going completely over the edge. 'Meet the Fockers' is, as its name implies, mostly centered on Gaylord's parents, but Robert De Niro delivers one of the best comic performances of his career as the deadpan, overly serious, control-freak father of Gaylord's fiancé. Suffice it to say, the story itself is not all that spectacular, but the director wisely allows the characters to dictate the comic element of the movie. Good job. I was laughing at every word that came out of Hoffman's mouth.",8,1,7,24 December 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Fraught with irony, tragedy, and Hanks
","Possible spoilers ahead...Saving Private Ryan is a movie about World War II.  In this it is not original.  Hundreds or perhaps thousands of films have been made about this subject.  What makes this film stand out besides the magnificent acting of Tom Hanks (possibly his best role, and that's saying a lot) is the film's plot.  A dozen men risk their life and put service to their country on hold in order to retreive a single officer.  Not one that is crucial to the war effort, indeed, not one that is even in enemy hands.  Just one that is the last surviving son of a mother that has lost all her children in the war. The irony and contradictions of a dozen men risking their lives to locate and retreive a single officer is almost paralyzing, and surely secures Speilberg's masterpiece a place, in my opinion, among the finest movies ever made.  Everything about this movie is spectacular, from the acting to the effects, to the dramatic qualities.  Possibly the finest of all the World War II films ever made.",10,2,3,14 April 2004
Schindler's List," My God
","Possible spoilers:I just finished this movie.  I was touched not by the graphic displays of violence and murder, but by the humanity displayed in the face of monstrosities too horrible to even consider.  Possibly the most moving film I have ever seen.  I'm sure that the film takes liberties, but the truly frightening thing is that I am sure that they are few and far between.  The scene in the showers may have been the most horrific moment I have ever witnessed in cinema.  The violence is so hideous and dehumanizing that it puts the displays of kindness in a unique perspective.  The scene on the trains, where Schindler provides water is one example.  I knew precisely what to expect from this movie.  What I did not expect was the portrait of kindness and humanity that it provides.  Everyone in the world should watch this movie at least once.",10,9,13,12 May 2004
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Very good! Much better than the original.
","I didn't think much of the original FF, but this one is far better in every aspect. Better writing, more exciting storyline, and better acting, as well. The special effects are amazing, as everyone can probably already tell from the previews, particularly the Silver Surfer. His scenes were incredible.I laughed quite a bit at this movie, surprisingly, as I didn't find the last one very funny. The humor in this movie was a little more mature, particularly when Johnny Storm is asking Ben Grimm about how he and his girlfriend have 'relations (which is something I always wondered as well).' My favorite scenes were the ones in which Ben and Johnny interacted, as Michael Chiklis' Thing is my favorite character to watch. He really captured the spirit of the comic in both appearance and attitude.There are many things to like about FF: ROSS, just don't expect Shakespeare, or even deep comic book movies like Batman Begins or X-Men. This movie is rated PG, and rightfully so. While there are mature moments, FF is at heart a movie for younger people.The reason that I gave this movie a 6, despite my seemingly high praise of it, is the ending/last 15-20 minutes. While not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this movie, the ending definitely rubbed me the wrong way, particularly as a comic book fan. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into detail. But it's easy to see how the producers painted themselves into a corner by needing an easy way to finish a movie that could potentially have an extremely vast scope.Bottom line: if you're a FF fan, or just a comic book fan in general, this is one that you won't want to miss. Just, like I said, don't go in expecting to think deep thoughts.",6,5,8,20 June 2007
The Untouchables," Very De Palma
","One thing I really like about Brian De Palma is that he'll sacrifice cold realism for artistic and creative pleasure. There are lots of cool things going on in the Untouchables, both visually and verbally. All the actors do a very good job, but the standout (as he usually is) is Sean Connery. Every second that he was on screen made this movie more thrilling and enjoyable. Highlights for me: spoiler warning Kevin Costner throwing Frank Nitti off the building, the horses in Canada, and Sean Connery's death scene: one of the most touching scenes I've seen in movies.Excellent movie, on several levels.",9,1,2,24 April 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Mediocre movie, fantastic ending
","If not for the brilliance of the ending, I would have rated this move a 5 instead of a 7.Spoiler--The ending with Sofia getting shot was kind of subpar, but what came after it was breathtaking.  Pacino's silent scream and the expression on Diane Keaton's face was great, but the true artistry came afterwards.  The flashbacks of Pacino dancing with Appolonia, Kay, and Mary suggest that Michael, for all his strength and self-sacrifice to ensure the safety of his family, has lost all the women in his life.  Essentially, his whole life has meant nothing because he has lost everything he has ever loved.  Then, the death scene was shattering.  Michael, great man that he was, ends up dying alone and blind with only a small animal to witness his passing.  And the music playing throughout this last scene, magnifico!Possibly the greatest and most moving ending I have ever seen in any movie. Just a shame that the film itself couldn't live up to it.",7,0,2,16 November 2003
Platoon," Great Oliver Stone movie about Vietnam
","I saw this about 29 years after it came out. I have to say that I've seen lots of Vietnam movies and this one, though slightly pretentious at times, qualifies as one of the top 4-5. Scholars researching Oliver Stone 30 years from now should definitely look at Platoon as being the rare vehicle that brings the best out of a skilled director.Platoon has a message to get across, and it indeed does; it beats you over the head with the message. You accept it though, because the tone of the voice delivering the message is so strong and powerful. You watch this movie like you watch a drunk driver whose crash is inevitable on the freeway.Anyway, the coolest thing about this movie is that Charlie Sheen virtually mirrors his father's performance from Apocalypse Now. Same theme, same story arc-both brought out beautifully in what may be Charlie Sheen's finest performance in film (it was all downhill from here). It's basically been a story told before...Charlie Sheen's character, Chris, comes to Vietnam wide eyed and idealistic, but the war turns him. That's all you really need to know about this movie. So watch the movie if you like movies of this genre.",10,1,2,1 June 2006
Thirteen Days," Excellent
","Fraught with tension, this movie contains great performances from Costner and Greenwood that really let you feel the strain and pressure that's coming down on them.  Put yourself in that situation and you'll find yourself acting no different than they would.  Great plot, great acting, a much overlooked winner.",9,1,1,16 November 2003
The Godfather," Greatest ever
","Simply the best movie I have ever seen.  I saw this movie as a pre-teen and have fallen more in love with it every time I've seen it since.  Something about the perfection of each performance along with the dialogue, I dunno...it's just perfect.  Coppola's (and Robert Evans') legacy.",10,0,2,16 November 2003
