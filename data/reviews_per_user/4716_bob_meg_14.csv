The Blair Witch Project," ...And if it were released today, people would hate it even more
","How you'll respond to The Blair Witch Project depends on two factors, really. Firstly, if you like your horror movies filled with jump in your seat shocks, tangible glow-in-the-dark monsters, etc...this film is not for you. Also, if you missed it in 1999-2000 as the rock you were under was a tad too cozy, you'll find it to your benefit.That's because, without overstatement, TBWP is really a publicity stunt wrapped around an urban legend. To say that it's 'of its time' is a massive understatement, and Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have got to be two of the luckiest punks to ever stagger down a pike --- the movie's marketing campaign, based around the at-the-time newly 'hot' Internet phenom was packed with more elaborate detail and nuance than was the film.No, what really sells TBWP and makes it somehow work are the performances of the three principals (Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams). They completely sell their snide cut-ups, bitch-biting arguments, and escalating tension and fear very well, and, believe me, they had very little to work with.Although the filmmakers do an OK job at constructing creepy tableaux, it's only the reactions of the actors that send it home. There are absolutely NO effects here --- just three young people running for their lives, holding cameras. If they didn't do so good a job, it's doubtful so many people would have been fooled the first time around.In ten years, audiences have gotten even more ADD-texting-Twittering crazed and the simple atmospherics of creep don't cut it. Personally, I prefer more psychological horror films, and TBWP takes a nicely creepy story (with some truly unsettling details) and realizes it in a nicely chilly, uncomfortably eerie backdrop. There's a lot to like, if you look.",10,1,2,2 July 2011
The Babadook," Blowing down the house
","There is very little more horrific than real life, and Jennifer Kent's first feature, The Babadook, proves it.Amelia (Essie Davis, in a tour-de-force performance) would have a hard time of it even without seven-year-old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) to constantly keep from trouble. And Sam's not exactly some mischievous little scamp --- he plays with dart guns at school, assaults other kids, and throws around firecrackers like confetti. He makes the titular terror from 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' look like a total pussy.And Amelia's not exactly mother-of-the-year. You can practically see the monster within her many times in the early part of the film, gnashing to escape the prison her deceased husband's confined her to, after he died in a car crash while taking Amelia to the hospital to deliver Sam. This is a risky, potent set-up that Kent could have only realized solo (with her Kickstarter and other funding, of course). Both mom and son are so pitifully unlikable (and realistic) that no big studio would come near this concept.Yet Kent makes it work constantly, due to the strength she imbues in every frame --- from the acting, to the at times beautiful chiaroscuro lighting, to the creepy sound mix, ominous visuals (which are just puppets, but damn good ones), and camera tricks that would make Hitchcock and Welles look twice. it really is a fantastically made film for any budget.But it's the emotional tension that Davis and Wiseman bring in truckloads that keeps you riveted, more than any cardboard bogeyman. The Babadook contains some really disturbing sequences, not the least of which is brought to life by superb graphics designer Alex Juhasz's ghoulish 'children's book' that features mom strangling son to death just before slashing her own throat. Yes, it's that strong and that effective, at times recalling Friedkin's The Exorcist in it's shock value.As many other reviewers have noted, The Babadook is much more richly dimensioned than a cheapo monster movie. It's got enough allegory and symbolism to keep a Sociology class busy for a semester. It'll more than keep you hypnotized for ninety odd minutes.",10,3,8,17 November 2015
Orphan," The Bad Seed remade for the not-so-bright
","Bad Seed movies have to walk a thin line in order to work their magic. They have to derive their suspense from the creeping evil of its antagonist. Obviousness turns them into any other slasher killer, but far more ludicrous due to their stature.In 'Orphan,' suspense doesn't creep, it slashes, slices, dices, and mutilates with lightning speed, giving little regard to character development and following cribbed story lines that anyone who has seen a handful of movies will see telegraphed like a beacon.The writing is beyond slovenly --- the protagonists (Farmiga and Saarsgard --- Farmiga reprising the role of the hysterical bad seed mom from 'Joshua,' to ill effect here; Saarsgard looking bored out of his mind) are such boneheads that they have sex in the kitchen with their kids in the house, leave firearms lying around in under-secured locations, and drive 90 miles an hour down icy roads while chatting on their cell phones.The titular orphan isn't much more believable. She should be wearing a ghost face or Mike Myers mask or a goalie mask --- it would suit her character far better. Psychos this psycho just aren't scary without a little more style in their stalk.Oh, but there is that BIG SECRET!!! WOW! Actually folks, it's not a secret, it's what writers do when they've written themselves into a corner or don't want to look like too blatant a plagiarizer: they invent some dumb-a** totally implausible explanation at the last minute.This big-budget Warner production has fix-up job plastered all over it, like it was some foreign garage-sale production they bought for cheap and tried to doll up like an underage hooker --- but only someone who hadn't seen a horror picture before (or was under 13 --- more than likely the target audience) could keep their attention during this one.If you want to have a few questions in your head to keep your brain functioning, try 'Joshua' --- it's realistic, creepy, and doesn't outline every plot point for you in black-light ink 40 feet high. Oohhh, that black light...CREEPY!!",2,13,24,30 October 2009
The Town," Now THAT's how you make a cops n robbers flick folks!
","I was one of the very few people disappointed by 'The Departed.' Being in the Boston area, folks here can spot fake accents a mile away, and on top of that annoying gaffe, much of the movie seemed too stylized and hyperbolized for its own good. It was Cops n Robbers as HIGH DRAMA, a film that tried to achieve the operatic tone and scale of The Godfather but just wound up feeling cheap in the end.It needed the gritty, unadorned performances and look that director/actor Ben Affleck has somehow managed to score in spades with 'The Town.' Much of the film's punch rides on the performances: Affleck has never been less self-absorbed and never more absorbed in his character, a master bank robber whose increasing self-disgust finally finds a well-needed escape valve in the form of pretty bank manager Rebecca Hall. Now if only he hadn't taken her hostage in his last job....Perhaps even more powerful are the drop-dead notes struck by Jeremy Renner, as Affleck's hard-case brother, Pete Postelthwaite as a dirt-bag local numbers runner, and Chris Cooper in a died-in-the-wool performance that is chilling for its brief on screen time. Even Jon Hamm knocks it out of the park as a G-man whose hatred for Affleck's crew courses through his body like motor oil through a piston. Seriously, Affleck is getting to be the Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford of Actor's Equity --- one phone call from him and the A Team shows up at his doorstep. It's all good.What makes 'The Town' most memorable though, are its action sequences, masterfully shot by Robert Elswitt. Make no mistake, shooting a car chase in Cambridge is about as easy as parking your car there in daylight hours, only a tad more deadly. It's not photographed showily, just effectively, and you can say that about almost every other element of this film.It's a throw-back to when Heist movies were about the basics --- simple, violent realism. And that was enough. It hearkens back to the days of Cagney and Bogart, instead of Nicholson and Walhberg.",9,0,1,13 January 2011
Gone Baby Gone," Expecting a dull police procedural? Think again.
","Kidnapped girl. White trash parents. Rookie detective/cop looking to redeem him/herself. Seedy underworld. Yada Yada.That's what I thought going into this. I should have known better when I knew quite well that the script is based on a book by Dennis Lehane, a Boston-based writer that I've come to really admire the last few years from works like 'Coronado' and 'Mystic River.' Like 'River,' 'Gone Baby Gone' delivers a fairly realistic portrait of working class Beantown, layered with characters that while on the surface seem a little hacked from the same template, reveal layer after layer of gray, never making you feel very good about them or about yourself by comparison.I really admired two things about this film. First, the way it takes you down one path so sincerely, really involving you in a story, then just dead-ends. You look at the clock going...'Uh, right...there's an HOUR left in the movie.' Then you start down another, much shorter, corridor...and it dead-ends too. Then you start the final act, which takes you in another direction entirely, though in retrospect it ties everything else up and --- for me --- creates a satisfying denouement.I know many people will take issue with that, but that's the second thing I like about the film's story. It has a strong moral center. It really challenges you to take your emotion out of your judgments and view right and wrong for what they are. I don't want to say any more, as I know if I had known more about the plot, this movie wouldn't have been even remotely as enjoyable. It's a good ride.The casting is knock-out. You get an exceptionally strong break-out perf from Casey Affleck, who I had only seen in smaller supporting roles prior to this (with the exception of 'Gerry') and not what you expect from veteran character actors like Amy Madigan, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman (which really surprises me), and John Ashton, who's always wonderful, and whom we still see far too little of.",9,0,0,27 November 2009
Insidious," Best haunted house film in years, just OK on the demonic possession front
","There's a scene in 'Star 80' where a hooker tells john Paul Schneider (Eric Roberts) why, despite his coarseness and unattractiveness, he's got to be her best lover. 'Honey, you just plain...try harder,' she laughs. One could say the same about James Wan's films. Though sometimes falling a bit flat in their morass of fantastical elements or dissolving a bit too quickly in their frenetic camera-work, you can't deny the heart and energy he injects into his movies. It they're failures, they're not from a lack of trying.While 'Insidious' is most definitely not a failure --- it's actually the creepiest haunted house movie I've seen in maybe thirty years --- it suffers from the More is Too Much curse of much modern horror, at least in the demonic possession realm.What keeps it going, and ultimately wins us over, is the acting and the brilliant casting choices. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are usually good in whatever they do, but they're spot on here as a clueless couple whose son falls victim to a mysterious coma (or so they think). In trying to find some solution to not only their son's sinister 'illness' and to the havoc that plagues not one, but two, houses they attempt to start a life in, they bring in ghost hunter Lin Shaye and her two assistants, one played by Wan partner and (once again) screenwriter Leigh Whanell. Shay is exceptional and Barbara Hershey continues her run of good, believable supporting work since 'Black Swan.'Wan's pacing and shot set-ups are craftily constructed, devilishly executed, and the use of the discordant piano chords ('Black Christmas' anyone?) is surprisingly effective. The problems come when the demons get a bit too 'visible' and therefore lose a lot of their shock value. There's a bit toward the end, however, where several wax-looking figures pop up that makes you rethink that rationale...there's something in this sequence that's creepy in the extreme, but it doesn't last long.The demonic possession aspect of the film was an unfortunate combo of chestnuts I've heard before, and an overly complex explanation...it didn't do much for me and explained too much about too little. I'd have been more curious about the apparent homicides that seem to have taken place in one of the houses, though this is never expounded upon.Whatever the details prove out or don't, the overall effect of the movie is unsettling, and while I'd have preferred a bit more atmospherics, what we get is still far and away better than the usual pappy crappy pablum of films like 'The Haunting in Connecticut.'",7,0,1,17 July 2011
Pawn Sacrifice," Take my pawn. Take my king. Just end it.... Please!
","Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Tobey hater. He's no Olivier but when there's something to bring, he brings it. That something, unfortunately, is nowhere to be found in Ed Zwick's leadenly-directed 'Pawn Sacrifice' and Stephen Knight's pointless, uninsightful, and often downright boring script.My main problem with the film is that Knight establishes virtually no empathy for Bobby Fischer, even in the early scenes. His dad ran out on the family, Mom is a doting but loving mess, and Bobby, though very intelligent obviously has some mental issues, bordering on psychotic paranoia. Why this is, however, is never explored and neither the script nor Maguire's performance lets us into his head even for a second.I expected Pawn Sacrifice to show us something we didn't already know about the famous Game 6 with Boris Spasky, perhaps how all the political sturm and drang unhinged the already volatile personalities at center stage. It doesn't. It's really just a series of Maguire's increasingly deranged demands and violent freak-outs that become more and more tedious to endure.Edward Zwick, who usually directs light, comedic, *very* commercial fare is a horrible choice for a director, but it's par for the clueless course of Universal's dumb-em-down blockbuster mill lately (It's almost where I have to restrain myself from fleeing the theater when I see or hear the logo and cue anymore). You can see the script doctoring right in the credits (3 writers on story alone? Really?) and on the screen. In an incredibly crass and dumb script-o-tronic device, Bobby loses his virginity to a hooker (natch) who then turns into one of his most knowledgeable and ardent fans. See everyone? Bobby's appeal crosses ALL gender, race, and social boundaries! Yippee! What a bunch of worn-out pap.There is also no suspense built in the matches themselves as we very rarely, if ever, get a close look at the board. Presumably though, we are too stupid to understand the game of chess, so why bother? Why bother indeed. Maybe a Stand and Deliver checkers tournament is in the works right now. Edward James Almos, where are you when we need you?",3,5,14,14 December 2015
Lincoln," As usual Steve is lost in his own world...and unfortunately takes a lot of great actors along for the ride
","I admit I am one of relatively few moviegoers who believes Steve checked out shortly after ET, but I really expected he would at least turn in something passable with 'Lincoln' --- I mean really, with a subject like this how can you screw it up? Turns out, quite easily, when you completely ignore the subject.As soon as the title card vanishes you are dropped right in the middle of the Civil War, and even deeper into the internal struggles of getting the 13th amendment passed. Even with Daniel Day-Lewis' incredibly absorbing performance --- he hypnotizes with his intensity every second he's allowed to take center stage (which isn't often) --- we're down into the infighting, the excruciatingly long oratories and debates that are more about the political roadblocks and hedges of getting a piece of legislation passed than revealing much of anything about Lincoln's motivations, history, and state of mind.Day-Lewis gets no help from Tony Kushner's self-aggrandizing, smug, boring script. Hiring Kushner was a huge mistake. In all his works his scripts are about passionately making a point, usually at the expense of the point itself (the wildly overrated and shamelessly pandering 'Angels in America' says this best). And Kushner's verbal diarrhea does some very big damage in robbing us of any of the pleasures a blockbuster can give us: great sets, location shots, historical intricacies...you name it, since most of the show is all long-winded diatribes you're rarely if ever treated to any set outside a Washington great room.Go in expecting a rich portrait of one of the most vivid and impactful presidents and you'll go away sadly disappointed. It's about as exciting as watching an afternoon of C-Span.But why should I have been surprised? Steven has been going for the safe middling formula for some time now. Figure out what makes folks feel good, nod their heads and smile...and give them only that.What a bore.",4,3,6,22 June 2013
Grindhouse," T&R's perfectly rendered drive-in exploitation trip
","After Grindhouse was released, it seemed in vogue to hate on Tarantino. Not sure why. Sure, he has his signatures all over Deathproof, from the foot fetishes and the insider talking thing. But his films have always been like that.Grindhouse was incredibly risky, and for that it paid the price. I don't know many people who liked both Planet Terror and Deathproof equally. Yes, they're both exploitation pictures, but one's a zombie movie and the other is a gear head horror flick.The real joy of seeing Grindhouse --- and yes, I mean Grindhouse, not Planet Terror or Deathproof in their separate editions --- is the production values of the Grindhouse production and how they perfectly mimic the quality and aesthetic sensibilities of all the popcorn crunchers that were fixtures of drive-ins in the early to mid '70s.If you don't get a smile on your face seeing the multi-colored concentric circle wash of the title cards for 'Prevues (sic) of Coming Attractions' and 'Our Feature Presentation' then you weren't there, and that's going to take away some of the appeal. The trailers are hilarious --- from the growling narrator over the 'Machete' preview to the awesomely bad slasher-film era parody 'Thanksgiving' to the hilarious lampoon of the trailer for 'Don't Look In The Basement.' They even have a still montage of food from a local Tex Mex joint! I've been able to take or leave a lot of Robert Rodriguez's stuff. He's got a great visual style and he keeps Planet Terror's boiled and leisioned tongue firmly in it's cheek. There are some great bits from some of the best actors working today. Freddie Rodriguez and Rose McGowen ooze charisma as a professional gun wrangler and his go-go dancer girlfriend, who has a secret jones for stand-up comedy. Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton nearly steal the movie as a husband-wife doctor team with a borderline psychotic relationship that the zombie plague infecting their Texas town only serves to stoke. If there's a weak link in Grindhouse, it's Planet Terror, however...it's not that it isn't entertaining, it's that there isn't a substantial narrative (it's explosion-gunfire-explosion-gunfire-gunfire-gore-plot) or anything happening that you haven't seen a billion times before in a straight zombie picture.I like Deathprood much better, simply because it's such a richly sick, twisted original storyline. Sure, there have been vehicular homicide pictures before but most are more stupid than scary. MAJOR SPOILER: The scene where Russell traps McGowen in his car's crash box and literally uses his car to beat the living crap out of her is one of the scariest and most disturbing 'kills' I've ever seen. It's just so over-the-line bizarre, I find it fascinating. Ditto with the four way car crash scene. Many people got very irritated at Deathproof for it's talkiness. My response to this complaint is A) See the Grindhouse cut...it's far more economical and tight (the additional footage is very arbitrary) and B) I've always thought the McGowen kill scene should come right AT THE START of the movie --- I think it's a mistake to open with another backseat car dialog ala Reservoir Dogs. Do we really need 5 kills in less than 10 minutes? Russell's performance is beyond creepy, all the women in the film rock their sexuality and personalities with a breezy easiness, and the soundtrack is PHENOMENAL, consisting of another of QT's immaculately selected samplers of pop and soul obscurities.Grindhouse is not perfect, but if you long for the days of the drive-in, complete with scratchy film stocks, cigarette burns, missing reels, and crackly soundtracks, this is the real deal. Why they haven't released it in it's original format on DVD is beyond me, just as why they haven't released Kill Bill in a box is beyond me. Catch it on cable if you can...it may be the only way you'll see these films in these versions for a while....and I think it's clearly the best way to see them.",10,0,1,24 October 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Sheer brilliance...prepare to watch it over and over again
","After Soderburgh's 'sex, lies, and videotape' announced the arrival of independent cinema with a polite cough, it's younger brother 'Reservoir Dogs' stumbled in the banquet hall and puked on the floor. But oh, what a glorious heave.There are two things right off that make RD so astounding. The first is that it both honored the genre of the crime drama and simultaneously took every one of its time-honored conventions and gleefully ripped them to pieces. The second is that this multi-faceted character-driven action picture, which is so tight and so seamless (while still managing to be jaw-droppingly original in its execution) could be the work of a (for all intents and purposes) a debut director.People accuse Tarantino of writing scripts full of sensationalized dialog ('it sounds cool but people would never really talk that way'). I don't agree. I think what primarily gives his films their appeal and power is that his characters talk PRECISELY about the things we would talk about...the insane minutiae that would normally bore the average person silly, but in a cool way. It's a lot like a Seinfeld crossed with a film-noir.And this easily relatable language allows us to care about and becomes involved with a variety of characters, not the least of which are a gang of hardened criminals running for cover after a botched jewelry heist.What's even more astounding about the film is that the plot is really just a sidebar to the character dissection at the film's center. We want to know what drives these guys, and after seeing the movie, we do. We may not like what we see, but we never look away whether in boredom or disbelief. These are not cardboard action figures.How Tarantino plays this rich cast of rogues against each other and the constant switches in narrative time-line is strategic and fascinating. Yes, it's been done before, in other films, but rarely to this great of effect.And that may be the most impressive thing about this movie: it does what all truly great indies do best...they economize toward the betterment of the picture. Every frame here adds something...even the blank frames where all you hear is Steven Wright's wonderfully adenoidal mumble as he exhorts you to attend the next Monster Truck Extravaganza. That undoubtedly lowbrow event fits the seamy world the picture revolves in perfectly.This film is just as unmissable, and once you see it, assure yourself it will be only for the first time.",10,0,0,14 December 2009
Don't Breathe," Don't Believe... oh sorry, I meant Don't Breathe
","Thrillers require a steadily escalating suspension of disbelief throughout. Once that spell is broken, all bets are off. I mean face it folks, most horror movies are essentially ludicrous. Most are chock full of convenient coincidences. Don't Breathe, however, Fede Alvarez's sophomore feature after his needless and uninspired remake of Evil Dead stands to break more than a few records in this arena, and not any to be proud of.Look, Don't Breathe doesn't completely suck. It could have made a very cool short film. The main premise is three utterly unlikable wastes of space go for the score of a lifetime by targeting a solitary Gulf War vet in his creepy house in --- of course --- the middle of a huge apparently abandoned ghetto. The camera work is very John Carpenter, lots of nice low tracking shots that are very engrossing and fluid. The film's main problems are the characters and the dialogue, which as in Evil Dead, borders on sub-literate. This does nothing to make us root for anyone but the 'bad guy' whom the script tries to turn into an utter madman in the last third of the film with a series of ridiculous clichéd plot-twists and lifts from other psycho serial killer movies.The scares are further sabotaged by one of the 'heros' (ha ha) who seems to have more lives than Michael Myers in the entire Halloween franchise and many other yes... plot holes. There are so many plot holes in fact, that you can go to Rotten Tomatoes and find that same complaint among almost all of the negative reviews, of which there are shockingly few, although I think most of the 'positive' reviews are really only so-so, as mine is. It's also a bad sign when most of the message board posts are either 'WTF?' or legions of horror fanboys defending one of the few horror entries this year that doesn't outright stink. The fact is that the general standards for horror are becoming as sloppy as many things are in our world today. You deliver one or two scares... you try for that C- and you're done, right? Sorry, it doesn't cut it for a full-length feature.",5,1,5,15 November 2016
Paths of Glory," Riveting, chilling in its intensity, and shockingly relevant
","I generally don't like war movies, even anti-war movies. To me, they're like Westerns, most of which fall back on the same tired tropes we've seen a billion times.Then, while browsing Kubrick's impressive back catalog, I stumbled on 'Paths of Glory,' and was transfixed for an hour and a half.Simply put, this film has it ALL and touches on almost as wide a scope: right and wrong, moral and spiritual hypocrisy, the futility of conflict...there's not a root cause of human suffering this film doesn't attack, and splendidly. But, it's never heavy handed, never verbose or pedantic.For those who don't know the story, it's very simple to sum up. A glory-mongering general (MacReady) accepts an offer by a superior (Adolphe Menjoe) to seize a literally impossible-to-take target during the WWI France/Germany conflicts, then tries to blame the mission's failure on three almost randomly picked scapegoats in the trenches. The sentence? Death by firing squad for cowardice. Douglas is the commanding colonel who sees through MacReady and Menjoe's motives and fights like hell to save the lives of his troops. Douglas is as fine as he's been, but MacReady and Menjoe steal a lot of the thunder, as two of the most inhuman monsters you'll see on screen. The scene after the execution where they discuss how well the execution of the three martyrs was carried out, as they dine on a gourmet lunch at Menjoe's exquisite château, is nauseating but all too true-to-life. Oh, did I forget to mention one of the victims had a skull fracture and was barely awake when shot? MacReady's character sadistically directs the man to be revived seconds before being shot. 'The general wants him conscious,' his flunky explains.Many mention the battle scenes in this film, and rightly so. Fot the time period, and the budget, their immediacy and coldness will take your breath away, and that's all Kubrick. There are actually several stunning camera moves here, not the least of which is a long tracking shot of Douglas walking through the trenches, the dismay and disgust on his face palpable, as the bodies writhe on either side of his like a human sea.War is about money (as is just about everything, sadly) and its accorded power, and that's one thing that hasn't and probably won't change, long before this film was released in 1957. Kubrick puts this all in our face without any tired clichés, preaching, or hubris. Just phenomenal and utterly perfect.",10,1,3,30 July 2011
Win Win," Actually more of a compromise
","Slice of life drama-dies like Win Win are some of the hardest films to pull off. You're not giving the audience anything wham-bam like a murder, significant traumatic experience, etc. to hang off of. You have to take your time with the set-up and just trust that the inherent humanity and chops of the actors will get you through.Win Win has a lot of both of these qualities. The casting couldn't be more spot on with regards to the leads. I mean, is there anyone more adept at portraying tragically flawed heroes than Paul Giamatti? Add Amy Ryan's frank unvarnished honesty and newcomer Alex Shaffer's impressive, emotionally bruised performance and you can't possibly go wrong, right?Well, as much as I eventually liked Win Win, it was a long haul into involvementville for me, and it took me a while to figure out why I took one step back for every two steps forward. Giamatti is a nearly bankrupt lawyer who takes on guardianship of a dementia-destined senior (a fine Burt Young) with a lot of cash, mainly to get his hands on some of it to save his family and practice. With the bargain, he inadvertently gains custody of the man's grandson, Kyle (Shaffer), who's estranged from his mess of a mother (the always superb Melanie Lynsky). The real bonus, though, comes in the form of Kyle's wrestling prowess, which serves as a catalyst for Giamatti (who also moonlights conveniently as a wrestling coach) to turn his life around, at any cost.This is inspiring stuff, but unfortunately I found it to be laden down with what I call 'ringers' --- standard studio plot devices we've seen a million times before that should be amusing and funny, but which only feel tired. The most obvious is the side detour for about ten minutes where Shaffer's character encourages another less athletic student, played by David Thompson, to go for it in a match. This is played out in a very absent, predictable manner that winds up looking frivolous at best and ridiculous at worst.But the really big blunder is the continuing chapter in what I think is The Bobby Cannavale Problem. Since about the time of The Station Agent, where Cannavale played a somewhat substantial character, he seems destined for the part of the Daffy Sidekick. He literally seems to show up in dozens of movies with next to nothing to do, and almost no character to play. It's like he's the free soda with our movie happy meal, and almost as needed or memorable. Tom McCarthy's script has given him what can only be termed a tour de force in this type of McRole...there is almost no real explanation for his being present in almost any scene...but he's always there, mugging, pitching for camera time. It's got to be one of the most annoying supporting performances in recent memory. Almost by cruel coincidence, Jeffrey Tambor occupies a similar role, but the difference is....Tambor is an expert at comic timing.I suspect McCarthy's script was 'doctored' or at least advised to undergo some changes to make it more commercially appealing. It reeks of Hollywood's 'idea' of What the People Want...the sugar to make the cough syrup go down faster.That's too bad, because there's a lot of good work here. I would definitely recommend this film, but look for it on the human level, not the canned-laugh drive-thru.",6,1,2,5 September 2011
The Runaways," Woefully light, by-the-numbers treatment of one of the most interesting and influential bands in rock history
","So here we have a potentially very interesting, very gripping story, helmed by some very talented young performers, backed by some of the coolest, most influential music ever made --- it seems ahead of its time even now. That it was written in the mid-'70s makes it even more unbelievable.What a tragedy to hand all of this gold over to a relatively inexperienced music video director who has crafted a movie so completely void of honest emotion and meaningful, non-clichéd, dialog that it is almost staggering in its basic ineptitude.What's really amazing about this movie is that it doesn't show us ANYTHING but standard made-for-TV-tabloid-BS. And perhaps some of that comes from the source material, but guess what? It's the screenwriter and director's job to turn that into something interesting, to find something of a soul in it, and Sigismondi fails completely at this.We have the Bad Homelife scene, the Trial By Fire bust-out gig, the Sink or Swim audition, the Drug Crackup Scene. It's really a shame that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning are so completely wasted here. They do their best but there is nothing but scene after scene with little or no expository dialog, leaving nothing but trite scenarios to flounder in.Sigismondi even kind of fails at presenting the band in concert footage (isn't that what she know how to do?). It's hard to tell many times if the performers are really engaged in what's happening on stage or if they're having any fun. The camaraderie seems noticeably missing except between Stewart and Fanning who again, have few meaningful exchanges.The many-talented Michael Shannon even comes off like a cardboard cut-out of a the Nazi Producer. I mean, we've all heard the stories about Kim Fowley, but even he couldn't have been this one-dimensional and boring.It's very ironic because The Runaways were anything but the same old stereotypical crap --- especially in 1975! Why? A) There were no hard rocking all-girl bands, really, before them, that were commercially successful; B) There were no girl bands that blatantly sold their sexuality while still maintaining a solid artistic integrity (solid playing and songwriting).That's what really stinks about The Runaways (which I admit I'm overrating at 4) --- you're damn sure there's more to this story than the same surface eye candy you've always known about.
