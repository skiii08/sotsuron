The Blair Witch Project," 'Dateline, 23/11/99... transmitting report...'
","'Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod, I am so SCARED! I don't know what's going on, help me somebody please! It's all gone so DARK! I can't see a thing and I can keep hearing rustling sounds. There's three people in front of me, two guys and a girl, and they keep shouting and swearing at each other and every time it gets dark SOMETHING HORRIBLE happens! I just know it will what was that? Oh my God, what was that? Ohmygod, sounded like someone slurping a drink, it must be a voodoo sign. Oh, I am so sorry that I brought myself into this! They just keep on shouting and shouting and swearing more and more and more and I'm so scared. I feel so sick, they're shaking all over the place and it keeps going black and white. They keep arguing about having lost a map, but they've filmed the map already, why don't they just rewind the tape and look at it? It's so desolate out here, I need to go to the bathroom but it's all so dark and I can't see a thing. What's that? Some lights have come on, I'm so SCARED! Some guy is telling me he's a 'cinema manager' and the film's finished, it's time to go home. I tell him that I found it an anticlimax and that could I not have my money back but he's shouting me and telling me he'll call security unless I leave and I'm so SCARED'",7,0,1,23 November 1999
Saturday Night Fever," 'The man who gave you coolness and hotness and everything you want'
","Saturday Night Fever is a hopelessly naive film that appears to have no discernible sense of irony. Such a self-aware approach could have fully vindicated this dated story of Travolta's Tony Manero  who now looks an idiot throughout with colossal collars  getting his highs through disco dancing. Filled with contemporary film and juvenile sex references, this is the sort of film a sixth former would write, falsely believing it to be 'relevant' and 'meaningful'.The film also has a bitter edge, centred on the obnoxious Tony and bad language. 'What are you anyway, a nice girl or a c***?' is a typical chat-up line. The most harrowing scene comes when the rejected Annette (Donna Pescow) initiates a gang-bang with Manero's friends in order to make him jealous. Despite her changing her mind halfway through and crying for them to stop, the act continues in a quite repellent example of cinema. This snapshot of racist, homophobic, foul-mouthed Italian-Americans is more Scorcese-DeNiro territory than the cosy retro of Grease, and can be quite shocking for those that think of this as a film solely about disco-dancing.An odd scene is Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney sitting on a bench in front of Brooklyn Bridge, shot from the same angle as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton would be two years later in 'Manhattan'. The difference being Allen wouldn't have called her a c***. Well, at least not until Deconstructing Harry. On the unintentional laughter scale, look out for a gang brawl that involves much harsh editing, balsa wood chairs and overdubbed 'punch' sound effects.John Badham's direction is very good, combined with Bronx slum surroundings that give it the aspect of an art-house movie. Ultimately, though, this is a film famed more for cultural iconography than actual content. Aside from Travolta in a white suit dancing, I bet that very few people could tell you what the film is actually about. Just short of two hours long, the repetitive tale  it alternates constantly between disco and mundane everyday life  is surprisingly never dull. Like Travolta, it is personable and imminently watchable, if never actually any good. Abortions, crisis of faith, gang war, attempted rape and Travolta seeking redemption by leaving the slum - this is more than a film about dancing. And, no matter what anyone else says, the best song on the soundtrack is obviously Rick Dees and his 'Disco Duck'. 7/10",7,1,3,10 September 2000
The Avengers," '... he's adopted.'
","Perhaps one of the most fun elements of the IMDb is seeing newly released films achieve high entries on the Top 250 chart, before wider recognition gradually sees them slip down. At date of writing Avengers Assemble is just outside the top 30 of all-time greatest movies, yet still sits comfortably above supposedly inferior efforts like Rashomon, Taxi Driver, M, Modern Times and Citizen Kane. I can only assume that it will eventually slip into a more realistic level, though it's been four years since the release of The Dark Knight and that's still in the top ten. That's not to say that this movie or Nolan's Batman sequel aren't good films, but they probably aren't GREAT films, and the lightweight and ultimately draining Avengers picture isn't really able to sit there with the classic artistic works of cinema's entire history.This is not to be snobbish about the IMDb's Top 250... well, much. Although populist, and seemingly never tiring of Freeman-Roberts (again, a good film, and worthy of top forty perhaps, but all time No.1?) it does generally have a rewarding regard of the classics. Rashomon's struggle to break the top 50 even on a good day remains puzzling, but no more so than this somewhat hollow popcorn-fest being so feted.It doesn't help that after so much build up - including five movies leading into this one - it can't possibly pay off all the pre- expectations. And then there's Joss Whedon's two-joke schtick, all predictable instant reverses (including the title quote) and largely uninspired deconstruction. Nowadays every film is so relentlessly post- modern that it doesn't come as a surprise, but then every film these days is also 3D, so that doesn't come as much of a surprise either.Ultimately it's an okay movie... the jokes entertain the masses, Johansson looks stunning, and even though Downey Jr.'s schtick in the Tony Stark role already looks tired just three movies in, Mark Ruffalo does well as the new Bruce Banner. Chris Evans, used to stealing weak superhero movies with the Fantastic Four, here finds most of his character pieces on the cutting room floor, though Chris Hemsworth manages to salvage something as Thor. As the most commercially successful superhero movie of all time, its chances of repeating that sentence with the word 'superhero' removed also look pretty high. But an all time classic of the medium? No, not quite.",7,3,10,13 May 2012
Vertigo," Is it just me?
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.
So THIS is the much-lauded classic, a critical hit and a permanent resident of the IMDb top thirty? Was I watching a different film or something?James Stewart is so lightweight as an actor I kept expecting him to float away, which is maybe why he doesn't fall in the beginning... and as for his voice! Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against people with lisps and what have you (Bogart never let it get in his way) but for an adult thriller? I kept expecting him to say 'Be vewy vewy qwiet, I'm hunting wabbits, harharharharharharhar!'The only sense of Vertigo I got was a dizzy feeling when I looked at the video timer... still an hour and forty minutes to sit through? But it feels like an age! Don't get me wrong, Alfred Hitchcock is a fantastic director in terms of shots, angles and lighting, but his slightly campy, unsatisfyingly middlebrow suspensers - Psycho excepted - are never fulfilling. Yes, Vertigo is one of the best-directed films of all time, but the performances and plot are no match for the presentation. Hitchcock could shoot dog mess. Even if it was taken from an angle with reverse zoom and colorised lighting it would still be dog mess.Like a meandering travelogue, Elmer, er, Stewart drives around in very nicely mounted but boring all the same street shots. I mean, Hitchcock was having a joke when he made this, surely? Plot elements are brought in, then neglected, while others are allowed to stand still or be completely overlooked. I've read reviews that say the film is complex, which it possibly is in terms of reference. But the plot - Woman pretends to be someone else's wife. Isn't really. Pretends to be killed. Gets found out by likeably light bloke from It's A Sentimental Life - could have been written on the back of a matchbox. As for the 'twist' - that Novak staged her own death with a dummy - the dummy used was so unconvincing it would have been more of a surprise if it had turned out to be real.Also odd are a surrealistic dream sequence that gets so near to a cartoon it reminded me of the 'Pink Elephants' sequence in Dumbo, and an ending that redefines the meaning of 'abrupt'. I can picture Hitchcock in Heaven right now, laughing his head off that such a silly film, one that he probably dashed off for a bet, is receiving such a critical reappraisal. Vertigo is in equal terms dull and unconvincing as drama... or is it just me?",4,12,26,31 December 2000
Men in Black 3," 'Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke is that it be funny.' 'It's never been funny.'
","15 years earlier the original comic book adaptation of Men In Black had been a reasonably fluffy, lightweight distraction that comfortably passed an hour and forty minutes. The much-lambasted sequel continued in the same vein, and it's perhaps difficult to see why it's regarded as being so inferior to the original, given that both are just formulaic popcorn munchers.This third movie in the resurrected franchise commendably tries something new, though does look tired. It doesn't help that Smith's schtick is now so predictable and by-the-numbers, and his assault of an interviewee at one press junket for kissing him does rather pull down the curtain on Will's media friendly facade. The fact that Smith could go from losing his temper to PR Will in just a couple of seconds does display how much artifice goes into the whole package, and how contrived the act really is. It doesn't help that Tommy Lee Jones spends the movie looking like he'd rather be somewhere else, making it a somewhat laboured opening.Thankfully the time travel excursion to the 1960s and Josh Brolin's involvement perk things up considerably. There's still the lazy laughs and the dodgy racial profiling of Asian minorities (who, unlike Smith, aren't granted effacing empowerment), though the language and suggestive content is less family-friendly than a decade previously. But what's missing more than anything is an inane-but-catchy rap from Smith to bookend the entire thing. I guess this is one time that Smith DID leave us hangin' without bringin' us the fun again.Yet what turns this entire thing around and makes it arguably the best in the series is a genuinely startling twist in the final ten minutes, one which, although signposted, the viewer didn't see coming because it's unexpected in a movie of this nature. Suddenly the no-brain piece of fluff retroactively fits itself and its former instalments with a sense of previously unexplored depth and motivation. It's so out of left-field for such a throwaway box office endeavour that it's genuinely surprising and makes you re-evaluate what you've just been watching. There may be life in this series yet, even if there isn't in Lee Jones' performance.",6,1,3,15 June 2012
Scarface," 'Nothing exceeds like excess.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
I hired this video out as I looked forward to the sight of Al Pacino wearing woollen knitwear. However, when I got home I suddenly realised that I'd misread the title Â– I thought it was called Scarfface. But this matters little as we get Al fully immersed in a Cuban character, coming over all intense and fiery.The film is the ultimate exercise in excess, though works because it starts on such a low-key note. The intensity builds gradually, subtly, until we're left with what is, unless I'm mistaken, a small Christ analogy from De Palma. In many ways the film shouldn't work at all. A screenplay by Oliver Stone and incidental music from Giorgio Moroder? Yet work it does, with Moroder's downbeat, oppressive score perfectly theming the piece. The only slight missteps the film takes are in the final hour, with an eighties MOR tune playing over a sequence of images. Debbie Harry contributes to earlier segments of the movie, though this is part of the background music. Here the music is laid over the top, like Dirty Dancing or a John Hughes movie. And it's also a little incongruous seeing hitmen raid Tony's (Pacino's) house to the strains of drum machine electropop. But other than these leeettle discrepancies the film is on sure ground all the way. In fact, such full-on tactics only serve to mirror the demented nature of the screenplay.Pacino is on excellent form, spitting, yelling and elevating the 'f' word to an art form. Best example is obviously his chat-up line to future wife Michelle Pfeiffer: 'you got a look in your eye liked you ain't been f****d in a year.' Though a later scene where he refuses to assassinate a man because his wife and children are in the car with him shows a touching layer of morality. And when the film concludes with Pacino, face plastered in cocaine, expressing non-platonic love for his sister and inviting about 50 hitmen to say hello to 'my leeetle friend!' you know that, if only he would give us a 'hoo-haa!' as well then it would be perfection.",8,0,1,10 December 2000
Alien 3," Back to basics
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.
Alien3 is a return to the low-key realism of the first, and as such is the most underrated film in the series. Frequently scorned, Weaver had to be talked into doing the fourth after this, yet after the flashy Resurrection she has no reservations about a fifth. Also, on the 'Making Of' trailer on the Resurrection tape, this movie is marginalised, scarcely mentioned, an embarrassment to the series, best overlooked.Why? I've never fully understood the reason. One of the main gripes seems to be the death of Newt. I mean, for flip's sake! The girl'd be about fifteen when this was made  that'd be some statis booth! So Ripley finds herself alone on a penal colony that has turned to religion. The colony is filled, as in the first film, with decent actors, and Weaver's presence there puts their vow of chastity at risk. However, it's just as well the rape fear comes from the monks, as it won't come from the alien this time, and this is the biggest flaw in the narrative. The alien won't kill Ripley as she's pregnant with an alien baby. So therefore there is no tension. Ripley is safe, and we know the rest of the cast are just there to be wiped out anyway. (Though again as in Alien, the swiftness of top-level actors' demise are startling. Charles Dance cops it almost as soon as John Hurt did, thirteen years earlier). The film concentrates less on the aliens (who aren't very scary at all this time, thanks to some seriously ropy CGI), but more on Ripley. Maybe killing her off at the start would improve this story, as it's starting to wear a little thin now. What is Ripley, indestructible? Well, no, and that's another bugbear for the fans. As at the end of the film (which should have been called Ripley3), she commits suicide. Of course, I didn't realise till I read it somewhere that this is a culmination of the Christ analogy running through the film. Now, I said the film is underrated, yet all I've done so far is discuss its low points. There are good bits, notably the acting (Dance particularly) and the characterisation. For Alien3 is an adult film, with realistic coding. The characters are genuine, rather than the juvenile cut-outs of the second. Dance in particular gives a dignified performance, while Ripley's death gives a grandiose poetry to the climax. Criminally underrated, the direction and camera angles are well above standard, and the dark, industrial settings magnificent. The set-up with the criminals converted to monks is original, and the character dynamics dealt with well. The effects are, as you might imagine, as improved upon Aliens as that film was on the original. The space shots are exquisite, while the depth in the movie reinstates the literary bent the second had discarded. Now if only they hadn't used naff CGI for the alien. Maybe that's the reason why there are no genuine moments of horror. 6/10.",6,0,3,9 November 2000
Antz," 'Don't you want your Aphid Beer?' 'Call me crazy, but I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature, okay?'
","While watching Antz, it is always tempting to compare it with the similarly themed and CGI-ed 'A Bug's Life' from Disney.In fact, doing so only detracts from both as, despite many thematic similarities, they are very different films. The Disney film is, as you would expect, the more saccharine and self-consciously humorous of the two. It scores over Antz by brimming with inventiveness, particularly the scenes where Flik is in the underworld. These scenes often reference latter day cartoons, including 'Hoppity Goes To Town', and feature memorable scenes such as the Bloody Mary-drinking mosquito and the slug that forgot not to order salt with his burger. However, while a slight homage is made to the works of the 30s and 40s, the CGI on both these films is of the period and absolutely magnificent. Where this fails is in the fact that it is no longer groundbreaking, as it was when attempted with 'Toy Story'. To this end, Toy Story is spoofed during the truly inspired 'outtakes' sequence at the climax.Antz, however, is the story I awarded the highest marks (7 to A Bug's Life 6). A Bug's Life is a children's film which adults can enjoy, Antz is an adult film which children may not enjoy or even comprehend. It would be overstating it to say Antz has depth, but certainly a cartoon feature with themes and images of genocide, decapitated corpses and graphic physical violence is not the sort of thing you'd want to show your newly-borns. While the basic plot is the same - ant leaves colony in disgrace only to return in triumph - the basic motivation is different. In the Disney vehicle, Flik leaves with the urge to return. In Antz, Z (Woody Allen) WANTS to leave. In all this is mixed up an Orwellian parable and the nature of individualism and choice. Not exactly Tom and Jerry.Woody Allen, while a fine comedian in his own films, is far better when out of context. He ALWAYS plays the neurotic Jewish New Yorker, but when that Jewish New Yorker is the chief villain in a James Bond movie (The only reason to watch Casino Royale) or an ant on a psychiatrist's couch bemoaning 'never being able to lift more than ten times my own bodyweight', then it borders on genius. Antz also scores over its rival by having a smaller set of characters, with only (more or less) ants to make up the cast. No show-stealing fleas, ladybirds or caterpillars for this movie.But where A Bug's Life had Kevin Spacey as a villainous grasshopper, the only real protagonist in Antz is the stifling lifestyle of conformity. It's the better film, but is it any wonder less people went to see it?",7,0,0,3 October 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'E.T. I love you'
","There's a certain age when film matters more than at any other time. A time when you lose sleep over Fenella the Witch from Chorlton and the Wheelies, or leave behind a worrying brown stain on the cinema seat after seeing the flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. E.T. was one such time. Never mind that nowadays it's full of sentimentality and overdone comic setpieces, E.T. is 1982, and you're back to being a ten-year-old, trying to not cry when E.T. dies just in case your big sister catches you.I've always had a slight problem with Spielberg's direction. Somehow, his films always seem too glossy, too clean. Even Schindler's List and Amistad had a clinical air, while the director chose Tom Hanks and Ted Danson to wage war in Saving Private Ryan. A case of the bland leading the bland? And so it is with E.T., possessing some very nice shots, but all put together with the maturity of an eight-year-old. Maybe that's the point. Spielberg loves referencing all the old films, such as Some Like It Hot, and, most obviously, Star Wars. If his childlike construction bores in Jurassic Park, then it's perfectly at home here.E.T. is, like Speilberg's other great success, Jaws, manipulative and ultimately hollow. With it's $704,800,000 takings, the film is still the seventh most successful of all time, and it's to the producers' eternal credit that they never called for sequels. Imagine a world where we got 'E.T. 3-D' or a story where E.T. travels from world to world in a personal vendetta against Michael Caine.E.T. himself is a wonderful creation, though he does look worrying like Jack Nance's mutant baby from Eraserhead when ill. With his blinking eyes and expressive voice, coupled with incidental noises that sound like a crying baby and a kitten, he's a credit to the special effects team. Ageing less well are the floating special effects, be it E.T. making lumps of plasticine hover in the air, or the flying bicycles. They look like they were done on 50p and a roll of sellotape, but they were excellent at the time of release, and that's when it really mattered.As an adult, you appreciate other things about the film, such as the family dysfunction, the reasonable performances, or the mental symbiosis between E.T. and Elliot. When I first saw this film I must confess I couldn't understand why they acted so alike, and thought the scene where Elliot copies whatever the drunken E.T. watches on the TV was contrived. Hey, I was ten, what do you expect? I was going to sit in the cinema musing over whether it's a religious analogy? E.T. dies, I sniffled, end of story.Since this film, the cast haven't been able to recreate such a high-profile appearance, with Michael (Robert MacNaughton) only appearing in one cinema film since. Drew Barrymore, of course, since being told by E.T. to 'be good', has appeared in Playboy, attended lots of open-minded showbiz parties (allegedly, allegedly) and gone on to be the most famous exponent of the film, appearing in Scream, Never Been Kissed, and many more. Her appearance in 'Bad Girls' is quite ironic as her character in E.T., Gertie, spends most of the time wanting to be a cowgirl.E.T. himself had a brief comeback to the high-life (or, at least, three of his brothers did) in a four-second cameo in The Phantom Menace. Since then he's been resurrected in England to plug a phone company. As for his sole starring role, as an adult it's still a pretty decently made, if cynical, picture. For the ten-year-old back in 1982, it's perfection.",7,0,0,13 September 2000
Fight Club," 'This is your roving reporter at the ringside...'
","'You join us tonight for a title bout that I've really been looking forward to. Two grand fighters, The Narrator (who looks similarly like Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Brad Pitt). I must confess to missing the first two minutes of the match as I stopped off to get popcorn, so I as enter the ringside I find the fight is already well underway.ROUND ONE: Norton leads the show as a man addicted to self-help groups. This puts his initial sparring on a shaky, slightly unbelievable footing, where his overstated jabs of ironic juxtaposition never really seem to hit the target. He runs round the ring stealing dream sequence and overlaid narrative tactics from recent championship matches, particularly the recent Trainspotting vs. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels title fight. It's a shock that he would borrow heavily from some English fighters, but we must remember that the backer behind this clash is David Fincher. Fincher has worked well with English fighters before, most notably when they had their guts eaten out in Alien3.ROUND TWO: Norton continues to lead, and from the horrified looks on the judge's faces his pseudo-literary, semi-pretentious dialogue is a little too strong for so early on in a fight. Yet Norton is giving his all as the morose, nerdy, slightly monotone clerk and all the effort is there to see - in fact I've never seen such savage hitting.ROUND THREE: Pitt has begun to put up a bit of a fight, his boxing style an odd clash of macho thuggery and streetwise intelligence. However, his slightly effeminate tone of voice means he's not really pulling this particular style off, and it could cost him the match. Doubters at the edge of the auditorium, though, should be reminded that he pulled off such a style in Kalifornia, and he stole that bout clear away from David Duchovny. Yet it must be said that to win this fight he has to give it a lot more edge.ROUND FOUR: The style of the match has changed, as Norton and Pitt have decided to set up their own underground 'fight club', where the reality of living is confirmed by the feel of pain and physical violence. Here Pitt really starts to rule the ring, knocking Norton back into a rope-a-dope by introducing to the match a subtle homoerotic subtext that Norton did not see coming. I really believe this could be the end of the match, especially as Pitt follows up this vicious assault by showing off his six-pack and sleeping with Helena Bonham-Carter.ROUND FIVE: The fight seems to be flailing in all directions now, the spectators being forced to pay attention by the displays of violent bloodletting with an art-house style, yet wondering how long Pitt can keep up his new ruse - overstated moralising and plot justification. It's anyone's fight now and we just hope they can stay the distance.ROUND SIX: Pitt has started to lose his edge here, and tries a 'surprise twist' uppercut, yet Norton, like the rest of the audience, has seen it coming a mile off and effortlessly ducked from the swing. But wait - what's this? Pitt has delivered a second 'surprise twist' uppercut, and this time NO-ONE saw it coming! Norton is down for the count! Never have I seen such a format-changing conceit in a mainstream bout - this has completely changed the whole face of the fight, and Norton is spending all his time trying to stay awake, reeling from one situation to another and bouncing off the ropes. Suddenly this has turned into a fight to remember.ROUND SEVEN: There's really nothing left of this match now, though Pitt does well with neat little jabs like showing off a billboard sign for Seven Years in Tibet, the bout that saw him flop both in the ring and at the titlematch box-office. There's also mention of the horror of sitcoms, and as we all now Pitt's girlfriend stars in one of those, leaving Norton no room to manoeuvre amongst Pitt's self-referentiality. Norton flails around with trying to overstate the 'ironic' humour once more in the match, but Pitt has justified the entire bout with this final display. As Norton hits the canvas, this is not up to the standards of classic matches, such as the Rumble in the Jungle between Rashomon and The Maltese Falcon, but is still a fight that I think a lot of people are going to be interested in seeing and are going to be talking about for a long time to come. I thought this match was going to be won on points (8/10), but in the end, I have to declare it very much a knockout'.",8,1,3,31 December 1999
Citizen Kane," 'There's only one person that decides what I'm gonna do and that's me'
","From a personal viewpoint I would cast my vote for 'Rashomon' as the greatest film ever made, but I am more than happy for a procession of critics to hand this picture the ultimate accolade.There are all the usual things you could claim about what makes this movie so special: innovative direction, ceilings on sets, etc., etc. What always makes me sit up more than anything is Ray Collins breaking the fourth wall near the beginning. Perhaps, like it's director-writer-star, this is more a film you can admire than love. While the film is purported based on William Randolph Hurst (someone I once knew had a theory that the lead character's initials were a subliminal advert for a fast food chain when spelt backwards), it is interesting to note how the obnoxious, domineering, excessive, lonely Kane is played by the allegedly obnoxious, domineering... Orson Welles.But what makes Citizen Kane an ideal choice for the finest movie is that while embraced by the critical fraternity, it is almost exclusively a mainstream film. The directorial 'tricks' are dealt with in an understated manner (though the panning shot under a neon sign and through a skylight was obviously so well savoured it's repeated twice, once in reverse) so that they never distract. Just like any other standard movie of the era, this one has romance, drama and song and dance routines. Okay, so many of these may be shot through with more depth than normal, and the circular, fragmented nature of the plot is not what audiences were expecting. But essentially this is not an esoteric work, but something for the masses. Even the psychology behind Kane - and this is my only real criticism - is overstated, almost spoon-feed where interpretation would do. However, this also fits in perfectly with the production's study of excess, the (now obvious, sadly) matte paintings that make up a huge mansion.Ultimately, of course, this is a film that is asking questions. Away from the dark vignettes, where men hit women and cheat on their wives, we have the revelation of Rosebud. The film asks the question 'what is a man?' and then delivers the perfect resolution. Then the finale gives us the biggest surprise of all - no, not Rosebud, but the roll call of all the actors in the film that had never been in a motion picture before. The shock of seeing a procession of extremely competent actors that had only just made their debut is stunning. Was this really only 1941?",10,4,6,25 December 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Weakest of the series
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI couldn't believe Resurrection the first time I saw it. Isn't the biggest pile of pants you've ever seen? Well, maybe not. Second time around, I didn't find this low-brow edition so bad, though maybe that's because this time I'd won a free ticket. And can you really blame the producers for making it this way? After the failure of the introspective third, the logical progression would be to return to the previously successful format.Where the first two sequels had used Alien as their template, Resurrection seems to think James Cameron's was the first film. Categorically set 200 years after the third, which was set possibly 200 years after the second, we get an action movie c.2299 with excessive gore and wisecracks. And that's really what dismayed me the first time. For while the movie never gets out of it's mainstream trough, the last twenty minutes scrape the barrel for tacky excess. Worst moment has to be the guy with an alien inside him who gets shot multiple times then bangs a man's face against a steel bar. With the man's head at waist level, he screams, and the camera pans down his throat to endoscopically reveal the alien. Then the alien rips through his ribcage, and in so doing tears through the face of the other man, all in blood-spattered detail. Or maybe you prefer the bit where the General picks his own brain out the back of his head, or the alien's guts getting sucked out of a g-force crack in slow motion. Just have a glance through this entry's 'quotes' section. Nearly the entire list contains profanity or crude sexual references, clearly indicating the mentality of the piece.But away from the juvenile gore, the underwritten characters and the non-literary narrative, there are some good points. The aliens themselves are utilised better here than in the third, probably because the 'Rottweiler' alien could never be played by a man in a suit. CGI is used, but sparingly. Still a little primitive, (note to CGI workers on soon-to-be-made Alien 5: the aliens are black, so why design them as silver?), but rarely used, it is passable. The aliens are shown to be intelligent, a throwback to the lift-operators of Aliens. Again, there is no horror, but that is because the creatures are perhaps over-familiar to audiences now. In fact, so docile are these aliens that this is the only film in the series with more than four survivors. The use of clones to bring back Ripley seems more of a logical plot extension than the gimmick it seemed first time around, and this does add an interesting slant to her hybrid character. Though once more, this doesn't really add to the dramatic tension, as the new, sexual Ripley, amazed she's alive again, doesn't care whether or not she lives.Ultimately, though, it comes down to who's your favourite Spice Girl? Scary? Action? Moody? Or Dumb Spice? They are the products of four very different writers and directors and do not gel together particularly well as a whole. Taken alone, Aliens is great entertainment. Watched concurrently with Alien, it's mindless slop. Yet while they're all entertaining, none of them, not even the first, have got above a '7' rating from me. For whatever you say about these four movies, they are just 'bug-eyed monster from outer space' vehicles, the original no-brainers. Maybe that's why the fourth really disappoints. The first three try to disguise this fact, the fourth makes a celebration of it. 4/10.",4,1,2,26 November 2000
12 Angry Men," Exceptional
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSThe notion of a ninety-five minute movie featuring twelve middle-aged men in real-time, almost exclusively on a single set, isn't one that sounds promising. Yet 12 Angry Men does exactly that, and works as a masterclass in film drama.There are some nice subliminal moments, such as Rudy Bond as the bored judge, obviously resigned to what seems a cut and dried case. Dialogue and characterisation is well noted, despite occasional leaning in the latter stages towards platitudes ('Wherever you run into it, blind prejudice always obscures the truth' says Fonda commendably, but embarrassingly). Direction is where the film truly excels, though, with Sidney Lumet's camera waltzing constantly around the set, though never so that it's showy. A nice trick that I wasn't aware of was his gradual moving in of the set walls as the film goes on.For notable moments, it's interesting that the 'good' juror from step one, Henry Fonda, leaves the room wearing a white coat, and passes the dark coat to the 'bad' juror, played by Lee J. Cobb. I'm not suggesting this was a religious reference, but it is nicely symbolic. Also interesting is the step count Fonda does when he assumes the role of the elderly witness. While it's timed at '41 seconds exactly', in actual fact it all takes place 10 seconds quicker.There are perhaps times when character flaws are presented too readily, or too obviously, and the 'vote count' is increased with unnecessary regularity, dissipating the tension somewhat. As the film moves on, Fonda's inevitable moral victory becomes more obvious, though this is a minor flaw and detracts little. The sweat, then the rain, and the excellent black and white cinematography all go towards making this a very special achievement. A mainstream film, though not a dumb one, cruelly overlooked by the Academy, who nominated it three times, but failed to give it a single Oscar.Versions of the film that wouldn't have worked:TWO ANGRY MEN: Henry Fonda tries to convince one other man that the kid is innocent. Only lasts ten minutes.TWELVE MODERATELY ANGRY, BUT NOT ESPECIALLY HEATED MEN: Twelve blokes sit around and calmly discuss the issues, while being polite and getting to know their feminine sides.THE TWIST ENDING: Henry Fonda turns round and says 'I was only kidding, I think he's guilty as Hell really - let him fry!'
Twelve Angry Men is a textbook example of good filmmaking, and an exceptionally good movie. 8/10.",8,0,0,5 October 2000
Spice World," 'Can they act? Did anyone care if Marilyn Monroe could act?'
","I was stunned to find the panning this film got. Okay, it's not high art, but it's a good laugh, surely?One thing removed from this film in just two years is the veneer of satire. Released in England at a time when the media had begun a predictable backlash and the Spice Girls were about to jettison their manager, this tale of dictating management and not-that-subtle Robert Maxwell spoofs was vaguely on the money. Now that such things are behind the group, and they are indeed back in media favour (for marriages and babies more than the music, and without Geri) this edge is stripped from the film.So, what are we left with? Well, the girls aren't about to threaten the Academy Awards, though 'Baby Spice', who had acted professionally before the group, is noticeably stronger than the rest. Characterisation is strictly one-dimensional, with the constant 'Gucci dress' fixations of Victoria and crowbarred-in football associations of 'Sporty' the most irritating element. Suprisingly, the loudest member, Mel G, has the least material foisted on her, and takes the minor role in all the amateurish vignettes. Baby is allowed to smile cutely, and Geri is the brunt of a cavalcade of bra jokes. But this isn't so bad, surely? To spend 90 minutes in the company of five pretty girls, well, four pretty girls, three, well, two, surely, isn't so hard.Unfortunately, the lack of on-screen presence the girls generate means that they have to be supported by a wide variety of actors, and even other pop stars that achieve a greater presence in momentary cameos (look out for the great scene with Elvis Costello, forced to work as a barman now times are hard). George Wendt, Richard O'Brien, Barry Humphries and even Meatloaf add an air of interest to proceedings, meaning that when the camera switches back to the stars it does tend to sag.When the girls do start to get interesting is when they're performing their songs. Though as most of their songs are remixed or rejigged snippets, this would surely fail to attract the teeny-tot audience at which the film is primarily aimed. As I've said, there are moments of attempted satire, though these are less well-aimed barbs than poorly-aimed damp squibs.Yet still I contend: songs, girls, Roger Moore sending himself up rotten and Richard E.Grant overacting enormously. Not a classic, certainly, but surely good for a throwaway laugh?",6,3,6,27 December 1999
The Great Dictator," 'Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental'
","When a film opens with the above note, referring to Chaplin's dual role, but also a cheeky dig at the fact that Hynkel is a not-at-all disguised parody of Hitler, you know exactly what you're in for. This two-hour long lambasting of the Nazi regime may not be subtle, but by God Chaplin knew how to rip the p***.If rumours are to be believed, Hitler had him placed at the top of his death list after this film's release – now that's street cred. We first see Adenoid Hynkel addressing the German (Tomanian) nation, giving a speech that involves much arm-saluting, nonsense English that makes use of the phrase 'sour kraut' and his more embittered rages descending into coughing fits. 'His excellency has just referred to the Jewish people', informs an announcer after a rage-filled moment that causes microphones to bend and quiver in fear. His first German-language dictates to his minister of war (Herring) involve 'banana' and 'cheeseuncrackerz'. Look out too for instructions to his Minister of Interiors, Garbitsch.I've never really gotten into Charlie (always credited as Charles) Chaplin, as I find his innocent sentimentality a little hard to get to grips with in today's society. W.C.Fields, and, to an extent, Harold Lloyd and Laurel & Hardy can still entertain, as they have something of the attitude, or edge, that Chaplin lacks. Ironically, it's modern times that mean we now find it hard to fully appreciate Modern Times. However, dialogue and a harsher undercurrent – including a Jewish barber (Chaplin, again) being hung from a lamppost mean that even today The Great Dictator is relevant.There are some nice silly jokes, such as the barber, confronted by a Stormtrooper, being told: 'and I thought you were an Arian'. 'Well, I'm a veget – arian', replies Chaplin, trying to fit in. Many jokes – such as Hynkel making a long speech and his secretary typing up just a couple of words; then saying just a couple of words only for her to translate it into paragraphs – were originated here and have been repeated countless times in other places. Some of the most amusing slapstick is when Hynkel meets fellow dictator Mussolini (Napaloni), and tries to impress him by having the greater psychological perspective in all their meetings. In a gag much honoured by Bugs Bunny, the two crank themselves up to ever-greater heights on barber's chairs.Elsewhere, the film also has a grand scale, with ceilings on sets and news reports propelling the narrative – you know, the sort of thing Citizen Kane was so highly praised for the following year. If there's a fault with this film then it's not so much with the sentimental, whiter-than-white Jewish population, but with Chaplin's interpretation of Hynkel. Although he gets all the best jokes and scenes, he's simply too likable to really convey the threat Chaplin was trying to stop. Nevertheless, this is forgotten as the ending gives us the Jewish barber taking Hynkel's place, and Chaplin making an impassioned, three-minute speech in the name of freedom.Charles Chaplin played two roles in this movie, wrote, directed, produced and, uncredited, composed original music for it. To claim it changed the world is an overstatement. America still had a good opinion of Hitler at the time, and, after it was released... they still had a good opinion of Hitler. It was still some time before they would even enter the second world war, and with the final speech being adopted for Communist pamphlets in England, this only caused Chaplin troubles when it came to the McCarthy witch trials. There's a sense that Chaplin isn't the master in the field of talkies, and that his use of mime was beginning to date. History was overtaking him, but The Great Dictator still stands as one of the most personal, and risk-taking films ever put on celluloid.Postscript, April 2012: I've since watched all of Chaplin's features and every short. So, I was talking rubbish when I said twelve years ago that he didn't have modern appeal. Sorry about that. However, I stand by most of the review, even if 'Chaplin on Hitler's death list' is a 'fact' I've only read in Trivial Pursuits. Oh, look out for the documentary that's included on the DVD - 'The Tramp and the Dictator' - well worth seeing, as well as Chaplin's extensive thoughts on this film and its aftermath in his 1964 autobiography.",8,8,10,2 September 2000
Chicken Run," 'So, was it as good as you expected?'
","No... it's worse. I have the unfortunate distinction of sitting next to a woman at work so obsessed with all animal kind that she spends her evenings baking jacket potatoes for her bird table. With grated cheese for topping. No joke. In fact, so near is she to the welcoming arms of insanity that she claims keeping fish in tanks is 'captivity' and campaigns for the rights of maggots. And so it was that I went to see Chicken Run, not because I wanted to, but to shut up an eccentric colleague who asks me if I've seen it on a twice-daily basis.On the positive side, thrice-Oscar winner Nick Park might be working with an American company for the first time but he doesn't sell out. Animation's first-rate and the humour is still as English as Wallace and Gromit. The inclusion of Mel Gibson as Rocky the Rooster also fits. Amusingly, Gibson's Rocky fails to understand a chicken with a Scottish accent, which may come to explain his own attempt in Braveheart. Most of the better jokes  such as multiple references to The Great Escape, The Weather Girls and a weak Star Trek spoof  got laughs from the adults but were lost on the child demographic. They're treated to a predictable series of self-conscious blinks, double takes and pratt falls, which over-egg (geddit?) the joke a little. As for the child audience, despite some comic violence, it does warrant it's 'U' certificate. The only odd point is, in a film devoid of bad language, the sole usage of the word 'bugger'. A mild English expletive, bearing in mind its actual meaning, it should be more offensive to right-wing middleclass audiences than the 'f' word. The fact that it is patently isn't is an interesting lesson in the misplaced priorities of linguistic experts.There's always the nagging feeling that the plot isn't long enough for it's 90m duration, or that the jokes aren't funny enough. Pipe smokers may urge an Orwellian perspective on the class divide, but it's really just a so-so 'see it if you really like that sort of thing' kid's film about plasticine chickens. But at least my deranged co-worker can now finally be silenced.",5,0,3,10 July 2000
Juno," Engaging but troubling...
","... up until the last ten minutes or so I was tempted to give this film an even higher mark.Although it occasionally steers a little close to twee, and the soundtrack is self-conscious, it's a likable, relatively original film, and Ellen Page is an engaging and cute lead.However, the pay off in the final ten minutes? 'Hey kids, you too can get pregnant and give the baby away with no emotional consequences whatsoever'? Sure, it's possible that some of the subtleties of this one passed me by with late night vodka, but regardless, a pat ending that discards any kind of emotional resonance or responsibility for its protagonists is a worrying thing indeed.Still, a worthwhile cinema experience... to a point.",7,1,5,30 September 2010
The Jungle Book," 'Birds of a feather should flock together'
","There is an interesting - possibly unintentional - racial subtext with this film, which ends with two of the lead characters returning whey they 'belong'. Maybe such things weren't intended with a cartoon film about singing bears who give boxing lessons, but it makes it one of the thematically more intriguing Disney offerings.Technically this doesn't always look like it was made 25 years after Bambi - while the art has a certain elegance in places, it's also scrappy and looks almost pencil drawn at stages. This isn't an express criticism, as it gets by on charm, which it has a considerable supply of.Centrepiece of the film is the sequence with King Louie, a jazz/scat singing orangutan. Although the idea of having someone possess the mannerisms of black culture while in the form of a monkey is a questionable feat, his signature song - wanting to appropriate the manner of another man in order to share in his freedoms is nicely sardonic for 1967.However, if there's one criticism of the film that holds up, it's how episodic the whole thing is. Introducing a great villain like Shere Khan three quarters of an hour into the runtime is quite a novel feat, but other characters are picked up and dropped throughout, with very few constants. Louie doesn't appear again, and just as the film begins to wind down, we get some vultures with 'what's that supposed to be?' English accents. It's telling how old-hat Disney could be at times in that what were inspired as parodies of the Beatles end up singing a Doo Wop number.Ultimately while the film has touches of greatness, and is a very pleasing time-filler, the unevenness of the story progression causes it to feel a little flat when viewed as a whole.",7,4,8,11 January 2014
X-Men," 'Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand'
","I don't really know if X-Men is the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the coolest.The comic series was the ultimate in style over substance, and very chic it was too. It originally stiffed as a Stan Lee/Jack Kirby alternative to Marvel's own range of Fantastic Four/Avengers/Spiderman, et al., almost coming close to cancellation. An idea of how relatively unsophisticated these early issues were reveal that the 'X' in X-Men originally stood for 'Xtra'. A five-strong team, only two of them really make it through to the movie. Angel, a winged playboy, is wholly absent, while plans to include the acrobatic beast were dropped after his later transformation into a blue-furred creature proved too extensive an undertaking. Bobby Drake as the Iceman does get a small role in the form of Shawn Ashmore, though this is as a young student, and not the same age group as Cyclops or Jean Grey. Jean Grey (codenamed 'Marvel Girl' in the comics, one of the series' less inspired inventions, and absent here) appears with James Marsden as the guy who can shoot lasers from his eyes.When the comic became cool was when it's allegorical issues (mutated humans as oppressed minorities) were scripted by Chris Claremont in the mid-seventies onwards. He totally reworked the team into largely what it is on screen. (Though the popular Nightcrawler is missing, and I didn't spot Colossus, played as a bit part by Donald Mackinnon). Debatably the most popular superhero of the Marvel range, Wolverine was also arguably the first short superhero, his 5'3 frame here being transformed into the 6'2 build of Hugh Jackman. Jackman is magnificent, his cynical, taciturn view emerging from the seedy bars and fighting clubs he frequents, later being used to prick the more absurd elements of the plot. His adamantium claws are truly impressive on screen (the special effects being used, as elsewhere, to serve the plot, rather than being the plot. George Lucas, please take note), and he even gets to use them on Cyclops as a new form of 'giving the finger'. His sniping, macho relationship with Cyclops provides some of the better sequences, and Jackman's timing means that these elements always seem spontaneous, not bog-standard retorts written to order. Best line? After emerging from a battle with the shapechanging Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who assumed his form, he finds Cyclops ready to blast him, just in case. 'Wait, it's really me' he urges. 'Prove it', he's told. 'You're a dick' comes the reply. Cyclops can only nod in agreement. Perhaps less successful is his love for Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) which, while again being true to the comic, isn't that well developed on screen.Wolverine gets all the best lines, all the coolest things to do, and is one of the three main characters involved, the rest just peripheral to greater or lesser extents. Patrick Stewart gets a fair chunk of the earlier part of the film, doling out exposition as Captain Jean-Luc, er, Professor Charles Xavier. It must be disheartening for some of the cast that Stewart is such a good actor without having really to try, and there is evidence here that's he going through the motions. Halle Berry gives a great effort as Storm, yet doesn't really impress. Maybe she's miscast, as I always imagined Storm with a bit more attitude, sort of a Grace Jones type.Then there's Ian McKellen as Magneto, unused to the SF franchise lark, and so managing to outact Stewart by a considerable margin. His character is still fraught with the odd problem, mainly, his origins. The X-Men series is, of course, foolproof, as no real 'origin' is needed. There are no cosmic rays, no gamma blasts, and no getting bitten by arachnids of radioactive properties. They've got the powers from birth/puberty and that's all there is to it. Yet the film casts McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr, Jewish victim of the holocaust. This is still reasonably true to the comics, and the sequence is brilliantly shot, lashings of rain making it look like a Kurosawa wet dream, yet this does take something away. The whole idea about the X-Men is that it's allegorical (later sequences allude to, but do not directly represent, the McCarthy witch trials), yet the idea of the lead villain being a persecuted Jew is spelling it out. This comes across as similar to a scene in 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes' where we are shown chimpanzee war protesters. Allegory and literalism are two separate elements, and should not be mixed. Again, McKellen is ideally suited towards this sort of thing, being homosexual in real life, though it's all-encompassing reference to persecution of minorities is somewhat offset by the generic good looks of the cast.Characters are reasonably well drawn, the script is literate, and there's a real sense that the people involved cared about what they were making. There's nice little in-jokes (a reference to Wolverine's comic book 'yellow spandex', whereas here the group wear cool black leather) and cameos from mutants that don't have a real part to play, though not introduced to casual audience distraction (Ariel/Shadowcat in particular getting a nice throwaway appearance). There's even a great explanation of how Rogue (Anna Paquin) gets the white streak in her hair.But this isn't a film for comic book fans, it's based purely towards casual audiences who may never have even picked up an issue. Some argue that it's too short, but for a superhero movie it sensibly neglects the dragging two-hours plus duration and goes for the 104 minutes slot. It has three clear acts and leaves you wanting more. Note how Wolverine's mysterious origins are not revealed, but left hanging, rather than the neat sewing up of loose ends that left Batman with nowhere to go after he avenged his parents' death in the first Tim Burton movie. Also notable (if not necessarily commendable) is that the X-Men kill their enemies, and it's not just Wolverine doing the slaying.I don't know if this film will stand up to repeated viewings. In five years' time it might be hopelessly outdated, or it's funky, slick style and stylish - though not ostentatious - direction might be lost on me. I suspect it really contains very little substance at all, but it's snappy, yet realistic dialogue and 'wow' super-powered fight scenes are clouding my reasoning. Who needs one Batman when you can have a whole army of mutants? No, in just a few years' time I might wake up and see this for what it really is. But for now, X-Men is the best summer blockbuster film of the last ten years.",7,0,0,27 August 2000
Midnight in Paris," 'I'm having an insight now... it's a minor one, but...'
","Midnight In Paris can be accused of being slightly pretentious, lazy and indulgent, but then even Woody Allen's best films are slightly pretentious, lazy and indulgent. There's no real knock out factor in this one, it's just a pretty good Allen film from his modern period. However, what really holds the whole thing together is Owen Wilson playing Woody Allen (here called 'Gil Pender') whose considerable charm propels what is quite a sluggish film on occasion. Sure, the entire point of this movie is not to be about pace or dynamism, but there's points where Allen's overearnest love affair with Paris becomes traveloguesque. Added to this is the perpetual self-flagellation over American identity, something else Wilson is able to achieve well.Yet Allen seems, if not at his peak, then somewhat reinvigorated for the new decade. You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger (6), while effectively the 'same old, same old', was watchable, and Midnight In Paris sees him take back up his recent predilection for filming outside New York. Incidentally, an interesting note on Allen's working methods was revealed when Michael Sheen, playing Paul, was interviewed on a UK chat show: Allen likes to pass actors only the parts of the script that relate to their characters, so Sheen had no idea his character was having an affair with that of Rachel McAdams until he saw the finished picture.Midnight In Paris, is, without adjusting for inflation, the biggest box office success of Woody Allen's career. It's a nice movie, a fine movie, but I doubt many would put it anywhere near his ten or twelve greatest works. It just goes to show that tastes, star names, marketing and even just pure luck can factor in to what makes a 'hit'. After all, even adjusted to modern figures, Husbands and Wives still didn't make as much as Small Time Crooks...",6,3,4,22 January 2012
Snatch," 'It's not too subtle, but effective'
","Guy Ritchie is not a satisfying writer-director and nor do I ever think he will be. The cocksure, pop video excesses and smart-arsed, stilted, would-be clever dialogue is the same as ever in Snatch, a mite better than 'Lock, Stock...' but still a clear '5'.Snatch, the smug, self-satisfied title, is, as well as a word for stealing; also a slang term for the female member, a point that I doubt was lost on the producers. Rather appropriately then, this is a male-dominated film, with women having no role (apart from the wooden-as-a-crate twin daughters of 'Tony the Head') except to bare their breasts. This laddish, sixth-form sexism goes hand-in-hand with the usual sub-racism and homophobia that punctuates a Ritchie endeavour.In many ways this is worse than the comparatively laid-back Barrels, as its clumsy post-modernism is even more apparent: a quote from Pulp Fiction is used, the Michael Caine homage is more heart-felt, and Reservoir Dogs is referenced even before the close of the beginning titles.The contrived plot and action-led pace are, however, thrown together with such veracity that, like Lock, Stock..., it is readily watchable, if not actually any good. For a first time viewing, at any rate. What crushes it is Ritchie's need to make every line a 'funny' line, which takes away all sense of reality. Look at the scene where a betting shop assistant is held at gunpoint, refusing to hand over money, and being told: 'I ain't f****** buying that!' 'Well,' she replies, a tad unrealistically as she's under threat of death, 'that's fine, cos I ain't f****** selling it.' You suspect that if Ritchie had the guts to make a serious, sincere UK gangster movie then it would be more bearable, rather than one which gorges on the rotting carcasses of superior stablemates.Where the film crucially falls down is in it's casting. How so many bad actors could be in one movie is staggering. What is worse, the few that do give a decent performance are given minimal roles, or roles that make the least of their talents, with a 'was he actually in the film?' appearance from Trainspotting's Ewan Bremner. Alan Ford is okay as Brick Top, though others – most notably Ade in his movie debut – are awful, though doubtlessly hindered by the weak script. Mike Read appears as Tony the Head (which sounds less like a gangster, more the male equivalent of Linda Lovelace), though is wasted by being reduced to a cursory cameo role. He doesn't even get to say 'wot are yer, some kind o' pilchard?'The other two decent performances come from Brad Pitt, and, surprisingly, Vinnie Jones. After humiliating himself with a lame turn in Gone In Sixty Seconds, he does better here than most of the 'professionals' with him; even though when he uses big words, you doubt if he knows what they really mean. Brad is, of course, the main appeal, almost unrecognisable as a tattooed, nonsense-Irish speaking bare-knuckle fist fighter. When he's on the screen, it almost lights up, only to darken again when he leaves it. Not a wholly successful addition, the standard of his acting and obvious presence make you think he's in a different film to most of the third-rates walking around pretending to be Bob Hoskins. Yet it is clear Brad loved his role in a low-budget Brit movie, and even appears to ad-lib his obscenity to an over-zealous dog. (Also look out for the hastily cut scene where Vinnie starts to crack up as another dog gets carried away and attacks an actor he wasn't supposed to). There are precisely three laughs in the movie, all of which are unintentional. The first two I've just detailed, the last sees dance artist Goldie indulging in some attempted thesping. 'Stick to being a gangster, Lee, leave this game to me and Sol,' he is told by Robbie Gee.One last moan? The self-consciously cool music score (soundtrack already available in stores), which, idiotically, has no relevance or association with what's on screen; be it The Stranglers' 'Golden Brown' being set, for no reason other than it's a good song, to a bout, or 'Ghost Town', The Specials' satire of my home town, being commercialised and stripped down to gain brownie points from muso-nostalgists.This is a film that will be lauded by Loaded readers, a lazy retread of a weak first film that largely wastes its resources. The picture concludes with Huey 'Piano' Smith singing 'ha, ha, ha, ha' through the end credits. Good luck to you, Huey – you're the only one laughing.POST SCRIPT - September 2015. I can only conclude that I was in an incredibly bad mood when I wrote this somewhat churlish review 15 years ago. Yes, Snatch isn't especially deep, but it's very entertaining, something only highlighted further by the existence of the YouTube spoof 'Snatch Wars' in the interim. There's a lot I didn't mention in the review above, such as the inspired metaphorical underwater sequence, and the performances, in hindsight, seem a tenfold better than I gave them credit for. 7/10.",7,1,3,6 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'It's time to meet the Muppets...'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSIn this post-Phantom Menace age the superficial thrills of Return suddenly don't seem all that bad. Particularly entertaining when watched alone, not after the maturer Empire, it's a worthwhile movie.The opening breakout from Jabba's palace is genuinely exciting (the unmodified original still the best - the updated version retains the ropy matte effects on the rancquor beast and inserts a dumb Ike & Tina dance combo) though thereon it does falter slightly.More contrived than usual, with Leia being Luke's sister undeniably stupid. Not only is it silly in itself, but it also destroys the Han-Luke dynamic, leaving Solo nothing to do but fire toy guns like a spare part. Suddenly upgraded to full lead status, Mark Hamill does adequately here, his more distinguished features (he looks about 80, basically) adding to his dramatic appeal. He even manages to look genuinely upset over the death of that silly old glove puppet, Yoda.I remember an amusing French and Saunders spoof of The Phantom Menace with John Inman as an Emperor. This could easily have been inspired by Iain McDarmid here, who is the campest Emperor you'll ever see. Maybe the whole thing is a homophobic fable, Darth and the Emperor trying to 'turn' Luke to their side. 'His compassion for you will be his undoing' notes McDarmid - Hamill for his part counters that 'You won't convert me as you did my father.' Face it - the dark side is all about dressing up in black leather and calling people 'master'. Vader is an S & M fetishist destroying the rebel alliance merely as a pastime.It is weird how - as with the speedbike chase - most of the state of the art special effects now look extremely dated. However, unlike some modern efforts, the movie doesn't hinge on such endeavours and so it still stands up. It also moves at a cracking pace, so that while the events are perfunctory, the dialogue functional, it's rarely boring.
Yet what eats away at the film's core is its Disneyfied perspective. Jim Henson gets his foot firmly in the door, while Luke being visited by the ghosts of his father, Yoda and Alec Guinness is vomit inducing. As with Phantom, Lucas reasons that any old writer could come up with brand new plots time after time - it takes a man of rare mettle to do the same story three times over. Go get that Death Star, boys!!The Ewoks are of course rubbish, but I loved 'em as a kid. I loved its neat, loose-ends-tied ending when I was ten, too, just in the same way that I hated Empire's open-ended resolution. Okay, so this is the most kid-orientated Star Wars movie (pre Jar-Jar, obviously) but it shouldn't necessarily be knocked for that. In fact, all of the comic set pieces are strictly of the 'cringe inducing' variety, but they made me very, very happy as a child.There are questions: the chief Ewok smokes a pipe. As their culture seems to be partially based on Native American culture, then what is implied to be in the pipe? Or did Embassy just have shares in the picture? Why does Darth's arm grow a foot longer when his hand is chopped off? And whoever would've thought his death would be so sad? And why IS Boba Fett so popular? I mean, what does he actually DO? Generally, though, this is a movie without any kind of subtext, which can make it disappointing.  The climax doesn't pack the potency it once did, but Luke's conflict - how to defeat the enemy without giving way to inner hate - is an identifiable and enjoyable turmoil.We get told the Death Star is operational twice just in case we don't get it, Billy Dee Williams is wasted, and Harrison plays toy soldier the whole time. But I last saw this on satellite when I had an overnight stay in a hotel. You know the sort of thing - a dull work course, no free bar - and this film became an admirable distraction. Yeah, all in all, this is not that bad a movie. It has a clear three-act structure, a decent pace and compared to The Phantom Menace it's BBC Shakespeare. And I didn't even mention the bit with Carrie Fisher in THAT bikini. 5/10, I think. 8.0 average on the IMDb? Let's not get carried away...",7,3,8,24 August 2001
Alien," Odd One Out
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.Watching Alien as a self-contained film is almost impossible nowadays, as you're constantly reminded of other, related, media. There's (for me, anyway), a constant mental image of Ian Holm as the pervy Lewis Carroll in the film 'Dreamchild'; Or Yaphet Kotto as top James Bond villain Kananga from 'Live and Let Die'. Then there's the sets, which were accurately reproduced for seasons three-five of Red Dwarf. Finally, there's the sequels themselves. In fact, the sequels are so well-known that seeing a third-in-command Sigourney who just happens to be the lone survivor and looks, frankly, a bit of a dog, is a strange one. All the performances are underplayed, rather than the overstatement that occurs in the second and fourth movies, though the characters aren't especially well-developed. Only Ripley, Dallas (Tom Skerrit) and Ash (Holm) get vaguely three-dimensional characters, while John Hurt is just a cameo. The sole black member of the crew, Parker (Kotto), is possibly the most obnoxious, an unfortunate characterisation that dates the film, along with the modest matte effects. And talking of dated, what about that sexist underwear shot in the final scenes? Sigourney strips down to a skimpy T-shirt, with the camera pointed upwards so we can see her chest heave up and down, and that's to say nothing of her pants. Could the production team not afford a bigger pair? Ridiculously small, they show her bum crack hanging over the top like a bricklayer's. Ultimately, now the film has its less-mature sequels, they have effectively killed it. The naff CGI of the last two isn't half as good as here, yet now we've seen mobile aliens, the rather static men-in-suits just won't do either. The smaller aliens are probably the best, the 'facehugger' looking like a spider and a snake all at the same time. Yuck! The worst alien has to be the baby, though. If you put a laughter track on the movie sometimes it would seem entirely appropriate. For the 'classic' scene where John Hurt gives birth is hilarious, and again one can't help but be reminded of the skit in the underrated 'Spaceballs' where the alien pops out and starts tap-dancing. Here, the baby alien is so laughably phallic that Sigourney looks around and says 'now where did I put those batteries?' as soon as she sees it. Well, maybe not, but she should have done. Of course, while exploitative, Scott's direction is the best-ever for the series. Where the second is action, the third gothic and the fourth dumb comedy, this one is supposed to be a horror movie in space. So I suppose the question should be: is it scary? Well, I jumped once, and there was one other place where jumping was a possibility, so I guess that makes the original sort of okay. But the use of cosy motifs throughout, such as the ginger cat that outlives them all (including Weaver bashing his carry-box around in the last ten minutes), and the alien snoring do not make this a trip to the laundrette for anyone. Ripley gets her best characterisation, slowly progressing from icy, dutiful officer to disillusioned aggressor who shouts 'bitch' a lot. But the original is now overshadowed by its immediate successor, and it's hard to say why it is better, though it is superior to the Cameronised model in many ways. Far more sophisticated than whatever followed, and also more psychological, from the face-rape of Hurt to the phallic imagery of the big alien, the original still has a lot going for it. But looked at in hindsight, and there is no other way to view it, it lacks the action it's successors have dictated the films must contain. It remains the odd one out in it's own series.",7,0,3,9 November 2000
Taxi Driver," Still important after all these years...
","I've been drawn to revaluate this film recently by four critical opinions other than my own that made me question my initial judgement.The first was hearing a story on tv that I've never come across before: a governing body forced the filmmakers to colorise the blood in the climatic final sequence to a lighter, less graphic colour. This explains why DeNiro's neck spouts orange blood as the effect unfortunately turned out to be irreversible.Secondly I read a magazine review that highlighted DeNiro's performance. Normally negative criticism of such a revered actor is never dared uttered, yet this particular review suggested that there was nothing 'behind the eyes' and that DeNiro's performance was all surface and definitely no substance. Lastly, I recently lent the tape out to two friends. One returned it to me half-watched, it's mid-70s pacing (none of the much touted scenes of violence taking place before over an hour) boring him. The other friend brought to mind quite a valid point. That we never see exactly what makes the DeNiro character, Travis Bickle, psychopathic. On first viewing I perhaps appreciated the characterisation more as what seemed a slightly disaffected young man gradually became warped by the decadence and hostility of a harsh New York. The genius of the film is that you follow his descent into insanity and see things through his eyes. We hear his thoughts, we get to read his journal, his presence dictates the movie. So much so that we almost support his mission to 'eradicate the scum off the streets', we almost cheer when he shoots a store raider dead and we agree with his justification for murdering the pimps who harbour a 12-year-old girl into prostitution. Then it hits us. We have followed, willingly, a man into a mass execution and the violence, which we have mentally encouraged, is displayed graphically before us. It causes us to question our own sense of morality and that is why it is such an important film.Except on second viewing it is quite clear that Travis is mentally ill from the outset. The world of New York doesn't consume him, he reflects it. An alienated, socially inadequate man who takes a girl on a date to a pornographic movie. My friend questioned that there was no impetus, no genuine cause of psychosis, but that Bickle is psychotic from day one. Maybe this was a race interpretation. My friend is Asian, and perhaps had been fortunate enough never to encounter the extreme, right-wing WASP mentality that is prevalent in a thankfully small minority. The Travis character is racist, homophobic, misogynist, he rallies against the 'pushers' and the 'skunk pussies' that litter the streets. In many ways his views are not those of the mentally disturbed, merely those of  `middle America'.The similarly-themed 'Falling Down' fails for me, chiefly because of it's self-conscious and incongruous bouts of humour, but also because it has nothing to say. Taxi Driver has plenty to say. Maybe what shocks about the violence (tame by today's standards) is it's moral ambiguity. The ultimate ironic play-out, that a murderer should become a hero, leads us to look again and question ethical behaviour. How different is the self-righteous from the wretched? What distinguishes the viewer from the `scum' of the movie? One of the most subversive pictures ever made, it ultimately carries no distinction between right or wrong and it's lead character is completely unsympathetic, an extremist who attempts murder for no other reason than personal notoriety. These are important issues it raises, and it succeeds as it doesn't spoon-feed its audience, but throws up a myriad of questionable motivations. Just how different is Bickle from the clientele in the back of his cab?Taxi Driver succeeds over populist fare such as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs as, fine films though those may be, it occupies a space of reality that they can't, or don't wish, to encounter. Plus Scorcese gives a better cameo than Tarantino ever did. Without question one of the ten or twenty greatest films ever made. In MY opinion, anyway...",10,0,0,3 February 2000
Over the Top," 'I'm gonna give you a world of hurt little man!'
","Like a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies of the period, this would be a devastatingly witty send-up of the late 80s/action genres... were it not for numbing realisation that the writer-star actually expects us to take it all seriously.Stallone and David Mendenhall as father and son produce some genuinely laugh-out-loud expressions when in the middle of arm wrestling, and any scenes they share that threaten emotion are made hysterical by use of a soft piano underneath them. Filled with so many montages and soft rock tracks it's impossible not to think of Team America: World Police while watching it, this is stellar entertainment at arguably the lowest peak of Stallone's career. After having achieved the not-so-mean-feat of making the genuinely decent Rocky and First Blood laughing stocks with ridiculous sequels (IV and II respectively) and turning in a dreary MOR flick in the form of Cobra, this is a wonder to behold. Like Rocky IV, any potential laughable scene is turned into a full laugh riot with the use of slow motion and OTT (no pun intended) music. Layered over this is the genius behind I Feel Love, adding to the ridiculousness of the whole set up. A must see terrible movie that, in fairness, wasn't even well received at the time.",5,0,1,19 August 2011
Bridget Jones's Diary," Please tell me I'm not the only one...
","Generally okay-ish romantic comedy that skirts with frightening regularity between likeable wit and soundtrack-flogging luvvie smugdum.Chances are the laboured Brit comedy and signposting of gags will wear you down before the end, OTT plot contrivances and self-conscious dialogue stifling the charm of the piece. It's not bad, but the self-satisfied performances and embarrassing escapades make you want to leave the cinema rather than egg Bridget on for all her social faux pas.Despite Zellwegger's Texan origins (Her accent is pretty good, and, despite the bitching she did about it, she looks a lot sexier at ten stone) you can practically taste the phrase 'darrrrrrrrling, you were wonderful' all the way through this one. All the prerequisite Richard Curtis elements are there: the wacky friend with the squeaky voice, the token promiscuous homosexual and the posh friend that says 'f***' a lot. I don't know who it was that decided posh people swearing was funny, but whoever it was they should stop it.Being in the company of such people for 100 minutes is acceptable, but would you really want to know any of them in real life?

Fargo," Plot Irrelevance
","There is a segment in Fargo where the female police officer meets an old Asian friend from high school. The segment is wholly irrelevant to the plot, and does nothing to advance character. Around this dubious moment are slices of violence, sex and profanity, peppering a one-note story.While nicely acted and shot, this indulgent excuse for entertainment must surely stand as one of the most over-rated of modern cinema.",6,0,2,9 March 1999
Predator," 'Some damn fool accused you of being the best.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSYou're guilty of it, I'm guilty of it, we're all guilty of it. In what now seems aeons ago, we were all to blame for encouraging Schwarzenegger. We laughed at his bad acting and indecipherable accent, and even, in the 90s, let him think he was in on the joke. Of course, we drew the line at Last Action Hero (shame, I quite liked that one, but never mind...), yet Arnhuld had had a decent run of mindless action movies that, despite ourselves, we genuinely enjoyed.Nowadays, it's a mistake, a relic, like filofaxes or a digital watch. Most sane people are embarrassed to admit they ever watched an 'Arnie' movie, Terminator excepted, much less enjoyed one. Predator is no different. Surprisingly, it wasn't one of the movies that Arnie did a sequel for, as it was his first big hit, earning considerably more than the Conan projects or the first Terminator. It saw him pushed up towards what now seems inconceivable superstardom, and is a typical macho tirade. A plotless pastiche of the Vietnam conflict, only with a seven-foot semi-transparent, green-blooded alien, it has characters that greet each other with an arm wrestle, call each other 'son of a bitch' as a friendly nickname, and say things like 'I ain't got time to bleed.'Two things stick in my mind about this movie: one is that I was once naive enough to not really understand the 'big as a house' joke and repeated it to my embarrassed mother; the other is that I couldn't tolerate more than fifteen minutes of it, so grating was it's dumb-as-you-like, testosterone-propelled dialogue. Seen in full, it's perhaps not that bad for throwaway entertainment, though I dispute Empire's recent claim that it's formula action trappings were supposed to be satirical of the genre.In Apocalypse Now a fleet of helicopters flew into the jungle to the overblown strain of Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkrie'. Here they do it to the jazzy-pop combo of Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally'. In a bizarre sort of way, this is actually classier. The film saw the continuation of the 'jokes' that Arnhuld woodenly tells, the 'jokes' we used to convince ourselves we found funny. He gets five one-liners here: 'stick around'; 'knock, knock'; 'oh, s**t'; 'you're one ugly motherf****r' and 'bad idea'. As you can see, with first-rate material like that, its no wonder two writers were needed. (Intriguingly, one of the writers goes by the name of 'John Thomas'. No wonder all the characters are lead by their ...)The platoon are originally on a mission to rescue hostages. Of course, this being Arnie, he blows up the entire military camp, including the hostages they were supposed to be freeing; though this particular plot point is glossed over. Probably because it is a plot point, and plot isn't the governing factor here. Anyway, it soon turns out the men have another enemy in the guise of an infrared alien, and are gradually picked off one by one. While this obeys the basic tenets of horror, don't be fooled into thinking this is scary. Any chance of fear is vanquished by fairly standard direction and the artillery-lead pace. It's hard to be frightened when you've got huge guns and can blow down trees.Predator, more than the majority of Schwarzenegger's CV, still stands up as an okay-ish, no-brain shoot-em-'up. It doesn't have any real ambition or meaning, it just goes through ammo and a pedestrian storyline until the predictable outcome is met. At least we got a Schwarz who hadn't yet developed enough of an ego to object to being covered in mud. Though even if he had allowed his head to be shaved ten years later for Batman and Robin, would it have made a difference? A reasonable excursion though as Apollo Creed himself says to Arnie: 'You got no style.'",6,1,13,1 October 2000
Notting Hill," Not the next great British movie
","Notting Hill is much-touted by insecure Brits as the new 'British Movie', yet - correct me if I'm wrong here - is made with American money. My theory is that Americans pay for shallow junk like this to make their own films look better. Notting Hill is a self-conscious comedy, with all jokes clearly sign posted, and all periphial characters 'wacky' and 'zany'. There's Grant's crazy sister, overbearing mother and his effeminate employee. Aren't all us crazy English exactly like that? Well, no, not compared to the Welsh character, whose every line and pace is so predictable so as to bore off the screen.Writer Richard Curtis even gets in a bitchy dig at the film industry when Grant reads through Robert's (American) film part. Commenting on the writer, he double takes and changes it to 'writers'. Fine if your film is Citizen Kane, but when you've just written Notting Hill, it seems a little ill-advised to criticize others. Grant and Roberts do quite well in the midst of all this sub-realism, but at the end of the day Robert's character isn't that nice to begin with.",5,0,1,31 May 1999
Grease," 'Rizzo! Genoffathatthiganoffashun!'
","I was amazed to find that, at date of writing, Grease had scored less than an average 7 with IMDb voters. Surely this film is a classic, an iconographic representation of an age? That is, not the 50s, but the 70s, where filmmakers were becoming more knowing. Grease stands as the greatest of all film musicals as, while possessing the requisite laughs, character, romance and song; it is also ironic and self-aware, which puts it way ahead of turgid and dated bores like 'Carousel' and 'South Pacific'.Of course, we've seen it a million times now, so there's really not a lot left to say. We can still thrill to Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, she the better singer, he the better dancer, neither of them terribly good as actors. We can still be amazed that Stockard Channing as Rizzo never really took off after this film, largely absent from the screen until 1993's 'Six Degrees of Separation'. What really helps with the superb set-pieces are the fact that each of the supporting players get more than a cursory character, each holding their own sub-plots well. My personal favourite is Doody (Barry Pearl), who, while not getting a lot to do, meaning his name isn't that apt, does get to perform some very funny faces. Then of course, there are the songs. Maybe the supply of good songs run out just before the end ('We go together like ramalama dingadingadong', anyone?) but for the most part they're first-rate. The lack of strong song material was what really hindered the weak sequel, Grease 2. Instead of traditional structures of verse-chorus, the 1982 movie had characters merely melodising straightforward lines to a tune. Even the teacher joins in at one point, seriously negating the cool. Catchy choruses were out of stock, with extended words inadequate substitutes. 'We're gonna scoo  oo - oo  ore tonight' goes one song, forgettably.  Other songs sounded like weak rip-offs of the original's 'Sandy'; with only 'Girl for All Seasons' being a worthy number. Two other numbers managed to become more than their parts, such as 'Back To School', thanks solely to a blistering vocal from Levi Stubbs off-camera. The other, Cool Rider (again, chorus: 'Coo  ooo  ooo  ool ri  der, Coo  ooo  ooo  ool ri  der') was saved by a seductive interpretation by Michelle Pfeiffer, suggestively riding a stepladder. Maxwell Caulfield was okay as the English Michael, (Though was Cliff Richard to Travolta's Elvis), but generally it was an artificial and lifeless retread, the others (Pfeiffer included) adding shame to their resumes. Grease is a brilliantly witty pastiche of 50s b-movies, whereas Grease 2 is a not-so-witty pastiche of Grease. Like a photocopier, duplication always produces inferior copies. Thankfully Grease is one of the few films  unlike say, Planet of the Apes or A Nightmare On Elm St.  not to be denigrated in light of its sequels.But now that the dust has settled on this one, all that's really left to ask is questions. What sort of moral message is being handed out by a virginal girl only achieving happiness by dressing as a slut?; What is the line that Kenickie shouts to Rizzo on the fairground, almost inaudible?; Who is the guy that sits alone in the stalls for the girls' perspective on 'Summer Nights?'  is it a cameo?; why have I seen two versions of this film, one where 'Summer Nights' ends in a split screen, the other not?;  Isn't it ironic that the drive-in plays an acne commercial, ending with the line: 'It's time to face up to Face/Off'; Lastly, we can also marvel at the laughable stupidity of the BBC, who, every time this film is screened, crudely edit out a whole verse of 'Grease Lightnin'' because John Travolta couples the word 'tit' with 'sh**'. Yet then leave in the entire next verse as he proclaims his car to be a 'real pussy-wagon'!!! Finally, if nothing else, watch this for the spot-on 50s take-offs (The Greased Lightnin' visuals; Olivia and John in the prologue with deliberately cheesy dialogue and 'Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing' playing in the background; Frankie Avalon appearing as an agony aunt angel); or for Barry Gibb's superb theme score. An exceptionally good movie.",8,2,5,10 July 2000
Cast Away," 'So... that's it.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Robert Zemeckis had a brilliant idea for a film... strand Tom Hanks miles from civilisation on a desert island. The only down part is he decided to bring him back.Bobby Zee does well with the directing duties, though still lacks the sufficient maturity to carry it off to its full potential. Witness the opening scenes where a rather obvious point of view shot follows a parcel from site to site... fine for a fast-paced, cartoon-like actioner, but incongruous in a film like this. But a genuinely unsettling plane crash takes us fairly quickly into the main objective: the desert island.Despite their being no women on the island, Tom still manages to catch crabs. In fact, that's probably one of the better effects, as surely animal rights activists would prevent a real crab being skewered on film? The film also gives us a whale, though neither is as groundbreaking as Zemeckis' achievements with product placement. Instead of all that pesky putting them slyly into a scene, he simply makes Federal Express part of the plot. Though this full-bore advert doesn't stop Bobby Zee sneaking in a can of Dr.Pepper, the little tinker!Some of the first things Hanks comes across are a rotting corpse and a football, which he respectively buries and hurls away. Presumably in a jealous rage in case they act him off the screen. Hanks' much-touted weight loss reminds you of one of the most famous actors to attempt such a feat, albeit in reverse: Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. The comparison isn't favourable. Can you imagine Tom Hanks in Taxi Driver? ('You talkin' ta me? Cos if you are I'll buy you a lovely soft teddy bear and some sweets') But mickey-taking aside, Hanks does do commendably well in what is largely a one-man film, highlighting his character's madness without ever taking it too far into the realms of comedy. And his winsome, helpless expression is quite endearing... you know, sort of like a baby seal before you're just about to club it? Hanks spends a lot of the film looking at his watch, which is a nice post-modern touch as, by a curious coincidence, that's exactly what the audience are doing.There's a striking lack of incidental music, so that when orchestral sweeps do emerge they seem overly sentimental and out of place. In fact, they mark Tom's return to his old life, which is where the film falters slightly. While Hanks is watchable on his own, he fails to generate any real chemistry with Helen Hunt. Hanks philosophises to a friend in a chair, where he strings more trite clichÃ©s together than C.J. in an episode of Reggie Perrin. We then follow him driving his van, while the vague Elvis theme running throughout culminates in 'Return to Sender'. What would they have chosen if he were a priest? 'Devil in Disguise'?A garishly unsubtle religious reference wraps up a film that ain't bad, but is worthy of no more than... 6/10.",6,0,1,3 February 2001
American Psycho," Errrrr.... can I have my money back, please?
","That's what I would have said if I hadn't won free tickets. Even then I was half-tempted.American Psycho is a movie above average in execution but ultimately hollow with an anti-climatic ending the like of which I've never seen before. Obviously this is a no-spoiler zone so I can't reveal it, but suffice it to say that rather than the reality-shifting conceit that turns great films (such as Fight Club or Jacob's Ladder) into arguably greater ones,  turns this one into a thorough waste of time and effort.Can it be true that this film has already generated controversy? Surely not? Surely in the 21st century we're all used to disembodied heads and chainsaw massacres by now? And if all the right-wing lobbies that complain about sex and violence in movies spend their whole time watching the stuff in order to complain about it, then how come they're not converted into our very own Patrick Batemans? The film actually raises this point itself, with Bateman (Christian Bale), watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre while exercising.This being England, we got to see a version 4 minutes longer than its U.S. counterpart, as it included senses of lesbianism. It sometimes bothers me that the world is still full of such reactionism that such things can fall foul of censorship. What bothers me more is that films which usually attract such controversy as this usually have the saving grace of being actually quite good - A Clockwork Orange being a notable success in that field. American Psycho, meanwhile, is a fairly average movie, with gory violence that neither shocks nor compels, and a vaguely witty narrative that can be seen as satirical by the same sort of people that think Scream is cleverly ironic.Bale plays a psychotic with some interesting characteristics. He's anally retentive and talks his victims through the critical plusses of MOR 80s pop-rock. He's also pro-racial equality, yet homophobic and narcissistic. Some of these conflicting character traits are interesting, and Bale does well becoming a semi-monotone serial killer while managing to maintain a level of charisma.I must make a confession, tantamount to heresy - I haven't read the very popular book on which the film is based. But I see that factor as largely irrelevant; the film should stand on it's own merits, exist without it's source text. So I cannot judge whether it represents the visual ideology of the novel, or whether it betrays its concept. What I do know of the film is that while it does have some flimsy barbs about the nature of consumerism and pitiless American culture, it is ultimately shallow and without meaning.The cast are all great, the direction is good without being ostentatious and the dialogue is fresh without ever - quite - getting too silly. What it lacks is a core, or purpose. And when the final twist ending comes along, it defies all that went before it and makes you realise that you've sat through a film as pumped-up, self-serving and internally vacant as it's central character.",6,0,0,26 April 2000
North by Northwest," 'A little more polished than the others... but I'm afraid just as obvious.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
One of the better efforts from Alfred Hitchcock, a man who directed extremely well but generally chose substandard material.There's a frightening lack of innovation on display here. There are the usual aerial shots, and some panning upwards, though nothing as groundbreaking as forward zoom/reverse tracking. Though as with Psycho, this is a film that doesn't need any such gimmickry.The humour involved in any Hitchcock endeavour  his English sense of detached irony meeting the players' American Vaudevillian  jars as usual, though Cary Grant does better than most with some witty lines. It starts almost like a comic version of The Trial, with Grant caught in a fight for his life and with reasons he can't fathom. Things soon touch on vague Vertigo territory, with a 'meet a duplicitous woman in a hotel room' sequence. By the end, though, the whole thing has been wrapped up as one of the director's ultimately straightest  and therefore most accessible  works.Occasionally, the dialogue is a little trite  'War is Hell, Mr.Thornhill, even when it's a cold one'  though generally the script is quite snappy and sharp for this kind of thing. The shorthand characterisation is exemplified by Grant saying to Eva Marie Saint: 'The moment I meet an attractive woman I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her.' Wouldn't it be great if lines like that worked in real life? They don't, I've tried it. Worst scene is the crushingly bad exposition where the FBI discusses the plot. 'Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan, created to divert suspicion from our actual agent.' All the people in the room knew about this event, so why does the Professor (Leo G. Carroll, not a good performance) need to describe it, and the elaborate movements for the ruse? Okay, it's to relay the information to the viewers, we all know that, but it's so badly done. The only high point is that before the Professor starts this clumsy dialogue sequence his shoe squeaks on the floor and it sounds like he's just broken wind. Maybe that was Hitchcock's sly comment on the script? The situation is also redeemed slightly by having the Professor later explain the plot to Grant... only to have it drowned out for the viewers by the sound of an aeroplane. The revelation of the microfilm in the statue is also delivered less than plausibly, though this again may be Hitchcock's lazy sense of humour. Avoid the need for screen realism by presenting it as a joke.Yet despite these problems, it still largely stands up, though it's always a shock to see black actors cast only as porters or auction menials. The colour is also washed-out, and the use of filmed and scenic backdrops more than a little obvious. Though mere technicalities shouldn't prevent enjoyment of a reasonably fast-paced plot, and it does contain a passable recreation of Mount Rushmore on it's $4 million budget. This is a film that's over forty years old, after all. The crop duster attack is a sequence that has been ripped off/homaged in more films and television than can be counted, an infamous segment. And of course, the swirling, dizzying theme is brilliant. It's an enjoyable light thriller, but blown up to be hailed as a classic it can only disappoint. 7/10.",7,4,8,5 February 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," 'I'll be cack.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
Nah, I'm only kidding, this second Terminator sequel isn't actually that bad to be honest. That said, I have only seen it the once, and can't imagine its thin-even-by-Terminator-standards plot really holding my attention a second time.The original still holds its place as a quite impressive arthouse SF thriller in my opinion. Judgement Day? Well, it depends on how I view it - sometimes it's an overlong moronfest, others it's an exciting FX extravaganza and others it's a soulless, noisy popcorn machine. Certainly the day I posted my review of it to the IMDb I wasn't looking on favourably, though it's clearly superior to this pedestrian follow-up.What plot T3 does have (and with its subtitle 'Rise of the Machines' it could arguably be taken to court under the Trading Standards Agreement) seems to be dividing into two unequal halves. Remember those really corny episodes of Knight Rider (okay, all episodes of Knight Rider were really corny, but roll with me) where an evil KITT known as KARR would control Michael Knight's vehicle and turn it against him? Michael would have to stand there arguing with KITT's sense of reason? Even back in the days of David Hasselhoff's 80s perm that was dated, but here we have similar shenanigans with Arnie's battered T-101 under the control of the TX. The other, much larger, half comes directly from a straight rehash of Judgement Day.Unfortunately, this does get rather silly as it means that while the film delivers a reasonable twist, it does yet again contradict itself. The nuclear war will come... no it won't... yes it does. Though this development makes the phrase 'I am' possibly the most predictable in cinema history, the nuclear explosions are made to look quite beautiful. Whether this is a good thing or not is open to debate, and maybe with a bit of post 9/11 angst this would have made the film feel relevant, rather than just an old relic trying to relive glory days.Of course, the biggest problem making this an okay sequel instead of one you actually give a toss about is the TX. When a character is so rigidly defined by their sexuality as Kristanna Loken is, then it removes all tension. It's just not possible to be scared when your libido is being forced to work, and even by T2's standards there's an enormous amount of obvious humour, pushing it beyond parody at times. Okay, I did shame myself by laughing at the gay gag, but when it gets to the stage of the TX checking her reflection and squeezing Arnie's balls it's just gone too far. And with her superpowers there to attempt to top Robert Patrick's superb T-1000, we get silliness like her power over other machines and inflatable breasts. If the inevitable fourth film continues to build on this we'll soon have flying Terminators that can assume the form of small rodents.An okayish script is often dumb, allowing for back-slapping cameos by Dr. Silberman, and a nauseating plane scene where Clare Danes contrivedly explains how she used to test fly her brother's. Generally though, while there's the traditional reams of exposition in between pointless explosions, this isn't so contrived, and even offers up intriguing possibilities with the foretold death of John Connor. Commendably, even the paradoxes inherent in the concept are addressed, with Connor (Nick Stahl, quite good) reasoning that their actions may make the T-101 cease to exist.If I really wanted to be nit-picky I could cite the incredibly crude uses of product placement, but instead I'll just ask the question of what new does this sequel bring to the party? The answer is nothing. There is no real reason for this sequel to exist, though it is nice to see Arnie having another hit, when his lower-key successes of late have all been worthwhile (though The 6th Day was a stinker).The lack of usage of the theme and that eerie android sound effect surprise, yet the FX are, naturally, technically the most proficient. However, Jonathan Mostow's leaden direction fails to work them in any innovative way (and why do the Terminators now arrive in a disco mirrorball?), meaning they fail to impress. Combine this with the fact that such effects are no longer groundbreaking, as they were for T2, and it's something of a let-down. Forward to 2004 and we now have Governor Schwarzenegger of California. Was this his half-hearted farewell?",5,0,0,6 March 2004
American Beauty," The Fall and Rise of Lester Burnham
","I would suggest that the makers of this film have no real sense of irony. A shame, because if they did then maybe American Beauty would be a great, as opposed to merely quite good, movie.During the first 90 minutes I was tempted to give this film an 8 or 9 (though not the 10 that a staggering 53% of voters have given it), but its final quarter made me drop this rating to a more realistic '7'.The picture is beautifully shot, as befits the title, with its imagery of pure red roses against the naked human body a cinematic high point. I must confess to being a little disturbed at seeing 17 and 21-year-old girls (though both presented as 16 year olds) having to perform topless shots, though not the elder Annette Bening, who keeps her blouse and bra on even for sex scenes. Okay, that's a knee-jerk reaction I admit, but seeing a virtual minor disrobing is a little disconcerting in a movie. Then again there is much about American Beauty that is subversive. Does this film contain the most prominent usage of cannabis on celluloid? There is no moral debate about its use; other than it makes you high.It's hard to describe what the film is actually about, as it has so many themes and issues coursing through it without it ever feeling forced or scattershot in it's approach. The basic thread of a man's midlife crisis and the stoic nature of middle-aged suburbia is something that was memorably approached in the British sitcom 'The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin'. Spacey doesn't end this film by faking his own death, though his wife (who is also undergoing a nervous breakdown) does have a tendency to scream in parked cars. The commentaries on the nature of beauty, death, sex and sexuality, commercialism and individualism are all well-noted, and it's worth the ticket price just to see Quantum Leap's liberal-but-macho Sam (Scott Bakula) as a homosexual. But where it all falls down is in its need to constantly beat the viewer with its 'issues'. We are never allowed to make up our own minds about what is being played out on screen, there is no ambiguity or need for interpretation. This is a well-made, well-packaged film, and Spacey gives a career-best performance, but ultimately its agenda is billboarded throughout its duration.This is certainly several steps up from the ham-fisted dictates of the similarly-overrated 'Truman Show', but cinema-goers can enter the auditorium and switch their brains off for its two-hour run time. That's not to say that American Beauty is dumb - far from it. Just that every nuance, every satirical barb is spoon-fed with a saccharine coating so that no effort is required on behalf of its audience. The last few minutes conclude with an over-earnest justification from Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), and Spacey wraps it up with a moral-of-the-story. It did make me want to take up weight training, though. Where's that bench press?",7,0,0,1 March 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Even machines need love too'
","So speaks 'Ginger' from the original Terminator. 2001 will see both the tenth anniversary of the sequel, and, supposedly, the third film in the series. As a result I decided to dig out T2 and see how well it stands up nearly a decade later; watched in a straight run after the original. The 1984 film was made on a meagre budget of $6.4 million and made somewhere around the $50 million mark. This sequel had a $100 million budget and has so far earnt over $620 million.  So it's clear where Hollywood would stand on the issue.Disappointingly, the two don't complement each other at all. Somewhere between the two James Cameron had lost all sense of film-making in a flurry of allocated budgets, and Arnhuld had graduated to ad-libbing 'I need a vacashun', with a hand-shaking, high-fiving Terminator that learns all about 'family values'. When the original was conceived, Arnold hadn't yet had his first big hit, (Predator), being nearer to Hercules Goes Bananas than True Lies. What happened to the egos of both in between is played out on screen, particularly the portentous monologues by Hamilton that are meant to be worthy and meaningful, but are more often unintentionally hilarious. This is a film, lest we forget, that climaxes with a 'moral of the story'. Did we all really like this kind of stuff at the beginning of the last decade?The original is a vibrant, moody, psychological piece, where the ironically named night club 'tech noir' acts as a telling counterpoint to the minimalist art nouveau. A film for adults, it featured healthy, but not gratuitous, sexual tone, and occasional usage of the f-word. The sequel is for teenage popcorn munchers. Swearing is toned down and sex is absent, forging a film that, in England at least, became a box-office friendly '15', as opposed to a restrictive '18' certificate. John Connor sports the t-shirt of a black rap group throughout the picture (Public Enemy), yet the music he plays on his scooter and the incidentals are there purely to capture the lucrative 'white rock' audience. So this is a Terminator that emerges leather-clad to the 'ironic' strains of 'Bad to the Bone', while moronic action sequences are feebly contrasted with Dwight Yoakam and Guns n' Roses.Was it always so bad? I certainly used to enjoy the overblown, overlong and overbearing 'Judgement Day' a whole lot more. Yet where the original had night, this one has day, in full-blown comicbook Technicolor. While the first movie had some of Cameron's trademark contrivance and overstated imagery (particularly the constant 'machines in everyday life' allusions), it was someway from the boo-hiss English villainy and Oirish jig-dancing of Titanic. In fact, the low budget gives it its feel. Very much a product of the mid-80s, music by obscure-but-dated group 'Tryanglz' plays, while mullet haircuts, frizzy bouffants and thin white ties can regularly be seen. The special effects may have dated (notably the back projections, Arnie's false head and the stop-motion exoskeleton), but the whole film is calculated for optimum-noir feel, so it doesn't really matter. Of course Arnold can't act, but that's irrelevant as he plays an expressionless cyborg. In the second film the cyborg gets feelings, and that does cause problems.Formulaic, the second is basically a rehash of the first, complete with 'bad Terminator commandeers a vehicle by saying 'get out' to the driver', HGV chase on a motorway and showdown in a machinery factory.  That bad Terminator is Robert Patrick, a slight man who doesn't really stand a chance against the twin might of a pumped-up Sarah Connor and the T-800 (weightlifter model). The fact that the main protagonist is wholly absent for a middle section lasting 37 minutes also dissipates any growing sense of threat, something which was constant in the first movie. Just as well he's aided by those magnificent FX, probably the major reason to watch the film, but also the least credible segment. Mind you, the expensive FX can't hide the rather obvious dummy that hangs off the back of Arnie's car, then abruptly cuts to a Patrick close-up. Reminded me of Benny Hill. Even less effective is a (cut, thankfully) scene where his hand turns stripy, as it uncontrollably emulates his environment. This was, of course, the other big selling point of the film, where, two years later, a 'director's cut' of reinstated cut scenes was released. Some moments, such as a morality debate over whether to smash the T-800's chip add nice touches to the plot. Others, like Arnie learning to smile, or a tritely-written dream sequence with Kyle, detract, and the film is stronger without their inclusion.Moreover, the intellectual properties of the franchise are changed. The first was a warning against machinery, this one a far-less-subtle take on war. Rather hypocritical given the amount of screentime taken up by firepower. Dialogue is naive at best, banal at worst. Take this line from Furlong: 'We have feelings, we hurt, we're afraid. You've gotta learn this stuff, I'm not kidding, it's important'. Furlong, in fact, like all the actors in the movie, is encouraged to deliberately overplay his role, with a high-pitched characterisation that can be quite abrasive.
The Terminator is the work of a man-woman team. The testosterone-led Terminator 2 was written by two males. It shows. It lacks depth, clarity, subtlety, and any kind of genuine relationship or characterisation. Aliens to Terminator's Alien, the only sore point here is that Cameron is responsible for both and should have known better. But he didn't, and neither did we, and so we bought a silly film about a sinking ship upon ourselves. And Arnie as the Terminator? No-one bothers to tell the dumb shmoe that if he succeeds in their mission  to destroy all Cyberdyne chips, including his own, to stop the great machine war  that John Connor will never have needed to send his own father back in time and will consequently never exist...",6,1,6,17 April 2000
Duck Soup," '... and that's why darkies were born.'
","It's possible to argue that this line from Duck Soup - and a later parody of minstrel songs - were attempts to satirise racial stereotyping. After all, Groucho's line was a nonsensical reference to a hit song of the same year, highlighting the absurdity of such a song.What is perhaps harder to argue (though frequently is) is that Duck Soup is any kind of political satire. As Groucho himself famously said, the brothers were 'just four Jews trying to get a laugh'. While the film does serve as a political farce, many of the targets seem to be touched upon by proxy, the movie's real purpose being only to keep viewers amused.This is where Duck Soup admirably succeeds, as a continuous stream of good to great material is served up by Groucho (the funny, wise-cracking one with the moustache), Chico (the slightly less funny but likable one), Harpo (the deeply irritating one) and Zeppo (the er... other one).However, one thing that must be noted is that the pace to the Brothers' films are often a little out of kilter by modern standards. The brothers work well together, but the guest cast never seem to be able to quite keep up with Groucho's machine gun approach to telling gags. As a result, every one liner is followed by an awkward pause as he waits for the others to catch up. The timing could have been trimmed in the editing suite, but it would have left a vastly shorter picture.Without a wholly satisfactory climax - this still in their pre-MGM, freefalling days - then the film does seem to abruptly end somewhat, leaving one to wonder how it has come to be regarded as an all-time classic of cinema. It's an excellent film, no doubt, and a very funny one, but its journey from initial mixed reviews to modern day canonisation is sometimes a little puzzling.",7,2,4,23 March 2008
The Patriot," Who do you think you're kidding, Mr.Gibson?
","After seeing The Patriot, I felt that maybe I was too close to the subject matter to give a truly objective view. Hence, I called my friend from the Southern States, Billy-Bob, and asked him to review it for me. Here's what he had to say:WARNING: BILLY-BOB'S REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SLIGHT SPOILERS'Well now sirree Ahm here to ree-view that damn fine American pickture, 'The Pay-Tree-Ut'. It sure is a mighty fine movie and ahm here to tell you wahy.First of all, it took me back to when ah used ta own mah very own Neegrow. One o' them gits treated like a dawg and cussed an' all, but he still shows some reespect to us real Americans. There's a touchin' bit where one of our guys turns to him and says he's proud to stand with this Neegrow and the guy looks back at him all respectful-like. Yessur, that sure is a touchin' moment. Anyways, it turns out it wasn't Americans that made 'em slaves anyhows, it was them damned English wut insisted on it.Those goddamn limeys are all over this pikture and they sure are mean sons o'bitches. Why, they be talkin' all funny-like and they be killin' wommen and chilren and we be the family men tryin' ta stop 'em. Wahy, one of them has two dawgs - real ugly lookin' critters - and evun they ignore him and go off with the reglar American guy. Wahy, one of them English bitches is evun so dumb we blow up her boat and she goes 'Why, look at them pretty fireworks' in that stoopid accent of hers. Why, that sure did make me laugh!!Mr. Gib-sun has a bit of love interest with a Joe-Lee Rich-hurd-sun. Why, she be talkin' all funny an' all too, like she ain't even a real American. I figgur she be a limey puttin' on a poor American accent which kinda don't make her much of a patriot appearin' in a film like this. But anyways, I furgive her, cos she is kinda preddy-lookin, though not as preddy as muh very own sister.There's some real heart-feelin' moments in this gosh darn movie too. Like when Mel's daughter can't even speak, she's been mute for years. But she speaks for her pa, she goes runnin' to him a'speakin', and he's a-cryin' like a man, and she's a-cryin', and there's violins and a big brass band playin' in the background all subtle-like. Or the bit where this real mean Limey who gets to live through all the film like a real villain should, and he's been burnin' wimmen and chilren and even a house of Gawd. He races up at Mel and he's got guns and ammo and swords. Mel charges ree-iiit back at im with the American flag. And it goes all slo-mo on us, and he charges, unfurling the flag of this fair nation while the battle drums play. Wahy, we evun git to have a go at those sneaky French fellas, too!There were tarms when I couldn't be-leeve this was a real American army. So to straighten this out they always have a guy playin' Yankee Doodle Dandee on a flute to make it all authentic-like. There's some darn funny bits in this too. Like when Mel's ree-crootin' some men and he goes in to a bar. He don't have no 'you want to join me?' non-sense. He goes 'God bless King George' and they all git their guns out to shoot him. And he goes 'Ah think ah came to the right place'.Wahy, this be a great film. There's lots a' speeches and stirring music and it makes you proud to be an American. There should be more films like this, like films where homo-sex-yew-als have to go to bye-bull classes and wimmin know their place. It truly is a great film and in no way a load of one-dimensional, hammily-acted, melodramatic, overblown sentimental trash with trite dialogue and the most blatant display of racist characterisation ever seen in a major Hollywood production.Well, ah sure hope you did like my here review, yessuh. And if you ever want to come down tu muh farm and meet muh barnyard animals, then you can do so anytime. Maybe if we get on an' all I'll truss you up real good and tight and chickenfeath-'Thanks to Billy-Bob there. One film the Australian Mel Gibson will never make? How about a tale of how the inhabitants of convict ships made a new life down under and murdered many aborigines. Every race has a past, Mel, isn't it time to let it go? What's your problem, anyway? Because we sniggered at your English 'accent' in Hamlet? Cos if that's the case, we wet ourselves when you 'did' Scottish in Braveheart. Or do you want to follow this and Braveheart to complete an anti-English trilogy?",3,9,21,21 July 2000
Rocky IV," 'Iv he diez, he diez'
","You know, I never really understood Rocky (7) when I was younger. I liked it, but I didn't really understand it. I didn't get that two men who go fifteen rounds without blocking a single punch aren't good boxers and would be brain damaged after one fight. I also didn't get that in the low-grade sanitised Scorcese streets of Rocky's neighbourhood that his friend Paulie using the word 'freakin'' is not an expletive, more a way to ensure a PG certificate. I never got that Adrian had a man's name. I never got that the time allotted for Rocky to compete with the heavyweight champion of the world  five weeks  is an extremely unlikely premise. I mean, never mind Apollo Creed, even if the champ was Frank Bruno you'd need longer than five weeks. Most importantly, I never realised that Rocky actually loses, a grain of realism that would thereafter be abandoned.Rocky II (6) is essentially Rocky with whistles and bells, while Rocky III (5) gave us a softened champ in the shortest of the franchise. The only Rocky film of the 90s, and, to date, the final instalment, Rocky V (4) gives Talia Shire and Burt Young get a little more to do than usual; Talia doing her narrative requirement of shouting 'Rocky' at vital fight moments, thus causing the brain damaged Rocky's Palovian winning reaction. Rather like The Rolling Stones continuing to tour, this film, while vaguely entertaining, is a rather sad parody of it's former self.Then there was Rocky IV. If you thought that Rocky III's 'losing in yellow, triumphing when wearing the American flag' was unsubtle, then Rocky IV proved that we hadn't seen nuthin'. Paulie is underused comic foil; pratt falling in snow and playing with his six-foot robot, while Adrian is virtually absent and James Brown puts in an appearance. A horrifically bad sequel, its runtime is played out with a series of images set to tacky 80s MOR white rock. One of these overwrought pop videos even has Rocky's life, in the form of clips from the series, run before his eyes. Survivor's Eye of the Tiger is now the opening theme, the old Rocky brass fanfare abandoned, while characterisation is minimal. It's unsettling how perfunctory the personal scenes now are. Whereas the first was about Rocky and Adrian, the fight almost incidental, by this time the fight was the whole film, the personal conflicts just an inconvenience to be got out of the way. Stallone, writer of all five movies, fails to realise that without these conflicts, the fights themselves lack any form of emotional resonance. What little dialogue this one has is absolutely abominable, all 'souls' and 'hearts' and Rocky's opponent claiming 'He's not human. He is like a piece of iron'. Rocky's opponent is Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lungren after jettisoning all charisma reserves. Drago is the product of steroids and artificial environments. Rocky, meanwhile, travels to Russia to fight him, using natural methods to train. So we see Rocky's nature juxtaposed against Drago's mechanical, clinical training; including Rocky felling a tree as Drago fells a sparring partner. Err is this supposed to be symbolic? I couldn't be sure, it was too subtle.In the film's favour, Raging Bull's influence does seem to have finally caught up with the franchise, with blood spurts now a semi-regular feature of the bouts. In fact, while the melon crushing sound effects have got so extreme they're laughable, the initial match between Drago and Apollo Creed is the most viscous fight of the series. It's notable that Rocky's opponents are always, by design of the limited filmmaking scope, one-dimensional bad guys. Apollo only got an extra dimension when he crossed over to the 'good guys' in Rocky III. Not that such badly drawn characters make a difference when you give a great performance like Mr. T. But Lungren practically falls off the screen in apathy, while Stallone's interest in the film and the character he plays has long since deserted him. Look at the scene where he stares down Drago after his match with Apollo. What is supposed to be hate in Rocky's eyes is merely indifference. The character of Rocky, too, has become a dull preacher, with little or none of the traits that first made him so endearing. It's stunning that the minor classic Rocky could become the minor turkey Rocky IV.Drago's menace is built up largely through persuasion. Never mind that he's what seems a foot and a half taller than Rocky, we're told that the average boxer can punch an average weight of 700 pounds. Drago manages 2150. So that when one of his punches lands  and land they frequently do  we get to feel it all the more. As the climatic fight draws towards a close, the stereotyped, cold, clinical Russian crowd  none of whom are shown to speak English  suddenly erupt into a chant of 'Rocky, Rocky'. At the end of the fight, Rocky takes the mike, something he had no interest in for the first film. Here he gets on his soapbox. We learn that the fight has been about two men killing each other, but it's got to be better than 20 million doing the same thing. You know, It's suddenly dawned on me! The whole film was a thinly veiled commentary on the cold war between America and Russia! Thank goodness Sylvester thought to write a speech explaining this element, it might have been lost on me otherwise, as discrete as it was. 'If I can change,' he bawls, 'then you can change. Everybody can change'. The crowd erupts! A bloke that's supposed to be Gorbachev gets up and applauds. My God, while a pile of absolute tripe. Such naive, unsophisticated, lowbrow mush that has the audacity to think it's a political satire. Yet the film's strength is that it's so bad, so mindboggling awful that it becomes fantastically silly entertainment. So silly, in fact, that it elevates a terrible film to a 4.",4,3,6,29 June 2000
Dark City," 'None of us remember that... what we once were... what we might have been.'
","24 May 2014:Dark City was one of the first films I ever reviewed on the IMDb, awarding it 4/10 and slating it under the summary title 'Hellraiser meets the Maltese Falcon for an MTV generation'.Rewatching it, I'm not sure what my issues really were, other than perhaps being slightly underwhelmed. After all, the plot - creatures alter your mind and your world while you're asleep - perhaps sounds more original and sinister on paper.Yet while it perhaps doesn't live up to its full potential, and has some issues with exposition and the odd corny line, it's still a very good film. One of my main criticisms was that the influences it has can all too clearly be felt, and, while this is still perhaps true, it has enough of its own identity to be worthwhile.It's possible that the extended director's cut aids enjoyment (ironically another criticism I had back in '99 was 'ultimately the film's only saving grace is its brevity.') and keeps some of the mystery later.If there is one criticism is that there's a layer of Burtonesque artifice throughout, and you're never in any doubt that you're watching something shot entirely on sets. This is partly the point, of course, but I can't help but feel it could have had more effect if it had been shot with a little more realism to accentuate the oddities of the script. Also unfortunate is the very mainstream Hollywood orchestral soundtrack, whereas something weirder may have helped.But overall, this is a decent film, well worth a second chance.",7,1,4,9 September 1999
Aliens," Better than the original?
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSAliens, the revisionist, formulaic sequel by James Cameron was the most successful in terms of audience appeal, if not in gross, and sparked off the mass franchise series we know today.The extra 17 minutes of the extended video release are actually quite vital, showing the fenced-in crew setting up computer sentries, emphasising the dire nature of their circumstance. Even more significantly, they added depth to Ripley by showing that her daughter had aged and died during the time she had been away. For Aliens takes place fifty-seven years later, where the shuttlecraft of the original (expertly recreated, even down to a look-alike cat) is picked up by scavengers. Once back on Earth, Ripley is emotionally blackmailed into taking a group of space marines out to the planet where they discovered the aliens, as it is now populated by a colony. The planet of the original is named as LV426, and the year the colonists inhabited the planet as 79. But which '79? For the sake of keeping it contemporary, let's assume it's 2079. Aliens takes place 20 years after colonisation, thus dating Alien at 2042. (Okay, I'm an anorak!) While looked upon as the most action-packed, a single shot isn't fired before the first 43 minutes are up. But from then on it's pretty gung-ho all the way, Aliens getting shot in the brains, etc. All the characters are known only by their ciphers  sorry, surnames  so that the rather sleazy, back-stabbing government official (who it's obvious is a traitor from the first minute), is named 'Burke', and the most macho soldier 'Spunkmeyer'. Cameron even tried to unite this series with The Terminator, having Cyberdene responsible for the creation of the 'synthetics'. He bottled it, and changed it to 'Hyperdene'. Weaver plays Ellen, lest we forget, though introduces herself as 'Ripley' to all, including the frightened Newt. Henn gives a good performance as the orphaned girl, along with Biehn and the underused Henriksen. The rest, though, are merely juvenile military types, ready to get blown away. And that's basically it. The crew never become real people, save for perhaps Biehn, as they are all stereotypical macho types, including the women. Cameron's direction is adequate, though the use of fades is a little obvious. Effects are obviously an improvement, this being seven years later in filmic terms, though shots of the actors in front of large explosions are notably fake. For its time, Aliens was state-of-the-art, but now it has been surpassed by others (including, ironically, Cameron's own later work), it must be judged on other merits. And that is where the problem lies. For away from the dumbed-down action and non-realism of the plot, there is little to recommend it. And surely Ripley would have been torn apart by the lack of air pressure at the climax? So that's Aliens, then. Good, nonsense, shoot-'em-up, just like the video games. But little else. Better than the original? I don't think so. Though Ripley does get bigger pants. 6/10.",6,34,60,9 November 2000
The Exorcist," 'I love to talk film. Discuss, to critique'
","How then to judge a film? That's a question I found myself asking after reluctantly deciding the Exorcist was worthy of a '7'.I know of people that would downgrade works despite their aesthetic and artistic merit if they include, for example, violence. Though I feel in assessing a film or any other piece of art then one must judge it objectively. And so we get to the Exorcist. Well-acted, by Jason Miller and Linda Blair especially, it cannot be faulted in terms of direction. Though light and shade contrast beautifully in the Georgetown sequences, it is the cinematic vision of Iraq in the prologue that deserves special praise. On a technical basis, the film is not quite as good, particularly the scene where Blair has an obviously artificial stomach with 'help me' written on it.This is a film that was banned for fifteen years in England until 1999. While I would stand against censorship and welcome the release of 'A Clockwork Orange' next year (if only to discuss how good it is in this country without fear of being arrested) part of me wishes The Exorcist had stayed banned.Fans of the movie protest its psychological, and maybe it would have been if the director hadn't removed huge chunks of scenes between Regan and her mother at the beginning. (And what kind of mother would play a game of ouija board with her daughter?) It's supporters also protest that the film is religious, though again maybe this would be the case if a dialogue scene between the two priests hadn't been excised from the final cut. What remains is a depiction of the Devil that demonstrates it's wickedness by defiling a young girl. This is where the film  nicely shot and acted though it may be  falls down.I do not call a girl's head spinning 180 degrees, spitting pea soup or badly lip-synching to a demon's voice psychological. Creaking in the attic IS psychological. A cherubic young girl lousily miming to someone saying the 'f' word is not. Take away the choreography and it's a schlock-horror film just like any other, but with fancy trimmings. Seeing a priest punch a girl three times in the face is not horror but gratuity. In order to show the evil, Regan (Blair) attempts to force her mother (Ellen Burstyn, Oscar-nominated but largely one-note) to perform oral sex on her. Before this happens we have Regan soaked in blood after masturbating with a crucifix. And there lies the crux of my argument. I don't like minors (Regan is identified as just 12 in the script) being placed into scenes with sexual content or connotation. Seeing a nude girl being scrubbed in a bath or having her top pulled down to be examined is content that would be used for titillation with a much older woman. Lastly we see Regan (actually a 22-year-old body double, but still presented on film as a 12 year old) inserting the metal object inside herself. Think about that for a moment. If you met someone who claimed to have seen a film where a minor is made to appear to be masturbating with metal object and conducting sexual relations with her own mother  faked or not  you'd have them arrested for indecency.Yet hype tells us we have to regard what really is just a tacky piece of filmmaking as classic modern cinema. The Exorcist  0/10.",1,37,90,1 January 2000
American History X," Likeably absurd...
","Likeable albeit thoroughly preposterous nonsense that somehow sits in the IMDb top 40 ahead of titles like Modern Times, Bicycle Thieves and Rashomon.Edward Norton plays a white supremacist who learns love and acceptance of black people after going to jail and befriending a black guy who tells him jokes. He then realises that white supremacists aren't all they're cracked up to be after they rape him in the prison showers... something he later claims he's 'glad' happened.The film eventually enters an ever higher point of absurdism, as overblown, showstopping music - the kind only an American studio would think was appropriate - fills the screen. Scenes like two brothers tearing down their bedroom decorations of Nazi memorabilia are pat and simplistic, and too 'easy'. The plot lines take over the movie, and characters change from scene to scene because they're required to, not because of realistic motives. Even a typically eccentric performance by Avery Brooks can't rescue the film from its ludicrous premise.At date of writing, American History X is rated on the IMDb as the 35th greatest movie of all time, comfortably ahead of Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now. It's watchable stuff, possibly for all the wrong reasons, but probably shouldn't even be in the top 350, let alone top 35.",6,0,1,13 November 2019
Saw III," 'I'm human. I'm human just like your son was.'
","And there was me thinking he'd probably be a labrador, or a small goat. It's bad dialogue, though surprisingly it's not the worst offering in this tired, repellent sequel.I was shocked to discover that the writing team is exactly the same as it always was through all three movies, meaning that the same hands that were behind the inspired and original Saw are responsible for this repugnant dross. As Darren Lynn Bousman was behind the first sequel - which was also inferior, though nowhere near as bad as this - then it's possible that it's his direction that kills it. Certainly he's not able to get a decent performance out of Angus Macfadyen, or give us characters to care about. His obnoxious jump cut cinematography only serve to distance the viewer from what's going on in the fiction of the piece.Whereas once Saw was about the inventiveness of the situation, here it's just about the grotesqueness of the mutilation. Borderline misogynist at times, there are even traps with no escape, just a high level of blood count. The news that a fourth film with Bousman but with new writers is in pre-production is sad news indeed. The original Saw was a striking movie, but sadly the $ talks, and more of these will continue to be made, to ever decreasing returns...",4,1,2,10 March 2007
Yesterday," Likeable predictability
","A likeable if rarely surprising tale whereby Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) finds himself in a world where the Beatles never existed. Deciding to sing their songs, he becomes the biggest global artist in the world, while his unrequited love looks on.It hangs on tenuous logic, of course. The Beatles didn't exist in a vacuum, and so their absence from the world would have had presumably more impact than just Oasis being amusingly but somewhat cruelly slated. Certainly the Rolling Stones that still exist in this world would have needed a new second single and different backing vocalists for We Love You. Other things have disappeared from the world, too, such as Coke, cigarettes, and - as this is a Richard Curtis movie - working class people.But such discussions are immaterial, as this isn't a reflective sci-fi piece, but a 'feelgood' romantic comedy that's fairly charming if never particularly anything you didn't expect. Even if you weren't aware that this film was written by Curtis, you'd guess it from the formula that's there... the British film that's sold entirely on its appeal to America; the eccentric parents; the 'zany' best friend who has anti-social tendencies but not in any way that's offensive or unpalatable.Despite being a multicultural film, every character is also an 'easy' and 'safe' middle class character with zero rough edge; the lead character and his parents three Muslims played by people with Hindu and Sikh backgrounds, and given the name of 'Jack', 'Jed' and 'Sheila'. It's a cute film, sometimes cloyingly so, and, apart from one swearword at the end it's one you can comfortably show your grandmother.The real big issue here is the trailer. For some reason the last few years have gone from trailers being there to... well, trail a movie... and into things that contain enormous, massive spoilers. Some notable recent examples in the 'do I even need to go and see it now?' category include Batman vs. Superman, which killed any vague suspense that may have been generated by showing a clearly post-battle duo on good terms; or Stan & Ollie, which showed... well, pretty much the entire film.It's trailers made by the mindset behind Planet of the Apes having DVD releases with the Statue of Liberty on the front cover, and Yesterday is that most amazing of products - a film that was released with every. single. major. plot. point. shown. in. the. trailer. This reaches such extraordinary, outrageous lengths that plot twists that take place less than TEN MINUTES before the end credits are shown in the trailer.Presumably the makers assumed that Richard Curtis scripts are so predictable there was nothing to spoil, and, apart from a scene where John Lennon appears as an old man, never shot dead in 1980, it's all very 'safe roads' and a fantasy world that never exists... entertaining, but often threatening to drown in its own saccharine. Jack's world may no longer have Coke, but it certainly still has more than enough sugar.",7,0,0,13 October 2019
Quantum of Solace," That difficult second movie...
","I was one of those people that got to feel smug after always giving Daniel Craig more than the benefit of the doubt before Casino Royale. He was great in that, and he's great in this... or at least, he is when his stuntman gives him chance to appear.I kept being reminded of the second Indiana Jones movie, which was really just an extended series of chase sequences threaded together with little narrative. This is Bond's Temple of Doom, just a non-stop roller-coaster with no chance to breathe... we even get a series of stunts and explosions before we've even had any real groundlaying exposition. It's a film that wants to run from the outset before even giving you time to get into the starting block... and apologies for the corniness of that analogy.With the all new, all realistic Bour... er, Bond franchise, then it's all presented so seriously that the hyperrealism can be a little unintentionally silly at times. Falling hundreds of feet, getting in about ten lethal fights and escaping exploding buildings beyond all laws of probability are okay if your lead villain lives with ninjas in a volcano. When it's a 'straight' movie then it does push it towards the limits of suspension of disbelief... in fact towards the end I kept expecting Bond to escape a nuclear blast by jumping into a fridge. The fact that the movie keeps reminding me of Indiana Jones - a franchise I don't particularly care for - is telling.The use of violence and sexual violence against women as a means to show how evil the villains are is troubling, and the rudimentary conclusion, wrapped up in a couple of minutes, makes you realise just how little plot there actually is. Don't get me wrong, this is very well made entertainment, Craig is still on fine form and Judy Dench is for once exceptional.... a self-conscious bore with the bland skincare commercial Bond, she shines with this sixth incarnation. It's fast, it's pacy, it's always watchable and there are glimmers of depth, but it's never going to be anyone's favourite. Still better than any Bond film since at least the 80s though...",7,2,4,9 November 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," 'Thank God for site B.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Thank God indeed, for Lost World is vastly superior to the original and I'm amazed it hasn't been appraised as such. Maybe it's due to the lack of spectacle and novelty, which was, conversely, the only notable thing about the first. Though if it's Dinos you want there are more here (though admittedly shot with less cinematic scope, and, considering this film was made four years later, the CGI looks considerably less impressive). Yet while not giving the dinosaurs their full majesty, the direction is superior in every other respect. That's another problem, or plus, with the film. It deals far less with the blockbuster impact of T-Rexes, but with the actual motivation of the characters.Another success is that only the interesting characters are retained, with Gold, um, Goldblum as nervously engaging as ever, and Attenborough as a cameo, this time completely forgetting whether he's supposed to be English or Scots. Plans for the third film - bringing back blandies Sam Neill and Laura Dern - do not bode well, however. One of my favourite moments in a more thoughtfully shot film is Goldblum's introduction. After watching a cod English family playing on a desert island, the family screams - to cut to Goldblum's mouth wide open on a desert plain. The camera pulls back to show him yawning, and the desert a billboard poster in a subway. It's a clever touch, and there are more. Jeff's ability to prick the whole absurdity of the whole premise is met with his self-referential: 'Ya boo!, that's how it all starts. But later there's running, and, um, screaming.'Okay, there's still the occasional awkward exposition, though this is Goldblum handling things, so it gets by. There's also the in-built character/plot device, as with Jeff telling his daughter Kelly: 'You've got a gymnastics competition, you've been training for that for months.' - cue Kelly backflipping and somersaulting dinos. However, this is forgivable, as 1. The entire film doesn't hinge on this contrivance; and 2. It's more natural, and Kelly has a much better developed character than annoying brat Lex from the first movie. Lex only existed to hack computers; Kelly has far more functions to a wider plot.In fact, everything is done better here: the (far less cheesy) explorers are joined by a group of game hunters, which adds a vital conflict, absent in the first. It's also an isolated island with no immediate help or defence capabilities. Finally, as this is an established sequel there's no need for clumsy set-up. Some perverse humour, such as a man stuck to the T-Rex's foot, is also a nice touch. This is overall a much darker film, both in brightness and tone, appealing to more adult audience. Some of the violent content could be unsuitable for younger viewers, and there's at least one genuinely scary moment, too.Perhaps the acting also has a lot towards making this the better movie. Because Pete Postlethwaite gets as much to do here as Goldblum did in the original (i.e. nothing) and has to utter absurd lines like 'I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death.' Yet, like so many others, he's a much better actor than the denizens of the 94 version, so it goes largely unnoticed. Okay, there are plot holes, most famously the 'how did the T-Rex escape on the boat?' Yet others abound, such as how did Kelly and Sarah get out of the tent when it was wrapped around a Dino's head? It matters little; the film is packaged with surprising courtesy, particularly in regard to the original's popcorn-fodder status.Lots of the setpieces are more inventive this time, too, with a truly spectacular 'falling on breaking glass' sequence. Its loose adherence to the three-act structure can tire slightly, as the film meanders on without any clear purpose at times. The ending, perhaps the weakest element, could have done what the original didn't: take the danger into a human environment. This does, in fact, happen, and, by the film's own rules (central characters never die) could have seen a few exciting moments of dino carnage. But the reason why it doesn't really count is that Spielberg-itis takes over and this element is pared down into comic setpieces, before the 'Rex is conveniently reshipped to the island. What should have been a wholly satisfying conclusion is neutered somewhat, leaving us with a Jurassic Park film which is well honed, yet ultimately feels hollow. 6/10.",6,1,1,15 May 2001
Velvet Goldmine," 'Personally I think it's meaningless'
","Imagine the most pretentious sixth form art student in existence. Multiply it by a thousand. Now picture the indulgent scribblings in the back of his copybook, hurled upon celluloid and coated with vomit. And, as Ewan McGregor said in Trainspotting, 'you're still nowhere near'.McGregor himself gets top billing in Velvet Goldmine, though only plays a supporting role. He portrays Curt Wild, witless parody of Iggy Pop. We're told Wild is from the US, which is helpful as judging from McGregor's accent it could be anywhere. A fine actor, he unfortunately takes the same tack as in The Phantom Menace - i.e. every time he says a line, a smirk passes his lips. He's not taking it seriously, and most of the others involved aren't either.Velvet Goldmine has a terrible reputation and I was all ready to give it a fair chance. I can usually find some merit in derided films, even Batman & Robin possessed thirty seconds that wasn't completely unwatchable. Other 90s superturkeys such as North, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and The Avengers contained the odd moment that stirred you from a comatose position. But Velvet Goldmine engenders not a second of interest throughout its overlong two hours duration. Even the shock tactic of nudity bores with it's indulgent direction, and I have to concur that it's reputation is fully deserved.A juvenile, exaggerated Bowie pastiche, it begins with an indecipherable prologue that links the story of glitter-spreading UFOs with the birthline of Oscar Wilde (No, I'm not making it up). This is stapled together by a Janet McTeer narration, poor thing, who must deliver some of the most ham-fisted; navel-gazing dirge ever put to paper.Christian Bale is a reporter who has an exclusive revelation up his sleeve - one which he shouts out in full range of other reporters, which kind of defeats the purpose somewhat. Anyway, his job is to uncover the secret life of Brian Slade, played reasonably by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. While Meyers (or his occasional vocal double, Thom Yorke of Radiohead) has an okay voice, the original material (sample lyric: 'like a peppermint eaten away, will I fight, will I swagger, will I sway?' - and that's one of the better ones) is made to look even weaker by having original period tunes in the soundtrack.This is a film which begins 'Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction, it should nevertheless be played at full volume', which is about as far up your own back passage as you can get. The title is meaningless within the film, and only exists as it turns out to be a Bowie album track. Oh, that's okay then. Just another indulgence to add to the mix. Writer/director Todd Haynes described this film as being like the effects of drugs. If that means meandering, banal and irritating, then he's succeeded. One of the very few times I've been forced to use my '2' vote, I was staggered to find that, at date of writing, this has over an average 6/10 on the IMDb. There's a moment in the middle of the film where Christian Bale is caught by his parents engaging in a solo sexual activity. By a staggering coincidence, that activity also sums up this film...",2,4,11,4 October 2000
Donnie Brasco," 'Fergeddaboudid!'
","For a movie that's only three years old Donnie Brasco isn't something people talk about all that much. Not exactly setting the box office alight, it's further proof that great pictures don't always translate into great financial concerns. Maybe it's the nondescript title - 'Donnie Brasco' is hardly awe-inspiring and gives little indication of what the film is about. It turns out Donnie is the undercover name for Joe Pistone (Depp), a FBI agent investigating the Mafia. He makes a connection with 'Lefty' (Pacino), which, while his initial integration into the group seems to lack conviction, soon builds up a watchable father-son relationship. Criticisms of the film - such as the forced nature of Pistone's behaviour becoming absorbed into the Mafia mindset - are largely irrelevant as this is a 'based on a true story' outing.Engrossing and eminently watchable, with first-rate lead performances and able back-up from Michael Madsen, this is an overlooked and extremely worthwhile film. The only complaint? Depp's first scenes, wearing the most fake-looking moustache in the history of the movies. But it detracts little from what is a highly skilled picture. So Fergeddaboudid!",8,104,129,3 July 2000
Mission: Impossible II," 'This is not mission difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission: Impossible'
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MAJOR SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!Antony Hopkins bookends this film with a brief cameo as Ethan's boss. I dunno about you, but I find it hard to watch the actor nowadays without being constantly reminded of an advert he did for a certain bank, where everything was 'big'. 'There's a big bloke with a big bald head and he's eating a big bag of sweets making a big noise. Then there's five big girls having a big chat through the film and one's got a big smoker's cough and she's hacking her guts up in a big way. Then there's a big idiot who left his big mobile phone on and it's letting off a big ring'. Yeah, the cinema can be an annoying place sometimes. But back to the film. There's a line of dialogue where Hopkins describes how by using a female thief on the mission they will reward her by deleting her criminal record. The record, he tells us, will be 'expunged' (pauses, then adds for those who don't know expunged means) -  'wiped out'. The whole film is like this. Every time a vaguely clever plot point is revealed, the movie then immediately spells it out in bright big letters just for the members of the audience too thick to get it.It's films like this that make you think you've either seen too many movies or that it's just blindly obvious what's going to happen next. This is no more apparent than with the wearily predictable series of face/voice doubles (c. Face/Off), the worst being Tom, running for his life, yet stopping to take off his mask. Hey, look audience! It was Tom all along! Even though the guy that looked like Tom is already revealed to be the henchman, here's Tom taking his mask off just in case you're dead from the neck up. Assuming, of course, you didn't know that the swap had taken place within the first five seconds anyway. See also: Oh My God, I cannot possibly guess what she's going to do with that hypodermic spray gun!!!John Woo's direction is the big star of the show (and yes, Tom does get to do a 'jumping sideways in slow motion while firing two guns simultaneously'), the colour of the movie a pleasant autumnal red/brown in contrast to DePalma's original clinical winter shades. In fact, he's the ideal director for this outing, as, while the first had pleasing complexity, this one is a by the book (if not - quite - by the numbers) actioner. The plot is non-existent, a mere 10 minutes' worth of events, to whit: bad-guys-steal-virus. Good-guys-steal-back-virus. The fact that this thin premise is expanded to two hours means everything else is just irrelevant padding and trimmings. Look at the first fifty minutes. Cruise steals a chip that tells him the secret of the deadly virus (Clue: It's deadly!) Yet we knew that before the opening credits, so why do we need to wait for Tom to find out? Like Connery finding out how they stole the nukes in 'Thunderball', this is a time-filling game of catch-up. And surely his bosses would have known what the virus was capable of anyway? This is expounded by a fat Englishman in a hospital who only exists to give the most blatant display of clunky exposition I've been privileged to witness. Except he comes back to life or something, and I must admit I didn't get that bit, I was distracted - keep the noise down with those sweet wrappers!!!Dougray Scott is good as the Scottish (what, not English?) villain who pronounces Ethan's surname like it's a form of East End rhyming slang. Thandie Newton's appearance in the first half of the film revolves around her breasts, while the second sees her redundant and looking pensive to what sounds like the lovechild of Clannad. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames; the cool-sounding stereotypical black guy that does all the work while the Caucasian with the impossibly white teeth gets the glory. I half expected his credit to read 'Uncle Tom', but I was left disappointed.Things to look out for: a blatant steal from Darkman (and I'm not talking about the faces - think cigar cutter time) and an ending which - perhaps geekily - reminded me of the last McCoy Doctor Who story. Except that after the Doctor did a motorbike clash, he didn't end it by beating the crap out of the Master in a martial arts video game that went on and on and on for fifteen minutes. Maybe I'm just not enough of a bloke to appreciate it, but my testosterone is of a controllable level, so that I don't watch karate fights that bore and go 'Wow! That was way way cool!' I just think - where's the plot?If this were the first film in a franchise then I would be predicting its demise. As it's a continuation from a superior original then I guess it does a reasonable job of treading water and will ensure that Cruise will once again take on board a mission that is, if not impossible, then moderately entertaining.",4,0,0,12 July 2000
Annie Hall," Allen's most essential and accessible picture?
","Manhattan's the better film, but there Allen's alter ego is a fundamentally selfish character. It's beautifully shot and well-written, but it's harder to like a picture where the central figure is a self-absorbed user in the middle of a relationship with an underage girl.Annie Hall has no such problems for a casual audience, even though Allen does his usual neurotic, self-regarding schtick and his predilection for European cinema. This may be an issue with Annie Hall, in that Allen's character is an intellectual snob, whereas in Manhattan (8) he's well aware that the worst person in the room is himself and he's even intimidated by the intelligence of Diane Keaton's Mary Wilkie. In fact, as the titular Annie Hall then this issue is reversed, with Annie feeling she's not educated enough for Allen's Alvy Singer.Regardless of comparing the 'two big ones' against each other, it can't be denied that Woody was on outstanding form in the 1970s. There's the final cast offs of his all-out comedy vehicles with the likable Bananas (6) and the patchy, hit-and-miss Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (qv). Add to this the imaginative silent homage of Sleeper (7) and an attempt at a serious drama with Interiors (7). The Bergman influences may be too keenly felt at times, not just with Interiors, but with a lot of the work, yet it really is Woody at the top of his game.Sole aberration for me is Love and Death (4), a popular entry but a pretentious farce that I find extremely grating. Yet back to Annie Hall, and it's probably the most accessible of his pictures. Sketchy, true, and Allen would learn more about genuine narrative structure in the future, but there's some experiments largely unique to his body of work, including characters walking through their own memories and Woody breaking the fourth wall. One criticism with Woody Allen's movies is that they do have a tendency to be similar, but there's a freshness and spontaneity at play here throughout. Yet what puts Annie Hall above all others is that Woody was rarely more likable than here, and all the great Freudian gags in the world can't compete with the charm of Allen and Keaton genuinely laughing during the lobster scene.",8,3,5,12 August 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," Stands up to the test of time extremely well... though the channel 'BBC 12' proved to be optimistic...
","Strangely enough, I saw this film again the day after I first saw Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. One of the films is clearly superior, with outstanding direction, sound, visuals, music, plot, scripting, design and execution. And it's obviously The Phantom Menace, isn't it?Seriously, though, 2001 is a real slap in the face for George Lucas, a film that has all it's effects constantly on show, but never to the effect that they seem ostentatious. Lucas, on the other hand, uses Phantom Menace to throw everything he's got at the camera, a mind-numbing tedium of sfx, rather like a six-year-old throwing a tantrum at jelly and ice-cream party.2001 in comparison is elegant and sophisticated, taking it's time, showing it's effects in all their glory to an exquisite classical symphony. Beneath the visuals, which are absolutely stunning for 1968, produced on a tenth of Phantom Menace's cartoon budget, is an intricate plot. Rather surprisingly, Kubrick creates a wholly believable space backdrop, yet the men in monkey suits at the prologue look exactly like... men in monkey suits. Yet this exists as a perfect introduction, just as the psychedelia acts as a perfect coda. In the middle is the most successful element, Hal, a voice that can conjure both stolid calm and malevolence in the same monotone.
2001 is probably the most important science fiction film, taking the genre into the realms of art. And while I must apologise for reviewing The Phantom Menace almost as much as the film in question, this does serve as a very important film-watching guide: watching a terrible film before a good one enhances appreciation of the better work.",9,11,30,18 July 1999
Victory," 'Did it happen?'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Never mind Schindler's List, what about von Steiner's football team? It's the silliest-ever premise for a movie: did you know that Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone played a football match against the Nazis in World War II? What makes it even dafter is that real football players make up their team. Seeing Caine shouting 'leave it, it's mine' to PelÃ© and Bobby Moore is amusing, though despite the patently ridiculous plot all concerned play it with remarkable conviction.Stallone, to his credit, manages not to disgrace himself against assured performances from Caine and Max von Sydow, and even gets to do a 'bloodied, staying in the match as the final minutes tick away and his vision blurs in slow motion' bit a la Rocky. In fact, when a Nazi General starts clapping the victorious (actually it's a draw which is a weird outcome) Allied team, it may even have inspired him to make Rocky IV.John Huston, the director of such variable projects as the classic Maltese Falcon, the so-so African Queen and the abysmal Casino Royale, manages to bring some dignity to proceedings. The whole thing is quite offensive when given a great deal of thought. The idea that the deaths of men in concentration camps have been laid to celluloid as kindly Nazis just wanting a bit of a kick-about is a dubious form of entertainment.At a 110 minutes it's at least 20 minutes too long, though the final third with the actual match does generate sufficient interest. And of course, when an escape committee tunnel through into the Allies' changing room at half-time, you know that the team will insist on playing on. Stupid, but compelling...",6,0,1,24 January 2001
Super 8," Who saw THAT coming?
","A likable film with just the right amount of postmodernism... enough so it's a wink to the audience but never so it gets ostentatious or fails to charm. Sure, Super 8 is a movie with its influences on its sleeve, but it's genuinely likable stuff with some nicely drawn characters.While it loses its way a little with the alien section in the middle, what kills it stone dead is the Hollywood ending. Stirring strings, 'emotional' payoffs, letting go of a dead mother's memory in the sake of love, 'I love you Dad', learning to understand one another... the film collapses under the weight of mawkish, overstated sentiment, something which had never troubled the other parts of the film. In this respect then it can, at least, claim to be a genuine tribute to Spielberg, a talented director with candyfloss in the place of sincere emotion.",7,0,0,7 August 2011
3 Idiots," All is well...?
","The prospect of a knockabout comedy that lasts for over 160 minutes isn't an enticing one, but luckily the title '3 Idiots' is something of a misnomer. There's some broad humour, 'comedy' characters and lots of scatological references, but also depictions of suicide and reflections on the human condition. Western audiences may find this tonal inconsistency hard to take, as an onscreen suicide by hanging is followed by one of many songs.The fifth Aamir Khan movie I've seen, he's an always likeable and engaging presence, but one criticism is that his characters never seem realistically flawed (Save for Dangal). Always the wisest person in the room, his 'think outside the box' method of living embodies many of his portrayals and his passing of philosophy to his fellow students borders on preaching. Khan has the likeability and charisma to pull this off and prevent it from being too cloying, but in a movie where he becomes a famous scientist, redevises an entire system of learning and delivers a baby, it's something of a surprise to see him near a mass of water at the end of the movie and not start walking on it.Currently on Netflix in the UK, there is some issue with the meaning of words and phrases being changed when translated: I know enough to realise that the subtitled 'ass' said around an hour into the movie is really 'dog', but I wasn't aware that balatkar (rape) was said throughout the doctored speech scene, with it changed to a more benign 'screwed' for the UK audience. An interesting article on how the difference in ratings between men and women could be divided (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-online-movie-ratings-werent-based-almost-entirely-on-what-men-think/) shows that this film would be over a hundred places lower if only the votes from women were taken. All, it seems, is not well.",6,0,2,5 February 2020
A Clockwork Orange," 'Amazing how real violence never seems real-real until you viddy it on the screen'
","The impact and notoriety of A Clockwork Orange can scarcely be imagined outside Britain.Whereas the film has been freely available across the continent, and has perhaps subsequently lost it's power, it's release in Britain after twenty-seven years has given a build-up and expectation that I doubt no film could truly satiate. While the movie has been screened through myriads of smoke-hazed student bedrooms on fourth-generation pirate videos for the last two decades, I still can't help feeling it's wide re-release will leave many feeling disappointed.Removed from this country by Kubrick himself, allegedly through fears of 'copycat' violence, the director insisted that the film would be released in Britain over his dead body. Rather an ill-fitting tribute, then, that the film should finally be aired after his death. And yet what a great tribute, for A Clockwork Orange is also a work that touches genius (though occasionally scrapes mudanity) and is arguably his finest.For nearly thirty years all Britain has had to remember this film is the very few pop art references that bleed into the mainstream culture. The odd Blur video that sees them dressed as 'Droogs', or an old creaky episode of 'Doctor Who', based on the movie, which sees the Master trying his own version of the Ludovico technique (a 'Keller Machine') to rid evil from prisoners. But now we finally get to see what all the fuss is really about.To be honest, time and the ban have robbed this film of much of its potency. The violence, outrageous at it's inception, is now tame by modern standards, and heavily choreographed. While it's vision of a future society is achieved on a remarkably small budget, there are times when that most crass of decades, the seventies, seeps through any sense of credibility. Camp in places, a whole plethora of 'light entertainment' stalwarts make this distracting viewing in its home country. Dalziel out of comedy-drama detective show 'Dalziel and Pascoe' rubs shoulders with the parrot-seducing wacky employment officer from 'The Young Ones', and Coronation Street's 'Fred Elliot', while the star of unfunny sitcom 'The 10%ers' takes a bow. Okay, it's perhaps possible to believe the denizens of the future will indulge in severe retro-kitsch, though Alex playing Beethoven on an old eight-track machine is a little disconcerting. Elsewhere, a prison guard resembles and acts like Hitler, all stomping and shouting, reducing the fabric of the film to farce. The lowest ebb of this dating is Alex and his droogs joyriding through country lanes. Whereas Pulp Fiction had Bruce Willis in a taxi cab to a filmed backdrop as a touch of post-modern lo-fi, here the 'racing scenery' played in the background of what is very obviously a stage produced sniggers from a more 'sophisto' audience of the 90s.Often, though, it is brilliant. Direction is flawless, and iconography and design are exceptional. The language uttered by the central characters is a bizarre concoction of pidgin, fabricated Russian, almost-Shakespearean English and common slang. A typical utterance, pre-gang fight is: 'How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou'.In fact, it is the first half an hour or so that is the film's highlight. While the violence is extremely tame by latter standards, it is the context with which it is presented that still gives it its capacity to shock. Scenes of rape are juxtaposed with the music of Beethoven or Gene Kelly, while overlaid is the indifferent, casual, semi-monotone of an outstanding McDowell. It is this combining of images that lends the film its greatest highs. A Nazi rally marching to the lightest strings of Beethoven is a remarkable cinematic achievement, though having a fantasy sequence where Alex whips Jesus seems to be over-egging the pudding somewhat.Yet after this startling opening the film starts to drag as Alex is incarcerated and the comedy is stepped up. Jailed for murder (in one of the film's most symbolic moments he fights the owner of a health farm with a statue of a giant phallus. She, in turn, fights back with a bust of Beethoven; sexual desire vs. culture), Alex is given the option of freedom. The basic idea is that he undergoes a sophisticated Pavlovian treatment, whereby images are displayed while he is conditioned to act in revulsion. Cured of violent impulses, or at least the desire to act them out, he is released back into society. The jail's Priest stands up and makes a speech on the ethical viewpoints of free will. This is another (minor) flaw in the film: the overstatement and unsubtle usage of moral debate. Allegory is jettisoned as characters take centre stage and siloquoise about the issues in a literal manner (the tramp particularly) before being silenced or beaten into submission.Alex's reintegration into society mirrors the beginning of the film, though lacks its verve through contrivance. No spoilers here, though his choice of bathtub song does stretch the boundaries of credulity a little. Then comes the worst scene in the entire film, where a nurse is seen retreating from a curtained bed after intercourse, her chest exposed. It adds nothing to the film and performs no function other than used as light relief or titillation. This casts doubt over the whole of the preceding work; has Kubrick been using nudity in the film to make a serious social satire or is the sight of bare breasts and defiled women merely a cause for arousal, or to laugh at, and to applaud?The picture is still one of the twenty or thirty greatest films ever made, and, because it has something to say, one of the ten most important. As for science fiction, I would place this amongst the three greatest of the genre (alongside Planet of the Apes and, ironically, Kubrick's 2001). But, with a film that has been forbidden fruit for so long, there is an inevitable sense of disappointment.",9,0,0,17 March 2000

Eyes Wide Shut," Colour-Coded Coda
","Stanley Kubrick's 17th and final film as director, Eyes Wide Shut felt like his equivalent of Scorcese's 'After Hours'. Both relatively low-key works directed by outstanding professionals, concerning a series of interconnected and ever-more bizarre incidents that befall one man in the underside of life.Where Kubrick's differs is that it has no thread of humour and takes a dark and regularly disturbing path. Interestingly, the action can be largely predicted by the colours used within. For longing and inactivity there is a blue hue shrouding the players. For unrestrained sexual desire and activity there are oranges and autumn reddish shades, be they the lighting or the backdrop.In the middle of this is Cruise, spectacularly turning his back on the macho roles of 'Top Gun' that have held him down for so long. There are points at the beginning of the movie where he looks a little strained, as with Kidman at the end of the film, though this can be largely put down to Kubrick's 50-100 takes, and both generally give career-best performances.On the negative side, some of the incidental music is too instrusive, particularly the piano stabs, which seem to want to be Psycho-Jaws with bells on; though there is a neat joke that Kubrick pulls twice by having the soundtrack playing, only for Cruise to turn it down as part of a CD in the film. There is a nice use of fades to break the scenes cleanly, and scenes are sustained, though often the jump cuts are botched and the film literally jumps and crackles and one piece of film follows another. Who did the editing on this one, Edwards Scissorhands?Ultimately, if the film gets bad press then it would be in the wake of being the arguably the most-hyped Kubrick movie, save A Clockwork Orange, and an anti-climax (no pun intended) is inevitable. After two years in production we had a right to expect a classic, and Eyes Wide Shut isn't it. Though while not scaling the heights of the aforementioned 'Orange', or even living up to '2001' or 'Dr. Strangelove' (how many films could?), Eyes Wide Shut is still a worthy film to enter the Kubrick canon and a worthwhile film for him to end his career on. His autumn years never produced such genius (his previous film, Full Metal Jacket, was, let's be truly honest, nothing outstanding), and Eyes Wide Shut is probably the best of his last four directoral works. One of the major problems is that it doesn't seem to have anything to say, although it's interesting how some intervention occurs every time Cruise tries to conduct extra-marital conduct, as if some moral guardian angel is watching over him. While the amount of sexual debauchery can seem far-fetched, the actual sexual act is overplayed on advance publicity and actually has very little involvement in the final product. The much-discussed 'orgy' (childishly and detractingly edited for American release), is over in little over a minute, and strains towards art rather than pornography, as one would expect from Kubrick's stature.Warning - possible spoiler ahead. The largest weakness in the movie is the sense of pointlessness at the climax. While, again like 'After Hours', this film has an off-beat denouement, this one has no singing 'Is that all there is?' to enforce the irony and subsequently falls flat. Almost like a game, we have followed the three big stars (Cruise-Kidman-Kubrick) through 2 hours, 39 minutes of intoxicating plotting only to find we're supposed to wake up sober and leave the theatre on the nearest exit to your right. A dissapointment, but not enough to destroy what is still a fine achievement.",8,0,1,22 September 1999
Some Like It Hot," Some Like It Lukewarm
","An amusing, well-packaged comedy, but with the humour too broad and self-conscious to ever be the classic it's chalked up to be.There seems to be some debate over which of the two male leads is funniest. Clearly it's Tony Curtis (Who has recently denied he ever said his infamous 'kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler' quote - Lemmon insists he did), who gets a dual role, not just as a female impersonator but as a Cary Grant send-up. After this superb take-off you can never watch a Grant film in quite the same way again. Curtis is better looking, cooler and much subtler in the role than Lemmon. To this regard, Jack irksomely overplays his part, his mannerisms and body language constantly over the top. There are some great lines ('I'll make it up to you' 'You're making it up pretty good so far'; He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head') and, apart from dubious soft focus for Marilyn's close-ups, the direction is excellent for a screwball comedy. The decision to film in black and white was also a good move. And look out for some great in-jokes, such as George Raft scolding a coin-tossing crook with 'Where'd you get that cheap trick?'Perhaps the 120-minute running time is too long for the subject matter, and it does get a bit draggy in parts. Forty-two years have passed since the film was made, so that the somewhat naive laughs of gender and sexuality confusions no longer pack the same punch in a more enlightened age. Nevertheless, as an historical document this is still an important work.",6,7,22,1 May 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," 'Planks o'wood! I'm working with f*****' planks o'wood!'
","Just two short years since it's release, time has already made it possible to detest Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.For a start, this is the film that resurrected a trend for half-baked British gangster films (Circus, Love, Honour and Obey, Rancid Aluminium...), not to mention it's own spin-off television series. Sexist, racist, homophobic and charmless, 'Lock Stock' (3) was the ultimate extension of the 'new lad' mindset; only an irresistibly funky theme tune preventing it from being completely irredeemable. In the midst of all this it's very easy to forget that the movie which started it all is actually a halfway decent film.It's no classic, of course. Direction, themes and execution are all highly derivative. Then there's the acting, or lack thereof. The wooden delivery of many players is such that the stylised, witty/self-conscious and contrived (delete as applicable) dialogue sounds one hundred times worse than it actually is. Nick Moran, while being better than most involved, is possibly the most annoying, his poor man's Michael Caine routine wearing thin very, very quickly.In this sense it's perhaps fortunate that the movie is also the acting debut of footballer Vinnie Jones. Being surrounded by such underachieving thespian talent makes him seem a whole lot better than he actually is; though he does fine. The same can't be said of Sting, I'm afraid. There's also a nice cameo by Red Dwarf's Cat, Danny John-Jules, as a subtitled, jive-talking Cockney.Ultimately, despite it's obvious shortcomings, the multiple plot strands and timeframes of this movie are thrown together with such force, pace and comic-book vigour that it does make for passable, average entertainment. Just one question: why do they all call Tom fat? He don't look that porky to me! Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - 5.",6,2,5,23 July 2000
Titanic," 'Of course, the experience of it was somewhat different.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
This is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen, a modern day classic that allows for drama by having the lead character tell the tale in flashback, letting you know she lives till the end. This framing sequence neatly comes back three times, and we get a voiceover, cannily breaking up the narrative.It turns out the elderly lady was Kate Winslet, a rich society girl engaged to the boo-hiss pantomime villain played by Billy Zane. Well, he is English, after all. Anyway, this upper class madam soon falls for a cocky brat with a head shaped like a turnip, and starts performing activities generic of her class. Like spitting over the side of the ship and getting her boobs out. I did give the movie 8/10, but that was for Kate's mighty chest, rather than the film itself. Mind you, it's all quite understandable as Jack has an enticing line in fortune-cookie platitudes, spouting lines like: 'When you got nuthin', you got nuthin' to lose' and 'Make each day count.'Where it really succeeds is in its accessibility, like many Cameron movies. Rather than confusing the issue with all that characterisation nonsense, we have dialogue that is functional and neat stereotypes like the Irish crew that love to do nothing more than dance a merry jig. Whuy, it be straight out o' a advert four de Morphees. And just like it, they're not bitter. Well, they're the US's spiritual kinfolk, aren't they? Even the Scots and Welsh help a little bit, but the English can't wait to shoot the passengers. And only the Americans are truly heroic.Perhaps the stumbling block is the superb realisation of the ship itself. To correct this error, Cameron gives us some ropy CGI, from the background where Rose attempts suicide, to the iceberg, which is as two dimensional as Billy Zane's character. Apparently the cheap effects came about because, despite costing $200 million to make, over half went on Zane's mascara. Ooo, he's a real villain, he is! Another wrong foot is casting the RSC Jonathan Hyde. The thought of having a decent actor in the film is absolutely abhorrent, yet luckily it's not a mistake the director makes twice.But the masterstroke is the running time. Where a 90 or 120 minutes duration might feel just about right, Cameron drags it out to over three hours. Genius. Other great moments include the constant references to the ship not being able to sink, and the cod English accents. Any old director worth his salt could cast realistic accents, but giving it a touch of the Van Dykes is a feat of remarkable post-modernism. In fact, the only thing the film needed to take it to the very peak of perfection was a dreary love ballad at the end by Celine Dion. Oh dear.",6,0,2,26 December 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," Government Warning: This Film Could Seriously Damage Your Health
","It's A Wonderful Life is one of the perennial Christmas favourites, a seasonal treat that has the admirable trait of being screened annually at British wintertime, along with the incongruous choices of 39 Steps and The Great Escape. Why the latter two should be used, without fail, to mark a time of religious significance has never been discovered, yet It's A Wonderful Life's winter-set, ultimate 'feel good' atmospherics make this ideal for such a schedule-filling occasion. However, a warning should be issued to people that brave to see this film: it could end up making you feeling a lot, lot worse.When I first saw this film for the first time it was indeed the 25th of December and I had split with my girlfriend just three weeks previously. I had indulged in that bizarre male ritual of 'purposely losing touch with all your friends when you meet a new girl' and no buses were running that year to my parents'. Bear with me, this is no idle backstory, but did in fact greatly effect my appreciation of this movie.Endearingly shot, it concerns, for those that don't know the famous story, George Bailey, a man on the verge of suicide. So far, so able to empathise. A wonderfully surreal opening gives us Angels that are the stars and constellations in the sky, looking over key moments in Baileys' life, like a kind of supernatural Citizen Kane. This is all carefully wrought and contains enough sense of (stylised) reality to keep it watchable. When George's guardian angel finally arrives, it is in the form of Clarence, a vulnerable angel who is so saccharine-coated and self-consciously loveable that he could have walked straight in from a Disney production. He gives us a glimpse of George's life as if he had never lived, and shows the influences he made, sort of like Quantum Leap forty years early. This segment of the film rapidly sees the invention start to dull somewhat and the film capsize under the weight of its own overplayed sentiment. Yet I'm sure it's no spoiler to reveal the picture's parting 'message', (Though if it is, Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Ahead) that a man's life is always worth living, provided he is surrounded by people who love him.I looked around my empty house and suddenly that 'head in the cooker' option took on a fresh urgency...",7,3,8,5 December 1999
Love Actually," Is it possible for a film to be so smug that you can actually choke on it?
","Because I found myself gagging at this cavalcade of middle class self-satisfied dross and needed the sick bag when I saw Emma Thompson on the screen. Add to this a cameo role for Rowan Atkinson and we're in business.Yes, it's the return of Richard Curtis. You remember him, surely? He was the one who made us all laugh with his film about posh people who said 'f***' a lot. Then there was his follow-up film about posh people who said 'f***' a lot. Not forgetting the one about posh people who said 'f***' a lot. Well, he's back, still not presenting us with anything approaching a genuine human emotion and yes, posh people do indeed say 'f***' a lot. Well, to be fair, only a bit this time around.Because Curtis has at least branched out, making this the most watchable of his luvvied-up monstrosities by presenting us with a series of vignettes. Naturally, we get Hugh Grant and his 'I'm posh, whoops, I've said f***, and here's a dead pan take to a blatantly obvious social juxtaposition' shenanigans. To be honest, I do quite like Hugh despite myself, so he doesn't produce the biggest allergic reaction. Neither does Thompson, who gets the most depth, and the story that doesn't have a happy ending. Probably the biggest non-starter is the sweet rendition of All You Need Is Love which then unfolds into a full brass band playing in the church. Well, imagine that! A full brass band! In a church of all places! How I laughed.Some have actually criticised Curtis for not splicing his vignettes together successfully enough, like they're watching Robert Altman or even Kurosawa. For God's sake, it's just some tatty comedy for posh people who don't get out much, it's not supposed to be art. Yet while I give the writer/director some slack there, it must be said that not all of his pieces actually go anywhere. Particularly of note is the one with the talented Kris Marshall, who dreams of going to America where he believes all US girls will want to sleep with him because of his accent. So he goes there and... four US girls sleep with him because of his accent. And the punchline is...?Despite coming out of the noxious All You Need Is Love scene, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln do come off better than most, Lincoln because he gets to, like Thompson, show something beneath the self-amused surface, and Knightley, well, just because I would. Big time. Other highlights include two pairs of bare breasts, Bill Nighy in parts, two pairs of bare breasts, some gratuitous cameos, two pairs of bare breasts, an okayish yarn for Colin Firth and two pairs of bare breasts.But this is the wacky, zany world of Richard Curtis, a land where everyone is a great British eccentric, and even the sole working class character (Martine McCutcheon) and her family are just offbeat and loveable. It opens by allying itself with the events of September 11th, an event nicely re-alluded to at the end by a so-so scene that shows lax airport security. This is a world where everyone talks, hugs and can find true love... just as long as they're straight, able-bodied, middle class and good-looking. 
You do have to question in what reality the Prime Minister's nephews and nieces would go to the same school as the kids from the roughest end of town, though thankfully with Nighy's 'Christmas Is All Around' life didn't imitate non-art. On the one hand fairly amusing, on the other a smug self-reflexive reference to his own Four Weddings and a Funeral, the real record-buying public saw the film's No.1 Christmas single barely trouble the top thirty. It's a small phyrric victory in a war of bland.",5,5,9,6 March 2004
A Hard Day's Night," A Hard Day's Sh**e
","The Beatles have much to be praised for, genuinely breaking new musical ground in their careers. However, one thing that's often overlooked is how rubbish they could be, too. Aside from a momentary blip with the Help! Soundtrack they didn't produce a decent album until 1966's Revolver. While they had some halfway decent singles the first three years of their professional life delivered bland generic pap that sounded like a close cousin of Gerry and the Pacemakers. Their twee head-shaking antics are also cringingly embarrassing to watch now, and in all honesty only three songs in this film are actually any good.Ah yes, The Beatles films. Self-indulgent tripe the lot of 'em, from the plotless turgidity of Yellow Submarine to the Tragical Mystery Bore. Only George chucking his teddy out the pram in Let It Be produces any cinematic interest, so that while the superb Monkees film Head goes underrated, this pile of tat still gets criminally overpraised. To be fair, the direction is absolutely excellent, and the black and white photography looks superb. Yet while some of the one-liners are quite witty (Alun Owen's script certainly providing more mirth than the band's real-life Scouse banter) they are drained of anything approaching a laugh by the absolutely chronic acting. Shy George is predictably lame, though gregarious Ringo surprises by delivering a performance that can only be described as downright abysmal. John does little better, leaving it to Paul to be the one to hold any form of amateur thesping self-respect. The forced cheeky chappie dialogue and 'loveable scally' characterisations soon begin to grate, and whoever told The Beatles they could act should be shot. The string of repetitive set pieces is fine for blinkered fans of the group, though casual listeners may become more easily distracted.Most irritating bit is John's line about Ringo: ''Ey, 'e's reading the Queen. That's an in-joke, you know.' Oh really? Well if it's an in-joke then why include it? What it really cries out for is incidental music to paper over the embarrassing gaps between mistimed lines. Other than two instrumentals the entire action passes by in a ropily acted vacuum. Only player to preserve dignity is Wilfrid Bramwell, effortlessly eclipsing the others in this sorry affair. Other things to think about: People who resented The Beatles' later years when they got heavily into drugs like to imagine this period as an example of a wholesome band. Yet John does a coke joke with a bottle and Ringo admitted to being stoned when he filmed the canal scene. Also weird to hear George's original docker's accent in all its glory. A fictionalised 36 hours in the lives of The Beatles so fabricated their manager is a red-blooded hetero male. If this was a true reflection of the lives of the group then I'd feel sorry for them... for they must have had very boring lives indeed.",5,7,30,3 May 2001
Jaws," 'This is not the time or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSBut it's always a good time to dissect Jaws, one of the most iconographic  if not necessarily classic  films of the last three decades.I'm not normally a Spielberg fan, finding him often bland and sentimental. So it's a pleasant discovery to find a director who, with Jaws, was at the top of his game.Oh, it's all hollow, of course. No real message or depth, just a multiplex-pleasing piscine horror movie, yet the way each and every single shot is lovingly put together is truly commendable. There's neat touches, like Schieder's face zooming into close up while the background stays the same distance. Admittedly, he's ripping off Hitchcock left, right and centre, but he's doing it in such a caring way it doesn't really seem to matter. Other images stand out, such as the head in the boat, or the dead swimmer's buried hand crawling with crabs. (The crustaceans, not the STD). There are clever moments, like Roy looking through research pictures on sharks. Not only does this give out relatively discrete exposition, but also it gets in our minds the image of a real shark, a sense of foreboding that would cover over any misgivings when the actual rubber version finally appears. And with John Williams' supremely memorable 'der-der, der-der' incidental theme, Spielberg has a Psycho-rivalling sting to deliver home the shocks.A man coming out of his hut with the sign 'Harbor Master Frank Silva' is a little obvious in imparting information, but Dreyfuss' autopsy is another genius touch. In order to keep the film available to the widest possible audience, the gore is toned down. So what Dreyfuss' description does is to suggest it, which is scarier anyway. In fact, the first sighting of the shark isn't till nearly an hour into the movie, during which time Spielberg has skilfully borrowed and honed shots from classic cinema to blend into the picture. Characters walk too near to the camera, or in front of it, obscuring the view, while waves splash up it  all giving a subliminal illusion of reality.Yet it has to be said that the second half, with it's slightly camp incidental music, and ponderous male bonding dissipates the tension somewhat. It's as if Spielberg realised he was building up to something really special and lost his nerve. Shots of the shark itself actually amount to less than ten minutes of the film's duration, many of which are underwater shots of the real thing. Where the action (i.e. when he's eating the actors) dictates the fake prop must be used the movie is less effective. The rubber shark now looks, frankly, slightly ridiculous. It's ironic that while the shark is the thing on which the movie is based, whenever it appears it tears at the credibility of the piece. While the shark's indestructibility and extreme powers of devastation  'smile, you sonovabitch!'  is an air of the feint silliness that would be symptomatic of the vastly inferior sequels...",8,1,3,3 December 2000
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," 'A fine bunch of washers you lot turned out to be!'
","I feel ashamed that I only watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order so that my hard, cynical heart could launch itself into an anti-Disney rant. The most sentimental of the major cartoon studios, I was determined to ravage this one after seeing isolated, treacly clips.Yet seen all together I have to admit that I was softened by a talented picture that is genuinely charming. The somewhat dated animation resembles cut outs from a picture book with its pastel hues, and looks and feels more natural than the angular, jerky computerised movement of the modern Disney features. It helps that they also employ someone who can actually sing in the titular role, with an operatic blend to the proceedings. And it would take the coldest of people not to warm to Snow White's genuine innocence. I concede, I did wince a little at the cutesy blue birds, but this is vastly more charming than I had been led to expect.It's pacy, too: whereas some of the older Disney films tend to drag (I remember catching the aptly named Sleeping Beauty one Sunday afternoon), this one is suitably brisk in its portrayal of events. And while modern cartoons (or 'Animated Features' as they pompously like to be known) blow up the role of the 'director', this one really has its eye on cinematic technique. Just look at the early wishing well scene, shot from the perspective of the well bottom or the blend of images and dissolves when Snow White's in the forest.Many of the songs are classics, of course. Whistle While You Work is still something you can find yourself humming or whistling while doing the hoovering, The greatest contention for me though was the seven dwarves, who always struck me as far too self-consciously cutesy and grating to really like. Yet, come on  It's Off To Work We Go is a belter, isn't it?The actual plot, which is largely sidestepped to make way for the leisurely song sequences, is more than a little macabre. Even when Snow White's heart (her severed heart!) is substituted; it's replaced with a pig's heart... and all for a family audience. I'm not saying this one is morbid, but they deem Snow White (Or Snow, if we may call her that) so 'beautiful, even in death' that they refuse to bury her and place her in a transparent coffin. In a parallel universe somewhere there's an offshoot of this movie where the Prince arrives too late and her rapidly decaying corpse turns into a flesh-eating zombie. Maybe they should do that as one of their special straight-to-video sequels  after all, they're grave robberies, aren't they?It's a slightly strange plot, too, with Snow White spending the duration being plotted against by a bitter old Queen. And people say Elton John didn't get involved with Disney until The Lion King. Yet in order to elicit Snow White's trust she transforms herself into a scary-looking old hag? Why not just stay in her own image? And if she can transform her appearance like that, then why not use the same magic to make herself the sought-after 'fairest of them all'? Yet I guess if she didn't then we wouldn't have a story, and the apple ofference does have some religious connotations. This is a one-note plot, though, and subtext isn't the order of the day. Rather, it's the colour and flavouring of the piece that are there to be enjoyed, not the somewhat redundant narrative. And while, after the initial thrust, the film does lose momentum slightly, enjoy it I did, a delightful and wonderfully made cartoon. Yes, you can read into the white = good/black evil assertions, but for me I'd rather marvel at the songs and images, or make cheap jokes about MOR pianists.Just two minor points: why are they called 'Dwarfs' and not Dwarves in the film's title? And seven dwarves working in a mine? Is that an example of positive discrimination?",8,6,13,4 April 2004
The Lion King," 'Slimy, yet satisfying.'
","Okay that's a bit of an unfair quote, as The Lion King is that rarest of beasts: a really good Disney movie. Packed with all the formula highs of past successes (including, Bambi-style, the bizarre kiddie favourite of a murdered parent. What does that say about infant psychology?), yet its sentiment tempered with an Eastern outlook, this is a worthwhile picture.Cute, but never so that it's twee and self-conscious like most of the studio's output, the animation is more sophisticated than the now-creaky 'classics', yet it steers clear of the more angular, abstract pieces of late. This is a traditional cartoon, and all the better for it. If there's a complaint then it's perhaps the too-brief running time, stretching to little over eighty minutes. This is particularly evident when Simba grows from cub to lion within ten seconds, though the film does contain the requisite three acts.Some great vocal characterisation (Whoopi Goldberg's hyena even strangely looks like her), but I'm not sure about Scar though. So named because he's facially disfigured, he's also darker than the other lions, complete with black mane and has an English accent. Three Hollywood villain stereotypes for the price of one. Though as the voice in question belongs to the superb Jeremy Irons this isn't too much of an issue, and he does meld the film with a darker element. In particular the (delightful, mind) SS symbolism of Scar's army during the best song, 'Be Prepared'. The reference would be lost on the child audience, so it's pitched to the adults. I wonder how many holocaust survivors would find this in good taste?There are some decent jokes, many puns on the nature of lions  'As far as brains go, I got the lion's share'; 'I'm gonna be the mane event'; 'my words are a matter of pride'  and 'What's eating you?' 'Nuthin', he's at the top of the food chain.' The rite of passage plot is as generic as the majority of the songs, yet both are loveable in context. I don't know if Buddhists would approve of their philosophies being transformed into Mickey Mouse morals and tracks by Elton John, but it still works in a naive way. Odd too how the lions accept the nature of karma and respect for all animals. Whenever I watch a Richard Attenborough show they're always tearing out zebras' hearts with their bare teeth. Still, I suppose they had to keep it a U certificate somehow...Some movie referencing combined with violence towards the end are dubious occurrences. Yet that and a couple of fart gags not withstanding, this is an innocuous affair that epitomises family entertainment. 7/10.",7,0,2,4 April 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," 'Put your trust in the Lord  your ass belongs to me'
","So says the warden of Shawshank prison, though Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) finds it belongs to a lot more people in this often-harrowing tale.The Shawshank Redemption is a very, very clever film in that it takes its call from elder cinema, meaning it can net not only acclaim but also a wider audience. It's surely no coincidence that the first sound we hear  before the titles have even begun to roll - is that of The Ink Spots singing 'If I Didn't Care'. The shot pans out to Tim Robbins in an old-fashioned automobile and then to a courtroom where his last words to his wife were 'I'll see you in Hell'. No profanity from a bitter man in 90's cinema, though expletives do flavour the piece, with 24 uses of the f-word and 48 minor swearwords.A few minutes into the film and part of the reason is given: the setting is 1947. However, the oldstyle trappings of the piece never leave it: violence and sexual activity are never laboured on. Beatings are delivered in shadow, or, in the case of Andy's first, the camera discretely pulls back and turns a corner while we just hear the sound. Note we are never shown that Andy is raped, we are just told that he is by Morgan Freeman's narration. That's another strong point of the film, and also an historical device, that of first person narration. Freeman adds a constant magnetism to the film; his voice-over a necessity considering it takes place over 20 years. Refreshingly, the ageing process is used subtly, if at all, rather than using unconvincing prosthetics. A little grey to Morgan's hair and the power of persuasion is all that is needed to carry out the illusion of time passing.Another interesting point is that of race. Someone once told me they didn't like the film because they saw the black/white male bonding between Robbins and Freeman as too contrived and worthy. I told them that this showed a suspect attitude on their part as Ellis Redding's skin colour hadn't occurred to me, nor is it ever mentioned throughout the film. It isn't an issue that Redding is black, he just IS. Ultimately, the redemption of the title comes from Robbins' humanitarian intellectualism against the warden's fundamental religious beliefs. But the ultimate testament to erstwhile cinema is that of two things: plot and character. It's this strength of character, not to mention two superb understated leads, which mean you can watch it again and again, even when one viewing reveals the twist in the tale. All the characters are three-dimensional, breathing human beings that get not lines, but emotions and beliefs. Occasionally some  not much, but some  of the dialogue can strain towards the overly sentimental. Perhaps this is what produced the nauseating tagline 'Fear can hold you prisoner  hope can set you free'. Yuck! But generally this pleasantly paced, well-told tale hits the target in it's own relaxed way. Far from pedestrian, the timing of the film is like that of drinking a cool beer on a hot summer's roof, or a whole yardful of inmates standing stock still to the beauty of Mozart. The Shawshank Redemption was released the same year as Pulp Fiction, yet both of them were disgraced at the Oscars by the forgettable Forrest Gump. A great oversight.",9,0,1,26 May 2000
Scream," 'If this were a scary movie I'd be the prime suspect.'
","In the later stages of Scream Neve Campbell lambastes the heroines of horror movies, claiming it's always 'some big-breasted girl who can't act.' Well, Drew Barrymore might fill part of that quota, but she certainly can't be accused of not acting in the best twelve minutes of the whole trilogy. This is Scream as it should be: self-referential in its dialogue, yet genuinely scary too. This 'lone girl in the house' trick is pulled off twice, and works both times, though thereafter the film degenerates into self-satisfied smugdom of the highest order.There's perhaps a little more bad natured humour than might at first be evident, too. I remember laughing with friends at the humble reference Barrymore makes to Craven's back catalogue, when talking about Nightmare on Elm Street being scary. 'Well,' she replies, 'the first one was, but the rest sucked.' However, closer inspection shows that Craven had little input with many of the sequels - he wrote and executive produced the third, but had no involvement with any of the others. What would seem to the majority of the viewing audience to be a modest slice of self-mockery is actually a bitter filmmaker venting his spleen.But the major praise heaped upon Scream is that it's what film students call 'recursive'. It's a horror movie about horror movies. It acknowledges that some horror movies aren't real, so therefore maybe it could be, blah de blah... Of course, all this could be quite fun were the point not made with sledgehammer subtlety. How many times does the word 'movie' occur in this mov- film, anyway? Every two seconds someone's asking someone else who would play him or her in a movie, or claiming 'this isn't a movie' only to be met with 'Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie, it's all one great big movie.' Errrrr... is it a movie?From the second half, beginning with the irritating video store scene, things start to get awry. No longer is the film scary, just roaming around it's own backside. For the last hour the film serves not to scare with occasional reference, but to show us all how 'clever' and 'ironic' it is - or thinks it is. The whole idea of satirical endeavours is that they're finely tuned and discrete, Mr.Williamson. Carving a script that goes 'ha ha ha we're in a movie, it's just a movie, it's like an old horror movie don't you know ha ha ha is this a movie I think it's a movie it's like a movie' does not make you a candidate for Jonathan Swift's line of ascendants.I probably enjoyed this more when I saw it on release. At the time Scream was probably one of the few horror films I'd ever seen, and so 90% of the references were lost on me. But now I've learnt a little more their gratuitous crow-barring into the dialogue really grates. You can almost imagine film nerds sitting there with a mental checklist, ticking them off one by one million. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Oh, my sides! His surname is the same as the Doctor's in Halloween, and Halloween features in the film, too! And it's also the name of a character in Psycho, and we reference that too! And he looks a lot like Johnny Depp, who was in Nightmare on Elm Street; Wes Craven's other horror-revitalising movie. What a rib-tickler!!) enters, to be slated by another character 'what's leatherface doing here?' Wait a minute - tee-hee-hee, snigger, chuckle! - wasn't Leatherface a character in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, I say! That really is superb!! What devastating wit! Ha ha ha! Oh, let's cap it all off by tossing in a reference to Carrie, and maybe you could talk about Jamie Lee Curtis being a scream queen. Oh, this is marvellous stuff!Next, we get the much-touted 'rules of horror films' sequence. If you have sex you die, if you drink you die... etc., etc., etc. The lovely Courteney Cox is watching all this backslapping goo on a hidden camera and concludes with 'Uh... boring!' I quite agree Courteney. The problem with this 'rules' scene is that the 'rules' it exposes are nowhere near as clever or as revolutionary as they would like to assume they are, merely blatantly obvious. Only a pea-brained idiot would comfortably sit there going 'Oh, how clever! I never realised that before!' Craven, who holds a Master's Degree in Philosophy, justifies the whole genre towards the end with: 'movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more inventive.' Is that the best you can do? Don't get me wrong, the genre has been unfairly derided, particularly in England, and Wes is a good spokesman for its plusses. But is that really all he could think of to say? Perhaps he was too busy, and hey, lest we forget, he didn't write the script, but this rollercoaster of smug inanity trundles on with a 'can you guess how this movie is going to end?' bore-a-thon. Wes did try his hand at writing similar stuff two years prior, with New Nightmare. While this seems to be destined to be regarded as a 'proto-Scream', it's actually the better film, and showed that Wes didn't need Kevin Williamson half as much as Williamson needed him.Linda Blair does a cameo; a character peers into a mirror while saying, 'after you branded him the Candyman?' It really does get very, very tiresome. As a historical document, this film will never lose its validity. It opened up a whole new subgenre within the field, albeit a short-lived one that has already passed. It is also made horror popular again, almost single-handedly upturning the fortunes of many genre directors. But as - I'll say it - a movie, it has sorely dated in under five years. Where it was once fresh and sparky, now it's glib and passÃ©.Inevitable sequels followed, the second being arguably better. The third, written by Ehren Kruger after Williamson had moved on, was fine, but lacked impact. Maybe it was the familiarity of the characters, particularly the constipated expression of David Arquette (Who it's now impossible to take seriously after seeing his character reborn as 'Doufus' in Scary Movie) and the hard-as-nails attitude of Cox. Moreover, it was a film whose time had now passed, and, the biggest irony of all, it failed to last as long as the movies it lampoons and unwittingly resurrected.",7,0,0,12 November 2000
Back to the Future Part II," 'I don't understand one damn thing that's going on.'
","While it does fairly well for itself on the IMDb, I've found BTTF II to be regarded as the weakest link in some quarters.I'd put this down to its complex narrative, which confuses some and leaves others cold. A shame, as it's my favourite of the series, brimming with constant invention. Many of the delights of the film come from futuristic devices you just wish were real: hover skateboards, self-lacing boots and auto-drying clothes. The movie somehow, inexplicably, has the power to draw you into its experiences. You might not be able to ride a hoverboard, but this is the next best thing.Some brilliant in-jokes are pitched in Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's direction: a holographic Jaws 19 is dismissed by Marty as 'still looks fake', while pal Michael Jackson gets a Max Headroom makeover. This is the sort of film where it's almost impossible to get bored, there's simply always something to see, and the pace never lets up. Michael J. Fox is as likeable as always in the lead role, while Thomas F. Wilson clearly enjoys going over the top in his dual parts.Apart from some product placement this really is a harmless, superb entertainment, and while some of the sports references - the Cubs winning the world series - mean little outside America, the principle of using time to cheat at gambling is a universally understood one. If there's a genuine complaint then it's that the series misses the presence of Crispin Glover, and that Lea Thompson gives a weak performance, though this is more than made up for by the multiple roles Fox gets to play. His five parts include his future self, plus his own son and daughter! And while some of the flying car effects may look a tad dated now (though only just), the split screen elements are flawless.There are some plotholes to mix in with the fun timeshifting - if Biff created an alternate timeline in the past then the future he returned to wouldn't have been the same one occupied by Marty and the Doc - but are irrelevant among all the fun and imagination of this superior sequel. While it may not be high art, BTTF II does some wonderful things with the medium, and breaches film excellence with a final third that seamlessly blends in the action to events in the first film. In fact, I nearly added another mark to its total... 7/10.",7,0,1,26 May 2001
Ben-Hur," A remarkably strong film
","One thing that always bothers me about the Oscars ceremony, now about to enter its 71st year, is the necessity for each award on a yearly basis. Take the award for Best Male Actor. What if there were no good actors in a particular year? Should not the Academy say 'we'll drop this single award for the year, as no actor met the high standard we require?' Similarly, the need for a 'Best Picture' on a yearly basis is something that seriously undermines the credibility of the awards. Okay, Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption were overlooked, but what really detracts is the ones that make it. Is the honour of winning 'Best Picture' really as great when you know that means entering the same league of distinction as Titanic and Forrest Gump?And so we come to Ben-Hur, which, before Titanic's equalling pull on the golden statuettes, was the largest recipient of the Oscars. This is something that is oft touted, and of course the main draw to watch the thing. Yet has anyone ever bothered to ask what competition it had? Just as Forrest Gump only had the unsuitable-through-excessive-violence Pulp Fiction to oppose it, 1959 was not a highpoint of cinematic achievement. Revered fare like North By Northwest, Some Like It Hot and The 39 Steps were released, but would ultimately have been too mainstream for the awards at that time. Critically popular foreign films such as Hiroshima Mon Amour and Apur Sansar were also led to the cinemas, but when has a foreign movie picked up 'Best Picture'? Room at the Top and The Diary of Anne Frank numbered amongst the token nominations, and so it was that Ben-Hur couldn't do anything BUT pick up 11 of the 29 awards going. (And it was only eligible for 15. Notable losses included no nominations for female cast members, who had little to do anyway, and a nomination but not a win for the writing).It's just as well, then, that this 212 long minutes of MGM pomp and splendour deserved the awards laid at it's feet (Though I might contest the treacly sentimental music as not worthy of the 'Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture' Award). A visual feast, if not always an intellectual one, it's epic grandiosity is always present, whether it's in lesser-known scenes like the underground leper colony, or the most famous, the chariot race. For a film that's now over 40 years old, it has aged remarkably well, and if you can spot the odd matte effect in the depiction of coliseums, or the battles at sea, then they have aged far better than early 90s CGI. In fact, probably the only fault you could really level at the film is it's sentimentality which, while not awash with it, does overcome the final reels. Its old-fashioned rigid virtues do tend to drag, but it is, in the main, a constantly pleasing production with minimal ostentation. Take the scene where Hur first meets the horses he is to use in the chariot race. It's a standard scene and far from vital in terms of the narrative, but the fact that the four horses in question enter a tent and interact with the cast is a small delight in the film. A quartet of actor horses who come into a human domain without wrecking the place, and yawn and nod on queue. Yet, delightful as it is, it is stopped before it becomes trite or the training of the animals is overly apparent.Interestingly, it's the characters off-screen that dictate the action. Hur's childhood friend, Messala (Stephen Boyd) is absent for over an hour of the middle section, yet is it Hur's hatred of what he has become that drives him, the desire for revenge against Messala that keep him alive. So too, the story follows the life of Jesus (the film's subtitle is 'A Tale of The Christ'), as seen through Ben-Hur's perspective. We never get to see Jesus' face or hear him speak, a factor that adds to his mystique.
While the off-screen presences drive the narrative, the main characters fare perhaps less well. Heston is a strong lead as Hur, though the women are practically non-existent. Instead, what really forms the core of this movie is not the actors or parts, but the sheer spectacle. Films like this were made for the visual medium of cinema, with huge mock-ups of Jerusalem and Rome (cruelly destroyed by MGM after use so no Italian filmmakers could take advantage of them) and hundreds of extras. It's all in the sights, and on this perception alone it shames any latter-day action film for sheer excess. Not the most remarkable of the 'classic' films, it must be said, but still an unmissable experience.",8,1,2,30 April 2000
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's best uncompleted movie?
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona (Allen's most nonsensical movie title since Broadway Danny Rose) is probably the best film Woody Allen never completed. With a fractured narrative and a narrator to cover the gaps, it's not even blessed with an especially strong ending. Like a lot of Allen works, things just fade to black rather than conclude. And despite all of this... it's still a very strong entry in his canon.What's most interesting about Woody's work in his fifth decade as filmmaker is his decision to regularly shoot abroad and introduce us to new characters. Perhaps realising that there's only so many stories you can tell about neurotic Jewish New Yorkers, Allen pitches camp in several different locales, including three pictures set in the capital of England. Of the London trilogy, then none of the films are particularly representative of a recognisable London. In fact, the characters in Cassandra's Dream (5) aren't even particularly representative of recognisable Londoners. But if the film is undermined by Ewan McGregor giving an uncharacteristically weak performance and seemingly struggling with both the leaden dialogue and the need to say 'Terry' nearly every single line, then it was still a worthwhile experiment. An experiment that borrows from Crimes and Misdemeanors (as does Match Point, 7) but one that at least sees him pitch his director's chair in a new setting.His delight in Scarlett Johannsen's company produces here her third work with the director after the memorable Match Point and the sadly forgettable Scoop (5). As he approaches his 50th movie, Allen seems to have lost his edge for pure comedy, such as with the toothless Hollywood Ending (5), wasting Larry David in mediocre Whatever Works (5) or possibly his career-worst Small Time Crooks (4). One of the best out-and-out comedies he achieved during the decade was the three minute short after the 9/11 attacks, Sounds from a Town I Love (6). Yet even that small runtime is filled with reactionary humour, like a lot of Woody's work these days. The concept of older people being outraged at younger culture is one that works to decreasing effect, even though this short generally works well. To this end his work in comedy drama or even complete drama is far more rewarding today. When it comes to the humour vehicles he was once known for, there's a sense that Woody's heart is either no longer in it or he's just going through the motions. The exception to this rule was Anything Else (7), a film that reused some jokes wholesale and met with very mixed reviews, but is surprisingly strong for this late period.The rest of Allen's output for the decade – Melinda and Melinda, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (both 6) - are watchable albeit forgettable works. But when he travels abroad it's as if the trip rejuvenates a director who is beginning to approach his 80s. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of the few real successes from this run, but the point is no longer whether these are great movies, but as to whether they're NEW movies. There's already one Annie Hall, anyone can buy the DVD, and so multiple variations of it from Woody on automatic aren't what the world needs. Barcelona is an Allen film that unusually comes from a female perspective, despite a male narrator telling us what characters are thinking and feeling throughout.Woody Allen has created some languid films, but ones which don't outstay their welcome: if we discount the likes of What's New, Pussycat? And Casino Royale then Allen didn't break the 100 minute mark until 1986's Hannah and Her Sisters. Since that breakthrough moment the longer format has become a fairly regular staple for Allen, with a dozen movies from 1989-2007 exceeding this length. All of which statistical musings make it doubly curious why Vicky Cristina Barcelona was hauled in at 96 minutes when at least another twenty would have done. For a low key, would-be reflective film we're frequently not given time to actually reflect, time and space constantly shunted forward and explained to us in favour of the next vignette. A strong, enjoyable movie that is deservedly one of Allen's most successful, and arguably his best since Husband and Wives... but one that could have been even more.",7,0,0,22 January 2012
The Deer Hunter," 'I feel a lot of distance... I feel far away.'
","I've found myself watching a lot of Vietnam films recently, many by some of the greatest directors of all time. And Oliver Stone. Yet despite it all, I still don't think I've found one that's perfect. When Marlon Brando gasped 'the horror, the horror' at the end of Apocalypse Now he could easily have been talking about tedious, navel-gazing Vietnam movies.Maybe it's the subject matter that's so difficult to successfully realise. After all, the conflict is still just two generations away, a painful memory for many, making it a morally dubious venture to serve it up as entertainment. Perhaps as a result, many have tried to disguise the subject, to dress it up with a veneer of pretension. The films are often overlong and worthy, too, with the four I've seen (Born on the Fourth of July, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter) lasting over nine and a half-hours between them. It sounds ridiculous, but maybe a better way is to present the conflict not as a film, but as a movie. A 90-minute popcorn romp that finishes before it disappears up itself, yet still gets the message across. Decent Vietnam films have been made of action movies (First Blood) and sci-fi/horror (Jacob's Ladder) without the need for any great artistic merit.Probably the most disappointing of all four is Stanley Kubrick's resoundingly average Full Metal Jacket (6), which is technically commendable but never as meaningful as it would like to think it is. Apocalypse Now (7) is a better bet, which contains more of the conflict than any of the other movies, a huge celluloid landscape of explosions and death. It lacks a certain something, though, possibly a little depth, that leaves it only on the edge of greatness. Born of the Fourth of July (6), crammed in between Cocktail and Days of Thunder marks one of Cruise's earliest attempts to break free of the bland macho roles he'd previously attempted. Cruise is fine, though the film's lack of subtlety soon becomes tiresome. The incidental theme by John Williams sounds strikingly like his sentimental swoops for Jurassic Park, but then again he'd got away with Superman/Star Wars for years and no-one had mentioned it. Williams, surprisingly, had a (guitar) hand in the gentle and quite moving theme to The Deer Hunter*.The Deer Hunter, then, is the best of the bunch, the best Vietnam movie ever made... at least up until now. Certainly not a film you would watch for pleasure, it contains the most depth, the most psychologically reaching aspects. It's still not as emotionally reaching as I would like it to be, the film perhaps containing a clinical distance between the viewer and its content. Okay, I realise that alienation and the sense of inner isolation is what the film's about, but even before the characters go to war DeNiro's Mickey isn't quite all there. Some of the characters, such as Chuck Aspegren's loutish Axel with his obnoxious catchphrase 'f***in' A!' offer little empathy for the audience. Yet it's really only Walken, DeNiro and Streep who get genuine characters anyway, the rest are just support.I remember being unimpressed with the film the first time round, and I admit that, in the main, I was wrong. Direction is almost flawless by Cimino, though oddly he's never had great success since, his post-Deer CV including the flop Heaven's Gate. Acting, too, is top-rate, and the realisation of Pennsylvanian village life, juxtaposed with life in the Saigon village, is exceptional. The picture scores because the nature of war as evidenced by most directors (loads of helicopters, macho bluster, explosions, and graphic deaths) are largely absent, the film being an intense, character-based piece. The famous highlighted section of the war is Walken, DeNiro and John Savage as POWs, forced to undertake harrowing turns in a game of Russian Roulette. 8/10.* Edited four years later to add: No, it isn't the same John Williams. There's research for you.",8,15,36,23 November 2000
Amélie," Falling out of love with Amelie?
","I saw this film at an arts centre with friends when it was first released. The fact that I spent the entire duration having to move in my seat to see the film through the moving heads of the people in front somehow added to the enjoyment. I guess a movie can seem like forbidden fruit when you've got someone's head in the way of the screen for half of it.Regardless, I clearly enjoyed it as I'd originally rated it 8/10. Seeing it again nine years later then it still stands up fairly well... it's relatively inspired, undeniably well directed and the performances are fairly likable. However, what once seemed quirky and charming now seems self conscious and twee, the cloying nature of Amelie's 'cute' personality beginning to grate.What's more, the impressive special effects - used for fantasy renderings of small situations, rather than garish Hollywoodised CGI - distract rather than enhance. For a film about romance and finding that special someone then Amelie possibly lacks a real heart.I once liked this movie a Hell of a lot. I still like it quite a bit as evidenced by the above-average score, but in the immortal words of Peter Griffin, 'it insists upon itself.'",6,1,5,16 October 2010
Final Destination," 'You've got your whole life ahead of you'
","I have to confess that after The Sixth Sense debacle, every magazine giving away the twist, I avoided reading a single review of Final Destination until I'd actually seen the thing. The fact that there IS no clever twist doesn't make it a bad film, just one more factor making it a mediocre one.Glen Morgan and James Wong, Executive Producers for both 'Space: Above and Beyond' and 'The X-Files', dealt a lot of expectation for this movie. Their ten scripts for The X-Files (most notably 'Squeeze', 'Beyond The Sea' and 'E.B.E.') created high hopes. But then high hopes is what the ant had and it didn't do him much good either.Maybe, like me, you're the anally retentive sort that is distracted by detail. Like in similarly air-based 'Die Hard 2', where Bruce asks an airport receptionist to send a fax. The fact that this plot development saw her send the fax upside down - meaning the other end would have received only a blank sheet of paper - kept distracting me. Likewise, the two girls who ask the leads to change seats so that they can sit together. Why? There were three seats in each row anyway!But I digress. The film, itself, then, is the sort of movie that has that peculiar type of Transatlantic irony - ie., not really very funny, but we'll pretend it is and send it up anyway. I hate snobbery, but suffice it to say if you think the 'humour' within this film is 'wry' or 'clever' then you're probably dead from the neck up. A bit like the guy in this film who... no, that's a spoiler... The 'joke' is sewn right from the start, with multiple 'ironic' references to impending doom, the lead quote from this review being probably the most subtle. There's also an unjustifiably snotty jibe at the much more entertaining and likeable 'Stuart Little'.The actual idea behind the picture - a group cheat death only to find the laws of death's predeterminism creeping up on them - looks tremendous on paper, and could have made for a fantastic movie. But while the initial idea is strong, and relatively original, the conception is weak and flawed. For a start, there's the average direction and acting, coupled with the age of the group. If this had been a much older cast, rather than schoolkids, it would have possible to get more depth into the piece. But then again, maybe it would have been nice not to have a 100% all-white, sparkly-teethed photogenic cast either. A little character variation wouldn't have gone amiss.Proceedings carry on as the characters each in turn meet a grisly death. While I won't, to be spoiler-free, reveal who gets it first, it is pretty obvious that the guy that puts the pieces together WON'T get it too early on in the movie. It's also basic narrative convention that the more interesting ones will get a slightly longer lifespan. In Hollywood only the bland die young. So knowing what trio will live on to see out most of the duration takes the fun away a little.One nice possible in-joke was the lead denying having a 'narcisstic DD complex' Anyone know what this is? Wouldn't be a reference to a certain Mr. Duchovny by any chance? Other than the everyday, run-of-the-mill execution, the other problem I had was with the scariness of the movie. A fantastic trailer was shown on television, showing people leaping out of their seats, hurling popcorn everywhere. As a bit of an idiot, I had planned to see the film with friends and do this whether I found it scary or not, just to act the fool. As it turned out, two other people in the cinema meant we couldn't justify making idiots of ourselves to such a small audience, and was there really any time when such a reaction would be appropriate? Honestly, I didn't even jump once. Wes Craven and his silly Scream has got a lot to answer for...",4,3,5,15 July 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 'Everyone has a bad dream once in a while.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.
Well worth another glance, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a striking film. In a time when its creator is associated more with 'Scream' or 94's 'Wes Craven's New Paycheque' (where this film would be regurgitated for a sanitised cash market with only a hint of satire), this still stands up remarkably well.A sort of Halloween meets Salvador Dali; Nightmare stars a Fred  not yet Freddy, note  Krueger who is genuinely disturbing. The 80's incidental music may sometimes sound like Depeche Mode on an all-night drinking session, but it's low-grade trappings and the amateurish acting only serve to make things more unnerving.This is light years away from the rest of the franchise, an independent low budget horror. There's some appalling dubbing, disjointed dialogue ('What the Hell are dreams anyway?' Nancy's mother cues an exposition-friendly Doctor), plus occasionally ropy special effects. Long-armed Freddy, anyone? Most importantly, though, it takes it's own world seriously. How odd that the sequels from the third onwards opted for send-up, while the second collapsed under the weight of it's own absurdity. You would have thought that at least one of them would learn from the original. The denouement is slightly limp, though clearly signposted by earlier dialogue. If your idea of a weak ending is the lead villain being called 'sh*t' and having a back turned to him, then this fits the bill perfectly. But then again endings never did seem to be Craven's strong point, as New Nightmare's underdeveloped finale goes to prove.Rather sensibly, Wes opted out of the studio-enforced sequel, Freddy's Revenge (4). Made and brought out within a year of the original, it contains the most homoerotic imagery you'll see this side of the gay soft porn industry. Even Freddy lovingly uses his claws to comb Jesse's (Mark Patton's) hair, while his S & M loving P.E. teacher is stripped naked and his bare bottom towel-spanked. While this is an unusual tack in the genre, it fails to be commendable, as the teacher in question is also a rapist. The unsettling surrealism of the first is perverted into pool parties and spontaneously-combusting parakeets. Freddy makes too much of an appearance, and the old horror classic of setting the villain in broad daylight and with incidental music that sounds like dolphin calls only adds to the lack of fear. It misses anything approaching the artistry of the original, and completely overlooks it's own prime remit: to scare.As if in revenge for Freddy's Revenge, Craven took on a producer/co-writer function for the third film, the only time he would be involved until the tenth anniversary. Probably the best sequel if only because it has more plot than the rest of them stuck together, Dream Warriors (5) finally sees the franchise tip over into the mainstream. Nancy is back, as is, briefly, her dad. She's now a staff member at a juvenile amateur dramatics group, er, I mean, psychiatric ward, where they all develop special powers in their dreams. Violent, gory, comic book like and reliant on special effects and bad language, it also contains the first real example of nudity in the series. However, most of Freddy's appearances are shot with a psychological aspect in mind once more (particularly the head snake, a Freud-worrying concoction), and it's probably worth seeing just to see Krueger tell Zsa Zsa Gabor 'Who gives a f*** what you think?' Generally, though, coming from the pens of Craven and Frank 'Shawshank' Darabont you would expect a lot more. Direction, too, by Chuck Russell, lacks Craven's defter touch. From hereon it was only two films to go before the all-time low of Freddy's Dead (3).The notion of vastly inferior sequels is always an odd one. Occasionally the originals can still hold their reputations intact (People still discuss Psycho without having to mention 2-4 in the same breath), but the adventures of Freddy & Co. are violently affected by what followed. The five painfully weak attempts to recreate its appeal means it's often forgotten that the first was a genuinely good film and worthy of... 7/10.",7,0,0,8 November 2000
The Matrix," The Deadly Assassin
","In 1976 the English tv series 'Doctor Who' featured a collective of unconscious thought as part of a computerised reality called 'The Matrix' in a story called 'The Deadly Assassin'. I just thought I'd mention it. Because that, like the BLATANT product placement for Nokia (including the slow-motion falling mobile phone)is one of the detracting elements from the movie. But, of course, the biggest detraction is, ironically, the praise. For, when you're about to watch a movie that has five-star reviews in every publication, and has entered the IMDb top 20, then actually seeing it is bound to be an anti-climax. Even Citizen Kane didn't grab me the first time round due to this effect. Yet having said all that, The Matrix IS a good movie - I gave it seven out of ten. Maybe I'm weird, but the film contained no concept or twist that I haven't already thought of, no surprise twist, nothing I didn't expect. Why do all Hollywood films need to contain at least one scene where characters do a 'humourous' double-take? Lastly, the moral at the end was forcing it down the viewer's throat and a slight to the intelligence, but these were the only truly jarring points. The characters were refreshing three, or at least two-dimensional, with only a couple of the cast there as the 'destined to be cannon fodder' variety. Direction and lighting is excellent throughout, if a little showy, and the structure is maintained well. For a film that is roughly one hour exposition, one hour pure action, it holds together very well. But does this really deserve to dent the top twenty when Twelve Monkeys is (at date of writing) outside the top 250?",7,0,0,3 July 1999
Deadpool," Draining and self-congratulatory superhero antics...
","Like Guardians of the Galaxy and the two Avengers movies before it, Deadpool shows a worrying amount of smugness, its own self-amusement only equalled by its disregard for the intelligence of the audience. There's not a single one of the 'instant reverse' jokes in The Avengers that even a very credulous small child wouldn't see coming, and Deadpool's scatological humour aims for little higher than the lowest (or broadest) common denominator. It's a crowdpleaser, and not awful, but if fart jokes, genital punching and a plot that resembles a 15-year-old's masturbation fantasies aren't your thing, you may find it all a little wearying. The gags are predictable and relentless... which, in fairness, is kind of the point for 'the merc with the mouth', but doesn't make it any less tiresome. In an age where scarcely any film lacks postmodernism, Deadpool's constant fourth wall breaks seem almost passé. While a reasonable conceit in and of itself, there's nothing particularly intelligent done with it, the fourth wall just used as another vessel for some masturbation gags.The best jokes in the film - Deadpool frequently commenting on why A-List X-Men don't appear - lose lustre when you realise it's made by Fox and so they could well have. Current voting on the IMDb sees it just inside the top 50 all-time greatest films, comfortably edging out Citizen Kane, M, Rashomon and Taxi Driver.Plot-wise, then a thug also being the brains behind the bad guy's operation lacks credulity, though this is a film where Stan Lee urges prostitution, so all bets are very much off.",6,7,20,19 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Consistently chucklesome...
","... an amusing follow-up/spin-off to the okay 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', this one takes up one of the characters, unfettered by the former's poor shot continuity.Amusingly free of a moral anchor, it does nevertheless get predictably mawkish in the last act, with the traditional 'mainstream Hollywood' need for an epiphany/moral of the story. Yet Brand and Hill have an easy chemistry that carries it through, even if it's Puff Daddy that steals the film.At nearly two hours it does stretch its limited concept to breaking point, and seems to have about fifty separate endings as a result, but this is a fun, engaging watch for entertainment purposes.",6,0,3,13 June 2012
Jackie Brown," ... when Quentin was king
","Despite the inevitable backlash against Tarantino, and regardless of whether you approve of his violence/bad language/self-referencing narratives, I firmly believe the cinema owes him a huge debt. For I genuinely believe that the 1980s were the worst decade in history for the modern motion picture. The 'high concept pitching' of films that could be summed up literally in two lines, with functional dialogue and A to B plotting had caused a serious slump in creative output, and audiences were being patronised by what substandard fare was being pumped into the cinemas.In 1992 Quentin entered the scene with Reservoir Dogs (9). Okay, it's heavily indebted to foreign film, but the real-time/time-bending conceits of the movie, coupled with naturalistic dialogue that gave characterisation broke down the rot. Okay, films with plot and character were all the rage in the 60s, 70s, 50s even. But the 80s had forgotten how to do it, and Quentin gave it back to us. Now I'm sure everyone could tell me there's another film writer-director that did it first, but Quentin was the one to popularise it. He capitalised on Dogs with the more commercial, more indulgent, more juvenile, but ultimately much more fun Pulp Fiction (10). Without these films we would never have seen such fare as The Usual Suspects, with it's wordy script and time-bending, and this would never have bled on to the dying British film scene with movies like the successful Trainspotting. There were other successes, too, such as by far and away the greatest Tarantino film not directed by Tarantino, True Romance (7). Starring Christian Slater (who allegedly gives 10% in royalties to Jack Nicholson for every performance), it lost the downbeat ending and time distortions, but Quentin was said to be satisfied with the linear narrative of this 93 movie. His first real film script (discounting an incomplete student project, 'My Best Friend's Birthday'), it was completed in 1987 and went for years before being taken up. It showcased some of his best dialogue and Hollywood satire; Tony Scott's more laid-back direction actually giving greater chance for the writing to shine. And for a film that also features Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman and Balki out of Perfect Strangers, it didn't feel crammed. Amazingly, I still know of people that won't see it as they think by the title that it's a romantic comedy.However, the nature of the films and the fact that Tarantino did so much in so little time meant a backlash wasn't only inevitable, but in certain quarters, eagerly awaited. Experimental, between-film follies such as Four Rooms didn't help, and when Jackie Brown emerged, three years after Pulp Fiction, it seemed as if his time had passed. Jackie Brown (7) was a smoother, maturer direction for Tarantino. The first of his films not to come from his own ideas, but from a source text, Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, it was a new direction. Interestingly, aged 15 Quentin had been caught trying to unsuccessfully hustle a copy of Leonard's 'The Switch' from a shopping mall. Many of his previous films did use the oft touted 'magpie technique' of borrowing. Ringo Lam's City of Fire has often been brought up in conversation against Reservoir Dogs and the 'Butch' segment of Pulp Fiction was a reworked version of Roger (Killing Zoe) Avary's 'Pandemonium Reigned'. Yet this was a fully-fledged adaptation, Miramax having bought him the rights to four Leonard novels in 1995. (The other three being Killshot, Bandits and Freaky Deaky. Quentin's original plan was to make Killshot, starring himself, Bruce Willis and Holly Hunter).Of course, many don't appreciate a film that has in it's range Robert DeNiro, yet underuses him, and Samuel L. Jackson, who is given plenty to say, but nothing as incendiary as Ezekiel 25:17. There is only one time-break, where a single scene is played out three times in the same bracket, and only one kitsch moment, where an animated plane is used to paper the gaps in a $5 million-higher-than-Pulp-Fiction-but-still-very-low $13 million budget. Violence is almost non-existent by Q's standards, and the subjects discussed range not from burger bars to the Fantastic Four but the fear of ageing and the Delphonics. Top of the bill is a long-term idol of Quentin's, Pam Grier, who is even name-checked in Reservoir Dogs. It's an altogether more relaxed, more controlled film, and in many ways the writing is stronger. The easy option of a sketch-style format for his script is discarded, making it, in a sense, a better film. Yet people claim it to be worse. Strange. A genuinely touching romance at times, the only comment this one got was 'it's nothing compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction'. Quentin, it seems, is a victim of his own success.And so it is that we now await his fourth writer/director vehicle, another Leonard piece, '40 Lashes'. Fingers are crossed that it will a superb return to form, though maybe it doesn't really matter. Even if Quentin's time were over, he would still have achieved a wide-scale revitalisation of American cinema. However, it would be fortunate if 40 Lashes did live up to its promise, if only to put the ghosts of Tarantino failures to rest. But that's another story. The time",7,0,1,17 May 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'In God's name, show me the grail!'
","Can I commit heresy by making a small confession? I don't find Monty Python very funny. Neither is Black Adder, and Sgt.Pepper isn't the greatest album ever made.Python is commendable, of course. The sketch show was interesting, and made innovative use of the television format. (I would say groundbreaking but I've seen Spike Milligan's 'Q'). Yet funny? Python has always struck me as the very worst kind of undergraduate humour, the sort of indulgent 'comedy' that's uncool to dislike in any University.In reality, of course, I suspect the somewhat obvious sight gags and formula juxtapositions are liked by a very small minority. But the ultimate in Emperor's New Clothes causes black t-shirted, Wilde-quoting students to break into peer-pleasing hysterics at a knight who goes 'ni!' A worry is that if you don't laugh then you'll be called 'thick' or told that you just 'don't get it'. But I do get it, and it's nowhere near as clever as it pretends to be. The repetitive jokes (Knights on pretend horseback; ironic detachment to death; characters who talk too much), coupled with the attempt at a singular narrative make Holy Grail an exercise in tedium.It doesn't help matters that the six members of the group aren't exactly natural comedians. John Cleese, the supposed comic genius of the team is possibly the least funny. I mean, he's too posh, surely? Posh people aren't funny, that's the rule. Seeing middle-class boy Cleese bullying foreigners and the working classes in the overrated Fawlty Towers inexplicably amuses many. Michael Palin would be a straight man in any other troupe, and is far more suited to travelogues. Terry Gilliam, arguably the most talented and a hugely important director, would be the first to admit he's not that hot as a performer. And Graham Chapman, the tall camp one, must get bored playing the same character all the time. That leaves Eric Idle and co-director Terry Jones as the only members who can genuinely raise a smile.I was amazed to find that this is regarded on the IMDb as the strongest Python film, as I have seen a lot better. Holy Grail is symptomatic of every flaw in the series, with hardly a single joke coming off. Even Gilliam's surrealist animation is lacking here, and the songs are a chore to sit through. The few good gags involve a Trojan rabbit which the knights forget to hide in; Neil Innes singing the uncomplimentary tale of Sir Robin; a copyright disclaimer signed by Richard Nixon, and a Yorkshireman King. However, the only part that made me laugh out loud was the truly hilarious killer rabbit. Five funny jokes. 85 minutes. Oh dear. 4/10.",4,12,30,10 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire's New Clothes Strike Back
","The second in the initial run of Star Wars movies, and I must insist that their extreme popularity has always alluded me.The original Star Wars film, A New Hope, is often cited as the greatest film ever made when such surveys are taken amongst the public and not amongst the critical fraternity. I mean, they're rubbish, surely? Yet all sorts of cod psychology goes up to justify what really are just Cowboys and Indians in space. Take a look at this religious analogy of The Phantom Menace:'A man wearing a shawl, sporting long hair and a beard travels through a town collecting disciples. After many Biblical encounters they meet a man with the appearance of a horned devil who carries a Staff horizontally, like a cross. This is ultimately what kills the man, though his death helps to save his disciple. He dies so that his disciple might live.' This is a description of the basic events of the film, and attention is also drawn to the fact that there are three generations of man in the film (Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin), like the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And what is Phantom another word for?In all honesty, that Christian analogy of the fourth Star Wars film isn't genuine - I made it up in two minutes while shopping for groceries. But it just shows how easy it is to craft a pseudo-intellectual subtext into what is a crass, sfx-crammed movie and palm it off as genuine critique. While even the most blinkered are shaky on Phantom's appeal, the fact that Star Wars makes a regular Top 10 appearance in the IMBd chart, trouncing even such greats as Citizen Kane, goes to show, to my mind, that people are scared to disagree with popular opinion.As a film, Star Wars isn't spectacular. The direction is average, at best, while acting, and especially dialogue (George Lucas' major weak point) are one-dimensional. So this would leave you to believe it must be great science fiction then. It isn't. 'Fetch the mind probe' utters Darth Vader at one point, without any hint of irony. Childish and vapid, this dumbed-down, popcorn Sci-Fi pales, surely, when compared with such greats as 2001, Planet of the Apes or A Clockwork Orange? Yet this 'emperor's new clothes' effect even sticks to the sequels, causing the noxious 'Return of the Jedi' to surf irksomely around the top 100.Which brings us to The Empire Strikes Back. The only Star Wars film to date that jettisons formulaic plotting, comfortable in the fact that it follows a movie and it knows a movie will succeed it. Put simply, sandwiched in between 'Hope' and 'Jedi', Empire doesn't require the luxuries of a beginning or end, so is essentially one big middle. This can be off-putting at first glance, particularly an unresolved climax which can leave the viewer feeling like they've been cheated. Yet this is, by Star Wars standards, sophisticated and depth-filled, a massive slap in the face for George Lucas who had little input into this dark instalment. Though he supplies the story, the dialogue is given a human, more adult edge by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, while Irvin Kershner's direction jettisons the 'point and shoot' fixations of 'Phantom Menace' for genuine cineramic sweeps.Strangely, with it's blood and mutilations, 'Empire' wasn't given a 'PG' certificate. But the internal nature of good/evil and the symbiosis between Luke and Vader (Mark Hamill, with the better direction, even threatening to act on occasion), lend this one a worthwhile backbone that means you don't 'have to pretend you're a kid again' in order to enjoy it.The most sophisticated and depth-filled Star Wars film, infinitely better than anything that followed, and leagues ahead of it's merely-average predecessor, it is quite beautifully filmed and the only one of the four that will always hold surprises on any number of repeated viewings.",8,0,2,22 December 1999
Braveheart," 'Certain Events Portrayed Have Been Dramatised'
","That says it all in a way. Maybe if I had watched Braveheart alone I would have liked it a whole lot less. Yet I took this one out on video after seeing 'The Patriot', my curiosity piqued to see if this was as fundamentally bad.It isn't, of course, and watching in conjunction with that film made me appreciate this one a whole lot more. The Patriot is melodramatic, trite, sentimental and showily directed. Braveheart may have its dream sequences, stereotypical bagpipes and the odd duff line, but generally it's pretty good for Hollywoodised history. I don't even mind the fact that history has been severely distorted, either. After all, this is a film, and every film needs its heroes and villains. The picture may be entirely one-sided in it's portrayal of the Scot/English divide, but at least the 'enemy' in this one get more than the boo-hiss one-dimensionality of 'The Patriot'.However, while this isn't high-minded enough to be a great historical epic and isn't totally worthy of the five Oscars it received (and, while nominated for more, they were all technical, none for acting) it is sturdy, average entertainment. In fact, what makes it of note, and justifies its watchability are really just two things:1. Patrick McGoohan, No.6 himself, having a thoroughly good time as the outrageously mad King;2. The Scottish accents. Maybe the American audience that thought they were getting an honest historical was convinced by the laughably fake 'accents'. Gibson was far from the worst, incidentally. But even so, anyone who lives in the whole of the British Isles would be unlikely to sit through this film without crying tears of laughter as this Australian, would-be US actor tells us what it's like to be a Scotsman. For those two factors alone, Braveheart is priceless.",6,1,3,20 July 2000
The Breakfast Club," 'I don't like what I see, I really don't.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM
This was one of the ultimate 'cool to like' films in the eighties, a film that had all teens doting on it because, well, it has so much ... meaning... doesn't it? Actually, no. Five students, at least three of them one-dimensional blandies, spend eight hours in detention where they allegedly 'find themselves.' Except only one of them has anything interesting to say.It opens with a written quote from David Bowie, the hallmark of student pretension, which then explodes into shards. Whoo, rock and roll! This is revolutionary filmmaking at its peak. Worst thing about the movie is that it temporarily convinced a significant proportion of society that Simple Minds were actually worth listening to.How old was John Hughes when he wrote this film? Fourteen, and full of angst? Like some awful sixth-form play, The Breakfast Club is filled with clumsily written amateur psychology. Molly Ringwald gets the brunt of it, and all the worst lines. Gems like 'You know why guys like you knock everything? Cos you're afraid' meet 'I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when someone steps all over them.' Other characters get to say things like 'When you grow up, your heart dies' and 'If you love someone, it's okay.'Judd Nelson chiefly carries the film as the only interesting character, and the one with the best lines. Saying 'eat my shorts' four years before The Simpsons, and telling a teacher 'Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?' he's by far the most appealing element of the movie. However, his describing of being beaten at the hands of his father is marred by loud incidental synth music, the hallmark of the eighties. Thankfully, there are no skinny ties or mullet haircuts, meaning it hasn't otherwise dated too badly in that regard.Some ill-advised comedy moments - The Bridge on the River Kwai parody, Anthony Michael Hall being stoned and Emilio Estivez breaking a glass door by shouting at it - work against the piece, and are quite cringingly embarrassing to watch. The film then takes on issues that the characters in the film seem to think are hugely important, but are really just everyday and banal. The group seem desperate to hold on to the secret that three of them are virgins, or that they don't get along with their parents, but such things are hardly Earth-shattering.Where the film really falls down is in the climax, where the group - who are now suddenly inseparable soul mates - turn into a bunch of bleeding hearts, mewling and wailing over what are really pretty much run of the mill problems. Judd Nelson aside, the rest of this crew has no cause for social dysfunction that isn't above the killingly ordinary. Maybe that's the point, but, like Flatliners, where a group of young students had their sins come to haunt them, the fact that people of that age won't have done anything of real note is called into question. Ringwald is cut up about the fact that her parents are so rich, and she has to agree with all her friends. 'You just don't understand all the pressures they can put on you.' Oh, shame. Sporty Estivez, meanwhile, is a high-school jock who once taped a man's buttocks together because he was trying to impress his dominant father. Okay, not nice, but not exactly the skeleton in the closet you'd wait ninety minutes to hear, right? I'm sure most athletic students do a lot worse things, every day of the week.Anthony Michael Hall, the least of the 'Where Are They Now?' entrants, as no-one hires nerds for Hollywood films any more, was contemplating suicide because he couldn't make a ceramic elephant. Ally Sheedy, in the most thankless role, acts weird because her parents ignore her and she just wants people to notice her.All of which would be fine, and, indeed, despite the criticisms I've made, The Breakfast Club is nicely directed, acted and imminently watchable. But what cripples the film is its overreaching pretension, particularly the trite closing monologue, which is cliched and squalid. Like the tagline for the movie - 'They met only once, but it changed their lives forever' - it smacks of corny movie trailer dialogue and is overearnest. Pat resolution has the group coupled off (except for poor Hall), with Estivez clinging on to Sheedy after finding she doesn't look that bad with different makeup. Rather a shallow indictment. Though the weirdest thing is, despite watching this and regarding it as a deeply flawed movie, I still voted it 6/10.",6,24,45,22 February 2001
Gladiator," 'We are all ultimately dead men. We cannot choose when we die, but we can choose how... so that we are remembered'
","This is probably the most sadly ironic line of Oliver Reed, here in his final film role. A cut 'n' paste last scene aside, the veteran actor gives a graceful performance in a film which would see his death before completion.Sadly, British audiences now associate the star more with a performance on Channel 4 programme 'After Dark'; where, amongst a group of chin-scratching pseuds on a discussion show a drunken Reed argued and forcibly snogged a large lady who was far from amused. 'Do you want me to go?' questioned Ollie, who promptly did, gin in hand, when the rest of the guests begged him to leave the studio. Or maybe his most famous moment would be a slot on a primetime chat show, a jug of orange juice and vodka in hand, bellowing the lyrics to 'Wild One'.If only for giving Ollie back his grace does Gladiator deserve praise. Direction, while derivative and gimmicky, is also well done (though it's easily Ridley Scott's weakest work). Derek Jacobi has a nice role, most famous, of course, for the mini series I, Clavdivs. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe, all mean, macho and moody with a tiny glimmer of sensitivity underneath. A bit dull for a film that lasts ten days or however long this one went on for.The visions of the afterlife are a little bit silly, and there's never a moment when you don't know how it's all going to end. But objectively, this is a film you can admire. Subjectively, I was bored rigid and kept losing concentration all the way through. Don't mistake me, I enjoy a good epic, but there's no emotional involvement to root you to this film, and ultimately I didn't care about Crowe's character.Sometimes the CGI is a little too obvious, already dated whereas the 50-odd year old Ben Hur still stands up. I laughed at the tiger that looked like it'd come straight out of a ZX Spectrum, and as for the dead one. I was reminded of comedian Brian Connelly. His catchphrase? 'It's a puppeeeeeeeeeeet!'The villain is a nice portrayal of the guy that just wants to be loved. But what makes him such a bad guy? Maybe it's the fact that he kills his father, wants to sleep with his sister and has a harelip. No grey areas for Ridley. Crowe is the manly, bronzed, masculine guy that all the women love.Gladiator is not a bad film, and I did give it a '6'. I would have awarded a higher mark, if only it didn't singularly succeed in boring the pants off me.",6,0,0,29 June 2000
Contact," 'A waste of space.'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS2001 had Strauss. Contact opens with CGIed planets set to snatches of Elvis and The Spice Girls. It all blurs past the screen without subtlety, dragging us into a nauseating prologue.This gives us Jodie Foster as a young girl, wanting to explore the universe because her dad let her use his CB radio. All of a sudden it segues into gut-wrenchingly-sentimental dialogue about her mother. 'Dad... can we talk to mom?' 'I don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far' replies her dad as the audience grabs a sick bucket. 'Hey dad... do you think there's people on other planets?' she then offers. This is indicative of the contrived nature of the script. And what kind of responsible father would let his daughter talk to truck drivers anyway?When we meet Foster as an adult she's the young go-getter striving against the system (Cliché #4582200), working under a weary, less intelligent but scornful boss (Cliché #83475971). Her colleagues are a token black man, a token disabled man and the good-looking lead that she shags within the first twenty minutes. The dirty stop-out. In perhaps the only inspired character twist, she walks out on HIM with a 'I'll call you'.Tom Skerritt soon pulls the plug on her alien research  well, he would, wouldn't he? Look what happened the last time that he met an alien. But being a living plot device is hard on anyone, and he avoids being in too many scenes. Foster then enters a discussion with a research board for alternate funding. Why is it in films boards never say 'Fair enough, we'll give you the cash' and have done with it? Instead Foster gets rejected then loses it, slagging off the review panel. Impressed by her spunk they then give her the money  and that's cliché #471781256.Pretty soon she's hooked up with James Spader and a token surfer dude who always seem to frequent scientific research departments for some reason. James Wood pops his head round the corner playing the only character he ever plays. In fact, the film is quite name-heavy, with Angela Bassett squandered as a Whitehouse representative. When the aliens send down a transmission of Hitler, the logical Hollywood choice for someone to seethe in indignant rage is a black woman. In fact it's a wonder they didn't throw in Jackie Gleason as well.The biggest star name though is my favourite US President, randy old Bill Clinton in a brief acting role. This is an amazing feat and a commendable one. Imagine how much more realistic Superman II would have been if Reagan had played himself in that.The alien transmission is relayed via news broadcasts from all over the world, including  yes!  a plummy English newscaster (Cliché #17537256). We then see how different cultures  hippies, native Americans, religious extremists  deal with the situation. Yeah, chuck another cliché on the pile.Things improve for the second half, where Foster is in a quest to meet the Vegans. That's the aliens, by the way, not people that refuse to drink milk. Pretty soon she's in a ship, strapped up with a head mike like a telephone receptionist. Her craft is remarkable for two reasons. One is that it looks suspiciously like a Sontaran ship from Doctor Who, the other is that it appears to have no toilet. A four year mission and nowhere to have a poo? When she does meet an alien he's in the form of her dead dad, bringing about a crisis of faith. Yes, it really is THAT bad.Overlong, undercooked, trite and uninvolving, Contact is a thoroughly missable SF dirge.",4,24,52,23 January 2001
Back to the Future," 'Make like a tree... and get outta here!'
","I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots, patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future – a family film with daring themes of incest and attempted rape – is one of them.Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding, this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin Glover as Marty's dad. A number of 'blink and you'll miss it' pieces add to the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks up – which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame – proclaiming: 'You'll be noticed driving the car of the future'.Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in its approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of 50's Middle America is quite charming.Maybe there's the nagging feeling that – now fifteen years old – the film's cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as fresh or relevant as they once did. Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But its lack of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more.",7,9,29,27 August 2000
The Birds," 'Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!'
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSAfter slating The Birds fifteen months ago on the IMDb I have to concede that I was talking complete nonsense. The Birds is perhaps a film that has to be watched more than once to be fully appreciated, a factor which does it few favours with a casual audience.Maybe it comes from years of being told the Hitchcock films are suspenseful thrillers. An accurate description, but one that fails to take into account their camp, knowing humour. As a result the twenty and thirty somethings that didn't get to see them firsthand may be disappointed.Tippi Hedren is a little wooden, as were the majority of Hitchcock's girls, and is caked in soft focus. The initial storyline sees her following Rod Taylor all the way from San Francisco to Bodega Bay. She goes to a lot of trouble just to get into a bloke's pants, doesn't she? The eerie mood is actually enhanced by the obvious filmed backdrops Hedren has to drive/sail in front of. It's not until the twenty-five minute point that Hedren's head is pecked by a gull.The direction in terms of shots is magnificent, and the film's potency can be directly paralleled with the trailer which Hitchcock himself performed. A five-minute monologue, which tends to go on a bit, then culminates in a genuinely unsettling scene where his caged bird draws blood. It's the meandering pace of the trailer and the film that makes the eventual shocks all the more disturbing. And making you care about the characters as three-dimensional people (the first attack proper is over fifty minutes in) is a masterstroke.Some of the effects to achieve the attacks may now be a little obvious, but in combining them together it works wonders. In fact, the iconography of this film is arguably more imitated than any other Hitchcock movie, including Psycho. Unusually gory for the director, its total absence of incidental music, save for a mosaic of birdcall, is also startling. The clever avoidance of any kind of explanation is the key to its real success, carefully avoiding science fiction territory. When told there's no reason for the attacks, Taylor replies 'it's happening  isn't that a reason?'Some genius scenes  the light innocence of child song juxtaposed with the massing crows; the unexpected horror of the gouged eyes; a beautiful, silent aerial shot of the garage, gradually filled with squawking gulls  are vital to the film's worth. The understated conclusion, meanwhile, is probably one of the ten best climaxes cinema has to offer. It gives not even the comfort of an 'end' caption, leaving the effects of the film to continue unresolved in the mind of the audience...",8,2,3,11 March 2001
The Birds," The pinnacle of underachievement from the most overrated director of all time.
","The fifty-fourth film of Hitchcock's 59-strong career as a director (out of which only 20 or so are really well-known), I will commit film heresy by lumping this one together with `The Big Sleep' and `The Exorcist' as examples of films that are vastly overlauded by the movie critic industry. Psycho is a worthwhile piece of work, and IS well-shot, though others  such as the middle-brow, clumsy exposition of North By Northwest  are vaguely above average and surely not worthy of such high praise?Reappraisal for weak films happens all the time and I feel certain that this should happen in reverse. The Birds may have worked in 1963, when its overlaid pictures of flying birds and feeble puppetry looked convincing. But without such sophistication in a 90s context, the attention is instead drawn to the script and acting, and that is where it clearly falls down. Okay, maybe I come from the Robert DeNiro method school and would have liked the birds in question to have had some motivation, rather than `let's just peck people for the hell of it'. But even extracting that argument away from this film, it still falls on many levels. The dialogue is a stilted, stylised set, with deliberately encouraged underplaying by the cast, Jessica Tandy particularly. This would be fine in another film, but in one as bizarre as this it means we are left with no sense of reality.There are the silly bits, of course, such as the two (laughably fake) budgerigars that sit on the car floor and bend in time with the bends in the road. Okay, I will refrain from making pathetic puns about this film `giving me the bird' and the bird in question being a turkey. All I will say is that this film would not be accepted from any other director. It is a cheap, low-brow exploitation picture that takes its audience for granted and shows them no respect in return. From any other director this one would be regarded as pulp horror of the cheep, sorry, cheapest variety. But at date of writing this one is ranked 222 in the IMDb top 250.",8,1,2,18 December 1999
Jurassic Park," 'You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you knew what you had you patented it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox'
","Okay, it's a nice, knowing reference, but the sole one amongst the mire. Jurassic Park was, at least until the advent of Independence Day and Godzilla, a new low in brain-dead popcorn fodder. I really, really cannot stand this film. Appallingly patronising to its audience, it expects nothing from them and offers them nothing in return.WARNING: THE REST OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERSThe cast's roles are built up with the most cursory of characteristics. Witness how Sam Neill's Dr. Grant starts the story not wanting children, yet spends the whole film in their company, thus undergoing a typical 'learning process'. Plot points are given unsubtly for future reference in the film, such as the attack patterns of the velociraptors. (I wonder, do you think they WILL attack someone like that before the end?) 'I'm not a computer nerd, I prefer to be called a hacker' offers Lex after being sneezed over by a Brachiosaurus. Let me guess, would her ability to hack a computer be relevant somewhere in the movie? Let's not even mention the dinos that open doors by the handle.Richard Attenborough is probably the worst performer as Dr. Hammond. He starts the movie with an effeminate Scottish accent, which fluctuates to English, then to Scots, then back to English... was the continuity adviser drunk? Maybe he should have played the part as 'Pinkie' from 'Brighton Rock'. At least it would have been entertaining. 'Stick yer perishin' mincers on that T-Rex'. Jeff um Gold arr blum, joins joins him in ah clumsy ex uh position, then spends the rest of the film uh lying lying on a uh couch. Actually, despite having nothing to do, Goldblum shows why he earns every cent of his wages by being the only one to give some sort of life to the cut-out he's given.The rigid banality and cynical, transparent manipulation of the film, coupled with its overblown incidental music really starts to grate before long. And while some scenes might be disturbing for small children, its PG certificate, mainstream targets and lowbrow denomination means you know none of the cast will be harmed. Or would a family film really show a ten-year-old boy being electrocuted and then dying? Therefore: no tension. See also: Independence Day, or: if it was real they never would have got that saucer out of the nuclear explosion in time.What everyone always discusses are the dinosaurs, of course. While, for the most part, excellent, they appear for less than - count 'em - 20 minutes of the film's total. This leaves us with 85% of a movie that is stock, run-of-the-mill and predictable. Even the mighty Samuel L. Jackson looks bored in this one*. On reflection, it appears that novelty was fundamental to its success. The sequel, The Lost World, was a better film yet wasn't as popular, critically or commercially.Jurassic Park is a film riddled with 'cute' kids, 'comedy' fat bloke, feeble one-liners and double takes. There's even 'humorous' use of 'ironic' juxtaposition, such as the T-Rex bringing down a flyer from When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth. 'Now that is one big pile o'sh*t' says Goldblum at one point. To highlight that quote for the purposes of mockery would be cheap and unkind.* I happened to stumble on my old review in September 2005 and edited it for a few minor typos. How ironic that in the five years since I originally posted this review every single part Sam Jackson has played is one that he's looked thoroughly bored in.",4,7,22,31 July 2000
The Wizard of Oz," 'Only bad witches are ugly.'
","What a curious lesson in morality that is. But then there's plenty more in this dated musical about a redneck girl's Day-Glo daydream.With self-conscious sentimentality this film is so sanitised that a chubby Judy Garland can fall into a pigsty without being covered in a single drop of pig muck. However, it's impossible to criticise the film in modern terms Â– Garland's stagy, melodramatic performance was typical for the time Â– and the whole movie has the sense of the classic, if not actually the sense of being any good.The picture's transformation from monochrome to Technicolor is justly praised, though the painted backdrops are a little obvious and two-dimensional. It's images seemingly inspired (and were improved by) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There the Oompa Loompas would dole out social commentary in song form; here the Munchkins chant asinine phrases. And just how irritating are the Munchkins? It's all really quite twee and forced, and despite entering the collective consciousness, songs like 'Follow The Yellow Brick Road' are really quite annoying when heard for real. It's all very ambitious, but there's also an unsettling lack of genuine wit.Much better are the talking trees, wicked witch and flying monkeys. All silly now of course, but absolutely terrifying to children. I still remember being scared silly at the witch being dissolved with water. There's also a scene with the Tin Man where his dance causes him to almost topple over in moves mimicked by Michael Jackson in Moonwalker. Jackson would later play the Scarecrow in the all-black version, The Wiz. That's the character without a brain. How curious.Of course, this is definitely not one to watch with an after-Christmas hangover, the 'lions and tigers and bears' chant being particularly grating on the senses. Brash and unremittingly childish, The Wizard of Oz is less a cinematic experience, more like spending 100 minutes being shouted at by a hyperactive toddler.",6,9,27,6 January 2001
