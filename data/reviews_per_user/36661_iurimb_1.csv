It," There's a lot more going on in this movie that you'll end up realizing by the end of it, I'll tell you a story too here (my thoughts after watching the movie)
","First of all, besides great acting, great slow progressing and compelling story , good special effects , besides all of this great stuff there's a deeper, more meaningful message to take from this movie. So hear me out and follow me because I will tell you a story of my own. (no spoilers included). Concealed beneath all of this I've just previously stated there's more than reaches the eye, It tells us about how society is blind to its own fear and hatred, things we sometimes ignore, shows us we should be more aware of these things going on around us, in this movie this fear and hatred takes the form of an evil clown, but these are very real things and I believe this is what inspired Stephen King (if this remake was indeed written by him, that I do not know), but what I do know is the message it brings out, it teaches us to take up arms and face our fears and challenges, together, and face all evil that oppose us, because the worst of all modern evil comes from our own minds, nothing to fear but fear itself. The 'you'll float too' thing kinda passed me by as I did not quite understand the meaning behind that, maybe more about it in a sequel (?). Great movie, even better message I took from it, hope you can all relate and felt inspired by this great work of art.",9,3,5,22 September 2017
