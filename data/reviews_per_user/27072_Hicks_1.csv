Alien 3," This is definitely a solid chapter that makes a perfect trilogy complete.
","Despite all the negative feedback that this movie received, I do consider it an excellent movie. I believe that the movie succeeded to capture 'alien atmosphere' in its own unique manner. Dark and rusty mood, feel of desperation, empathy, horror and terror are all mixed in one great movie-making cocktail. There is no combat action like in the previous installment 'Aliens', that alone, was definitely the right decision to follow. The music score by Elliot Goldenthal is astonishing. In my opinion, the music score is like a second nature to this universe and Mr. Goldenthal definitely delivers a consistent yet unique accompaniment. To this day I do consider it as his best work. Bravo Maestro! The suspense in the film is rigid, the 'running in the tunnels' scenes are very chilling, with cast delivering first-rate performance. Special Effects are good and the ending; well what can I say not to spoil it. If the movie does not have a happy end it does not make it a bad movie. This is definitely a solid chapter that makes a perfect trilogy complete.",8,1,3,6 June 2001
