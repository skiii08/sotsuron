The King's Speech," A touching, historical masterpiece
","I rarely rate a movie a '10' but in this case, it is well deserved. Truly, there is no way to improve upon the achievement that this film represents, whether in casting, direction, writing, artistic value, you name it.The story gives us a fascinating look into the struggles faced by George VI on his way to becoming king of England. The story line is all about his stuttering, but underneath all that are suppressed memories from childhood, growing up in the shadow of an elder brother, perpetual negative reinforcement from a domineering father, etc. It's a psychoanalytical look at a well-known royal family, and while I can't vouch for its absolute veracity, it gives a rare glimpse into the lives of people we wouldn't otherwise observe at this level of intimacy (much like 'Queen' did a few years ago).The contrast between George and Edward VIII is most fruitful. It's the clash between duty and hedonism, fulfilling one's personal quest for happiness vs. overcoming one's worst fears on behalf of your people and country. Edward is typically romanticized and lionized, but here we see him as more of a spoiled, selfish lout.But the heart of the movie is the relationship between George and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who is helping him overcome his speech problems. Both actors are at the absolute top of their form. Firth is brilliant as the aloof, initially reluctant and distrustful monarch, while Rush shows the same wink-of-the-eye humor and irony that he did as Barbossa, relishing the sheer inequality of their positions yet knowing the extent to which George is dependent on him. Ultimately a true friendship develops between the men, and since they are both such endearing characters, it's a joy to watch.I should add that Helena Bonham-Carter is also spot-on as the haughty yet practical queen consort. Other more minor roles are effectively played (e.g., Winston Churchill, George V). The entire movie is a perfect blend of history, personal and familial drama, with broader themes of perseverance and overcoming adversity which give it a timeless application.Lastly, in this movie's case, the 'R' rating is for 'Ridiculous.' The only potentially offensive material is some over-the-top language (including the F-word) which plays a part in one scene, and is clearly used for comic purpose and with great effect. I unhesitatingly took my 13 year old daughter and (depending on the child) might be okay for even younger ones. Don't let that stop you from seeing this gem.",10,175,215,27 December 2010
Skyfall," A real classic Bond film
","I say 'classic' in two senses. First, because I believe all future Bond movies will be compared to this one; second, because this is the first Bond movie (to my knowledge) that doesn't rely on gimmicky sci-fi plot twists, or completely unbelievable gadgets or technological breakthroughs that allow the villain to control the world.I also say 'real' because nearly everything about this movie is very realistic and plausible. You don't ever feel like you are in a make-believe world. There are a few points at which the viewer's credulity is tested (mainly the computers), but for most of the movie, things look and feel completely plausible.Skyfall has essentially redefined the genre while remaining true to the essential character of the brand. We still have the suave, polished Mr. Bond, but he's now aging, not quite as sure of himself (and thus very real). The villain, perhaps the creepiest ever, is simply a twisted wreck of a human, but still clearly human. All the stock features are there, including a phenomenal opening credits in the standard psychedelic mood but very creatively handled, and with a great song by a top current singer (Adele).Casting is excellent, and Daniel Craig has already established himself as the best Bond of all time. Bardem in the villain's role is phenomenal, Dench is the best M ever, and while the youthful Q is a bit sophomoric, he does add a nice contrast to the now middle-aged Bond. The introduction of Ralph Fiennes is very good, he fits his role and the entire Bond milieu perfectly.The plot is straightforward, the tension palpable, and the conclusion has some surprises. Bond is seen to be human and vulnerable, yet still an incredible killing machine. Absolute must see for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Bond franchise.",9,3,11,24 November 2012
The Young Victoria," see it for the music and costumes
","This movie is all about atmosphere. It very successfully recreates the era of Queen Victoria's early life, just before and after her coming to the throne. The performances by the main characters are generally good though not spectacular. The only ones that I found particularly endearing were King William (Jim Broadbent, has he ever been less than brilliant?) and Viscount Melbourne (Paul Bettany), neither of whom were principal characters. And the story line has some weaknesses: it seems to peak a little early, and ends at what seems like an arbitrary moment in history.All that being said, there are many good reasons to see this fabulous film: (1) the costumes are just absolutely gorgeous, and there are so many of them. Scene after scene is filled with gowns that are to-die-for. (2) the gardens and palaces at which the movie was filmed are also beautiful; many are recognizable landmarks in their own right (Ham House which stands in for Kensington Palace, Hampton Court). (3) The period atmosphere is impeccably presented, transporting the viewer to another world.But most importantly, (4) the soundtrack. I was blown away by the way in which the music integrates themes from classic compositions (Handel, Dvorak, Schubert, et al.) and weaves them into new forms that align perfectly with the action of the movie. You hear the music, and for a while you think, 'hey, that sounds familiar, have I heard that before?' and soon it transforms itself from a contemporary composition into the actual classical piece. My explanation doesn't do it justice, you'll have to see/hear it to understand.Altogether, a rich, lush, very romantic movie about the early Romantic period, a delight for both the eyes and ears.",8,1,1,8 July 2010
The Other Boleyn Girl," Solid effort, well worth seeing
","A few things up front: I never read the book, I love period movies, and I've always been interested in the Tudors. In light of that...'The Other Boleyn Girl' excels in many, many ways. The look and feel of the film are superb (I guess credit the art direction). There is always a brooding, mysterious, dark element in every visual. I think there were only two instances where we saw full golden sunlight, and those were two scenes, one at the very beginning and one at the very end, where children are shown running through a tall grass field.The costumes are fabulous. The colors seemed a bit strong and almost gaudy for that era, but the clothes (men's and women's) are to die for.Acting was very strong throughout. Scarlet as Mary Boleyn was fantastic, at first disliking the court and only going in order to help her sister's cause; then gradually warming up to Henry and eventually coming to love him; then her hardened, steely self towards the end as she sees her family come to disaster and herself as the only cool-headed person left who can do some good.Portman's portrayal of Anne was terrific. She too went through a series of changes and made them all credible. Her gradual unraveling towards the end was particularly powerful and remained convincing.Bana's Henry was, contrary to other reviewers' opinions, very engaging and quite central to the film. He was able to capture both the tenderness and poetic side of Henry along with his manic and despotic side.Supporting roles were also well done: Queen Catherine, the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother, all had important contributions. Anne and Mary's parents, the Boleyns, were fascinating: the grasping of the father for advancement and riches, but always with some nagging doubts showing in his eyes; and the resigned strength of the mother who was powerless to interfere and could only watch her family's destruction.Now, on the other hand, the script does suffer from numerous shortcomings. The language throughout is very much today's language, and one is often struck by phrases and sentiments which surely no one in that era could have conceived or framed in those words. There are a number of loose ends which the plot never ties up: what happens to Mary's son or her husband, for instance? And if Norfolk in the end betrays his family, why are we not given any insight to his moral wrestlings with this betrayal (after seeing him plot and scheme to advance the family interests all through the movie)? Music was generally weak; not at all period-appropriate, occasionally trying to be but generally not.The most profound aspect of the movie is that it made one think about the role of women, how the only avenue for an ambitious woman to reach power and authority was to seduce a powerful man, and Henry was about as powerful as they got. To think that a miscarriage meant the difference between her being beheaded or being the most powerful woman in the realm is pretty amazing. This is also a strong cautionary tale, as Anne seeks the security that comes from being married to the king, although the only way to do that is to convince him to annul his previous marriage which in turn makes all his future marriages just as easily revocable. The relationship between sisters is another dominant theme, part rivalry, part mutual support, and in the end unflagging devotion.All in all, it is probably not the definitive portrayal of these characters, but it does capture one's imagination. Whether historically informed or not, the movie conveys a powerful sense of the turmoil and intrigue of the Tudor court.",8,4,8,10 March 2008
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Highly entertaining, great for ESC fans
","This would have been so much better if:a) Will Ferrell had stayed out, and they had cast a reasonably aged/sized actor
b) 30 min. had been trimmed outStill, the entertainment value is great and if you have any familiarity with Eurovision acts from the past, you'll find the context very familiar. Several past ESC winners show up in cameos, Graham Norton (as usual) is brilliant, but really the best performance of all goes to Dan Stevens (of Matthew Crawley fame). He plays the ego-driven superstar who is alternately lovable and also despicable; really enjoyed watching him in this. If you can stomach > 2 hrs of Ferrell's absurdities and over-the-top exaggerations, and if you have any appreciation for the madness that is the ESC, you'll certainly enjoy this movie. And perhaps it will introduce a few Americans to the ESC, which is not a bad thing.",7,2,3,5 July 2020
Children of Heaven," Enjoyable, simple family movie with solid values
","This is a great movie especially for children: the plot is simple, there is no real villain, the main characters are children, and it's an excellent eye-opener about how life is lived in a very different society.It suffers a bit because it is too simple, and doesn't have quite enough tension to keep adults fully interested; but since it is fairly short, it doesn't really drag either.The story illustrates the story of a very poor family in which the brother (Ali) manages to lose the only pair of shoes that his sister (Zahra) has. To avoid the wrath of the father who is behind on rent and is unable to make ends meet, they work out a scheme whereby they take turns with Ali's sneakers: Zahra takes them to school in the morning, then Ali in the afternoon. Eventually Ali enrolls in a race hoping to bring home a new pair of sneakers as the prize.There is much of great value in this film. The two children really shine: they are endearing, tender, kind, almost saintly. It's particularly touching to see Ali's concern for his little sister, knowing that it was his fault the shoes were lost, and how he does so many things to try and cushion the loss for her. The father is the one character with some depth or complexity. He's easily angered and gruff, yet he clearly loves his children and wife and is doing his best in spite of circumstances. Another weakness of the movie was the ending, which left a lot to be inferred by the viewer and did not have the tidy, clear conclusion one would expect. Then again, the art of film-making lies in subtleness, but I thought this might have been too subtle.This is an excellent didactic movie for children: it promotes decency and goodness and it teaches the value of self-sacrifice and caring for others in one's family; that even when one is poor, one can perform acts of charity towards others even less fortunate; that the greatest nobility in human character can be found among the poorest and most destitute, but also among the rich (e.g., the grandfather who hires Ali's father as gardener). These virtues and values are universal and transcend nationality and ethnicity and religion, which is why this movie has such a broad appeal.",8,2,4,26 January 2008
Life of Pi," Visual feast but difficult to grasp meaning
","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word 'beautiful.' I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.",7,5,9,24 November 2012
21," Stylish and satisfying
","'21' follows the rise (and ultimate fall, and what happens afterward) of a college math wiz recruited by his professor to outwit the blackjack tables at Las Vegas and make a ton of money. It's a well made movie with lots of class and style, and if you aren't turned off by the notion of filthy lucre, then you are bound to enjoy this.The movie works well because of its cast. Jim Sturgess, the young male lead, is outstanding. He does a great job of transitioning from initial uncertainty to eventual acceptance and ultimately relishing his new 'career.' He's eminently likable and you can't help pulling for him all the way.Kate Bosworth is lovely as his love interest, always impeccably polished. She looks a bit old for the part of a college student, and especially her style of clothing in the casinos (while ravishing) is not quite right for a 21-year old. I wish more buildup had been devoted to her relationship with Sturgess, but the movie is all told from his angle. Best of all, Kevin Spacey is dead-on as the ringleader. He is cool, efficient, very sharp with every line. As always, he always manages to steal every scene he is in.There is also a nice subplot about these aging casino security agents, who are being phased out in favor of software recognition systems. It gives the movie more depth and interest, and ultimately you can't help realizing that these guys, while 'villains' in one sense, are also 'heroes' in another.The look of the film is fabulous, well worth consideration for art direction. It's all about Vegas, but not over the top, somehow. You never blame the character for falling into the trap, because it is all so addictive: the cash, the clothes, the fabulous rooms (it's almost worth seeing the movie just to see those penthouse suites!). The editing and camera work are awesome. They did an especially good job zooming way in on the cards, to where they almost become characters in the story. But it never gets technical, it never dwells on splitting 8's or hitting a soft 17 or anything like that. Even if you know nothing about the game (and I know very little), it won't impair your enjoyment of the movie.It's not a very deep movie, but it does have insight into human character and motivation. It's mainly just a lot of fun to watch. I give it a solid 8 (maybe shading towards 8-1/2).",7,2,3,3 April 2008
Dunkirk," Tensely gripping but hard on the ears
","There is much to like in this film, particularly if you like to be held in continuous tension for the better part of two hours. The screenplay interweaves 4-5 different story lines, all happening somewhat simultaneously but presented in not-always-chronological fashion. It's sometimes disconcerting, but there are many moments where you get to view an event from two or three different perspectives, which is very creative and adds interest. The narrative is of course harrowing, but you see it not so much through the eyes of a few individuals, but of the collective whole. In other words, the story doesn't dwell very much on any particular soldier or airman, and the ones depicted pretty soon all blur into one.The one exception is the Mark Rylance character, the boat owner who takes his sons into a war zone and thereby saves a couple dozen lives. His selfless courage and dedication to his mission is memorable, though I found his stoicism in the face of personal loss and tragedy almost too much to believe.The movie does an incredible job at immersing you in the battle scene, the confusion and madness and chaos. The air-to-air dogfights were easily the best I've ever seen; just the footage of the Spitfires, Bf-109s, and He 111 were worth the price of admission.However, there were some serious flaws. Most notably, one's ears are continually assaulted by super-loud noise. Perhaps this was an attempt to be realistic, but it went overboard. Every explosion, every round hitting a metal hull is over-amplified and painfully loud. Even scenes where ordnance is not being detonated come off as too loud, and I found that I could understand only a small fraction of the dialogue. Fortunately there isn't much dialogue and it's not very important, but it's still annoying. The story line is also fragmented and disjoint, with too many things going on at once. If they had stuck to fewer story lines, focused on a few of the men more closely, then I might have been more drawn to their fate. In the end, when the survivors reach England, I felt elation because of national pride and all that, but not because Private so-and-so made it home alive, since I knew nothing about him or what he was coming back to.Finally, I wish some aspects of the high-level strategic planning had been depicted. Who decided to requisition the little boats, when, how did they implement that plan, what sort of political dramas were played out among the Admiralty and the Government? This would have added historical depth and relevance.PS: upon a second viewing, the film got a WHOLE lot better. Definitely need to see this twice.",8,3,5,23 July 2017
The Intouchables," A French gem
","This is easily the best and most memorable movie I've seen in a very long time. Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.The real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.It's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless. This is the first time I've seen a French film that didn't leave me depressed and suicidal by the end. I hope many more like it will follow.",9,6,11,15 August 2013
The Duchess," sumptuous visual feast
","'The Duchess' tells the tale of the beautiful young Georgiana Spencer (Knightley) who, in the late 18th century, is married to the much older Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes) and attains wealth, status, and prestige, all at the price of being condemned to a loveless marriage. It's familiar ground: the duke is the typically phlegmatic English nobleman, unable to express or perhaps even experience emotions, while his wife is in every way his superior: in intellect, courage, self-reliance, devotion to children, etc.Most of the story revolves around the inequality between men's and women's lives: the former openly flaunting their mistresses while the latter are forbidden such dalliances. Men don't come off very well in this movie: they beat their wives, threaten them with separation from their children, and treat their girls with utter indifference while a boy is the ultimate prize.While the plot is not altogether scintillating, the acting more than makes up for it. Knightley is at her best, able to convey all the emotions the role requires. But the star of this movie is Fiennes, who in spite of playing a truly unlikeable character, manages to keep him from being utterly detestable. At the end, his humanity finally breaks through just a little bit, and one wishes the script would have allowed a few more glimmers at earlier points in the movie as well.But even if one were to magically delete all dialogue from the film, and just watch it on the big screen with the soundtrack, it would be well worth it. The constant parade of fashions, primarily women's but also men's, is like a documentary of late 18th century clothing. Each scene seems to outdo the other. It's like walking through a museum full of Gainsborough and Reynolds portraits, and seeing each one come to life; wonderful! The stately mansions, the magnificent teams of horses, the sweeping vistas of gardens and sheep on the pastures, it's all England at its very finest. The soundtrack was beautiful, lush and romantic and very apropos. I particularly liked the inclusion of much period music which was intelligently (though not always accurately) paired with the era. Was Bach played in England in 1775? I rather doubt it, but still it fit nicely and sounded gorgeous.Do see this on the big screen; don't wait for the DVD.",8,5,6,18 October 2008
The Chorus," Beautiful, heartwarming
","This film is a rarity on several counts. First, a French film that doesn't leave one depressed, that is rare enough. Second, a sentimental and touching film that doesn't descend into mawkishness or maudlin territory. And third, a simple and predictable plot that still holds your attention because of the charm of the characters.The story is set in post-WW 2 France, with destitute and/or orphaned boys in a harshly run boarding school. There's the usual sadistic headmaster, but the other teachers are far more human. (I wish we had seen more of these teachers, they would have added a great other dimension, and the movie is short enough.) The new 'prefect' (teaches the kids but also chaperones them in their sleeping quarters) earns the trust and respect of these otherwise troublesome urchins by showing kindness. A musician himself, he finds that he can give them a positive outlet for their energies by forming a choir, at the same time finding an avenue for performing his own compositions.While simple and not very original, the pleasure of this movie is in the execution. The prefect and the various other characters are quite real and multi-dimensional; the bad ones have good qualities, and vice-versa as well. You really sense the despair of being imprisoned in that school for months and years, and the sense of futility which overcomes the staff. The music is haunting and beautiful, including the score and also the choral pieces practiced/performed by the boys.The ending is mostly satisfying, though not all the threads are tied up in the way one expects. The retrospective way of telling the story also adds some interest and poignancy, when you realize who those people were in the first opening scenes.Very strongly recommended and, except for a few vulgarities (which are probably a little less hard-edged in the English subtitles), an excellent family film.",8,1,1,18 January 2009
The Piano," Interesting, but not very convincing
","'The Piano' has a lot going for it: a strong cast, a unique premise, great on-site scenery, but somehow the combination left me flat and unmoved.The story follows a young English mute woman (Holly Hunter) who is sent to New Zealand to become a bride for a local settler (Sam Neill). Her passion is her piano which she brings across the ocean, but her new husband has no interest in it. Instead, one of his native workers (a curiously miscast Harvey Keitel, who doesn't look Maori for a moment) is drawn to her, and thus we have our triangle.Some of the scenes showing the interplay of Maori and English cultures were fascinating. The views of New Zealand, both the large-scale and also the smaller-scale views of jungles and mud (there is LOTS of mud!) were very enjoyable. The idea of someone being forced to express herself solely through music, and then finding herself in this wilderness totally devoid of culture, that too was interesting.But this story lives and dies on the basis of its characters, and somehow the main ones (the men especially) were baffling and, worst of all, unsympathetic. Neill's character treats his new wife with coldness and indifference at first, though he does seem to warm to her later on. Keitel's character is even less plausible. He is drawn to her sexually, and realizes he can use the piano as a bargaining tool to achieve his carnal desires. Halfway there, though, he relents. In the meantime, Hunter's character warms up to him, even though he was abusing her. Hunter does the best acting, even though she can't speak any words, still she conveys the frustration and anger and resentment at her predicament very well.More could have been made of the piano as a metaphor for civilization out in the wilderness among the savages, but it wasn't. In fact there was the opposite: the native man feigns interest in the piano, only to ensnare the beautiful woman. One never feels that his interest in the piano was truly musical or artistic.Again, it's hard to explain exactly why, but the combination of characters just did not click very well for me.I found the score hopelessly anachronistic; at no point does the piano play any of the music one would have expected during that period (Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, etc.), but it's still decently pretty. And be warned, there is plenty of male nudity, including the full frontal variety, and a little female as well.It's worth seeing, but I walked away thinking that a very interesting premise was somehow mishandled and left untapped.",6,0,3,24 February 2008
Saints and Soldiers," small-scale war movie is a true gem
","'Saints and Soldiers' presents an intimate, detailed look at one particular incident during the Battle of the Bulge, and its effects on a handful of allied soldiers. The story follows four Americans who escape their German captors and hide out in the woods, where they come upon a Brit pilot with key intelligence information. To help him get this information to their commanders, they embark on a harrowing cross-country journey across German-held territory to reach their own lines.While there are several battle scenes, and plenty of men dying, this ends up being less an action film and much more a thought-provoking idea film. Of the main characters, one is a devout Christian, one a confirmed atheist, and it is the interplay between these two world views that makes the plot gripping and fascinating. Both are trying to make sense of the horrors they are going through, and while they start out somewhat at odds, they grow closer as the movie goes on.It's hard not to compare this to 'Saving Private Ryan,' another story of a small band of GI's going cross-country and battling Germans, trying to reach someone and accomplish something. Yet where 'Ryan' left me totally depressed and emotionally empty, 'Saints and Soldiers' rewards the viewer with an uplifting, encouraging message. Both deal with the consequences of pity/mercy on the part of the GI's towards a German prisoner, but with vastly different outcomes. Every aspect of this movie was remarkably well done. There is visual beauty in the winter landscape, a sparse but nonetheless effective soundtrack (one main theme that is really haunting), great camera and audio work in the action scenes, and genuinely powerful performances by all the key actors. To realize this was all done on a minuscule budget only adds to my admiration.This movie will leave you thinking about its characters, images, and ideas long after it's faded away. A well-deserved 10/10.",10,3,8,4 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Loved the costumes, hated the rest
","For sheer sartorial splendor, this movie is unbeatable. But the raves end at the costume department: everything else about this movie is awful. I so loved the first 'Elizabeth' that I was ready to love the sequel, but it was a complete disappointment.Blanchett's acting is good enough, but none of her supporting cast do much more than deliver wooden lines with no sentiment. Rush, who was such a powerful figure in the earlier movie, is not much more than window dressing here. He has little to say, little to do, and adds no drama to the story. Owen is stiff and unconvincing. Perhaps the best is the Spanish king who at least is interesting. Or maybe Tom Hollander as Mary's jailer: he has only a few lines but he delivers them with intensity and makes them count. The rest seem to have had a really bad time of it.And as with most lousy movies, this one dies because of its story, or lack thereof. The script has a mix of equal parts love, family, jealousy, religion, politics, intrigue, militaria, and does none of them justice. The battle scenes look phony and unconvincing; there is the hackneyed scene of the great speech before the big battle, but the battle never happens. The love stories are never convincing (neither one of them), and we never sympathize with either of the heroines. There is some smattering of religious thought thrown in, along with anachronistic sentiments of freedom triumphing over the inquisition, but the real issues (Catholicism vs. Protestantism) are never touched upon. One might think love of one's native land would be a theme in such a picture, but it's hardly even mentioned. There are so many minor subplots I can't even remember them all, and none of them amount to much of anything. Oh yes, Mary Queen of Scots, she makes a few cameo appearances as well, and we spend many minutes in lurid anticipation of her beheading, but then that too seems to have no connection with anything else.Seems like the director/screenwriter couldn't choose which story they wanted to dramatize, so they tried to dramatize all five at once and ended up with a pointless hodge-podge.I hate to admit it, but I was ready to walk out about halfway through but was too embarrassed. This from a guy who loves historical period films and who has the original 'Elizabeth' near the top of the all-time list. Apparently the genius of the first film has completely eluded the makers of the second.I give it 3/10.",3,13,17,23 October 2007
Valkyrie," gripping wartime drama
","Without question, this is a well made movie, and the story is told in a compelling, engaging way even though we all know it's going to turn out badly for our hero. The costumes, props, everything is superbly well turned out.The characters involved in the plot are also interesting, each with their own internal conflicts. The interplay between political and military thinking is fascinating to watch. I had never before considered 'so what happens after Hitler is dead?' which took up the greater part of the planning and scheming and plotting (and also gave the movie its title, from operation 'Walkure').Cruise does well, but his supporting cast is outstanding, including numerous ex-Pirates: Gibbs, Beckett, Mercer, even Davy Jones all show up. They looked a lot more colorful in pirate garb than in Nazi gray and green, though.Still, while the movie does provide an excellent education in the assassination plot and the situation in Germany in mid-1944, it leaves us with little to hold on to. The key men all were martyred and paid with their lives, yet as the movie presents things, they accomplished next to nothing. Somewhere else I read that as a result of this plot, Hitler became even more reclusive and distrustful of his inner circle, which led to him taking less advice from capable generals and making more military mistakes. So ultimately this point could have been made somehow, but it wasn't.Worth seeing by all means, but no big loss by waiting for the DVD rental.",7,7,11,4 January 2009
Atonement," Doesn't live up to the hype
","I was prepared to love 'Atonement,' but I came away very disappointed. The film failed in two basic ways: 1) None of the characters were intrinsically likable or endearing. The only one I felt any sympathy for was the 18-year old Briony, because she was truly suffering and could find no way out. But neither of the two protagonists grabbed me in any way. Their love was never made credible or plausible, we never got to see any of the reasons why Keira's character would fall in love with that guy, aside perhaps from the hot weather and the dreariness of the other available men. But that's hardly enough to keep her love at white-hot pitch for years afterwards.2) So many of the key incidents are so utterly improbable, that one cannot take the plot seriously at all. Take the incident with the flower vase: they live in this huge mansion, they're obviously filthy rich, and the girl is distraught over breaking one silly ceramic piece? And even if she was, wouldn't she just call a servant to go dredge up the broken piece, rather than diving into the water herself? Or sending a 13-year old out in the dark, alone, to search for the missing twins; who would ever do that? If this were more of a fantasy story, I'd be more accommodating, but this was clearly presented as gritty reality.The film-making is good, but even that had some annoying qualities. It seemed like so many shots were close-ups, I felt nauseatingly oppressed by the sheer size of the images. The whole typewriter-as-percussion-instrument idea was cute the first time, but it lost its novelty after about the third instance. The first portion of the movie reminded me a lot of a Poirot episode, except without the grace and charm. The English are all snobs, upper crust with genteel manners but horrible people at the core, and there is no one of any value you can cling to. The Dunkirk scenes were quite impressive, and the reality of nursing life during the war was equally intense.And I have to say, of all Keira's major roles thus far, this is easily her least likable. Maybe it's all that smoking, you almost feel like coughing by the end.",5,3,6,7 January 2008
