Mission: Impossible III," Mission Possible Now
","I went to see this movie after watching the first two Missions (MI and MI-2) and this one was a rocker, the first two shouldn't have been made. I haven't had great fun watching an action thriller since Collateral. Tom cruise is as awesome as ever, looked amazing throughout the movie. Rest did a good job as well, light humor during the mission sequences was fun. And finally the techie stuff, mind blowing... just reminds us we are in 21st century.All in all Tom cruise finally made the mission possible this time round.Go watch it... U won't be disappointed.",9,1,1,10 June 2006
Rang De Basanti," Aaahh what a Movie.... After a long time...
","I got this feeling when i saw Lagaan a couple of years back and i had the same goose bumps when i witnessed the true brilliance of actors and director and music director in form of RANG DE BASANTI...Movie belongs to Amir all the way, he proves yet again, why hes the most talented actor in Bollywood. All actors supported him beautifully...Another scoring point is the dialogues, just awesome...And last but not the least the amazing brilliance of Mr. A R RAHMAN, this man adds life to this movie with his inspirational music...Watch it you must, if you are movie lover...",10,2,7,4 February 2006
The Dark Knight Rises," What more can you expect from a movie...
","This is one movie for which i was desperately waiting for almost an year since the teaser was out last year. Been a die hard fan of the Nolan's batman series and last 2 movies so far, I took a day off from work and went to see first day first show as i couldn't have waited any longer. I definitely went in with high expectations and boy i wasn't expecting high enough. This is a master piece and anyone who claims to be a movie buff should/must see this movie as there is no way one see this movie and not go like WOW a thousand times. This movie reminded me of Shawshank redemption a bit and it showed that summer action movie can have emotion too...This is Nolan's best work by far and if you look at his previous work like memento, dark knight, inception and more you can imagine he is truly the master filmmaker of our generation and generations to come.Christian bale has given his best performance so far i think, it matches the performance he gave for fighter. All other characters are played to perfection by all the brilliant actors and the most formidable cast that one can ensemble...Amazing music, amazing dialogs, amazing story/screenplay and above all an amazing ending to this brilliant trilogy.I know Chris Nolan has decided not to direct another batman movie, but i hope he does, i hope...",10,2,6,20 July 2012
