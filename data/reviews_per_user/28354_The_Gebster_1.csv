Requiem for a Dream," Without a doubt the most powerful film ever made.
","When I heard about this movie from a friend, I thought it would be something interesting to see. He had said that the movie disturbed him so much that he would not watch it again, even to show it to me. I have been a die-hard horror fan for many years, so I decided to challenge myself with this movie.But because he wouldn't let me see it, it took a long time to get a copy. In all of the time I had been waiting to get the movie, I was reading all I could about it on the internet.There was a lot of hype about how disturbing the movie is, so I couldn't wait to get it. Normally, when I combine lots of hype with a long wait, in the end I am disappointed. I didn't think this movie would be able to get to me. I was wrong. By the end of the movie, I couldn't do anything but sit and stare at the credits rolling by for about ten minutes. I won't go into the plot of the movie, because that is already covered enough by the other comments, but I can tell you that the last few minutes of this film are the most disturbing things I have ever seen in all my years of movie watching. The soundtrack in the movie is also one of the best ever made. This movie is a must see for anybody!",10,0,1,14 October 2005
