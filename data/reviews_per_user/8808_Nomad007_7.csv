Ford v Ferrari," Well Put Together Docudrama
","For what it was, well done, but didn't have much drama, excitement, or emotion and there is two and a half hours of it.I'm well versed in the story having and viewed material about it many times over the years.Was worth a watch but can't recommend it for your average viewer. There's just not enough there for your average viewer. If your a car person, specifically car history it's possibly more your speed.I've fallowed Ferrari and the GT40 as far as Ford is concerned; but I'll probably never watch this one again.Good n then for getting it make but there's not much here for most people.",6,6,18,17 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Least Favorite Marvel Flick
","Out of all the Marvel universe films over the last decade this my for sure my least favorite. And while I'm a huge fan of the Marvel and the MCU the trailers did very little for me. Initial press and reviews didn't add any excitement. I wanted to see it from the beginning anyway but actually didn't see it until nearly two months after release; highly unusual for me with any movie, especially something from the MCU.Much like how Solo did so poorly for Disney with the Star Wars universe, which caused other projects to be canceled, Captain Marvel feels very much the sale. Disney is trying to make every last dollar of profit out of their (very) expensive studio purchases over recent years and they're spreading themselves thin, cutting corners, rushing projects.It was fun to see some of the early days back story and how it relates into the other movies set in current time. Otherwise it felt like they were just reaching.Too much prostheses, not enough enough special effects, poor story, lots and lots and lots of talking, not much action for a sci-fi / action flick.Avengers, Ironman, Captain America, Thor franchises are all much better then Captain Marvel. It's not because it's a female lead either. Wonder Woman (DC, not Marvel) was markedly better compared to Captain Marvel.I wasn't bored but I didn't really feel as engaged with Captain Marvel like I typically do with basically every other Marvel universe film.It's worth a watch, especially if your a fan of the universe. I'm sure I'll buy it on video when it comes out, if only to keep the collection complete, but I can't say how many times if at all I'd watch it again.I am however, looking forward to the upcoming Black Widow MCU film, even though it's a years late in development.",6,0,3,29 April 2019
Aquaman," Weakest part of the rebooted DC universe.
",I have to think the movie was just the wrong vechcile for Aquaman. I enjoyed his character in Justice league but it just doesn't work here.,6,1,2,6 March 2019
Ready Player One," Over-hyped and not Spielberg best work.
","A large group of my friends and myself had been waiting for this for some time. We even went so far as to make a trip to the Chinese theater in Hollywood to see if in laser 3D glory on their massive screen.The movie just ended up being so so for everyone in the group. Characters weren't fully developed, plot holes, etc. I personally didn't read the book so as to not have unfair comparison to movie. But as many have said the book is a million miles better compared to movie.Effects good, there was lots of (promised) action but it just wasn't really exciting. Never really connecting with the characters.",6,1,3,2 April 2018
Suicide Squad," Could have been Amazing. Too many bad choices.
","1st Trailer - Awesome 2nd Trailer - Awesome 3rd Trailer - Showed too much of the film and a bunch of low budget effects from something out of a Universal Studios movie like Scorpion King.In the end there was a lot of scenes in the trailers that weren't in the movie. The plot was really different then it should have been. The 'bad' boss' characters were poorly thought out. Effects were low budget, think SyFy channel. Sound was mixed too hot, think 'Fury' with Brad Pitt.Either the studio pulled funding like 'Deadpool' (which could have been even better then it already is) or someone decided the film needed a hack editing job and took out all the decent footage.Hopefully we'll see a much better re-cut version like 'Salt' with Jolie which gives us a different and better version of the film then what ended up in theaters.I love Warner Brothers, and many of there other movies like Batman are done so much better. But someone really screwed up on this project. Sets could have been better. Special effects could have been way better. The whole 'big boss' plot was stupid, the plot could have been so much better in so many ways. They didn't really use The Joker like they could have, or any other crazy villains.Felt like a low budget TV movie between The Mummy, Ghost-busters (original), and Avengers.PLEASE WB correct your mistake and give us a re-cut Suicide Squad version 1.5 !",4,2,5,8 August 2016
Suicide Squad," Ok movie that was jacked up just to get PG13
","This could have been a great movie but the problem is that they insisted that they get a PG13 movie. They wanted a 'family' movie. Nothing about the context of this movie fits into a family movie. If your familiar with the original backstory for the characters in the movie it would have been a very dark, black, and HARD R rating at best. There was loads of R rated footage shot but the director always intended for the movie to be a PG13 movie at most, and the studio forced an even softer PG13 rating for there. They think they'll get a wider audience and more ticket sales with a softer rating but it has been proven time and again that harder rated superhero movies actually do better. You want say that Marvel / Disney doesn't do R and they sell a ton of tickets. But Marvel kills WAY more people than DC, they just don't use language or show blood. Beside DC has ALWAYS been darker, and dare I say more realistic. The problem with Suicide Squad is from the start they were more insistent in getting a PG13 rating and toning evening down so much that even a prime time broadcast TV show shows more than Suicide Squad. Even the (unrated) 'Extended Release' is basically still PG13 and it STILL strips all the life and story out of the movie and leaves it a confused, disjointed, mess of a movie. All the needed footage to make this an 8 or 9 out of 10 was shot and all we can HOPE is they make a fan version of this, since even the director was more concerned about the MPAA rating than telling an authentic story. Even the closing music on the unrated extended release has been censored! Why even use that music to begin with then. It's so obvious what they're saying when even edit it, for credit music, on an unrated version. Why? This is a dark story, that is even darker in its original form; and they insisted in watering it down to try and offend the least amount of people possible. You just pissed off all the people that love the original characters and story. And the goody goody people people are still offended because it's still not family enough and they know what you were editing out anyway. So you're left with a 6/10 movie that could have been 8+/10. Here's hopes the sequel which is taking 4 years for what reasons isn't done the wrong way again, for the same wrong reasons. I can easily saying the studio won't give you enough budget for the sequel because the first film didn't do well enough. Why. The director watered it down till there was nothing left for the sake of a rating and the studio watered it down even further. This is NOT family water, and MOST of the DC Universe ISN'T family material.",4,0,1,21 October 2019
