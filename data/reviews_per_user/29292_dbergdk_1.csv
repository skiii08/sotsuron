United 93," United 93 vs Flight 93
","First of all, the real life hi-jacking and sad ending were cruel/nasty and something i am totally against! - my comments is all about the movie it self.This movie is overall OK, but things that i don't like with it is following:<ul><li>too much hand-held camera from person to person (you get sea-sick) - too long sequences in the flight control room, with lot of people talking, makes me feel a bit lost, in what's going on (maeby its meant this way to show how chaos like it were) - not much from inside plane, to actually feel emotionally with the passenger, fear, chaos, anger.</li></ul>This further comment, can be misplaced will someone think, but i think comparison comes to it's right here.I have also watched Flight 93 (for TV) and that i must say, is much more emotionally. I somehow feels so much more sorry for the people on board, than United 93 (theater). Perhaps its the underlying music, that put up the emotion mood into it, i don't know - but it works for me.Overall my opinion is, that Flight 93 touched me more than United 93.",5,2,6,11 September 2006
