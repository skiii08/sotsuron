Sucker Punch," Everyone who is thinking about seeing this should just go see Hanna instead.
","Beyond awful. I originally was really pumped to see this movie, because, come on... steam punk Nazis? Girls dressed in skimpy clothes kicking ass? Robots? Mental institutions? A dragon chasing a plane?! It looked like it would be aesthetically pleasing, and delightfully cheesy.Instead, we're given another one of Zack Snyder's creepy glamorization of rape threats.It was just gross. I consider myself to be pretty thick skinned, but I just felt really uncomfortable throughout the whole movie. I don't even mind feeling uncomfortable if the story is good, but it just wasn't. It also wasn't empowering at all. If the movie was just the action sequences, it would be passable and could even be potentially seen as being empowering to women. But all of the implied rape and the threats of rape were just totally unnecessary and didn't do anything for the story at all.Hanna just came out and is a much better film for so many different reasons - but I think what I'm most excited about is the fact that she was so strong and the antagonists were scary without being creepy and threatening her with rape. I'm just really tired of Zack Snyder being such a creep in the name of 'art,' especially when the art is no good.",1,7,16,9 April 2011
