United 93," Wow
","I watched this last night and thought it was excellent, shocking and sad but kept you watching til the end even though you knew what was going to happen.I can't even begin to imagine the fear/pain/heartache the families went through from hearing their loved ones say good-bye and the fear of being hijacked is something no person should never have to deal with in their life.Brilliant movie.",8,1,2,24 August 2018
