Deja Vu," Great, Quality Entertainment
",Saw this tonight on filmflex and read the reviews before choosing it. Denzel is usually a good bet and we decided to go for it. After nearly 2 hours we felt thoroughly entertained - if not a little confused about the time-travel. This is a great movie and I really don't understand that bad reviews.All the main actors delivered. The plot which is not without it's loopholes (but it doesn't matter) keeps you hooked and things are explained well throughout in the main. It's what a film should be - ENTERTAINING! I think some of the reviewer on here have forgotten that.For me it was money well spent and I would certainly recommend it.,9,3,6,23 January 2011
