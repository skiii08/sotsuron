Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode Dumb - The Phantom's [CENSORED]
","I saw this movie when it was first released two years ago and from what I remember I must say that this movie will be in my memory solely because it disappointed me so. Episode Numb has so many hang ups.The plot is vague as though Lucas himself wasn't sure where his story was going. The actors mumble their lines as if they can't believe what they've rehearsed, and the animated characters especially Jar Jar only add to the viewers frustration. I think Lucas was experimenting with this particular character. He wanted to know if his team could create a computer generated character that would be believable and life-like. That Jar Jar annoyed audiences worldwide is testament that Lucas succeeded. Although I think the voice behind Jar Jar was the real source of annoyance.
The animation on the whole was definitely good, maybe on par with that of the dragon in 'Dragonheart'. The computer generated world and set designs were visually interesting and the pod race reminded me of the chariot race in 'Ben Hur'. Some of the action sequences seemed to have been thrown in here and there perhaps to snap viewers from their stupor.When it's all said and done what Lucas has managed to create in Episode Mum is eye-candy visuals for the masses most of who are not pleased with a story that is so thin and un-inspired.I've seen the original 1977 Star Wars countless times and when Episode Gum comes to the small screen no doubt I'll watch it again but only to see if I made a mistake about it.",7,1,2,4 February 2001
