The Ring," Ok, but too full of holes
","I have been searching for years for a horror movie that would scare me. This may have been it if it wasn't for all the patched together scenes that did not make sense The character of Aidan was seriously underdeveoloped and reminded me of a rip off of Cole from 'The Sixth Sense', only much less believable.  I suppose this is one of those old movies that is supposed to make you guess what happens for yourself.  What really happens is an assortment of scenes that are added only to make the movie scarier but have no meaning.I'd like to know the answer to the following questions: ***SPOILERS*** If the kid knew this girl was evil, why didn't he keep his mother from helping her? What was the point of showing Noah's girlfriend, she did absolutely nothing to contribute to the movie. In the day of cameras built into cell phones, why didn't anyone have an answering machine? If the tape was that bad, why didn't Rachel hide it from her young child instead of leaving it in the VCR? What was the deal with Aidain looking at that stranger on the street, it had nothing to do with the movie. Why did Mr Morgan wait 20 years to commit suicide, in front of Rachel, and why did he decide to plug every appliance in the house into the BATHROOM? Was the girl evil or a product of evil? Why did the mother kill her daughter?  To protect her or to get rid of her? Why didn't the psychologist on the island NOT see images? What was the point of showing her autistic grandson? Why show Rachel in the shower with blood swirling down the drain, where did the blood come from? How did she get an electrode in her throat? Why did she keep focusing in on that stupid fly, even in scenes before she pulled it out of the screen? Why did all the dead people (who only died of heart failure but looked like they were decomposed) look exactly like Linda Blair in the Exorcist? The horse sub-plot was completely goofy as well. Who made the tape?   The end of the movie I didn't even care anymore, I just wanted it to end because it didn't make sense.  It seemed like they just threw together a bunch of scenes to try to be scary and said 'We'll bill this as one of those movies you have to figure out yourself' so we won't have waste time wrapping anything up. A few strange scenes, but overall not as good as I thought it would be.",Null,0,0,3 November 2002
