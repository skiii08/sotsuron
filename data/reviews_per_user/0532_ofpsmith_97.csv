Men in Black 3," A sequel to Men in Black that's really good.
","Although I didn't think that Men in Black 3 was as good as the first, it was undoubtedly better than the second. Watching it I was reminded of what I loved about the first one. Let me quickly summarize it. The film is about Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), a terrorist who escapes from the Lunar Maximum Security Prison on the Moon, with intent to go back in time to 1969 and kill the man who sent him there, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Meanwhile back in 2012, Agent J (Will Smith) is wondering where K went as he is the only one who remembers K's existence in the alternate time line. J also travels back in time to 1969 to kill Boris and save K. Immediately a better and more innovative plot for a MIB sequel then the second. Not to mention the wise cracks, the jokes, and the little things about it just add to the fun. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out. It's a fun and creative sequel to the first fun and creative MIB.",8,0,2,17 January 2016
The Monuments Men," Underrated
","I seriously don't understand why the critics seem to hate on this film. I personally loved it. I love the characters, the acting, the theme especially. In fact I am listening to the theme right now as I'm writing this. The plot is that during World War 2, the Nazis have stolen all the famous pieces of art from the conquered territories. Reichmarshall Hermann Goering (Udo Kroschwald) has decided to make a Fuhrer Museum with the help of Senior Lance Corporal Viktor Stahl (Justus Von Dohn√°nyi). Meanwhile over in the United States Lieutenant Frank Stokes (George Clooney) has gained permission from Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Michael Dalton) to create a platoon called the Monuments Men to recover the Art stolen by the Nazis. It includes Lieutenant James Granger (Matt Damon), Sergeant Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Sergeant Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Private Preston Savitz(Bob Balaban), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Lieutenant Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas). They go all over France shortly after D-Day to recover some of the Art. They later advance through France and find more and more places where the Art is stolen. But they lose Jean Claude Clermont and Lieutenant Jeffries. But eventually all art is taken by the monuments men and is returned to their owners. I think that this film has been unfairly judged by the critics, because I sure loved it. It's fun, it's funny, and it's an all around great film.",9,0,0,11 June 2014
Captain Phillips," One of the most intense films I've seen in a while.
",It's got to be difficult to take a true story and make it into an intense thriller. Before watching this film I looked up the story of the actual Richard Phillips and therefore knew that he made it out okay. Yet somehow at the near end of this movie I was biting my nails at how intense this was. Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama. When traveling around Somalia his ship is taken over by Somali pirates. But when the cargo crew manage to subdue a weapon from Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) the leader Muse escapes with the rest of the pirates in a lifeboat and holds Captain Phillips hostage. The rest of the movie is the US Navy negotiating with Muse about Captain Phillips's return home. This part is incredibly intense. It was still intense after I read about the real story too so Paul Greengrass did a good job. Hanks's performance was stellar as always so if you like intense films don't miss this.,8,1,3,27 December 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The classic action flick.
","Indiana Jones. One of the most famous and timeless action film series of all time. I love them! Okay I love 2 of them. But either way Indiana Jones is still a timeless classic. And Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite of them. In 1936 Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones (Harrison Ford) is an archaeologist who is recruited by the US Government to find and protect the ark of the covenant before Nazis do. The Nazis are led by Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Along the way Indiana is helped by his old girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his buddy Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). With a great story, fun action scenes, and great characters this is one of my all time favorite movies. Number 14 to be exact. If you haven't seen it, go do that right now.",10,1,2,14 July 2015
It," Solidly done adaptation.
","Stephen King's novel upon which the film is based strikes alot of people different ways. Personally I enjoyed it, though I felt it was longer than it needed to be and a few sscenes were far from neccesary. Luckily this film (unlike its sequel) does not fall into the trap. If you don't know the story it concerns a group of 11-13 year old kids living in the fictional town of Derry, Maine where a malevolent entity makes an appearance every 27 years. They come to realize the existence of the monster and so come together to fight it. Alongside the monster they also have to fight psychotic bullies, variously troubled family lives, and growing up. The film did a good job of bringing the story to light without making it too dense and long (again, not a feat shared by its sequel). The child actors are all apt at portraying the memorable characters and it is a legitamitely scary film. I'd say to go check it out if you liked the book but you've most likely seen it already.",9,0,0,18 September 2019
The Big Lebowski," 'The Dude Abides.'
","Bowling, mistaken identity, white Russians, and kidnapping. These are the words that describe the events in the plot of this movie. It's story is an unemployed bowler named Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is one day mistaken for a billionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston). His rug is ruined so he get's the help of his bowling buddies an insane Vietnam Veteran named Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the Dude's other friend Donny Kerabotsos (Steve Buscemi) to get his ruined rug back. An innumerable number of subplots, a boatload of swearing, and some great lines are what make this film more then worthwhile. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and everything revolves around the Dude. The Dude is a character who has accomplished very little, and does very little, but he seems to have managed himself a very happy life. And that's what really holds together. Everything (as funny as it may be) could have been left out but what you can't take out is the Dude himself. His reactions and way of doing things is what makes this worthwhile. If you haven't seen it then go find it somewhere and watch it.",10,1,3,22 December 2014
Citizen Kane," I'm not being original here but wow.
","I know I'm not saying anything new here but this film is incredible. It's amazingly put together, it has a great story, it's got great acting, great directing, and it's all around perfect. No wonder this is often listed as the best film ever made. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Wells) is a publishing tycoon who dies and his last words are Rosebud. A group of reporters try to find out what he meant by this. Most of the movie is told in flashback form when the reporters interview people. It follows Kane's life as a child to when his second wife left him when he was an old man. The film follows his life beautifully and although I'm not being new or original everyone should see this movie. It is just incredible.",10,1,2,1 November 2014
Zootopia," The best I've seen from Disney in quite a while.
","Zootopia I can already tell is destined to become a classic. Of course the idea of portraying racism without actually using race is nothing new. But this is one of the first films to do it, aimed at children. In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) a young bunny from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of being a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. Unfortunately the commissioner Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), doubts her abilities and assigns her to traffic duty. While there, she meets a conman fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). When Bogo reluctantly let's Judy handle a missing mammal case to look for Emmett Otterton, she and Nick become unwitting partners and friends. Along the way our two heroes are subjected to animal inequality and stereotypes, which near the end becomes a big part of the story. I won't go into all the details bit overall I thought it was a great film, with great characters, and a creative world. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.",9,8,15,1 May 2016
12 Angry Men," My all time favorite movie.
",This film is without any flaws. It's the closest to absolute cinematic perfection I've ever been privileged enough to see. I'm a 13 year old kid and last year when I was in 7th grade civics class my teacher brought this in when we were talking about court cases. I was excited because I'm a big Henry Fonda fan! When I first watched it I loved it but it wasn't my favorite film. Then after I watched it 4 more times I gradually loved it more and more! It then became my favorite film. So this is the plot. 12 jurors are deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18 year old boy accused of stabbing his father with a knife. On the surface the kid looks guilty but juror #8 (Fonda) wants to discuss all witnesses accounts given in court. Eventually he decides that the kid is innocent and eventually so does everyone else. It's interesting to listen to even the smallest details become the most important facts of the whole case. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Every frame of the film is golden. Whoever did the casting is smarter than a scientist. It's so good it looks like I've completely run out of complements to say about it. Watch this movie. It's so amazing it makes everything else seem low. If you ever come across a chance to watch this movie by all means take it!,10,0,1,6 October 2013
Knives Out," Fun and refreshing.
","Knives Out brings the Agatha Christie style whodunit murder mystery into the modern age in a way that both pays homage to the obvious inspiration as well as being its own original thing. Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is a successful crime novelist with an extended family with whom he has a variety of issues. When he dies private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by an unknown person to solve the case of the apparent suicide. The plot thickens when it is revealed that Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Harlan's nurse and friend has received the entire inheritance in Harlan's will and is offered assistance by family misfit Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). Without going into too much detail the film is well written, clever and fun, managing to bring new twists and developments to an often done genre. Most everyone in the star studded cast gives an impressive performance, especially Craig. I recommend seeing it while it's still in theaters.",8,1,5,2 December 2019
The Great Dictator," Charlie Chaplin's first sound movie turns out to be his best.
","Charlie Chaplin makes blatant fun of Adolf Hitler by parodying his Nazi Regime and expressing how he personally felt about it. Chaplin included aspects of anti-Semitism, and Hitler's invasion of Austria. Chaplin stars as two characters. Adenoid Hynkel the dictator of Tomania and an unnamed Jewish barber. There are also parodies of Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goring in Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) and Herring (Billy Gilbert). It also satirizes Benito Mussolini with a character named Benzino Napolani (Jack Oakie). The things I love most about this movie are the situations between Hynkel and the people that work for him. Because to me there is nothing funnier than a powerful guy who is a complete idiot. It's even funnier when you look at the fact that it represents Hitler. Chaplin is replacing a formidable leader, with a pathetic dweeb in the same role. Hynkel steals the show in every scene he's in. In particular the scene with Hynkel and the globe and the scene where Hynkel is giving a speech in fake German. Go check this one out.",10,4,6,11 October 2014
Ed Wood," Ed Wood is celebrated, made fun of, applauded, and mocked,
","Ed Wood as we all now is one of the worst but best filmmakers of all time. Watch Plan 9 From Outer Space, or Bride of the Monster and you'll see what I'm talking about. Well this movie does it's best to celebrate Wood and mock him at the same time. It does this perfectly. We see Wood (Johnny Depp) interact with his friends who among others include Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) the tired old film actor now watching his life fall down. The film showcases the making of Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 From Outer Space. It shows the films being made, it shows the scripts being written, and it shows the interaction between Wood and Lugosi. Now while it shows the making of the film it shows the mistakes made by Wood, and it shows his incompetence. For example there's a scene where Wood is acting in Glen or Glenda, then they see a police car and run away because they don't have a permit. So yes it's funny, and it's even endearing at times. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in going into filmmaking.",9,0,0,21 December 2014
Zodiac," The Tora! Tora! Tora! of true crime films.
","The Zodiac killer operated in San Fransisco and Vallejo, California in the late 60s and early 70s. This movie is a portrayal of the press and police investigation with out three main characters being Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a political cartoonist who becomes a press detective to track down the Zodiac, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) a sarcastic crime journalist, and Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) a seasoned SFPD homicide detective. These are all real people and although I don't know if they were as connected to each other in real life as they are in this movie it makes the film more enjoyable. Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo are great, but Downey I think steals the show. His Bill Murray style portrayal of Avery is just brilliant. Other actors I can commend are Brian Cox who plays lawyer Melvin Belli and John Carroll Lynch who plays suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. I've always been interested in the Zodiac case and if you're interested too then check this movie out. You don't even have to be interested in the case either. You just have to enjoy a good mystery thriller.",9,2,3,13 September 2015
The Terminator," 'I'll Be Back.'
","The Terminator is very much a thinker's movie. The plot is that in the future there is a war between humanity and machines. The machines send back a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill a waitress named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the future leader of the human resistance John Connor. Humanity sends a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah from the terminator. But Kyle is only human and therefore not as powerful. It has good action scenes but it's also very much a thinker's movie. It brings up questions like 'Are we going to destroy ourselves?' and 'Will technology outgrow humanity?' It brings up these questions which I seem to think about to this day. The best part of the movie is the police station shootout, where Schwarzenegger says the famous line, 'I'll be back.' Go see it.",9,4,5,13 September 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The darkest dark comedy of them all.
","What is a dark comedy? I would describe it as a movie that deals with a dark subject and looks at it in such a humorous way. The Coen Brothers are known for this for their works like Raising Arizona, and Fargo. But my favorite dark comedy is this one. Stanley Kubrick takes the darkest idea imaginable and turns it into something hilarious. A paranoid USAF officer named General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launches a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union just for fun. Meanwhile in the war room President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) frantically tries to stop Ripper's attack. Also in the war room are the inane USAF chief of staff General Buck Turgidson and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also played by Sellers). Merkin is just trying to keep this whole thing under control but the first telephone conversations with the Russian Premier show that he really has no urgency yet. Turgidson is incredibly hyper and energy filled. Instead of viewing Ripper's attack as a horrible mistake and trying to fix it, he actually offers Merkin strategy on how to strike again. He was actually based on real life Air Force General Curtis Lemay and if you read as much Air Force history as I do, you'll know that Lemay was known for doing things like this. Dr. Strangelove actually get's very little screen time but when he's on screen he absolutely steals the show. This is one of the very few times where Kubrick left one of his actors to improvise because he pretty much knew what Sellers could do. All the actors do a fantastic job so if you like dark comedies (and by that I mean really dark) you have got to see this movie. It is amazing.",10,1,3,11 November 2014
Battleship Potemkin," A cinematic landmark.
","That, of course, is far from a fresh observation but it's true. Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin tells the real life story of the 1905 mutiny on the Potemkin in the Russo-Japanese War. When the crew of the Potemkin are fed borscht made from rotten meat most opt to eat bread and butter instead. When the officers of the ship hear of this, they become outraged and they believe the enlisted men of the ship to be spoiled. Chief Officer Ippolit Giliarovsky (Grigori Aleksandrov) orders the men the be executed. A revolutionary sailor named Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) inspires a mutiny and the oppressive officers are thrown overboard. The mutiny is successful but Vakulinchuk is killed by Giliarovsky. The sailors mourn their fallen hero and deliver him to the port at Odessa. When the Odessa residents learn of what has happened they protest but are brutally suppressed by the Tsarist guards. In response a revolution goes underway. The film is done very well and has since come to be regard as one of Russia's best films. Not to mention the commonly used soundtrack by Dmitri Shostakovich is brilliant and perfectly fitting. The film is most famous for the 'Odessa steps' sequence, so much so that the stairs on which the sequence was filmed has come to be known at the 'Potemkin stairs.' It is important to note that no such event took place at the Potemkin stairs but that doesn't make the sequence any less groundbreaking. It should also be said that the film is brutally violent, even by today's standards. Overall, Battleship Potemkin is highly recommended.",9,1,1,18 February 2017
Taxi Driver," 'One of these days a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets.'
","Taxi Driver is a movie that a lot of people have talked about and for good reason. It's a properly good film, working superbly as both a character study of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran with a plan to purge the wrongs in society, and as a testament to the rising crime rate and urban decay in New York in the '70s, the very same rising crime rate and urban decay that incenses Travis. Travis's journey is our plotline. At the film's onset he is seemingly unemployed and so, knowing the city well, goes and becomes a taxi driver. On a date with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) a pretty campaign worker with whom Travis is infatuated, she remarks that he is a 'walking contradiction.' And certainly this characterization is an apt one. When applying for the job Travis seems normal. A little awkward maybe, but nothing out of the ordinary. At least not too out of the ordinary. And his disaffection with high crime, prostitution, and garbage strewn about the city streets is one that many people can agree with. Even his goal of saving Iris Steensma (Jodie Foster) from her situation is a noble one. Martin Scorsese keeps the movie set in Travis's world view, a world view which never really changes. Travis's mental state and perception of reality don't so much change as they simply worsen. It's a very gradual shift so we hardly realize it's happening up until Travis makes a botched attempt to assasinate Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is volunteering. After that his massacre of a brothel, his final deluded attempt to clean up the city, is only natural. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and remedy that.",9,0,2,28 September 2019
Interstellar," It's good.
","Interstellar get's a lot of praise, but the demographic seems to be split. People either like or dislike it. Personally I like it, but not as other people who like it did. I don't know I just felt as though most of the characters weren't interesting enough and just seemed to be pawns for exposition. The plot is complicated in that Nolan way, but here it is. In the near future, Earth is starting to suffer due to a giant dust bowl. Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine) enlists ex-pilot Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to pilot a mission to find another planet. Unfortunately due to relativity of time, this causes Cooper to be away from his daughter Murphy Cooper (Jessica Chastain) for the majority of her life, even though the mission itself doesn't take that long. The story is very complicated and it can lose you if you're not paying attention, so if you liked Inception, you'll probably find this pretty interesting. The acting is good, but most of the characters, with the exception of Cooper and Murphy aren't very interesting. Actually half the time my favorite characters really end up being the robots which ironically seem more like people, than the actual people. However there is one thing this movie can not be denied. It's epic. It's shown on such a large scale that you have to get invested in what's going on, even if you don't understand it. Not to mention that soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is amazing. I'm actually listening to it as I'm writing this. If you like Nolan you'll probably like Interstellar.",8,0,1,23 January 2016
Forrest Gump," 'Run Forrest, Run!'
","This is the 3rd best movie I've seen. I love everything about this movie. The acting, the story, and how almost every big news event from the 1950s to the 1980s finds it's way in this film. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a kid from Alabama with a low IQ of 75 and with braces on his legs. He meets a girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) and they become good friends. Forrest starts to lead an extremely productive life. Despite his low IQ he is accepted into the University of Alabama and becomes part of the all American team. While there he witnesses George Wallace stand in the door, to keep African American students out. When he graduates he joins the US Army and serves in the Vietnam War. He befriends a fellow boot camp recruit, Private Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) who has a dream of going into the shrimping business and his platoon commander Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who regards it as his destiny to die in combat like his ancestors before him had all done. In one part the platoon is ambushed by the Viet Cong. All the men are wounded. Forrest takes all the wounded men and brings them to safety, including Lieutenant Dan. Bubba dies and Lieutenant Dan is angry with Forrest for not letting him die in combat. In the Army hospital Forrest takes a liking to Ping Pong and becomes the Ping Pong champion, and receives the Medal of Honor for saving everyone. In Washington DC he meets Jenny again who has lead a life that is the opposite of Forrest's. She moves from failure to failure as she becomes a hippie and takes drugs while Forrest goes to China to play Ping Pong for the US against the Chinese team. He meets Lieutenant Dan in New York, New York who has now fallen into depression and is still mad at Forrest for leaving him a cripple. Forrest retires from the Army and goes to become Captain of a shrimp boat like Bubba wanted to do. Lieutenant Dan later becomes his first-mate and they begin to own a very successful shrimping business. Forrest meets Jenny again and they spend more time together before she leaves again. Then Forrest for no reason at all decides to take a long run all over Alabama at first and then all over the country. He meets Jenny again who now has a son named Forrest Jr. (Haley Joel Osment) and shortly after wards Forrest and Jenny are married, and their wedding is attended by Lieutenant Dan. Later Jenny sadly dies. The film ends as Forrest is waiting for the school bus to come by and pick up Forrest Jr. on the same tree stump that Forrest's mother (Sally Field) had waited by on Forrest Sr.s first day of school. I highly consider this to be Tom Hanks's best role in any movie he's done. I certainly recommend this film to everyone.",10,4,6,9 June 2014
The Godfather: Part II," One of the greatest sequels ever made.
","The Godfather is a fantastic movie. It's one of the most celebrated in history and it has gone down in history as one of the best films ever made. And much of that can be repeated to be said in The Godfather Part 2. In this film it showcases Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the new don of the Corleone crime family. It also shows the early life of Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) Michael's father and the celebrated Godfather. Michael's story involves his rise to power . Vito's story involves his early start in the business after he is forced into the US from Italy as a child. The two stories are told in a parallel fashion. And both of them are what makes the film great. The two stories are helped by the great acting ability from Pacino and De Niro both. If you liked the first one watch this one. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you should still watch The Godfather Part 2 because it is a great movie in it's own right.",10,2,3,19 March 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," 'From now on you'll be known as Jason Bourne.'
","This movie greatly impresses me. It's not as good as The Bourne Identity but it's just about there. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still on the run in Russia. He eventually escapes only to find himself hunted by a new and more ruthless CIA deputy director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) who steal believes Jason is a threat. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is not convinced but reluctantly goes along with it. When Jason meets up with Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) she leaves the CIA to work with him. They are hunted by an assassin (Joey Ansah) but Jason kills him. After sending Nicky into hiding Jason goes to New York. The ending scene from The Bourne Supremacy is shown where Landy tells Jason that his real name is David Webb and he was born '4-15-71' in Nixa, Missouri, United States. Jason then tells her that she looks tired and should get some rest, indicating that he can see her. 4-15-71 is actually a code to the place where Jason was first brought into the Treadstone project. He talks to Dr. Albert Hirsch the mastermind behind it who tells Jason his back story and that he volunteered for the operation. Vosen and his men arrive to kill Jason but he escapes into the river after Vosen shoots at him. Landy exposes the operation, and Vosen, and Hirsch are arrested. Meanwhile Nicky is watching a news report of the exposure and seems pleasantly when she learns that Jason's body has not been found. This film is great for a number of reasons. I like for mainly the same reasons I liked the other Bourne films. In this one though we learn when Jason became a part of this program. This was never mentioned in the earlier films and Jason himself was unaware of it. It's a great movie but the only way it will really make sense is if you watch the other ones first. It's a spectacular finale to the trilogy.",9,0,0,4 October 2014
Fargo," Funny and Shocking at the same time.
","The jokes in this movie brilliantly contrast the dark murder scenes. It's a perfect portrayal of a kidnapping gone wrong. Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a struggling car salesman who pays two criminals Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristen Rudrud), and demand a ransom from her father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). But when Grimsrud kills a police officer and two witnesses to the crime an angry Showalter his demanding more money from Ludegaard and a higher ransom from Wade. To complicate things for Lundegaard even further, Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is closing in on his crime in a very Columbo style fashion. The movie is both a dark crime thriller and a funny Jerry and George style comedy. It's a great example of what the Coen brothers are great at.",9,0,0,13 September 2015
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Saigon has a smile.
","Good Morning Vietnam is a masterpiece. It's funny, but at the same time shows the war from the eyes of our protagonist Airman First Class Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams). Cronauer is a military DJ sent to tell jokes and report the news in Vietnam. But as soon as he starts his superiors Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (JT Walsh) are angered at Cronauer's unorthodox music and off-color jokes. But the movie's best parts are the scenes where Cronauer does his job as a DJ. It's really funny. This is one of Williams's best performances. The acting from everyone else is also really good. Good Morning Vietnam is really just a great classic Williams comedy.",9,3,4,26 November 2015
Burn After Reading," 'The Seinfeld of spy thrillers.' -Doug Walker
","When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his job as a CIA analyst, he decides to write a memoir about his career. His wife Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton) is looking to divorce Osborne, so she copies their bank records on a disc, along with meaningless rambling about the CIA by Osborne. When two gym employees Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) find the disc they mistake it for top secret government documents and decide to use it to blackmail Osborne. When that goes wrong they decide to sell the disc. That's basically the story. There's so much going on that it's easy to get lost, but it's incredibly funny and at the end you just find yourself wondering what happened. It's easy to compare this to The Big Lebowski, another Coen brothers film that pretty much seems to be about nothing. While I wouldn't say that this is as good as that film, Burn After Reading still has the feeling of comedic randomness that only the Coens can provide. Go check it out.",9,1,2,20 July 2016
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne trilogy is Born.
","This is the kind of action movie that always seems believable. Other action movies usually have some kind of weird gadget or an over the top over blown action sequence with some kind of scheme to blow up the moon or melt the polar ice caps. None of that is in this movie. The action scenes are good but they're believable. There aren't many strange or amazing gadgets in this movie. In fact there aren't any gadgets at all. This is the plot. A man (Matt Damon) is found by Italian fishermen riddled with bullets off the coast of Marseille, France. He is picked up and discovers that he is suffering from amnesia. He can't remember who he is or what he did. But he does know that he possesses a number of unusual skills. He travels to Zurich, Switzerland where he receives a number of passports all with his picture but with different names and nationalities. He takes the name Jason Bourne. Meanwhile in the United States CIA Director Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) is talking about a failed attempt to assassinate Nigerian dictator Nykwana Wombasi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and that Jason was responsible for it failing. They go to arrest him in Zurich. Meanwhile Jason goes to the state US Embassy in Zurich, but US Marines recognize him. The Marines attempt to arrest him but he escapes. He meets a woman named Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) that he offers $10,000 to if she drives him to Paris, France. She reluctantly accepts. Marie is suspicious of Jason for obvious reasons. Jason still does not know who he is and tells this to Marie. When they get to Paris, they visit Jason's assumed house. When they are there a CIA Agent breaks in and attempts to arrest Jason and Marie. They know realize that they are wanted. Under another identity John Michael Kane, Jason finds out documents about the night that an attempt on Wombasi's life was made. He finds out that an assassin was escaping off of Wombasi's boat when a secret serviceman shot him twice in the back. Afterwards Jason and Marie go to the French countryside and take refuge in Marie's friend Eamon's (Tim Dutton) house to stay away from the CIA. A CIA assassin (Clive Owen) attempts to kill Jason but he defeats him. He then tells Marie and Eamon to leave the house to stay away from any further danger. Jason confronts Conklin and another agent named Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who sent the assassin and Conklin tells Jason that he was the assassin whose mission it was to kill Wombasi, but he didn't because his children were in the room. Jason escapes and Conklin is killed by another agent. Jason meets up with Marie in Greece and the two are united.

","This movie is brutal, violent, and unsettling. That's what makes it so great. That said it certainly isn't for everyone. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an American frontiersman traveling with his convoy alongside his Native American son Hawk Glass (Forrest Goodluck). When Hugh is brutally mauled by a bear and barely able to stand, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleason) assigns Hawk, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) to look after him. But after Fitzgerald tries to kill Hugh, Hawk is killed by Fitzgerald, and Hugh is partially buried alive. The rest of the movie is mostly Hugh trying to get back home. As I've previously stated it's very brutal and in some parts, hard to watch. It's certainly not a movie for the faint hearted, because trust me it gets intense. But if you can watch through that, you'll be able to enjoy this for the suspense thriller it is. It's still in theaters so if you can withstand the violence, go check it out.",9,1,4,31 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," A fantastic effort by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.
","Bridge of Spies chronicles the mission of New York lawyer James B Donavan (Tom Hanks) to first, defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) a Russian spy, and then to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the Russians for Lieutenant Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) in exchange for Abel. The movie is a brilliant portrayal of the story and it really kept me interested the whole time. The movie was amazing. Hanks's performance was excellent, and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job with the film as well. Rylance is also good as Abel. The scenes with Donavan and Abel talking are some of the best bits of the film. By far this is the best film from 2015 I've seen (yet).",10,0,2,1 November 2015
American Psycho," 'This is not an exit.'
","In New York, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executive who is exceedingly vapid and vain, professes socially attractive beliefs that he doesn't believe in, generally dislikes his peers, is generally disliked by his peers, is regarded as lazy and a waste by those outside his social circle, dates an equally vapid and vain woman, and cheats on her with his peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) Patrick belongs to a subculture of wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executives, who are exceedingly vapid and vain, profess socially attractive beliefs that they don't believe in, generally dislike their peers, are generally disliked by their peers, are regarded as lazy and as wastes by those outside their social circle, date equally vapid and vain women, and cheat on them with their peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) They are all the same, so much so that they call each other by the wrong name. These wasters go to New York's finest clubs and restaurants every night, dabbling in expensive clothing, food, hair product, and cocaine. They discuss music and fashion advice. They waste away the hard earned fortunes of their parents without actually doing much work themselves. Nevertheless, they are all aware of one thing; they're better than you. Patrick however, is slightly different, and markets himself in a particular way. First of all he may be aware of how superficial and ridiculous this subculture is (though this does not change his participation in it.) And secondly, he may or may not be a serial killer. Perhaps desperate to find individuality in a world lacking it or perhaps severely ill, Patrick makes himself different from those around him by killing people. Anybody. Coworkers (especially if they make him insecure), the homeless, women off the street, security guards, anyone. Sometimes the motive is clear. Other times it's completely random. The movie and novel are told from his perspective so it's completely possible that he's imaging all of this and that it's not actually happening. The movie sometimes doesn't follow its own logic but this is all part of the appeal. I've heard people claim American Psycho to be a horror film. Certainly it has those kinds of elements but I'd call it more of a dark comedy. It has a dark, satirical comic edge to it. It's not for the faint of heart but generally speaking it's one to watch.",9,3,4,23 September 2019
North by Northwest," A precursor to the modern day action films.
","Alfred Hitchcock really shows his expertise in suspense with this thriller. But also his expertise in action too. Here's the plot. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising executive but is thought to be a government agent under the name George Kaplan. They force him to drink an entire bottle of alcohol and they put him an a moving Mercedes Benz so he is arrested for drunk driving. He goes back to New York but after pulling a knife out of a man that an assassin threw, the police think he is a terrorist. Roger goes on a quest with CIA agent Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and finds out that the FBI planted Kaplan as a decoy. But now that he's assumed the role, he's actually enlisted to become Kaplan. He ends up talking with the lead criminal Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) at an auction who has assassins all around. Roger makes a scene so no one can attack him without being seen, and then punches a man so the police take him away. He eventually meets up with Vandamm and Eve again. Eve shoots Roger in the Mount Rushmore caf√© to get away from him. She goes to Vandamm's country home but Roger saves her from being killed. At the end there's a spectacular chase scene on Mount Rushmore. It's one of the most famous movie scenes ever like the crop duster chase that happens earlier, in the film. I say go check this one out. But in my opinion it's not as good as Rear Window (1954).",10,0,2,17 June 2014
Hugo," A reminder of why I love movies in the first place.
","When I was 9 years old, I read The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. It was one of the major driving points that brought about my fascination with film. Although the movie was released in 2011 I didn't see it until much later. I have to say that Martin Scorsese was the perfect choice to direct this film owing to his own love of movie history. Hugo does not disappoint. With great acting all around, a faithful telling of the book, and a fantastic array of characters, Hugo is a terrific cinematic experience. Watching the story brought me back to days when I read the book, to when I made short movies with my friends, and to when I started my fixation on cinema. Not only a great movie but a reason why we love them.",10,4,7,9 February 2017
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Based on the top secret true story.
","'More of this is true than you would actually believe.' A title card tells us before the film starts. This story that you will never believe is actually based on anything in reality starts off with Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) a down on his luck reporter who goes to Iraq to get the latest scoop on the War on Terror. In doing so he meets Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) a former US Army soldier who was part of a top secret unit of the Army called the New Earth Army, which was a unit that used paranormal powers. As Lyn drives Bob to an Army outpost he tells his the history of the unit, with Lyn's friendship with his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). But because Lyn and Bob are in Iraq they run into Al Qaeda and a security detail that complicate their lives. Luckily Lyn's psychic abilities always get them out of a jam. Overall I thought this was a good comedy that always managed to put elements of humor in at the right moments. I also can't help but feel that the movie I really about friendship. Bob and Lyn's dialog together is funny, and Clooney gives a great comedic showing. The movie is also told in many flashback scenes with Lyn and Bill in the New Earth Army and the relationship that these two guys have is just great. It's not a perfect comedy but it's certainly not as bad as some people make it out to be.",8,2,3,11 March 2015

","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-convict just released from prison, whose first order of business is to get his buddy Robert 'Rusty' Ryan (Brad Pitt) and an assortment of other characters together to rob three Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). These characters are great and we love seeing them talk and rob. All the actors do a great job is animating the personalities of their respective characters. Danny is the charming mastermind, Rusty is the sarcastic right hand man, and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) is the innocent newcomer. It's a great caper flick and it's really hard not to like it. The whole film is a load of fun. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out.",8,1,2,23 January 2016
Tropic Thunder," 'What do you mean 'You People?''
","Tropic Thunder is full of all the satires of big Hollywood stereotypes. The action star, the method actor, and the comedian who relies on farts and nothing else. Staff Sergeant John 'Four Leaf' Tayback's (Nick Nolte) memoir 'Tropic Thunder' is being made into a movie. Action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), drug addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), and newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) are the stars of the film. Because the film is running on a tight schedule and risks being shut down by producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is forced to drop Tugg, Kirk, Jeff, Alpa, and Kevin in the middle of the Vietnamese jungle to shoot the movie guerrilla style. But strange things go on and eventually the actors are forced to act like real soldiers. Tropic Thunder is a load of fun. All the jokes are funny and it's so satisfying with a bunch of quotable moments. It's not a movie for everyone but for those are not easily offended, you will have a blast.",9,4,6,14 October 2015
Independence Day," No 12 Angry Men but it was a fun movie.
",This I remember thinking was a fun movie. It wasn't like it was trying to be Citizen Kane or anything like that it's just sort of a movie about gun happy aliens who blow crap up. It's like a more contemporary Plan 9 From Outer Space. I guess I can't really expect much logic in a movie where a TV repair man can find things that the government's top men can't find. Also in a movie where the president get's into a fighter plane to stop the aliens. Also in a movie where the ship can be destroyed by a drunk redneck pilot flying his jet into the gun. Also...never mind. If I point out all the plot holes then the review will be longer than War and Peace. But overall it's a fun movie. Go see it.,8,0,0,20 January 2014

","In 1980, welder Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunting antelope in Texas when he stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone wrong. Moss inspects the site and finds a fortune of cash lying beside a tree. Moss picks it up and soon he goes on the run from the drug dealers. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) has been hired to find the money and sets out on a ruthless search claiming dozens of lives as he looks for Moss. Soon the trail of violence get's so big that not even the police can contain it. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments on the violence and is nearing retirement. I'm a big fan of the Coen Brothers, and in my opinion this is the best film they've done. I'm also a big fan of the novel by Cormac McCarthy that this movie was based on. This is an excellent adaptation of an amazing book, by two amazing filmmakers. The acting is likewise commendable. Jones is great as Ed Tom, and Bardem is perfect as the ruthless and remorseless Chigurh. Everything about this movie is great. An excellent portrayal of McCarthy's novel.",10,1,1,27 July 2016

Bruce goes home to Gotham City where it is ridden by crime and corruption. Bruce trains with his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and becomes the Batman to save Gotham from Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) a doctor at Arkham Asylum becoming the scarecrow and various corruption. The acting is great from Bale especially. I also have to commend Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Caine as Alfred. If you haven't seen this film, you should really do so.",9,1,2,26 March 2015
Saving Private Ryan," Gripping World War 2 movie.
","Saving Private Ryan is a heart pounding drama that shows World War 2 very realistically. The battle scenes, while horrific, are done to perfection. It shows us the horrors of war from the POV of our main character Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) and the platoon he commands. Captain Miller's platoon has landed on Normandy beach, and has now been assigned to a rescue mission. To locate and save Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) a US paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action. As the group goes through France to find one man, they ask themselves why one man should be as important as the eight looking for him. As I've already stated the battle scenes are amazing. The acting also is top notch. It's really an incredible movie. The last 27 minutes is just gripping. It's impossible to ignore.",10,2,4,13 December 2015
1941," By no means a perfect film, but it's a real wild ride.
","After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor paranoia swept across the nation as the United States was swept into World War 2. One of the most prominent areas of paranoia following December 7th was the West Coast, in particular California cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nothing like the films events occurred in real life, but at the time it was a real concern. The plot of 1941 is in the context of this paranoia. While the film isn't great (especially by Steven Spielberg standards), to say the film is boring would be false. One of the best things about the movie is the characters. There are a few throw away characters but those played by Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Toshiro Mifune, Christopher Lee, Ned Beatty, John Candy, Warren Oates, and Slim Pickens are a lot of fun to watch, even if some of them aren't in the movie very long. There's also a bunch of great gags. But the flaws are pretty prevalent as well. As funny as some of the jokes are, there's also other ones that are just painful or awkward. In conclusion, the film is relatively enjoyable but the flaws can leave you imagining how it could have been a better movie. I do recommend it as it is very entertaining, but the flaws exist.",7,0,1,14 July 2017
Cars," A world of Cars? Why not?
","I remember still when this movie came out. I was 6 years old. I'm now 14 and I still love it. I'm very interested in cars and I always have been. When I was 6 too. So this movie seemed perfect to me. I love the animation, the characters but most of all the plot. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a hotshot race car in a world completely dominated by automobiles. On his way to his next big race he is dropped from his trailer and stumbles across Radiator Springs, a small town in the middle of the desert. He meets a tow truck named Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) a Porsche 911 named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) and the town judge a Hudson Hornet named Dr. Hudson (Paul Newman) who takes an immediate disliking to him. Lighting and Mater soon bond after a while, and Lighting makes friends among the rest of the towns people but Doc Hudson never gets used to him. It turns out that Doc also used to be a race car but was rejected after a crash. Eventually he can't stand Lightning anymore so he calls the racing company to take him away. But at his next big race he meets the townsfolk who are now his pit crew and Doc finally get's used to him. I have to say I always enjoy this movie. Ever since I saw it I loved it.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Expect something more like The Big Lebowski than Pulp Fiction.
","While it still did generally feel like a Quentin Tarantino movie it wasn't really what I was expecting. At first I felt somewhat underwhelmed by that. It was more slow moving than I was used to with Tarantino and I kept wondering when this fantastic movie everyone was talking about would show up. And with the exception of the fight scene at the end, it never really did. But an hour after leaving the theater I looked back on it again and I realized that maybe this is just a different kind of movie. It's still Tarantino and there are still plenty of callbacks to film history like spaghetti westerns, macaroni combats and Bruce Lee martial arts flicks. No surprise with it being set in Hollywood, of course. But it wasn't overly stylized and was more subtle than usual for Tarantino. In 2016 the Coen brothers released Hail Ceaser which followed one day out of Hollywood life in the '50s. And that's essentially what this film does, only with the '60s. The film basically follows three plot lines and it's a series of segments. Again, something more like The Big Lebowski or Caddyshack or Napoleon Dynamite or the aforementioned Hail Ceaser. So you could say that I liked it more as I thought about it more.",8,12,30,1 August 2019
Frozen," Okay.
","Frozen(2013) is one of those films that get's so much praise but personally I think it's just overrated. It's okay it's not great but it's not bad either. My sister loves it. I don't. It certainly had some good moments in it and it was funny in a few scenes. The animation was amazing. But the story didn't do much for me. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a 14 year old male. This kind of thing just doesn't appeal to me. But let's look at the story anyway. Anna and Elsa are 2 little princesses. One night they're playing when Elsa accidentally hits Anna with her freeze ray abilities and knocks her unconscious. Her parents take her to some trolls who rescue Anna but tell them she can't see her sister anymore. This leads to one of the music elements. And in this musical element we learn that their parents died in a ship wreak. Yeah, I guess this was supposed to be sad but I can't sympathize with characters who had maybe 5 lines. And it doesn't really focus much on the deaths after this scene either. But anyway so coronation day comes and Anna meets a prince named Hans. I swear I will never hear that name again without first thinking about the killer from M (1931). But anyway he's a nice guy. And guess what? Anna shares maybe 7 lines with him and she knows that he's the one. Literally, they say that. But anyway Elsa accidentally reveals her powers and traps the kingdom in an eternal winter, while she runs away to the mountains where she plans too live the rest of her life in exile. Anna meanwhile goes to find her sister with the help of ice salesman Kristoff. By the way I can't think that Ice is a very big market. Along the way they're joined by our comic relief a snowman named Olaf. They try to reconcile with Elsa but to no avail. Oh and remember Hans from earlier. The film suddenly decided he's a villain now. There were never any clues to figure that out so I'm guessing that M Night Shyamalan was working on that part. And the rest of the movie is all stock. Elsa realizes her mistake. She tries to fix it. Hans get's defeated and they all live happily ever after. Until the next inevitable sequel. Overall the film wasn't awful but neither was it awesome. It was just okay. That's really the only reaction I can think of after viewing this film. But a lot of girls liked and that's easy to see because I'm not a girl. So if you are, then you'll probably like it. I do have to give it credit though because this is one of the few times in a Disney film where the queen is a good guy. When is the last time you ever saw a film where the queen was good? Other than Brave (2012)I don't recall any. So all in all I thought it was OK but that's just me.",7,3,5,2 February 2014
The Incredibles," 'No capes!'
","The Incredibles is a good well though out film. Being this is the first Pixar movie with human beings as the main characters they did really well on the animation. This is the story. In the early 1960s (probably) in a city in the United States we see Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) as a superhero who is treated as a regular celebrity. Bob's superpower is that he has super strong abilities. There are a bunch of other super heroes including Helen Parr (Holly Hunter) his fianc√©e who can morph into anything, and Lucius Best (Samuel L Jackson) who can freeze anything. Everything is going fine until Bob is sued and eventually all super heroes are forced into a normal life. Fast forward to 15 years later where we see Bob living his normal life with Helen and their kids Dash (Spencer Fox) and Violet (Sarah Vowell). Bob is a bored insurance claims investor and constantly angers his boss. He looks for excitement and is recruited by a former fan of Bob's named Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who is secretly planning to eliminate him. The rest I won't explain. The story is really good and the animation is really good. This is the first Pixar feature film with humans as the main characters. When you look at their old short films like Tin Toy you see that Pixar never really had much success with animating humans. But when they made this, the animation was great and they got it spot on. It's a really good movie and I definitely recommend it.",9,0,0,15 November 2014
Ghostbusters," Fantastic!
","This is one of my favorite movies. Three college professors who study paranormal happenings get fired from the University. They decide to start their own business catching ghosts. They go from a joke to New York heroes. It's also an incredibly funny movie. Bill Murray plays a sarcastic, and humorous scientist called Dr. Peter Venkman. Dan Akroyd plays Dr. Ray Stanz, he acts like a little kid but he's an incredibly technical speaker. Harold Ramis plays Dr. Egon Spengler. Egon is the human encyclopedia of the group. Later in the film they are joined by Winston Zeddemorre played by Ernie Hudson, he's the cool one. As funny as it is, I would not recommend it to kids who are easily scared. Otherwise go see it.",10,2,3,23 November 2013
The Longest Day," An Epic history lesson.
","I love US History. Especially World War 2. And this is a really good retelling of the D-Day invasion. It represents the Allied and Axis points of view of the battle. This same kind of thing would later be done in the studio's later film Tora! Tora! Tora! They got tons of big names in here too. John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, the big people in 1962. If you know anything about World War 2 you'll probably know the premise. The epic D-Day invasion of Nazi-Occupied Normandy, France on June 6,1944 by US and British forces, commanded by General Dwight D Eisenhower. The film does a fantastic job of showing us everything on all scales and on every setting of D-Day. That's probably why it's almost 3 hours long. The massive battle scenes are fantastic, the acting is good, and it's an overall fantastic representation of D-Day. As I said before, it's a long movie but if you get some extra time on your hands, give it a watch.",10,3,6,2 February 2015
Back to the Future Part III," It's all right.
","I'm a huge fan of the Back to the Future series. In particular, the first two. Back to the Future Part 3 isn't bad, but it's true it's not anywhere near as good as the first. In true Back to the Future Fashion, it starts just as the last left off. In 1955, after preventing a time-line where Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) becomes a corrupt casino owner, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox), witnesses his friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) get struck by lightning in the DeLorean DMC time machine, and sent back to 1885. After re-meeting 1955 Emmett (who had just helped the Marty of the first film get back to 1985), Marty goes to 1885, to bring home Emmett and prevent him from being killed by Biff's great grandfather Buford Tannen (Wilson). It's not as good as the first two, because it's not as funny or endearing as those ones. It is kind of a basic story. There's still a lot going on, just not enough to make Part 3 as interesting. But overall, it's still a good movie, and the ending scene really wraps up the trilogy nicely. If you're a fan (and you haven't already seen this movie) go check it out.",8,1,1,25 April 2016
Patton," My favorite General's biopic.
","General George Patton was one of the greatest generals of Word War 2 and the United States Army. Although certainly not conventional, his exploits are legendary, and his efforts made him a headache for Americans and Germans alike. George C Scott plays Patton perfectly and it's no wonder that he won an Oscar for this performance. This follows Patton's exploits as commander of the US 3rd Army in World War 2. From Tunisia to Germany the film shows us Patton's rises and challenges. It also shows his relationship with his good friend General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden). Scott and Malden's performances really shine through as they both do a great job. Patton is an epic adventure where we follow one of the most respected and controversial figures on the history of the US Army. Patton is one of my favorite movies of all time and will be for time to come.",10,1,2,3 January 2015
Men in Black II," It's kind of a let down.
","Men in Black was great. It's humor was incredibly clever and it was really fun. The second one on the other hand just kind of failed to deliver. It wasn't horrible or anything, it was just kind of a disappointing sequel. Luckily 10 years later Men in Black 3 redeemed the series, and all was forgiven. Men in Black 2 still had clever jokes, they just weren't as common as the first. Well let's look at the plot. A Kylothian named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) has come to Earth to look for the Light of Zartha and stir up trouble. Agent J (Will Smith) needs help to stop Serleena, due to his habit of memory erasing his partners when they don't meet his standards. The only man capable of J's partnership is the now retired Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). J has to go find K, restore his memory, and stop Serleena. This story should have been more humorous than it was. And don't get me wrong, it had funny moments, many of which were cleverly done. But the first film does it better than this one. If you're curious to see a follow up, then check it out. But if you want a clever comedy, the first and third films just do it better.",6,1,1,30 January 2016
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful.' -Edward R Murrow
","Good Night, and Good Luck starts off with Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) telling a group of people about the career of Edward R Murrow (David Strathairn). Shortly after this Murrow comes up and tells these people about the importance of television in educating and informing the public of major economic of political events. The film then goes back to 1954 when Murrow and his friend and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and the rest of his news team sough to bring down Joseph McCarthy and his communist witch hunt. I love this film for a number of reasons. I love Murrow and I think that Strathairn does an excellent job in the role. He looks and sounds very much like Murrow. The film is shot in black and white and it just looks beautiful. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is fantastic. I give it an A+ there. I also commend this film for it's great and dramatic showcase of Murrow's famous political attacks on McCarthy. Strathairn recounts several lines used by Murrow on his program and he just does a stellar job with it. Whenever Strathairn speaks in a scene where he recites Murrow you're just drawn in to his words. And this once again is due to the may the film is shot. Clooney did a great job here with his second directorial effort. At the end scene when Friendly walks up to Murrow and tells him that McCarthy is to be censured by the US Senate it's not a moment when you get up and cheer. It's a moment where you are just left with a satisfying feeling as is Murrow. I highly recommend it. Good Night, and Good Luck.",9,0,0,15 June 2015
Mulholland Drive," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
","David Lynch has an interesting relationship with Hollywood, to say the least. Its clear that he has the utmost respect for classic Hollywood but holds little of this reverence for the Hollywood of today. Its no surprise, therefore, that one of his favorite movies of all time in Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece Sunset Boulevard (both this film and that one are, of course, named after roads in Los Angeles.) Betty Elms (Noami Watts) is an aspiring actress who moves to Los Angeles to become a movie star. A basic story so far, though Betty has more than one leg up over the actresses, nannies, clerks, and other girls in the same city with the same dream. Her aunt Ruth (Maya Bond) has more than one amenity for her use, including her old Spanish villa style apartment. Things get serious though when an unnamed dark haired sole survivor of a car accident (Laura Harring) arrives in Betty's new apartment, completely unaware of who she is. Suffering from amnesia, she takes to calling herself Rita after looking at a poster of Rita Hayworth's Gilda (1946) on the wall of the kitchen. The two search for who she really is, eventually with Rita suddenly spitting out the name 'Diane Selwyn' as a possible clue. Concurrently Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is a film director whose latest production has recently been taken over the (I assume) Mafia who pressure him into casting Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) in the lead role, despite his reluctance. Frustrated by this hostile takeover his production, he takes his anger out on their limousine before driving home to the Stahl house to discover that his wife is having an affair. Taking his anger out on both of them he returns to downtown Los Angeles and stays in what is possibly the sketchiest hotel I've ever seen before being told that his credit card has been canceled. By the second half of the film everything is revealed to be either a dream or an extremely distorted memory had by the real Diane Selwyn (Watts), the real version of who Betty is. Depressed and washed up, Diane is clearly a failed actress, a possible conclusion for Betty. Rita is revealed to be the real Camilla Rhodes, once a partner of Diane who has now largely discarded her for opulence and fame in the Home of the Movies. The film's genius juxtaposing of the good and bad of Hollywood really comes out into play in the two main episodes. The first is clearly a homage to the classic image and the second is what it is/was like in the early 2000s. For example we get glimpses of Betty's aunt's Spanish villa apartment (which are particularly numerous in that part of the town) as well as the apartment complex inhabited by the real Diane proves to show us the point. Mulholland Drive, much like its spiritual predecessor Sunset Boulevard, is the perfect image of Hollywood, for all of its ups and downs.",9,3,4,10 June 2019
Brave," I thought it was good.
","I was looking through some of the other reviews for this movie and for the most part, they all seemed to be pretty negative. I'm not really sure why. I thought it was good. Granted it wasn't Pixar's best film, and lot's of elements of it seemed to be a repeat of the past but overall, I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed it and so did my family. In the middle ages of Scotland Merida (Kelly MacDonald) is a willful young princess who has to get married as a rite of passage. Instead she decides to go against the wishes of her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) and inadvertently turns her into a bear. well this comes as a problem because King Fergus (Billy Connolly) Merida's father is known as the bear king because a bear once had a fight with him. The rest is all typical Disney. Overall even though lots of parts of the story were overused, I still found it enjoyable. I recommend it over some other alternatives.",8,1,3,22 March 2015

","When I saw the trailer for this film I thought it was going to focus on all the drama of Alan Turing's (Benedict Cumberbatch) discoveries of the infamous Enigma machine. But it actually focused on Turing himself which I did not expect. It focused on Turing's interactions with his team, his relationship with Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightly), and the constant blunders that his superiors give him. But more than all this, it focuses his homosexuality, and basically the intolerance thereof. The film works in every way showing all of this as well as Alan's dedication to the machine which ultimately lead to breaking the German codes. The acting here (especially from Cumberbatch and Knightly) is all great. It's really an incredible narrative so if you haven't seen it yet, you should.",9,4,12,9 January 2015
Caddyshack," 'It looks good on you though.'
","This is a funny movie. The plot is that a caddy at a golf course named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a doing just about anything to raise money to go to college. While Danny is trying to get a caddy scholarship from the owner Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), Smails has to deal with a brash new member of the course Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). When a character is played by Dangerfield it's pretty much what you would expect. Al is eccentric, and a loudmouth. He's always annoying Smails with his over the top machines, weather it be his Rolls-Royce, his boat, or even his golf bag. Anyway while all that is going on, there's a subplot about Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) the assistant greens keeper who is told to kill every gopher on the field. Carl is a lovable idiot and goes way overboard and uses sniper rifles, and plastic explosives to kill one gopher, who ends up surviving. Along the way are two golf games, hilarious one liners from Dangerfield and brilliant comedy from Knight and Murray. It was the first film of Harold Ramis who does a really great job. I certainly recommend it if you like great comedy.",9,1,4,15 November 2014
A Bug's Life," The Second of Pixar's Efforts.
","A Bug's Life, I think was the second feature film that Pixar made. It is good, but I feel it's probably one of their lesser efforts. The story is about a group of ants, who every year have to serve their grasshopper overlords a supply of food. When an inept bug named Flik (Dave Foley) inadvertently destroys the entire supply. The head grasshopper Hopper (Kevin Spacey) promises to come back and destroy them so Flik is sent to go find 'warriors'. He finds them but they turn out to be circus performers. The acting is good for the most part and the story is good. So it is a good movie I just don't feel as though it's one of Pixar's best. But all in all, everything is good.",8,0,0,5 December 2014
The Dark Knight," Excellence that surpasses the last film.
","Rarely is a sequel able to be as good as the first one, let alone surpass it. The Dark Knight is one of those rare occasions. It starts of with a bank heist which quickly turns into a dark game of betrayal as those participating in it get shot by each other. Until only one remains who gets the introduction as the scariest Batman villain in the trilogy, the Joker (Heath Ledger). With a great story, great acting, and some great and intense action scenes, The Dark Knight is just as good (if not better than the first one. The acting is still great from Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and pretty much everyone, especially Ledger. Go see this film if you haven't.",10,0,1,26 March 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," A very thought provoking film.
","2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a film that really makes you think. It raises questions like 'Are we giving machines too much information?' 'Is technology going at a rate where human beings will be replaced by machines?' 'What was up with the last 20 minutes?' Well, Stanley Kubrick was very good at making you think about these things. His ability to draw you into the suspense is shown here. His artistic ability is shown here. His message is shown here. And his ability to end a movie without any of the questions shown above is shown here. It's sort of like an experience movie, especially during the end. So here's the plot. A space mission showcases the work of Dr. Frank Poole, and Dr. Dave Bowman. They are helped by the computer HAL 9000. HAL eventually realizes that Dave and Frank are planning too disconnect him so he eliminates Frank but not Dave. Dave saves himself from being killed by disconnecting HAL. It's sort of like a film in 4 parts. Part 1 is the part with the apes. Part 2 is the part with the moon mission. Part 3 is the part with Dave, Frank, and HAL. Part 4 is the part with the portal. I highly recommend this film. It's definitely one of Kubrick's best.",10,1,4,2 February 2014
Toy Story," Pixar's first feature.
","The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.",10,4,5,15 January 2015
Men in Black," 'We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we are aware of.'
",Men in Black is a really funny movie. The plot is about two agents in a top secret government agency named the Men In Black which is so top secret that not even the government knows it exists. It focuses on two agents in this agency and their efforts to bring down an intergalactic terrorist named Edgar the Bug (Vincent D'Nofrio). The Agents are Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) a fast talking serious man who is not at all phased by the fact that he deals with aliens everyday. The other character agent is Police Officer James Edwards (Will Smith) who later becomes Agent J when he joins the Men in Black. The conversation between Agent K and Agent J is hilarious and really keeps the movie going strong with the laughs. Edgar is also a particular source of amusement. Overall the movie is very good so if you like either science fiction or comedies you'll like this.,9,1,2,13 February 2015
Avatar," Many people love this movie. It just didn't do anything for me.
","I still remember when this movie came out, everyone was talking about it. It was one of the highest grossing films of all time. The graphics blew everyone's mind. Yeah, it just didn't really do anything for me. I agree, the graphics are stunning. If you want to get sucked into this world with the CGI and the animation of all the animals, go see this movie because you will be pleased. But the reason this didn't really work for me is the story. It's a story that's been seen a million times before. Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas did this story, and it was old back then. I know a lot of people really liked this movie for it's graphics, but personally I have to be engrossed in the story to be engrossed in the movie. I also think that the villains were weakly developed. They're just the generic bad buys. So personally I'm not a fan, but that doesn't mean you won't be.",5,4,7,31 December 2015
Chariots of Fire," An engrossing and entertaining film.
","This is a great depiction of a true story of Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) two British track athletes competing in the 1924 Olympic games. Harold is Jewish and Eric is Christian. As the film goes on we see Harold and Eric win their respective races as they become closer friends. Win they are put into a race together we see that the have a sense of competition towards one another but they soon realize how close they are. The film focuses on these two people mostly and their lives behind them. Eric is a soon to be missionary who is running the race because he wants to please God, and Harold is running to overcome anti-Semitism. It's a very good depiction and the acting is also quite good. I like it a lot mostly because I run cross country for my high school. I recommend it and give it 8 stars out of 10.",8,1,1,20 October 2014
Where Eagles Dare," An incredible adventure that keeps you enthralled all the way.
","Whoever thought that teaming up Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton, putting them in a World War 2 movie about a top secret mission where they go undercover as German offices was a genius. Because that summary is what this movie is all about and it's incredible. The story is that two allied soldiers, Royal Army Major John Smith (Burton) and US Army Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Eastwood) are dispatched to save a US officer named General George Carnaby (Robert Beatty). But this is only what we think is going on. As the film progresses we learn the real mission is something much different. The reason this film works is how it follows Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer on their mission. The best part in the movie is the incredible getaway scene, when the Germans realize who Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer are and they make an incredible and daring escape. It's fun, suspenseful, and action packed. So if you like action packed and exciting entertainment, don't miss this one.",10,1,5,5 December 2014
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's sarcasm vs. Punxsutawney Phil
","By the time this review is published it will be the real groundhog day. By that time of course we will know whether or not Phil saw his shadow. But anyways on to this film which I am reviewing in honor of the occasion. Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a weatherman who along with co-workers Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and Larry the camera man (Chris Elliot) are sent to cover the weather report in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States for Groundhog day. Phil is most displeased but swallows his pride and goes through with it. After having a less than perfect February 2, he goes to sleep and wakes up on the exact same day. Over and over Phil finds himself in February 2,1993 with the exact same events occurring and he's the only one that knows about it. With this he starts to act out which includes expressing how he really feels about the entire celebration. It's a very funny movie with Murray's trademark sarcasm but it also can help you relate to some real life problems. Everyone feels like Phil sometimes. We are all forced to do things we don't really want to for work and that's exactly what we see here. I can definitely recommend Groundhog Day.",9,0,1,1 February 2015
National Treasure," It's not serious but it's fun.
","This is a film that doesn't try to be serious. It's just having fun. And I absolutely love it. Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is a treasure hunter who is looking for the Templar treasure, which is the biggest treasure in the world. It was hidden by the founding fathers during the American Revolution to keep it from the British. He is working along with Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who is funding the expedition. While searching in the Artic they come across a ship named the Charlotte, which they believe has the treasure. They search for it and Ben finds an old pipe with a message on the scroll, which leads to the to conclusion that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. When Howe proposes the idea of stealing the Declaration, Ben turns him down. As a result Howe leaves Ben and his friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) behind. Ben and Riley go to Washington DC to alert the FBI but they are dismissed. They then go to Doctor Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) to alert her. They are dismissed again so Ben decides to steal the Declaration to keep it from Howe and to find the treasure. He succeeds and along the way Abigail and Ben's father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) get tagged along as well. Ben, Abigail, Riley, and Patrick eventually find the treasure, and Howe and his men are arrested for attempted murder and kidnapping. This isn't a really serious toned film, but it's just a lot of fun so if you get the chance give it a watch.",9,2,3,30 August 2014
Pulp Fiction," A clever narrative structure paired with unforgettable dialog and incredible acting make Pulp Fiction a force to be reckoned with.
","We start off Pulp Fiction seeing Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) discussing different ways that people have robbed banks and what to rob next over a meal. Shortly after wards the two stick up the caf√© in which they are eating. Then the opening title screen appears. The first scene illustrates perfectly the tone of the movie. Interesting dialog followed by big moments. Sometimes the dialog isn't even about what happens in the next big part. There's a scene that follows the one I just talked about where hit men Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are on their way to retrieve a briefcase from four kids who stole it from Jules and Vincent's boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). There having one conversation in the car, followed by another conversation in the apartment building, followed by another conversation in the apartment building, followed by a conversation with one of the kids in the apartment itself, then we see the action. That's what makes this movie so great. The conversations followed by big moments. It also has a clever narrative structure and if you're not paying attention you could get lost because it doesn't follow time. If you haven't seen this movie yet then do it. It's worth all the effort.",10,0,2,22 August 2015
"McFarland, USA"," I thought it was really good.

When that doesn't work he decides to start a cross country team at McFarland. Jim soon bonds with his Mexican American runners who work all day long as pickers in the field. Jim brings running to help lift his runners out of poverty and provides for them a haven. I'm a cross country runner myself, so when I saw this movie, I thought to myself 'Yes, finally a movie about cross country.' But you don't have to be a runner to enjoy this movie. You just have to enjoy good films. Costner does a great job and the movie was really well done. Go check it out.",9,4,18,26 March 2015
The Matrix Reloaded," More annoying and pretentious than the first.
","Even though I like the original Matrix, some of the dialog is pretentious and some of the other parts are pretty dated. That said I didn't let that ruin the movie for me, and I still thought it was fun and I liked the philosophy. This movie however takes the things I didn't like about the first, and reload them (forgive the pun). The action scenes are still good but the philosophical talks are as pretentious and annoying as ever. Some of them don't even make any sense. And the scene where Thomas Anderson/Neo (Keanu Reeves) talks with the architect (Helmut Bakaitis) is just as boring and nonsensical as everyone makes it out to be. But the action scenes are still good, my favorite being when Neo fights the clones of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). But the if pretentious exposition will ruin the film for you, you won't like it, because there's a lot of that in here.",5,1,3,31 December 2015
There Will Be Blood," Well, there was blood so the movie delivered.
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a man of competition, greed, family, and of course oil. Daniel starts off as an ordinary prospector and ends up a millionaire. This movie shows his greedy evolution as he buys land uses it and becomes more and more greedy, while at the same time becoming more and more wealthy. The end of this movie was particularly powerful. I won't spoil it but wow. This really had me thinking for a long time. All the other actors of course do great and make the movie what it is, but by far the biggest thing about the movie is Daniel. It's his movie, and he's in almost every scene. It shows his evolution as well as the evolution of those around him. Not to mention Day-Lewis gives a monumental performance in this movie. The movie also contains lot's of long moments without dialog and work to put the atmosphere of the movie together. The movie is epic. It's an amazing narrative into the rise of a 1910s oil man.",10,0,1,6 September 2015
Joker," Brilliant as both a comic book movie and a stand-alone movie.
","I've never seen a movie (with the possible exception of The Force Awakens and The Incredibles 2) to be as hyped as this with both good and bad things emanating from that. Ever since the first trailer came out in April, I've been waiting to see it. I knew that this wouldn't be like any other comic book movie I'd seen up to that point (I've yet to see Logan and Watchmen). And indeed, from the trailers it looked like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which also star Robert De Niro. Even still, Joker perfectly encapsulates everything about the character. The Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate. The movie gives a believable and more than fitting backstory for the Joker. If not than you could look at it as the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just an unfortunate and deluded man with aspirations of being a comedian who endured one too many kicks in the teeth. It is a comic book movie but more dark and gritty than any I've ever seen, including The Dark Knight. I often don't like the way that DC assumes that since the Dark Knight trilogy the only path to success is by way of the dark route, without actually taking the time to do it right. Joker does it right. And with an R rating it's not for kids.",10,5,10,6 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of the all time greats.
",To Kill a Mocking Bird is one of the all time greatest books and films of all time. It's the timeless story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) a lawyer in the Great Depression in Alabama and his relationship with his children Jean 'Scout' Finch (Mary Badham) and Jem Finch (Phillip Alford) and his devotion in defending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) an African American man accused of rape. The book is one of the most critically acclaimed works of literature ever and it was brought to the screen with great success. Atticus is one of my favorite characters of all time. He's a hero who strives to serve justice to an unrepresented minority. And the scenes where he talks to his kids about different things are great too. The best scene of all though is the courtroom scene. I highly recommend To Kill a Mocking Bird in literary or cinematic form.,10,0,1,20 February 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of the greatest prison films ever made!
","This film is nothing short of one of the greatest pieces of cinematic genius I have ever seen. It shows two sides of many things. Take for example Colonel Nicholson. Colonel Nicholson is a savior to his fellow British soldiers, yet he can also be viewed as a traitor. Commander Shears who was a former prisoner at the camp, and later leads the attack on the bridge, was impersonating an officer. A court martial offense. But he also led the United States and the United Kingdom to victory by blowing up the bridge. Colonel Saito, who was the commandant of the prison camp, was a sadist and was a monster. But he was willing to make necessary compromises with Colonel Nicholson on the construction of the bridge. Anyway let's look at the plot. A new group of Royal Army soldiers have been captured by the Imperial Japanese Army and have been placed in a Japanese prison camp. In other words hell. Anyway the commandant Colonel Saito, and the commanding officer of the prisoners Colonel Nicholson, don't agree with each other. Saito wants all prisoners, including officers to work on a bridge that will connect from the island the camp is on to another island I think. But as this is against the Geneva Convention, Colonel Nicholson won't allow it. Saito retaliates by putting the British officers in confinement. And putting Colonel Nicholson in the oven. Meanwhile US sailor Commander Shears, who was already a prisoner at the camp escapes. When he makes it back to an allied base they give him a mission to blow up the bridge that the prisoners are working on. Colonel Nicholson eventually agrees to Saito's commands and officers work on the bridge as well. It end in a spectacular battle against the allied special forces, and the allied prisoners who seem to have forgotten their allegiance. I highly recommend this movie.",10,0,1,20 April 2014
Whiplash," Amazing beyond an extent.
",Whiplash is a simple idea stretched out to become an epic character study. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a jazz student at Schaffer Music School who meets teacher Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) an abusive tyrant known for his terrifying methods of conducting. As Andrew tries harder and harder to please Fletcher he closes off everything else that mattered to him and turns his desire to be the greatest into an obsession. It's an exhilarating story that doesn't let up from beginning to it's incredible final act. The acting from Simmons is great and it's really no wonder that he was given an Oscar for his role as Fletcher. Teller is also great as Andrew and we really see his change through the movie. Whiplash is epic.,10,1,2,22 November 2015
It Chapter Two," It's complicated.
","I liked the Losers as kids better than them as adults when I read the book, so I figured that I would already like the first film better than this one. It also might be important to point out that I was not aware of how long the movie was before I walked in. But even still, this wasn't as good as I expected it would be. It had legitimate scares and the acting is pretty good for the most part, especially Bill Hader as Richie Tozier. But the film went on for too long, it relied too heavily on cliches, it took itself too seriously when it was discussing the lore, it makes half an effort to follow certain things from the book (as in it will show something from the book but not follow through with it entirely), and generally I viewed it as unfocused. Were there still things to enjoy? Yes. Just not enough to fully recommend it.",5,3,6,7 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," What is Hail Caesar?
","Well this is the best way to put it. It's part satire, part western, part drama, part film noir, part epic...and all comedy! It's so random in the scenes that it cuts to, so if you're someone who get's thrown off easily, you won't like this movie. But it's great in the way that the other Coen brothers films were great. You have no idea what's going to happen next. The film doesn't have so much a plot, but an array of subplots, that all surround our main character. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer in Hollywood who has to deal with the fact that major actor Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped by a group of communist writers known only as 'the future.' And at the same time he has to keep it a secret from reporters Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton). But that's not all. He also has to find the father for actress DeeAnna Moran's (Scarlett Johansson) baby, find a new movie and arrange the premiere for actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), decide whether or not to take up a job offer for Lockheed, and investigate communist actor Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum). There's so much going on it'll make your head explode. And you'll be laughing all the way. Joel and Ethan have really done a good job on this one. Even though most of the actors are in only one or two scenes, they all do a good job. Frances McDormand for instance is in one scene only. But she absolutely kills it. This is destined to became a classic.",9,3,8,7 February 2016
Jaws," The first shark movie. I think at least.
","This movie directed by my favorite director Steven Spielberg is amazingly fun, suspenseful, and scary all in one. I just love it like all other Spielberg films. Well apart from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I think everyone knows the premise. A giant killer shark is terrorizing a town. So a sheriff, a scientist, and a fisherman go out to hunt it down. It starts out with the shark just going around killing people. But once Martin, Matt, and Quint get on the Orca the movie officially begins. It's kind of like a part 1 and part 2 movie. My favorite part is when Matt and Quint are having dinner, and they are drinking to their wounds. Then the mood changes when Quint tells a story when he was on the USS Indianapolis. Then they start singing. And then all of a sudden they're attacked by the shark. Jaws is a real wild ride.",9,1,4,20 January 2014
Inception," Amazing!
","This movie is astonishing! The plot is complicated so it can lose you if you're not paying attention, but if you hold on to every piece of the plot it makes sense and you see a really good story. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who performs the rare art of extraction, stealing an idea from someone's mind via their dream. When Saito (Ken Wantanabe) gives Cobb the task of inception (the art of planting an idea through their mind) he also offers Cobb the chance to see his children again. He accepts and Cobb and his team are given the task of planting the idea inside the mind of CEO Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). Cobb and his team isolate Fischer on a plane and though a series of dreams give him the idea that Saito wanted him to have. The music by Hans Zimmer is amazing. I mean Zimmer's music always is, but here is where he's at his best. The plot, as I've already mentioned is great, you just have to be really paying attention to everything going on. The acting is also equally great. If you haven't seen it yet, go see it.",10,0,3,10 May 2015
Finding Dory," Just as good as the first.
","But if I had to choose which one I liked better, I would probably say the first one. I don't know why but I just end up enjoying the first one more. However this film has a lot more going on. Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) begins having random memories of her parents and remembers that she came from the Marine Life Institute in California. There she inadvertently meets Hank (Ed O'Neill) an octopus, meets up with an old friend, and ends up driving a truck. You'll really have to see the movie to understand it. Finding Dory continues expanding on characters we've already come to love, and introduces a few new ones. We also delve more into Dory's history which I was always more interested in seeing. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out. Your kids will love it.",9,2,10,26 June 2016
Stalag 17," It's kind of like a 'Who done it.'
","I just finished watching this movie. I felt immediately like I should review it. So here I am now. The film is about a prison camp in World War 2. It focuses on one barrack. Well in this barrack, there is an informant who tells the Germans of escapes and anything else. The informant is suspected of being Sergeant JJ Sefton (William Holden). Sergeant Sefton is a cynical US Airman who never wishes to escape. He also gets many unexplained luxuries. Sergeant Sefton needs to clear his name to avoid being beaten for a second time. Sergeant Price (Peter Graves) is the head of security. One time Sergeant Sefton overhears Price talking with (get his) Sergeant Johann Shultz (Sig Ruman) about secret information. Price puts the secrets he learns in a chess piece. And then later Shultz comes by and picks them up. When a US Airman arrives in the camp named Lieutenant James Dunbar (Don Taylor) he tells the prisoners that he sabotaged an ammunition. Soon the Germans find out about it and they capture Lieutenant Dunbar. All the pressure is on Sergeant Sefton who has to reveal that he is not the informant, by finding out the real one. He eventually reveals it to be Price while at the same time breaking out Lieutenant Dunbar. I say that everyone should watch this movie.",9,1,3,27 April 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," I can certainly see why this is number 1.
","This movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few can compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison for murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red soon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate factory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way that the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the other officers about it, including Warden Norton and Andy is soon doing tax returns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for Andy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the prison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life on the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton tries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a new prisoner named Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and reveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to bring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has Hadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had enough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a tunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from solitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton and Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand kills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like Brooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in Mexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film is great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy and Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the issue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large portion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become adapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside world. Overall it's just a great movie so I hugely recommend it.",10,1,2,9 July 2014
Halloween," One of the best independent movies ever made.
","Halloween has a simple premise. Fifteen years after murdering his sister, Michael Myers (Nick Castle) escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. His psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasance) follows suit to stop him from killing again. As soon as Myers arrives in Haddonfield he begins stalking teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) as she babysits two young kids on Halloween night. As the night progresses most of Laurie's friends are axed off as she tries to escape the seemingly unstoppable Myers. At the end of the movie Loomis shoots Myers off the balcony where he disappears. Made in 1978, Halloween is one of the earliest examples of the modern slasher movie as they've come to be known. An important aspect to note however is the film itself has very little gore or blood. It's more of a suspense thriller, in the vein of something like Jaws or The Shining. It's also easily one of the most effective horror films ever and a prime example of how a film on such a small budget can make such a large impact on movie making. Everything I wrote has probable already been said countless times before so I'll just conclude by recommending it to any movie buff.",9,0,1,23 July 2017
Paths of Glory," A fantastic film!
","I love war films! Usually I watch the ones about the commanders like Tora! Tora! Tora(1970) or The Longest Day(1962). These films are both about a historical event in World War 2. They don't form any opinion on war they just show what happened. War films about the soldiers themselves are different. They still showcase an event but these films express views on war. All Quiet on the Western Front(1930) comes to mind. Paths of Glory(1957) is sort of a mix. It's about both the commanders and the soldiers. It's about how the commanders treat the infantry men. It's about two generals General Paul Mireau(George MacReady) and General George Broulard(Adolphe Menjou) who want to take over the German anthill in World War 1. They plan to do this by using troops led by their leader Colonel Dax(Kirk Douglas). Colonel Dax does as he is ordered and he and his men attempt to storm the anthill. It goes horribly wrong and results in an unnecessary loss of men. The attack was suicide anyway. General Mireau is angry and orders his artillery to fire on Colonel Dax's troops. The order is refused so General Mireau blames the men for cowardice. Colonel Dax attempts unsuccsessfully to save his men from execution. But to get revenge on Mireau, Colonel Dax tells General Broulard about Mireau's attempt to fire on his own troops. This is my 3rd favorite Stanley Kubrick film out of the 4 i've seen at the moment. This is an amazing film from one of the best ever motion picture makers!",10,0,1,13 October 2013
Back to the Future Part II," Not as good as the first but still a pretty solid effort.
","I'm writing this in 2015. And that is one of the years that Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lee) go to in this movie. Back to the Future Part 2 was a good effort to follow up to the success of the first film. In this film Marty and Doc go to 2015, where they see flying cars, self lacing shoes, and all kinds of stuff like that. Well I'm looking out the window right now and I don't see that. But anyways old Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) goes back to 1955 after stealing the DeLorean time machine and causes major problems to the time line. Therefore Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to fix all of it. It's really hard to explain but when you watch the film it makes more sense. This Back to the Future film relies more on the suspense element as it gets into the second half. Even though they were wrong about many of the predictions (I'm looking out my window again just to clarify) this is still a good movie so give it a watch.",9,0,0,3 January 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," The send off of the dark knight.
","While I don't think that The Dark Knight Rises is as good as the last two Christopher Nolan Batman films, I still find it to be a good film as well as the proper send off for Batman. Yeah major spoilers ahead! If you want the film to be a surprise like it was for me, than I recommend you stop reading this now. In this story former League of Shadows member Bane (Tom Hardy) is fulfilling Ra's Al Ghul's dreams of destroying Gotham City by isolating it from the rest of the world and destroying it with a nuclear bomb. After Bane traps the Gotham City Police Department underground, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) becomes the only hope to save Gotham, so he dons the suit again to save the day for the last time. I don't feel that The Dark Knight Rises was done as well as the last two Nolan Batman films but I do still feel it was pretty good. It's also very confusing as to what is going on. In the first half of the movie we see three main subplots that eventually come together in the second half. I think it's a clever idea on Nolan's part and I liked it in the second half, but throughout the first half I just kept getting confused. If you're the type of person that would be thrown off by this, this may not be the movie for you. I do recommend this film, but you should see the last two first, as a lot of plot points are picked up from both of them.",8,2,3,26 March 2015
Toy Story 3," Why does this get so much praise?
","Okay this is Toy Story 3. The film everyone says that they liked, they say it was the Citizen Kane of animated films. And I'm just going to say, I don't get it. The main problem with the movie is it's just unpleasant. How did this get a G rating. I'd love to get somebody, anybody, from the MPAA to say maybe, just maybe, we should have given it PG! I mean that there is no fun in this film. But my review will be in obvious contrast to the others because I think it's bad. Well, it is. Granted it some good moments but it was just dark and unpleasant. Cars 2 get's hated while I like it. This get's liked while I hate it. Cars 2 get's hated because they say it was so much darker than the 1st. But this is twice as violent. Granted the last 2 films weren't all whimsical but in the last two did you see the toys getting tortured?! No! This simply does not happen! When did 'You've got a friend in me,' turn into 'Burn alive, burn until you rot in hell!' When did that happen?! Is there something I missed in the last 2? Do I have an abridged DVD? Somebody tell me when the last 2 films were as dark as this! I'm sorry but this film is horrible! I still don't understand why so many people liked it. The last part of the movie with Andy playing with his toys for the last time was the only bit of the movie that I found good. That is my review.",4,10,19,20 January 2014
Trainspotting," Not quite what I expected.
","I ought to start by saying that I liked the film. I had known about this film for a while, thinking it was something akin to other 1990s crime comedies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels or The Big Lebowski. In retrospect I suppose that was a bit naive. Trainspotting is often described as a comedy but while it has comedic elements to it the film felt much more like a drama/surreal fever dream. While such imagery would usually remind me of David Lynch the aforementioned comedic elements and the presence of illicit drugs reminded me more of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Francis Bacon in particular was cited as an influence and it makes sense. Dealing with the harsh realities of drug addiction the film certainly wasn't pleasant and kind of hard to watch in parts. But these aren't appealing themes. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) our protagonist narrates to us his difficulties with social pressure (to get off drugs), shots of the Edinburgh drug scene into which he is immersed, the degradation of his life on drugs, his unreliable friends, and the perceived mediocrity and boredom of life without drugs. As a result, while I can't relate to many of Renton's issues I can still empathize, even though he makes plenty of bad decisions that continue to drive him into a hole. Marking down an opinion then is difficult. While more gritty (and even depressing) than I expected it to be Trainspotting is still enjoyable and you can't say it's not a good movie.",8,1,2,27 December 2019
RED," GACF: Great Action Comedy Fun
","While watching RED I got a sort of classic Men on a Mission vibe from it. I felt like I was watching something like Where Eagles Dare or The Dirty Dozen only it was in modern time and it didn't take itself so seriously. The story includes Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) a retired CIA operative that is forced back into action to stop political corruption when the CIA tries to take him out because he knows to much. Frank get's his old CIA pals Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) along with former MI6 Agent Victoria Brown (Helen Mirren) and KGB old enemy Ivan Simanov (Brain Cox) to save the day. If that sounds like fun, you're absolutely right. This is a really fun movie. It has a great old feel to it and if you liked the two movies I listed up at the top then you'll like this. Go ahead and check it out.",8,0,0,22 March 2015
Rear Window," Another movie that takes place entirely in a room.
","This is the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I've seen. And as of this writing it's my favorite. Here's the plot. LB 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is an adventurous photographer that is recovering from a broken leg and spends his time looking out his window. His girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly) is the polar opposite. Lisa is into fashion, while Jeff is into adventure. He's rugged, and she's gorgeous and really just too perfect for him. So while they're having their differences Jeff starts to suspect that a neighbor of his names Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Eventually Lisa becomes convinced too. They try to alert a friend of Jeff's named Lieutenant Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey) but he's not listening, so Jeff and Lisa take it up themselves. Jeff sends Lisa to investigate Thorwald's apartment but she is caught. When Thorwald goes to confront Jeff, he pushes Jeff out the window. Luckily the police save Jeff, Thorwald is arrested, and Jeff and Lisa reconnect. The whole film takes place in one room. Even when something is happening across the courtyard we see it through Jeff's binoculars. The only time this doesn't happen is near the end when the police catch Jeff from falling. The acting is all great. Stewart, and Kelly were both amazing in this movie. And it leaves you with an eerie feeling that a murder could be going on right by the house.",10,0,3,16 June 2014
The Matrix," Good movie, but not without it's flaws.
","The Matrix was pretty groundbreaking wasn't it? It showed the world that big budget action movies can be philosophical. That said, looking at it now, it does have a dated appearance. Does that make it any less a film. Not exactly, but it's easier to laugh at some of the things about it. We've all seen people make fun of Keanu Reeves going, 'Whoah.' That said I still like the movie. It's a fun action flick that also makes you think, and I like that. The story was good, the effects are good, most of the acting is good (most of it), and I really do appreciate what this film did for the action genre. It wasn't unheard of for action movies to be philosophical, it just wasn't as common as it now. Today a lot of action movies can double as thinker movies, and a lot of that is down The Matrix. If you haven't seen it, you should go check it out.",8,0,0,26 January 2016
Minions," An good and interesting prequel.
","Apparently the minions in Despicable Me weren't created by Gru. They're a group of being that date from prehistoric times to serve the most evil people imaginable. From the Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon Bonaparte. But they find they always inadvertently kill their masters. They feel depression and isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Until one day in 1968 Kevin (Pierre Coffin) goes to the world again with two other minions Stuart (Coffin) and Bob (Coffin) to find a master. They get to New York, New York where they hear about Scarlet Overkill (how subtle) (Sandra Bullock) who is aiming to be the world's first female super villain. What follows is a big series of jokes and quite the story line that makes this a great movie. To those reading this review look at your schedule and make time to bring your family to this film tonight. You won't regret it. It has fun characters, comedy, and all the minions that made the last two films so great.",9,37,73,12 July 2015
Saboteur," Man Hunt
","Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films where an innocent person get's into some big trouble. In Saboteur we see our hero, factory worker Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) run across the country after being accused of the murder of his coworker. Along with Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane) Barry has to prove his innocence and prevent the next sabotage effort. Yeah, Barry's friend was killed by sabotage. This film bares a lot of similarities to North by Northwest and The 39 Steps both also by Hitchcock. This is a great film like all Hitchcock films. I recommend Saboteur to any Hitchcock fan or anyone who likes good movies in general. It's suspenseful, it's enthralling, and it's a lot of fun.",10,0,2,9 June 2015
The Social Network," Way better than it needed to be.
","I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to make a movie about the founding of Facebook difficult. Part of that is obviously due to the dramatization and the bending of the truth, but credit is more than due to David Fincher's directing, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay, and the performances given by Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake and just about everyone else. There's a line in Honest Trailers that claims that the movie is so good it makes young millionaires suing each other high stakes. As for the aforementioned bending of the truth, well the movie does it pretty often. Mark Zuckerberg didn't come up with the idea after breaking up with his girlfriend, he wasn't really obsessed with exclusive Harvard clubs, and Sean Parker wasn't a coked out paranoiac. Do watch the film, unless you want to know the real story of Facebook.",9,0,1,7 April 2020
Back to the Future," 'When this baby hit's 88 miles an hour, you're gonna see some serious ****')
","This movie is filled with ideas, jokes, and great characters. And it works on every level. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager living in the year 1985. He has a less than perfect life, as his parents George McFly (Crispin Glover) a nerd, and Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) a drunk don't connect. His two friends that we see are his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Cristopher Lloyd) a crazy scientist. When one day when Doc. Brown invents a DeLoeran time machine Marty inadvertently goes back to the year 1955 where he sees George and Lorraine as high school students. He also sees George's future supervisor Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the current school bully. Marty has to meet up with 1955 Doc. Brown so that he can fix the DeLorean, hook it up to a lighting bolt to get the required electricity to go back to 1985 and prevent Doc. Brown from being killed by Libyan terrorists. As if that weren't enough things get worse when Lorraine becomes infatuated with Marty instead of George. Therefore this could prevent his own existence. So he has to get his parents to go to the dance together, fall in love, so he will even be a person. This movie like Ghostbusters will confuse the mess out of you if you think about too long. Just try to enjoy it. And this is entirely possible. This film is filled to the brim with funny lines, catchphrases, great acting, great characters, great jokes, and everything about it is great. Go check it out. Good stuff.",10,5,6,4 October 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," A good sequel.
","The Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies. So when I saw it's first sequel I was wondering how they could make a better Jason Bourne movie then the last. It wasn't as good but it was still pretty good. This is the plot. After the events of the first film Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) are living in India. When a CIA mission goes wrong they frame Jason for it. When an agent is sent out to kill Jason he kills Marie instead and the car they were driving goes off the bridge. Jason is assumed dead. But he survives and goes to Naples, Italy. Meanwhile CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is convinced that Jason and the late CIA supervisor Alexander Conklin were somehow involved in in a plot to steal $20,000,000 from Politician Vladimir Neski 7 years ago. Landy and Deputy director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) go to Berlin, Germany to capture Jason. Jason is captured but escapes and goes to Munich, Germany after learning that the Treastone project in the first film was shut down after Conklin died, Jason goes to Berlin where Landy and Abbott meet up with technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and question her about her past experiences with Jason. While this is going on Jason is watching Landy in her office and calls her. He tells her to send Nicky to him. He learns from Nicky that Abbott was the head of Treadstone instead of Conklin. He also now knows that he was the one who killed Neski and his wife 7 years ago and made it look like a murder/suicide. When Jason meets up with Abbott he confesses to ordering the assassination on Jason. Later when Landy confronts Abbott he commits suicide. Some time later in New York after Landy learns Jason's innocence, she is called by him. She tells him his real name is David Webb and that he was born on 4-15-71. Jason tells her that she looks tired and indicates that he can see her. Overall although this wasn't as good as Identity it was still a really good movie. I say this is one to see.",9,2,2,25 July 2014
Shark Tale," The biggest marketing excuse i've seen in a while.
","Shark Tale is one of those movies that you can tell is just a thinly veiled excuse to make money. The problems with the film are pretty obvious. The film has all these big names that you know they only got to draw in big audiences, and there are a bunch of really bad puns. I'm not even kidding about that. The puns in this movie make A Bee Movie look funny. Oscar (Will Smith) is a cool hip hop fish in the underwater city, works at a 'whale wash', and he's being admired by his coworker Angie (Renee Zellweger). But not all is well for Oscar as he owes money to his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) and he can't pay it off. Well Oscar inadvertently meets a vegetarian shark named Lenny (Jack Black) after it looks like Oscar killed Lenny's brother Frankie (Michael Imperioli). This is bad news because Lenny's father is the shark mafia boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro). Oscar and Lenny then make it look like Oscar killed Lenny making him the shark slayer so Lenny can run away and start a new life. Spoiler alert! We have to go through the liar revealed story again. I understand why they put that in kid's films but it get's old and predictable. But the real problem with Shark Tale is the idea. The story isn't done very well and you know right from the get go that this was an excuse to make money and throw in some pop culture references. Think about it. When you see the characters, you don't see the characters you just see the actors playing them. You now they choose them because of the names and nothing else. Smith's character is also annoying and to be honest a bit of a jerk. There are some moments when the film is enjoyable, particularly with De Niro and Scorsese, but even here you can't shed the light that you are watching De Niro and Scorsese. Honestly I really don't recommend it.",4,0,2,28 May 2015
The Birds," Birds attack people. There's not much to it.
",The Birds is a movie about birds that go insane and start attacking people. Obviously there's character development but the main thing here is the birds. James Rolfe said that The Birds is kind of like Jaws. It has the plot of a B movie but it was so good that's now a big budget 'A' movie. The plot apart from the birds is that a young rich playgirl named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) follows a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to a remote town in California. The film at first takes awhile with delivering the bird attacks but I think it does a good job in keeping us on our toes. That's Alfred Hitchcock for you. The bird effects themselves are often quite cheesy looking but it still keeps up the suspense. Not my favorite Hitchcock film but it's good enough for an 8 star rating.,8,1,5,6 September 2015
The Simpsons Movie," D'oh!
","Who doesn't love the Simpsons? This show has spoofed every American political and social event that has gone on in the amount of time it's been on. So when they made their first feature length film, they just decided to outdo themselves. Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) the well known father of the most outrageous middle class family in the United States, has just polluted an entire lake with pig excrement. Typical. As a result EPA director Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks) encourages President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) to put a dome on top of Springfield so they can not be connected in any way with the outside world. Homer and the rest of his family are the only people to escape Springfield and make a life as fugitives. And it's up to Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa to defeat the evil Cargill and save the day. I honestly can not do this movie justice by writing about so I'll just say, go see this. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.",9,2,3,13 March 2015
The Martian," It's pretty amazing.
","When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by a satellite and presumed dead on a manned Mars mission, he has to find a way to survive on the planet and signal to earth that he is alive. I'm not a scientist so I don't know how accurate everything is, but the movie itself was really good. It almost behaves like a documentary at times as their are parts where Mark talks to the camera giving the status of his situation. We also see all the drama in Washington, DC with NASA officials trying to bring Mark back home. The acting is good. Damon is really good in the role and it's really not easy to imagine anyone else in his place. The story is great. Even though for the most part we're just seeing Damon stranded on Mars, we're emotionally invested and we want to see what happens next. I highly recommend The Martian.",9,3,7,20 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Oddessy in the Depression.
","O Brother Where art Though is my second favorite Coen Brothers film. It's also the first one I've seen. Well this is the premise. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) has just escaped prison with two cell mates Pete Hogwallop (John Tuturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson). Ulysses tells Pete and Delmar that they have escaped to go find a fortune but it's really so Ulysses can get back together with his wife (Holly Hunter) who divorced him when he was sent to jail. Along the way they meet all kinds of characters. They meet Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) a guitarist who sold his soul to the devil, George 'Baby Face' Nelson (Michael Badalucco) a high strung prohibition gangster, and Daniel 'Big Dan' Teague (John Goodman) a one eyed Bible salesman who is secretly a Ku Klux Klan member. They are being chased by a Sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who loses them at every turn. Eventually they make it to Ulysses' wife who demands her ring back. When they go get it they are caught by the police. But then a massive flood comes in and sweeps them away. I love this movie. It's funny, engaging, and of course has that Coen feel to it. Clooney makes a really good main character so check it out.",9,0,0,25 May 2014
The Godfather," 'I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.'
","One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it.",10,3,6,31 January 2015
