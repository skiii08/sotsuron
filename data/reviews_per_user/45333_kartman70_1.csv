Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great movie
","This movie is great, but I wish they would make a new Indiana Jones movie, they are a very exciting series of movies, and many people would love to see a new movie. It is a potentially very exciting series of movies that many people would absolutely love to see. Now, as for Harrison Ford playing the lead role of the next movie, that would only be absolutely vital! Unless Indiana Jones was much younger in the movie, Harrison Ford could easily play the role if he put his old bones to the test. Being in the entertainment business, and being a long-time movie fan, I am actually quite disappointed in the fact that there is not yet a new Indiana Jones movie.",10,0,1,27 January 2005
