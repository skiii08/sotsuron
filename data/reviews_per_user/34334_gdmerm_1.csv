Skyfall," Uninspiring, feels like it was rushed...
","A marvel in terms of cinematography that is otherwise - and unfortunately - being completely let down by uninspired story telling, half baked personas and a plethora of clich√©s. This is a title that does not live to the Bond theme, story or franchise and feels like a collection of badly stitched, half finished side stories, all leading to a spectacular, in terms of photography and colors, yet completely unfitting finale. Actor performances were as good as they could get and they could not get very far with such a horrible horrible script anyway. I don't want to spoil the film so I am not going into examples or details but this one definitely reused some very recognizable themes from comic hero movies (hint hint cave)Very very disappointing. Then again, I see a lot of people here writing that this is the best Bond movie ever, so I guess that maybe I just don't get it.",4,31,63,3 November 2012
