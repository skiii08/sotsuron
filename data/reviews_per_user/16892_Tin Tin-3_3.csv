Mission: Impossible III," Must do better...
","Yet another example of the law of diminishing returns with 'franchise' movies. As the numbers at the end increase, so the merit of the film decreases.'Batman Begins' took us back to the start in an absolutely blistering shake-up of the franchise and, hell, even Episode III managed something similar after the embarrassments of Episodes I and II. Mission: Impossible needs something similar or they would be as well packing up now and quitting while still marginally ahead.Why? Well, we've seen it all before really. Twice. Big explosions, minimal plots, a shameless and shallow attempt to shoehorn in a 'family' theme (wonder whose idea that was?), MORE moles - why bother going into work in the morning? Your mission is a decoy EVERY TIME, cartoon baddies, guest stars who look as if they have no idea what they are doing there, etc.It watches like a television drama with a bit of money thrown at it, which I suppose is not entirely surprising but, for the third time the credits rolled on an impossible mission and for the third time I thought: 'That's IT?' It looks tired, the production looks lazy and the paying public deserve better. Not that many of them will notice, however.",3,12,27,5 May 2006
Superbad," Astonishingly bad
","Something that hasn't been picked up as frequently as I suspected it might have been is the 'trivia' section fact that the idea for this, er, 'movie' was dreamt up by two 13-year-olds.Boy, does it ever show. In 30+ years of movie-going I have never seen such a pile of puerile, unfunny, self-indulgent nonsense.Quite disgusting, and it's incomprehensible to me that anyone over the age of ten could find this plot less mess amusing or worthwhile.Thankfully it's no longer the case but to see this odious crap in the IMDb top 250 a few weeks ago was staggering. It's slipped away now that the brain damaged people who rate this film have left their '10' and been readmitted to their secure unit.At one point, this film rated higher than Scarface. The latter film is the topic of discussion and retrospectives well over two decades after its release and I would bet than in another couple of decades people will still be talking about Tony Montana's exploits. 'Superbad', if there is a God, will be forgotten by Christmas. Amen to that.Avoid this prurient rubbish at all costs, unless you have a mental age of 10, in which case 'Superbad' is the mothership.",1,99,205,1 December 2007
Avatar," Derivative, ordinary
","Any film would struggle to live up to the gargantuan hype that Avatar had placed upon its narrow shoulders and this movie, unsurprisingly, falls well short. That's not Cameron's fault, of course, as the PRs are only doing their job. Suffice to say that promising the 'redefinition of cinema' in championing something so ordinary is never going to win many admirers.As to the flabby mess that is the film itself? There's only one person to blame for that, I'm afraid. It's eighteen years now since 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' and in the intervening time, Cameron has totally flat-lined as a director of vision and compelling narrative. One can overlook the vacuousness of 'Titanic' as it had mass appeal to people who didn't really know any better but it is insisted that Avatar was 10 years in the making. Really? If that's true, then Cameron needs to manage his time better. What on earth was he doing over the past decade? Certainly not developing the turgid and derivative plot - I could have knocked out something equally as hackneyed over a weekend without too much difficulty. Certainly not fine-tuning the dialogue, which is clunky ('numbnuts' - WTF?) and stereotypical in the extreme - a good deal of it sounded like lines that would have been rejected from the 'Aliens' script.Cameron was, we're told, waiting for technology to 'catch up' and enable him to make the film he envisaged but there's nothing here that hasn't been done before, and better. It's really hard to see where the money went. If you want to see a film that looks good with minimal plot then I would recommend '2012' over this.Cameron's arrogance and insufferable smugness are the stuff of legend and his overbearing attitude and belief that only he knows best are undoubtedly responsible for this stab at fantasy. He's clearly seeking a legacy on a par with that which Lucas achieved with Episodes IV - VI but this doesn't even run the loopy and convoluted Episodes I - III close.You had it, you lost it. Such is life.",1,48,103,17 December 2009
