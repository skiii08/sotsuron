Vertigo," Pass the Popcorn review
","Alfred Hitchcock - the name says it all. This prolific and famous director doesn't really need any introduction/presentation, and neither do his movies - many of them can often be found on various 'best movies' lists and maintain a cult status even after all these years.Detective John Ferguson (James Stewart) decides to retire after his acrophobia causes the accidental death of a police officer. He meets an old friend, Gavin (Tom Helmore), who asks him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), because he thinks she's possessed, hence in mortal danger. John is sceptical, but he accepts and, as time passes, starts to develop feelings for Madeleine, all the while trying to get rid of his phobia.Vertigo is now hailed by many as (one of) the best Hitchcock movies, and as (one of) the best ever made. In my opinion, it's pretty overrated. Of course, this doesn't mean it's bad. The story is original, the events are unexpected, and every major dramatic happening is accompanied by a fitting soundtrack. The actors do a terrific job, you can see they are really into the part they play, although the age difference between the two main characters does cause their love to be less believable. Hitchcock himself blamed James Stewart's old age for the movie's critical and commercial failure, when it premiered. Certain scenes are memorable: Vertigo popularized the dolly zoom (thus often called 'the Vertigo effect'), achieved by moving the camera away from a subject while simultaneously zooming in, and used when John Ferguson looks down from a height which makes him feel dizzy. But all of this somehow doesn't work. There is something missing. The movie simply didn't grip me. And of course, there is the ending, which could have been so much better, but instead it almost ruins the whole film. It seems like the director was late for a meeting and decided it all had to end there and then - which results in a rushed, unsatisfying finale. In conclusion: a good but too overrated piece of art which requires that little 'something' to work out. But maybe then it wouldn't be Hitchcock.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,0,2,16 March 2013
The Monuments Men," Pass the Popcorn! review
","George Clooney is usually considered a good actor and an even better director. Although he directed only a few movies, almost all of them were good, especially The Ides of March and Good Night and Good Luck. So it was natural to expect much from The Monuments Men, particularly since, even before its release (and its postponement), it was considered an Oscar contender. Add to all this the cast of good and talented actors, and the interesting true story (I'd never heard of the monuments men before), and you'll get something that's probably too good to be true. But The Monuments Men isn't good: it's a very confusing movie that is either extremely comedic or extremely dramatic, and it doesn't work.The Monuments Men are a group of art historians and museum directors and curators, led by Frank Stokes (George Clooney), who are sent to Europe during World War II in order to try and prevent the Nazis from stealing and destroying art pieces, and to find the art that has been stolen so they can return it to the rightful owners. They start off as a group, but are then sent, as couples, each in a different town, throughout France and Germany. The story is simple, but it's very difficult to follow what's happening, since there are characters who look similar (Hugh Bonneville is like a combination of Bill Murray and John Goodman) and only Matt Damon and George Clooney's characters are properly introduced, from the beginning. All the others eventually gain some personality towards the end of the movie.It could be said that there's no villain in this movie. Of course, the Nazis are the bad guys, but it's not easy to feel the tension of war and fighting if you don't have a physical character that represents the bad guys. There are some shots of Hitler and various generals/officers, but all of them are just generically sleazy and irritating, like there hasn't been put any effort in making them quality villains, because we already know Nazis were bad people. Another big problem with the movie is that, for a lot of its duration, it seems like a collection of loosely connected individual stories, and when one ends and the other one begins, the most common reaction is 'oh, I forgot this guy was in the movie'. And this happened every time they showed Matt Damon on screen. Logically, you can't connect with the characters and feel for them – even when somebody dies, you couldn't care less.The soundtrack isn't objectively bad, but it's more suited for a Disney movie than The Monuments Men, and it makes even the most serious and dramatic moments look pathetic and silly. The things that redeem this movie are the good performances by the cast, some well-executed scenes and the story – because, as I've already said, I had never heard of the monuments men before, this movie taught me something. It's just sad that such an important and interesting part of history has been ignored until now, and has been ruined with this movie, that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, so it goes from tragic scenes of death to scenes that look like spoofs. In short, you better skip this movie.Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.com",6,0,0,21 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Pass the Popcorn review
","Captain Phillips is a movie based on a true story, and on the book Richard Phillips himself wrote after the events that occurred in 2009: his cargo ship was attacked by Somali pirates, and after that he was taken hostage in a lifeboat, while the pirates awaited ransom and the US Navy tried to save Mr Phillips. Apparently, this movie is an Oscar contender, and many hail it as the best this year. I'm definitely not these people: Captain Phillips is a good movie, but it should have been better to be worthy of an Oscar. On the other hand, since the Oscars are often given to every Tom, Dick and Harry with no apparent reason, we might have a winner here – which, compared to some other movies this year, may truly be one of the most worthy of the award.There's not much to say about the story that I haven't already said. The movie starts by depicting Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) as a family man, traveling to the airport with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) whom he loves very much, talking about their grown-up children and how it's never easy to part. It would have been nice to see Phillips' family again later in the movie – that would have added even more emotion to the story. Also, this is a lovely sequence, and I think people in a long-distance relationship will appreciate it the most. Mr Phillips reaches the Sultanate of Oman in the next scene, and gets aboard the MV Maersk Alabama – a cargo ship – with his crew. They know they will have to travel close to the coast of Somalia to get to their destination, so they are ready in case of pirate attacks. Unfortunately, after a first failed attempt, four Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manage to get on board and take part of the crew hostage – and so a battle of wits begins.First of all, it's nice to get a true story that's really interesting and worth watching, once in a while. Too often do directors seem to think that, if they put 'based on a true story' somewhere before the opening credits, the movie that follows will be able to grip the audience and make it automatically feel for the characters. The director Paul Greengrass is really working hard to make you feel the tension, the fear and everything else the characters are feeling – as if you were there with them. For example, the scenes in which the pirates try, and eventually manage, to get aboard the ship are able to make you so nervous you need to take a pill to calm down. Therefore, it's really baffling how such a movie, with such a story, can get so boring so often. Apart from the fact that it's unnecessary long – over 2 hours! – some scenes are obviously lengthened for no apparent reason (except to make the movie longer?). Generally, it's very difficult to stay focused for so long, and it's even more difficult when you have nothing to keep you interested. And since even Escape Plan managed to be constantly entertaining and interesting, Captain Phillips' boringness can't be justified.While, like I said, I don't think Captain Phillips deserves an Oscar as a movie, Tom Hanks just might get a well-deserved one for best actor. I've never liked him in particular, but here he proves to be a great actor, as he carries the whole movie and is impressively spontaneous and believable in his main role. Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, the pirate gang leader, is amazing in his first-ever role as the main antagonist. Perhaps the best characteristic of this movie is that it doesn't separate people in 'Americans and good' and 'Somali and bad'. It acknowledges there's so much more: the people who choose to be pirates don't really have much of a choice, in their anarchistic, warlord-controlled country. While we want captain Phillips to get home safely, it's cruel to leave those pirates to their fate – we know that if they go back to Somalia they will keep on living a tough life and perhaps will even be punished by the warlords that gave them the order to attack the ship. And yet, they have broken the law and nobody can really help them. In real life, Mr Phillips developed Stockholm syndrome after getting home: this shows clearly what a complicated subject we're dealing with. In conclusion, aside from the flaws I pointed out and because of its good sides, this is a good movie you should definitely see.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,4,8,19 October 2013
Iron Man 3," Pass the Popcorn review
","In superhero movie franchises there is the famous rule that the second movie is, usually, the best one with the third being the worst. Ever since the flawed Iron Man 2 came out, it was pretty obvious the Iron Man franchise wouldn't follow this rule. After that set back, on the other hand, it was rather unclear what to expect from the third one. Will it be, nevertheless, the worst one? Or will it completely negate the superhero franchises' rule and triumph as the best one? The answer to these questions is: Iron Man 3 is neither the best nor the worst Iron Man movie. However, it is the strangest. You may ask, what do I mean by strange. Well, first of all, unbelievable as it may sound, Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie. Of course, there are some superhero movie elements here and there, but in its core Iron Man 3 is an action/comedy/thriller. To put in the words of director/co-writer Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau in the director's chair) - it's kind of a Tom Clancy style thriller. Because of that, Iron Man 3 is much more similar to another Robert Downey Jr. movie - also directed by Shane Black - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. While I applaud the idea of experimenting with different genres, the ending result was not satisfying. Before I continue, I'll just say I have not seen the movie in 3D so I don't know how it holds in that aspect.The movie follows Tony Stark, as usual,who apparently got PTSD from the events that took place in the Avengers movie. He has trouble sleeping and has panic attacks from time to time. As if that weren't enough, his luxurious Malibu mansion gets destroyed by a terrorist called the Mandarin. Now he has to deal with the Mandarin and other potential threats in the form of old acquaintances. Thematically, Iron Man 3 is similar to The Dark Knight Rises - destroy the hero, put him on his knees so he can rise once again. That being said, Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark rather than about, you know, Iron Man. The similarities with The Dark Knight Rises don't stop here. Both movies have overly complicated stories. Not complicated in the intellectual way, mind you, but in a way that there are just too many intertwined subplots in the movie. Since this is the case, Iron Man 3 is prone to have some plot holes. I, myself, didn't notice many of them nor did I let them diminish my viewing experience, but I'm sure other people will notice them and they'll get frustrated. Anyway, the question remains - why all the TDKR similarities? And it's not only me, I've already seen people on the internet jokingly call this movie Iron Man Rises. To answer this question, we'll need to go back in 2012 when the Avengers exploded at the box office. Iron Man 3 was the first Marvel movie to be released after the Avengers and the stakes were pretty high. No doubt everyone involved wanted this sequel to continue the Avenger's financial success. When everyone realised they can't possibly re-create that success, they turned their heads to another last year superhero box office juggernaut, and copied it instead. And that's how the Iron Man franchise also jumped on the whole Dark Knight Trilogy bandwagon. I find this to be ironic since DC is trying to copy Marvel's Avengers by creating a Justice League movie. However, all of this is strictly my opinion.There's another famous rule in cinema, affecting especially superhero movies, which says that the movie is as good as its villain. And so we come to the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, in spite of how hard the trailers wanted to convince you, is not the main antagonist of the movie. Which is a damn shame, since he may be Iron Man's most famous villain. Instead of being the main bad guy, he plays this disappointingly strange role which I can't explain thoroughly without spoiling the movie. So yes, the movie is as good as its villain - Iron Man 3 is disappointingly strange. It puzzles me why he wasn't given the role he deserves. The reason for that can't be the 'realism', since the real main villain's powers aren't convincing as well, which contradicts Shane Black's statement that Iron Man will be fighting real world-type villains. I'll just say that regarding the villain, there's a definitive Dark Knight Trilogy vibe.Now that I got the two main things in superhero movie, the story and the villain out of the way, I must say I fairly enjoyed everything else - especially the humour. The acting is decent (Ben Kingsley being the best actor), the action is superb and the several Iron Man suits that show up in the movie are also nice. All in all, it seems that Iron Man 3 works best as a dumb popcorn flick. Unfortunately, it has no real re-watch value.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,0,5,25 April 2013
Training Day," Pass the Popcorn review
","Denzel Washington won an Oscar for best actor in 2002 for the movie Training Day. Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it – he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool – but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time – there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time – especially those Alonzo calls 'the three wise men'. All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,1,2,15 August 2013
Gravity," Pass the Popcorn review
","Judging by various internet rating sites, Gravity is currently the best movie from 2013. And along with those who adore and praise it, there are many people who have spent all their time, after seeing the movie, discussing it on various forums. The most talked-about issue is physics, which makes sense since Gravity is a sci-fi. But I doubt any recent sci-fi has ever been analysed so much – and also hated and loved at the same time. It's obvious that Gravity is a very interesting movie, and it seems to be different from the usual stuff Hollywood gives us, which should be appreciated. Many people have been comparing it to 2001: A Space Odissey which, I think, best explains and summarizes the fame that's been building around Gravity ever since it came out.The story in Gravity, unfortunately, is not as original as one may think. Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first mission in space, while Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is an astronaut on his last mission. While trying to repair some damage on the Hubble telescope, they are hit by debris from a destroyed satellite which wrecks the space shuttle Explorer, leaving only Stone and Kowalski alive. Kowalski uses his thruster pack to retrieve Stone, who was sent away from the shuttle, and together they make their way to the International Space Station. Here Gravity becomes a survival thriller – a very good one, no doubt, but still nothing more than that, which is a shame since the setting alone allows more psychologically challenging developments.I found the cast selection to be confusing: why Clooney and Bullock? They are not bad actors, but I don't think they fit their roles. Notably, before Bullock was cast there were many other (better) options, and even Robert Downey Jr. (who was also offered the role of Kowalski) would have been better than Clooney playing himself. Still, both our main actors do a good job – especially Bullock, who spent months training for her role – and even though their characters are not developed enough, it's difficult to notice that since the story keeps you glued to your seat. Gravity's opening scene is particularly amazing: there are no sounds apart from the radio communications among the astronauts and Mission Control, and a very long take, going in circle, shows us Earth, the shuttle and the astronauts up close. I admire Cuarón's decision to acknowledge there is no sound in space, but I'd rather have sounds than a soundtrack that's occasionally exaggeratedly loud and unnecessary.Furthermore, many people claim Gravity is scientifically inaccurate, but unless you're a physicist or an aerospace engineer, I don't think you will notice/mind many of those mistakes – besides, Cuarón himself admits he 'adapted' the physics to suit the plot. Interestingly, the movie is only 90 minutes long but feels much longer, in a good way. It also has a lower budget than many other epic sci-fi movies, but looks much better. Actually, Gravity is the most beautiful and tense movie I've seen in a while, with some perfectly directed scenes. The tension is mostly built through very long takes and some POV shots. In summary, it all comes down to this: the movie is visually stunning and has loads of potential, but doesn't exploit it fully. The dialogues (and monologues) are mostly clichéd, some even make you cringe. Had it been a mostly silent movie, had it concentrated on the psychological effect of the fear of imminent death on people, Gravity would have been better. But it would also have seemed like a Space Odissey ripoff, and it definitely wouldn't have been a Hollywood movie. Despite its flaws, I recommend this movie, because it's a unique experience Hollywood probably won't present us again soon.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8,1,4,11 October 2013
The Big Lebowski," Pass the Popcorn review
","I, usually, don't watch the same movie several times. However, The Big Lebowski is a big exception to that rule. Very loosely based on real people and stories, this movie is full of details, subtle references and jokes. In fact, it's impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I always find something new. Thus, the Big Lebowski has the biggest re-watch value I've ever seen in a movie. Another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie (besides one sentence that was ad-libbed) was written in the script. Which is fascinating since the F-word or a variation of the F-word is used 292 times; the word 'dude' is used around 161 times and The Dude says the word 'man' 147 times through the movie. With these two elements in mind, there is no doubt that the Coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters. And The Big Lebowski is their best movie to date.The Big Lebowski is a movie about an everyday lazy hippie-like guy named Jeffrey Lebowski aka The Dude. His misfortune starts when two thugs, mistaking him for another man, also named Jeffrey Lebowski and who is a millionaire, enter his house and try to extort money from him. They also pee on his rug. When they eventually realise they entered the wrong house, they just pick up and leave. The Dude, furious about his rug being destroyed, decides to take the whole situation to the millionaire Lebowski. From this moment on, one complication after another erupts. And the Dude gets involved in all kind of activities. The movie's narration is very film noir-esque: the movie follows the Dude in every scene and he serves as the audience's guide through the story. As a matter of fact, the movie's plot and characters somewhat follow the classic novel/movie The Big Sleep.Since the movie's plot, just like the one from The Big Sleep, can get complicated from time to time, one may find oneself, during the first viewing, in a position where trying to follow every subplot means missing the small details that make this movie so perfect. Not that it is wrong, but in order to fully appreciate the appeal of The Big Lebowski, repeated viewings are an absolute necessary; especially since The Big Lebowski is ultimately a comedy and much of the humour is in the details. The characters also a very strong aspect of the movie. There is plenty of them and each and everyone is memorable and great. Like I said before, the characters, and some of the situations they get into, are based on real life people (and their stories) the Coen brothers met in their lifetime. This unusual combination of real life absurd situations and film noir structure is what makes The Big Lebowski so unique and enjoyable.The Big Lebowski really has a cult status, it is generally adored by both critics and the audience. It even has its own multy-city festival, Lebowski fest. It can easily be found on most of the best comedies of all time lists. It also spawned one of my favourite soundtrack albums (featuring names like Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Captain Beefheart and Elvis Costello, among others). Speaking of music, the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, also has a role in the movie. And The Big Lebowski features a fictional German electro band named Autobahn, which is clearly a homage to Kraftwerk – I found that to be a really nice touch. The only problem I have with the movie is the opening narration by Sam Elliott, which seems too pointless and long and it never suited me. Besides that, everything is top notch. It's a definite recommendation. Now if you would excuse me, I have to go make myself a White Russian.Rating: 9/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",9,1,3,20 May 2013
This Is the End," Pass the Popcorn review
","This is the End is a comedy movie that gathers some of the biggest  names in modern comedy in an unusual set-up. All of the actors play  themselves (or better, the somewhat alternative versions of themselves)  while they're trying to survive in an end of the world scenario.  Initially, when I heard of this movie and its premise, I thought this  would be yet another lame stoner comedy (with the exception of a good  cast). But, fortunately, I was wrong.  The movie's main character/actor is Jay Baruchel, who visits his old  friend Seth Rogen in Los Angeles. Jay doesn't like the LA lifestyle and  just wants to spend a quiet weekend with Seth smoking pot, playing  video games and slacking off. However, Seth wants the both of them to  go to James Franco's housewarming party. Jay reluctantly accepts Seth's  offer. At the party, the two of them meet some of their old  acquaintances (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robertson) and also see  some other stars enjoying themselves (like Rihanna, Emma Watson,  Michael Cera). Seth seems to have a good time at the party while Jay is  bored. Eventually, natural disasters start occurring, breaking the  party, killing a bunch of party guests and leaving only six men in the  safety of James Franco's house  Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig  Robertson, Jonah Hill, James Franco and Danny McBride.  The thing that caught me by surprise the most in This is the End was  that Jay Baruchel is the movie's protagonist. It was a risky choice to  give the main role to the, arguably, least known actor of the bunch.  Nevertheless, that turned out to be really a good decision, since Jay  has a quite decent acting range and managed to carry the movie even  when it was exploring some issues outside the realms of comedy.  Speaking of this issues, This is the End is much more than a brain-dead  comedy. It also deals with topics like social relationships, human  nature in friendships and the course of growing apart from someone you  hold dear. Of course, none of this makes This is the End a particularly  intelligent movie but it does, however, elevate the movie above your  average everyday modern comedy.  Still, writing about all of this is getting me a little aside from the  main argument  the movie's humour. After all, what is a comedy without  its humour? The humour in This is the End is rather good, I found  myself laughing quite a few times. A large portion of the dialogue in  the movie was ad-libbed, which was great, since the majority of the  actors in the movie are experienced comedians and this way they managed  to show off their skills. All in all, This is the End is worth  watching, and not for the laugh value alone. The only bad thing I can  say about this movie is that towards the end it gets a little too  cheesy and predictable, but I'm pretty sure some people will consider  this discontent as pure nitpicking. Either way, I think it's safe to  say that This is the End is a movie that will satisfy many and  disappoint only a rare few.  Rating: 8/10",8,11,23,17 September 2013
World War Z," Pass the Popcorn review
","World War Z is a PG-13 movie adaptation of the 2006 Max Brooks novel of the same name. However, if my Google research is correct, the movie has very little to do with the book. And if history taught us anything is that movie adaptations are often not as good as the books they are trying to adapt - especially if they greatly differ from their source material. I, for one, didn't read the book and am not able to judge whether World War Z was or wasn't a successful adaptation. But I can judge World War Z as a stand alone movie and I must say - it's not particularly good.The movie is mostly about Brad Pitt's character - a former U.N. employee named Gerry Lane - trying to find a cure for the zombie outbreak. There isn't much plot to World War Z and the story hasn't got any important establishing points. That is one of the problems with World War Z - there is no real plot development. World War Z 'compensates' for the lack of a coherent story with being a fast paced/action packed movie. The movie's action sequences literally start within the first several minutes and almost never stop during this 2 hour long ADD fest. To be honest, there is some mild social commentary to be found somewhere in the story, but nothing significantly distinguishable from the usual clichés.Besides the weak plot, World War Z, unfortunately, has a problem with how it portrays zombies. It was obvious that World War Z wanted to break the world record for the movie with the largest number of zombies. Of course, the creators of this movie couldn't possibly achieve this goal by using only actors with make-up so they created the huge zombie masses by using CGI. As a result of that, the zombies in World War Z look very artificial. Sometimes I even felt like I was watching something from a live action video game (not unlike Left 4 Dead), which definitely isn't a good thing. In conclusion, I mostly enjoyed the movie during the third act, when the actual actors in make-up replace the inane computer-generated caricatures.Furthermore, World War Z doesn't really invest in its characters, save from Brad Pitt's character: they are all bland, one dimensional and boring - and when uninteresting characters die/fight for their lives there isn't much drama to it. Still, if you're not really that interested in drama/characters/overall story and just want to watch action scenes and eat popcorn - World War Z is the movie for you, since there are some really impressive and tense action scenes. As for the rest of you, I certainly wouldn't recommend World War Z because of how disappointing the movie feels - it's just a weak shadow of something that could have been great.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",5,19,40,22 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Pass the Popcorn review
","The Hunger Games, the adaptation of the Susanne Collins novel of the same name, was one the most popular and successful movies of 2012. This year, in November, its sequel – The Hunger Games: Catching Fire – will hit the theatres world wide, and there will be even more sequels spawning in 2014 and 2015. So, I decided to sit down and re-watch the first movie, and try to analyse once more if it's really as good as everyone says, and whether it deserves/needs its announced sequels. Like many other people, I hadn't heard of the novel until I had heard of the movie, and I never actually read it; therefore, I can't say if this movie is a faithful adaptation or not.The Hunger Games is, amazingly, about the Hunger Games – an annual manifestation in which two young people (one male and one female) are chosen, from each of the 12 districts set in a dystopian future state, and put into an area where they fight each other to death, and only one comes out alive as the winner. In case you don't understand this concept, don't worry – the movie will go out of its way several times to explain you the rules. Anyway, in the 74th annual Hunger Games, two young people from district 12 are chosen as tributes for the game, one of them being Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteered as a tribute to save her younger sister from the same fate, and the other being Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).In a certain way you could call The Hunger Games a 'style-over- substance' movie, because it spends more time developing the environment/setting/premise in which the characters interact, rather than the characters themselves. While the premise of the movie – people fighting to death until there's only one left standing – certainly isn't original (Battle Royal comes to mind), it's still a pretty interesting premise that will keep you entertained. Being set in a dystopian future, the movie nicely executes the portrayal of this future – with shots of the Capitol and the districts, the portrayal of the everyday people, their costumes, fashion and, of course, their fascination with the Hunger Games.However, the movie falls flat on a technical and character level. The technical problems in the movie include the unnecessary shaky cam, which makes the movie sometimes hard to watch, and the awful CGI (scenes with fires and monster dogs). The situation with the characters isn't much better: the male lead Peeta should have been introduced earlier in the movie, some potentially great characters like Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) should have had more screen time, and some other characters should have been more developed – like the bland bad guy Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and the forgettable little girl Rue (Amandla Stenberg), whose death exceeds her importance. The character of Katniss Everdeen is developed just fine, but the actress portraying her, Jennifer Lawrence, has an unusually stiff delivery and doesn't show her true acting capabilities. That is a shame, since she is a talented actress and she even won an Oscar in 2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.All in all, The Hunger Games is a flawed movie but is still entertaining and has an amusing concept. So I think I would like to see more movies from this franchise and, hopefully, the sequels will learn from the first movie's mistakes and be even more enjoyable. If nothing else, the director Gary Ross – the man responsible for all the shaky cam – passed the opportunity to direct the sequels. Thus, the movies will certainly be somewhat better, at least on a technical level. Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",6,0,1,3 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Pass the Popcorn review
","Four years after the successful J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot came out, we finally have a sequel – Star Trek Into Darkness. To be honest, I was never big on the whole Star Trek franchise, but I was rather entertained by the 2009 reboot. Combine that with the superb trailers and promotional material for the sequel, and it's safe to say my expectations for this movie were pretty high. Overall, I wasn't disappointed. Of course, the sequel had some problems here and there but, ultimately, it's on par with the 2009 movie. The only noticeable difference between these two movie is that, in the latter, J.J. Abrams significantly decreased the use of lens flares. That doesn't mean that there are none, mind you.Set some time after the events of the first movie, this one opens with Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his Enterprise crew, who save a planet inhabited with a somewhat primitive species from imminent destruction. This sort of interfering with life on other planets is against the Federation's regulations and Kirk must face consequences because of that. This opening isn't that vital to the whole story, but it serves as a device to further develop the already complicated relationship between Kirk and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). However, what is vital to the story is that a man named John Harrison – played by Benedict Cumberbatch – decides to destroy the Federation from the inside by performing acts of terrorism. Kirk takes on a dangerous mission to go and capture Khan so they can bring him to justice.The story isn't overly complicated nor very original, but the story in this modern take on the Star Trek franchise was never the most important movie aspect. The characters were always in the first place in these two movies, and their relationships, interactions and back stories were what made my viewing experiences so enjoyable. Like I said in the previous paragraph, Stark Trek Into Darkness takes a further step in developing its characters, analyzing their complicated relationships. And that really works – the characters are likable and developed enough for the audience to care about them when they face danger. The character Khan, who is a new character, stands out the most in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch's cold portrayal of a mad man seeking revenge is top notch. It's important to say that Khan is a much better villain than the Romulan guy Nero in the first movie. Unfortunately, some of the plot points regarding characters didn't really lead anywhere and felt useless – especially the ones with Alice Eve's character Dr. Carol Marcus, whose famous underwear scene was nothing more than pathetic fan service. Also, towards the third act, there was something we may call – a sudden new villain introduction. That's another thing that didn't serve any real purpose, but, due to its short length, it didn't particularly affect my opinion of the movie.Besides the story, which is fairly simple but strong enough, and the characters, most of which are well written and excellently portrayed, there isn't much more in Star Trek Into Darkness. Of course, there are the visuals, which are – just like in every modern Sci-Fi movie – amazing. This time you'll even see some scenes on the Klingon homeworld of Kronos, that was visually interesting. There aren't any other popular alien races shown in the movie. There is the primitive alien race shown at the very beginning, and there are numerous 'cameos' of alien races on the Enterprise. I liked these cameos since they don't take much of the movie's screen time and still effectively illustrate the Federation and the Enterprise as a futuristic multiracial society. As far as modern Sci-Fi movies go, Star Trek Into Darkness will surely leave you thoroughly entertained. Considering what J.J. Abrams has done with this franchise so far, I think the future Star Wars movies and the possible Star Trek sequels are in good hands.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8,6,17,12 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Up until X-Men: The Last Stand, the things were going very good for the X-Men franchise – both X-Men and X2 were good movies. Looking back at it, X-Men Origins: Wolverine wasn't a bad idea. On one hand, X-Men: The Last Stand was a disaster, but why not continue this commercially successful franchise in form of a prequel of its most marketable (and possibly the most interesting) character – Wolverine? However, just like X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a simply bad movie. And yet two years later, the X-Men franchise managed to redeem itself with X-Men: First Class.The movie follows Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) during his pre-X-men days. He and his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber), both immortal mutants with amazing healing powers, spent most of their lives fighting in major wars (the civil war, WWI, WWII, Vietnam) before settling in a secret military group, led by William Stryker (Danny Huston), which goal was to supposedly fight for American interests. During one routine mission in Africa, Logan is disgusted by the groups' methods of persuasion and decides to leave them. But, several years later, his past comes back to haunt him.There are several things very wrong with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First of them being the serious lack of any kind of coherent, noteworthy plot. The movie is packed with (PG-13) action sequences every five minutes or so, which does get pretty boring very fast; and there is no real dramatic conflict to back those action sequences up. Not only is the plot not satisfactory, but the portrayal of the mutant Deadpool, isn't either. Deadpool, a fan favorite, made his big screen debut in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but in his case the source material is completely disregarded – he is nothing like his comic book counterpart – and as a result, his character is inane.It's a shame Deadpool was portrayed the way he was since he was played by Ryan Reynolds, an actor many people agree is the perfect choice for playing Deadpool. However, not every casting choice in the movie was as good as this one. For some reason, the singer of Black Eyed Peas, will.i.am, was in the movie and was awful at playing the mutant John Wraith; and the brilliant Brian Cox, in spite of being interested in doing so, isn't in the movie reprising his role of William Stryker. Instead, he is replaced by the charmless Danny Huston. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber are good as mutant brothers (especially Jackman who, after all, is a veteran in his role), but that isn't enough to keep this movie from falling apart.Rating: 5/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",5,0,1,23 May 2014
The Others," Pass the Popcorn review
","The Others is a psychological horror movie directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar, and it's his first English language movie. Amenábar is a director, actor and a composer. He wrote the screenplays for five of his movies, and composed the majority of the soundtracks. The Others was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, which is pretty rare for a horror movie. As a big fan of ghost movies, I consider this movie to be a masterpiece.On a huge estate, in an always darkened house – darkened because of the two of her photosensitive children – lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), the mother of a boy and a girl whose husband hasn't returned from war in the past year and a half. As a very religious person, Grace insists on her children's religious education, teaches them about God's morals and reads verses from the Bible. Because of her inability to conduct all of the house work, she employs three workers who should help her with the children and around the house. Since she has a heavy rheumatic disease, Grace keeps silence in the house, but it is one day disrupted by piano sounds, children's cries and sounds of footsteps. Her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) tries to convince her and her brother that she frequently sees a little boy, Victor (Alexander Vince), and his family, but Grace blames the workers for everything that's happening.The Others has a very good atmosphere because of the creepy soundtrack (present in all tense situations), the old house in which many families have lived, the constant fog and the isolation from every form of civilization. Despite the fact that there are not many jump scares and blood, the tension is still present and it's created mainly by making the house dark (the curtains are always closed) and silent. Nicole Kidman, in spite of being reluctant to accept the role, since before this she was working on Moulin Rouge!, turned out to be excellent in the horror genre. She amazingly portrayed hysteria, as well as kindness to her folks, and her facial expression freezes one's blood (like in the scene where she starts finding out the truth). The movie is dominated by the opposition between the guessing what could be going on, the religious beginning and the overall thematic – and what's really going on, and the sudden annihilation of the aforementioned.The role of the children in the movie was very big and very successful. Their regular conflicts about their mother and father create drama and tension. The character who leads the audience, and the other characters, to the discovery of what's happening, is nurse Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who tells Anne that she trusts her and that she also feels the presence of the boy Victor. She also tries to convince Grace of the existence of the supernatural. As a remark, I'd say the character of Charles Stewart (Christopher Eccleston) felt unnecessary – he has no impact on the rest of the characters or the overall plot. The movie's ending is exceptional and is worth every minute of the movie's duration. The movie doesn't want to leave the revelation to the very end – instead, the truth is progressively exposed throughout the movie, but still manages to lead to an unexpected finale. The Others, despite not being a movie that will haunt your dreams for weeks, manages to keep its quality and level of creepiness with every subsequent watch. A definite recommendation!

About Time," Pass the Popcorn review
","Richard Curtis, the director and writer of About Time, is a well-known screenwriter, whose most famous scripts include those for the Bridget Jones movies, for Love Actually and for Notting Hill – so you kind of know what to expect from him already: a cute and funny romantic comedy, but no Oscar bait. About Time, I think, tries to be something more than a romantic comedy, and in a way it manages to do so: it's not only about a relationship between a man and a woman, there is also the love for family members. Unfortunately, this movie fails in creating any drama – it's more like watching a compilation of images from someone's life – and in this aspect it should have just sticked to the romantic comedy genre.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) lives an almost ideal life with his almost perfect family: the only thing he's missing is a girlfriend. But when his father (Bill Nighy), on Tim's 21st birthday, reveals to him that all male members of their family can travel back in time, he decides to use this ability to find a girlfriend. He moves to London, gets a job and meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), with whom he falls in love, one evening in a café. He discovers that changing the course of events by going back in time has major consequences, not all of which are pleasant. Therefore, he must decide what is more important, and realise that the ability to travel back in time perhaps isn't that much of an advantage.It's impossible not to notice similarities with other movies, especially with the anime The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but that's a good thing. The main problem with this movie, like I already said, is the fact that there is no real story, no drama, no problems that last till the end of the movie and our heroes have to resolve. For example, after he finds Mary and gets her number, he has to go back in time to help a friend – and ends up never meeting her. This story, his searching for the girl of his dreams, could have been stretched out to last an hour and a half, but instead the issue is resolved in ten minutes, and the movie goes on for more than an hour. The main character's sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) is the only one who has constant issues she needs to resolve, but her role is too marginal to be really relevant.The main problem I just explained might as well be the movie's best quality. It is just a collection of segments from someone's life, and almost every segment is positive, which makes it more a therapy than a movie. Most of the time, while watching About Time, you'll find yourself laughing and feeling happy, and once you exit the theater, you'll probably feel satisfied with the life you're leading – which is the message of the movie. The actors, the cinematography and the music help with that: the cast is talented, the scenery beautiful (and mostly shows sunny days or calm nights). One may argue that the movie is too idealistic, that nobody leads such an awesome life in reality. My opinion is that it's not about what happens to you, it's about how you handle it, and the characters in About Time handle it very well.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,2,5,9 December 2013
Don Jon," Pass the Popcorn review
","Don Jon is young actor's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as a director and a writer. I always admired Gordon-Levitt as an actor (in addition to writing and directing Don Jon, he also plays the title role) and I was eager to see how he would handle the director's/writer's chair. And I must say, Gordon-Levitt didn't disappoint: Don Jon is a rather sweet and entertaining movie that deals with the sensitive subject of pornography – a subject you'll won't see frequently tackled in mainstream movies. I wouldn't go as far as to call Don Jon a revolutionary movie, but it definitely is a fresh movie that deserves to be watched.The movie is about Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), called The Don because of his success with the ladies, who enjoys several things in his life – his friends, his family, training in the gym, going to church and, of course, the ladies. Bust most of all, Jon likes pornography, he even explains how he prefers porn to real sex; he watches it daily and is, what you might call, a porn addict. One night, at a club, he meets the beautiful Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), whom he describes as a 'dime', and soon starts a relationship with. The problem with Barbara is that she dislikes men who watch porn. Jon has no choice but to simultaneously maintain his relationship and his porn watching habits, because he doesn't want to give up either.The thing I like the most about Don Jon is how it deals with 'taboos' in a genuine, intelligent way – and because of that it somewhat reminds me of Kevin Smith's 1997 classic Chasing Amy. Like it or not, porn plays a role in almost every man's life and will – sooner or later – be the topic of a discussion in a relationship. Don Jon deals with this topic in a very mature way. It shows that too much porn can cause the developing of unrealistic expectations in a young man, as well as other things (like romantic movies) which, if consumed in excessive amounts, can lead to unrealistic expectations. The movie deals with this topic in a very subtle and appealing way, and it may be considered a relationship study. However, due to the nature of its topic, the movie is written exclusively from a man's perspective, and it might not be as entertaining for the female audience as it is for the male audience.Overall, it seems to me that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was able to achieve the hat-trick of movie making with Don Jon. His screenplay is fresh and intriguing, his acting is top-notch and even his directing style is interesting and captivating. The rest of the cast – especially the female leads Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore – are charming as ever, and Tony Danza is great as the, arguably, funniest character in the movie – Jon's dad, also called Jon. In spite of not being a full blown comedy, Don Jon is a movie that will definitely put a smile on your face. With directing and writing Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showed he is not just a talented actor, and I can't wait for him to direct more movies.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,9,14,16 November 2013
X-Men," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Undoubtedly, we live in the golden age of superhero movies – in the last several years, there have been more superhero movies than ever and the majority of them were big box office successes. And the movie which is almost solely responsible for this current situation – the movie because of which the superhero movie fad reemerged, after it nearly died in the 90s – is Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000). In spite of being considered a low budget movie in the summer blockbuster season, 'X-Men' managed to earn almost $300 million world wide, thus spawning more movies in the franchise and making way for other superhero movies. In its own way, 'X-Men' played an important role in cinematic history.Set in the near future, 'X-Men' follows mutants (extraordinary individuals with superhuman powers) in their plight to be accepted by the human race. There are two notable fractions among the mutants: The X-Men, led by the peaceful, intelligent Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the Brotherhood of Mutants, who operate as terrorists, and are led by the brilliant, but vengeful Magneto (Ian McKellen). Two mutants – Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a former military personnel who can't remember his past, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a confused teenager – get caught up in the rivalry between the fractions.'X-Men' works both as a decent action-drama movie and a superhero movie. What differentiates 'X-Men' from other superhero movies is how seriously it deals with its source materials and topics – the topics of homosexuality, racism and even America's fear of communism. In the hands of another director, 'X-Men' could have been nothing more than a generic mindless action movie, but in the hands of Bryan Singer (himself a homosexual), who also worked on the movie as a writer, 'X-Men' definitely stands out among other superhero movies/franchises. Although it deals with serious topics, 'X-Men' never comes off as preachy; it equally portrays two legitimate, opposing views – that of Charles Xavier and that of Magneto. In spite of Magneto being the movie's bad guy, he makes some interesting remarks about the nature of humans, and the audience can easily side with him morally (which is unquestionably a sign of a well written villain). Casting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in their respective roles of Charles Xavier and Magneto was a genius move, since both of them give magnificent, memorable performances. The then actor newcomer, Hugh Jackman, doesn't fall behind in his most iconic role to date – that of Logan aka Wolverine.Unfortunately, not everyone in the movie was on the same acting level as McKellen/Stewart. Especially not Halle Berry, whose acting was clingy and awkward, and created a very unnatural Storm. To her defense, she did have possibly the worst lines of dialogue in the movie (especially the infamous 'you know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightning' line), but she still was the weakest link in the acting crew. And speaking of dialogue, it seemed like throughout the movie the dialogue slowly started deteriorating, with the dialogue in the movie's third act being sub par to the rest of the dialogue in the movie. In addition to that, 'X-Men' clearly could have benefited from a bigger budget since some of the action sequences in the movie were oddly executed. Luckily for the audience, the sequel, X2, learned from its predecessor's mistakes and was an even better movie.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,1,2,23 May 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Captain America: The First Avenger was somewhat strange – it combined an interesting origin story with goofy plot elements and dumb action sequences. In the world of superhero movies, there is an unofficial rule that the sequel is better than the first movie. Luckily, this is the case with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Not only is 'The Winter Soldier' clearly superior to 'The First Avenger', but this movie is also (arguably), for now, the best movie in the Phase 2 of Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't as good as everyone makes it out to be (it currently has pretty high ratings on both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes).The movie follows Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) as he tries to find his place in the modern world, and that definitely isn't easy for him – the world clearly changed and even S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't what it used to be. He is most worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s project Insight, which is basically a plan to launch 3 next generation Helicarriers to the sky to neutralize, from above, any possible threat. The situation gets more complicated when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gets attacked in broad daylight, and Steve Rogers doesn't know who to trust anymore – could it be that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised? Of all the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier feels the least like a superhero movie. There's a certain James Bond/spy movie vibe to it, and Kevin Feige, the movie's producer and President of Marvel Studios, went as far as to describe it as 'a 1970s political thriller masquerading as a big superhero movie'. In spite of being described as a '1970′s political thriller', 'The Winter Soldier' is still a relevant movie, in the way that it deals with some major recent events (the post 9/11 world and WikiLeaks). This new direction in Marvel movies is definitely a brave one and should definitely be applauded.Visually, the movie looks great, which could be explained by another novelty in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – the use of visual effects is reduced to the minimum (which was the decision of the movie's directors, the Russo brothers). The action sequences are well shot and edited and rank amongst the best ones I've seen in Marvel movies. As for the actors in the movie, some of them played their characters so many times now, they need no special analyzing (Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson & Scarlett Johansson), and the newcomers did a satisfying job – Robert Redford was believable as Alexander Pierce, Anthony Mackie's The Falcon was nicely introduced and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier was alright (despite he doesn't really play that important a role for someone who has his name appearing in the movie title).Even though Captain America: The Winter Soldier does many things right, it still suffers from the same flaw many movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe do: the villains are not that good. By now, 9 movies have been released in the MCU, all of them producing only one memorable villain – Loki. The villains in Captain America: The Winter Soldier are forgettable at worst, and average at best. Not that a movie necessarily needs a great villain to be great itself, but it definitely helps if the audience has an interesting villain to help them sit through the movie (with its runtime of 136 minutes, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the second longest movie in the MCU, which is a little too much for a solo superhero movie). Also, as the movie progresses, it gets increasingly worse, with its action packed third act suffering from some ridiculous elements. Undoubtedly, all these elements – the bland villains, the runtime, the inconsistent quality – are precisely what keeps Captain America: The Winter Soldier from reaching its full potential.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,0,1,4 April 2014
Pacific Rim," Pass the Popcorn review
","When I was much younger than I am today, I played a certain PlayStation 2 game named War of the Monsters, in which giant monsters fight each other. The game, despite lacking intelligence, was extremely fun and enjoyable. When I heard Guillermo del Toro was making a blockbuster movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters, I instantly thought of War of the Monsters, and I must admit, I was skeptical. But, at the same time I knew that the only person that could pull off a movie like this was del Toro – the genius behind great movies like Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2. The final result certainly wasn't awful, but it wasn't amazing either.Pacific Rim's plot is set in a not so distant future in which giant monsters named Kaijus start coming out of the Pacific and attacking major cities world wide. Humanity, as a response, creates giant robots named Jaegers, which need to be piloted by two people, to fight off the creatures. This method seems efficient at first, but eventually more menacing monsters emerge and slowly start destroying the Jaegers. In such a defeat, our main character Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) loses his co-pilot and brother Yanci (Diego Klattenhoff). This tragic loss forces him to retire from piloting Jaegers. But obviously, in a not so unpredictable turn of events, he starts piloting Jaegers again, aided by a new copilot – a young Asian woman named Mako Mori who seeks revenge against the Kaijus.In a big blockbuster 'robots vs monsters' movie like this one, many people were afraid of how del Toro would deal with the human aspect of the movie, so let's get that out of the way first. The human aspect of the movie is satisfying. Of course, it's not spectacular but it's developed just enough not to make you bored during the pauses between the action scenes. The main character Raleigh Becket is somewhat bland and one-dimensional and the actor who plays him, the anonymous Charlie Hunnam, does have clingy acting abilities, but all of that is overshadowed by other characters and actors in the movie. Idris Elba is great as the marshal Stacker Pentecost, Rinko Kikuchi gives a convincing portrayal of Mako Mori and Guilermo del Toro's favorite, Ron Perlman, is terrific in his semi-cameo role. There are also two scientists in the movie – Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) – who were rather interesting and likable. So I'd say the movie tackled the human aspect just fine.Now that we got the human aspect out of the way, let's talk about the real reason why everyone wanted/wants to see this movie – monsters and robots. Both the Kaijus and Jaegers look absolutely amazing. There are several different designs of both these groups of giants, and each one looks amazing and special in its own way. So props to the effect designers/visual designers or whoever actually created and realised the Jeager/Kaiju designs. The action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited. The majority of the action (as you can see in the trailers) takes place in the night time, but it's very effectively actualised so you can properly see everything that's going on. So, regarding the robot/monster aspect of the movie, Pacific Rim is one fun, entertaining and amusing summer blockbuster.Of course, not all in Pacific Rim is milk and honey. The main problem with the movie is that it's too loud and that does get tedious after 2 hours. Buildings being destroyed, metal screeching, monsters shrieking, explosions and other irritating noises are constantly present in Pacific Rim. Because of this, after the movie was over my ears were aching. So, in spite of how fun the movie may seem, I surely won't see it again, at least not on the big screen. The other problem with the movie was the ending, which was underwhelming. The final fight is quite disappointing, considering how other fights in the movie were more engaging. However, I think I would recommend Pacific Rim, especially since it's not like there's something much better currently playing in theaters. But if you want to enjoy your viewing experience even more, I'd advise to bring a pair of earplugs along.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,0,6,13 July 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is hitting the theaters in my country in a few days, so I decided to (mainly because some characters re-appear in the sequel) look back at Captain America: The First Avenger, the last solo Marvel movie that came out before The Avengers. On my first viewing, Captain America: The First Avenger struck me as one of the weakest and most forgettable movies of Marvel Phase I. I hoped my initial impression would change upon this viewing. Unfortunately, it didn't.Set during World War II, the movie follows Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who wants to join the army but is rejected because of his health and physical issues. His luck, however, changes when he meets the mysterious doctor Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who helps Steve join the army despite his disadvantages. During his military training he shows intelligence and bravery, and doctor Erskine enlists him in an experiment, which goal is to create super soldiers. After the experiment is successful, Steve's body completely changes (he gets much taller and stronger), and soon he becomes Captain America.Captain America: The First Avenger can roughly be divided in two parts, with the first one ending when Cap puts on his suit and starts punching Nazis. The first part of the movie, which is almost fully devoid of action sequences, is the origin story and with its interesting character development, setting and plot, is much superior to the second part. Chris Evans (in spite of how silly he looks before the super soldier experiment) is a fantastic choice for Captain America and truly does a remarkable job. Hugo Weaving, who's always great at portraying villains, is (at least before he reveals his true face) good as the movie's bad guy Johann Smith aka Red Skull. The rest of the cast (mainly Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell) don't fall behind these two. During this part, Captain America: The First Avenger is a decent and enjoyable period movie, which sometimes is more than enough to entertain. And then, the second part of the movie happens.The second part of Captain America: The First Avenger is more or less a montage of dumb action sequences, explosions and people killing each other. During this part, the movie's cheesiness becomes apparent and makes the movie look more stupid than it should. Scenes of a ridiculously looking villain (let's face it – no matter how you portray Red Skull, he'll still be somewhat ridiculous) and a ridiculously patriotic protagonist punching each other in the face, while speaking awful lines of dialogue, come almost as an insult after the movie's solid first part. While there is some lighthearted humor here and there, overall the movie should have taken itself less seriously than it did (for the right amount of serious and unserious, look at the first Iron Man movie). By taking some of its silly elements too seriously (the Red Skull, the Hydra, the patriotism) and by having too many action sequences tightly packed, the movie overall undermines its full potential and it ends up being forgettable and of rather poor quality.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6,0,2,2 April 2014
American Hustle," Pass the Popcorn review
","American Hustle is the fictionalized retelling of the real-life FBI operation called 'ABSCAM', which ran during the late 70s/early 80s, and which result was the conviction of one U.S. senator and six members of the U.S. House of Representatives – they were sentenced for accepting bribes from a FBI agent who was posing as a sheikh. During the investigation, the FBI were aided by a convicted con artist, named Melvin Weinberg. A film adaptation of this event was originally planned in the early 80s, but it failed to reach the big screen up until 2013, when David O. Russell sat in the director's chair and gave the world a very loose adaptation of the story – so loose that the opening title card in the movie says only that 'some of this actually happened'.Set in the late 70s, American Hustle follows a pair of con artists/lovers – Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) – who ran a small con operation. One day they get arrested by the FBI and are soon given a choice, by the young and idealistic agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Copper), who says he'll let them go, if they help him perform 4 white collar busts. Irving and Sydney reluctantly accept their offer, and make a plan which involves a made up Arab sheikh, and which will hopefully attract other con artists for DiMaso to arrest.American Hustle is like a postcard from the golden age of Hollywood, it reeks of old Scorsese movies (Goodfellas comes to mind first), and while others may consider American Hustle a rip off because of this, I found this movie to be a stylish, beautiful throwback to a time when mainstream movies were somewhat better than today. In this movie, the director David O. Russell collaborates with almost everyone he has collaborated before: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred in his critically acclaimed, but in my opinion somewhat flawed, Silver Linings Playbook, and Christian Bale and Amy Adams starred in The Fighter. These casting choices are amazing, since everyone fits their characters and roles perfectly. Christian Bale, who has (once again) undergone incredible body transformations in preparation for his role, is memorable and great as the con artist Irving Rosenfeld; Bradley Cooper is magnificent in portraying the FBI agent Richie DiMaso and his troubled personality; and Amy Adams is absolutely adorable in the 'double accent/double character' role she plays. Even Jeremy Renner, who had not previously collaborated with Russell, is perfect in portraying the sleazy, but likable Mayor Carmine Polito. Only Jennifer Lawrence's role, that of Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn, didn't really stick with me, since her character seems rather formulaic.In one instance, during the shooting of the movie, David O. Russell said to Christian Bale 'Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it'. Which is a rather strange thing to say since some people, from what I have read on the internet, had problems with the characters themselves, meaning they couldn't engage with them. And I must say – that is very true, sometimes it is hard to empathize with the characters (since all of them have some distinct unlikeable traits) and this may be a problem for some people because the movie is over two hours long. As for me, I haven't had such problems, but I still disagree with Mr. Russell, since I am all about the style and the old school way in which this movie is told, rather than the characters. Although, there is one thing in the movie that left me disappointed, and that was the ending, which felt dull and underwhelming. I must say, in the end, I felt somewhat hustled.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,1,4,2 January 2014
Rush," Pass the Popcorn review
","I'm not very keen on Formula 1, so the news of a biopic about the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt didn't strike a nerve. When the trailer for the movie appeared, I was even less eager to watch the actual movie since the trailer wasn't particularly good. Eventually, I did see Rush in a full theater on a Saturday night, and absolutely no one in the audience talked throughout the movie. It seemed that everyone, myself included, was amazed by the movie and enthralled by the story. Rush turned out for me to be one of this year's biggest surprise and, for now, one of the best movies of the year.Rush follows two very different Formula 1 drivers. One is the charming British partyboy/playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and the other is the determined Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). As the voice over – from Lauda's point of view – early in the movie says, he's most famously known for two things – the first being his rivalry with James Hunt and the second being his nearly fatal accident in which his face got severely burned. The movie gives us a little backstory about those men, about their backgrounds, personas and family life, and then spends the remaining time depicting the events that happened in the 1976 Formula 1 season.The best thing about Rush is that it doesn't have any major flaws – it's just a very good movie, as simple as that. Rush is a two men show: Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl make this movie, no other actors or characters other than them are really important to the story. The casting of Hemsworth and Brühl in their respective roles was genius, not only because they look like their real life counterparts, but they feel very natural in their roles and portray their characters with ease. Of course, one may argue that their roles weren't extremely difficult to play, but they do it so believably and smoothly that I think at least one of them may get an Academy Award nomination – if not even both of them. I do hope that this movie introduces Brühl to the mainstream audience some more, since he is a talented actor and it would be great to see him in more mainstream movies.As for the plot of the movie movie itself, I was somewhat suspicious – can a rivalry between two sports figures be fascinating enough for a two-hour-long movie? Fortunately, I was once again taken by surprise. The story depicted in the movie was rather dramatic, inspiring and engaging – it was intriguing to watch two completely different men approach the same dangerous topic (or should I say problem?) of formula racing. So, yes, there is more than enough drama to fill the length of a two-hour movie. Interestingly, the only thing that's lacking in this sport biopic are the scenes of actual sport – there aren't much racing scenes. Those scenes are used selectively and to push drama forward, never to replace the actual drama. And when they were in the movie, you could see they were magnificently shot, with the just right amount of shaky cam. I would expect nothing less than technical perfection from an experienced director like Ron Howard. The soundtrack in the movie was also good – most of it was composed by the great Hans Zimmer. All in all, Rush is a truly excellent movie about an entertaining story and it features brilliant people who know how to do their job.",9,2,3,13 October 2013
Oblivion," Pass the Popcorn review
","If you've seen Oblivion's trailer, you know what to expect, since much of the story is spoiled in it. But the saddest part is, the movie is very predictable even if you haven't seen the trailer - just another Hollywood money-making sci-fi/action product. Except, Oblivion is based on a comic book. At least that's what they want you to believe - the comic book was never published, the director Joseph Kosinski started an illustrated novel and then abandoned the project to work on the movie. He said it was not intended for distribution, only for legal purposes, and Tom Cruise found it interesting.In the year 2077 Earth is uninhabitable, after the nuclear war between humans and aliens known as 'Scavs'. They had destroyed the Moon, which caused natural disasters, and started invading Earth; humans eventually won the war but lost the planet. Some of those who survived are now living in the Tet, a large spaceship orbiting Earth, waiting to go to Titan, Saturn's moon where the rest of humanity is waiting. Jack (Tom Cruise) lives with Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) in a house above the clouds and spends his day repairing drones - Scav killing machines - while she oversees him and communicates with the main commander on Tet. One day, Jack finds Julia (Olga Kurylenko) in a crashed spacecraft, who will make him question everything he thought he knew about himself and the war.If a movie is in the 'science-fiction' genre, I expect it to be at least somewhat accurate about the 'scientific' facts it presents. In Oblivion, Jack and Victoria live in a house above the clouds, and can normally walk around it and even swim in a pool in front of the entrance. They don't seem to mind that they are located in the stratosphere where the air is one thousand times thinner than on Earth and where it's pretty cold. I guess I should forgive the scriptwriter's mistake of considering the Moon's destruction responsible for earthquakes, but it still bothers me. And how can Jack and Victoria believe that, even after Earth was destroyed, humans managed to build their house, the Tet, those giant water-sucking machines and the drones? How could people possibly live on one of Saturn's moons if they had not made it habitable before? And they had only 60 years to do so. I suppose I'm nitpicking, but all these inconsistencies ruined the movie for me.Also, the movie is way too long. Not much happens in the first half an hour, it is basically just made of shots of the destroyed Earth and remains of the American civilization (because nobody else matters in Hollywood). Although, I must admit, the cinematography in this part is good. Unfortunately, it doesn't make Oblivion any less boring. Furthermore, the special effects are also good - but with a $120 million budget and being a Sci-Fi movie, they can't be bad. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is bad. The scene when Jack and Victoria swim in the pool at night is romantic and sexy, but the music doesn't fit that mood at all. And then there's Ramble On by Led Zeppelin, probably put in the movie to show us that Jack/Tom Cruise is one cool guy. I should also mention Morgan Freeman, the exposition man, who was probably cast just because he has a nice voice and was supposed to explain the story. The other actors did a good job as well, I suppose, but their performances won't be particularly remembered: Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko does an unimpressive job, Andrea Riseborough is the best of the three. Interestignly, Kosinski only directed another movie - TRON: Legacy - which reminds of Oblivion: great visual effects but poor storytelling. I surely hope he won't continue making this kind of movies, since he seems to be on bad terms with science fiction.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",5,5,10,12 April 2013
Man of Steel," Pass the Popcorn review
","To be honest, I'm not very keen on Superman as a character, nor am I keen on his movies. I didn't particularly enjoy Richard Donner's classic 1978 Superman nor the 1980 sequel (however, I did immensely enjoy General Zod as the villain in the sequel) – I didn't like how they wanted to be 'funny' and 'witty', and just ended up being juvenile. And don't get me started on the awful movie that is Superman Returns. So yes, my experience with the Superman movies wasn't a very pleasurable one. But, when I heard the franchise was getting a reboot, and that this time the movie will feel more serious and darker, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, bad reviews started pouring in eventually and, as a result, Man of Steel received a pretty bad rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I feared that Man of Steel would be another big superhero movie let down. I was wrong.The story of this movie is very familiar, but in case you don't know: Jor-El (Russell Crowe), in the midst of the destruction of his planet Krypton, sends his newborn son Kal-El to Earth. There Kal-El gets adopted by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner), and they name him Clark. When he grows up, Clark (Henry Cavill), since he has super powers, chooses to help humanity. Soon after he puts on the Superman suit and cape, a threat to humanity rises in the form of General Zod (Micahel Shannon) – a genocidal maniac from Krypton. Some other important characters that appear in the movie are Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and her boss Perry (Laurence Fishburne). As you may notice, this is a great cast. Actually, I've never seen such combined star power in a superhero movie. And all of them are good. Especially Henry Cavill, who shines as the title character.Bottom line, Man of Steel isn't a bad movie, it has amazing visuals and good action scenes. Most of the origin story is told in the form of flashbacks, which is always an interesting narrative device. The movie features a ton of interesting and creative Kryptonian technology so the movie's Sci-Fi aspect is also satisfying. As I said, the actors really do a good job. Michael Shannon is effective as the menacing General Zod, even though Terence Stamp's portrayal in Superman 2 is somewhat better. Henry Cavill is amazing as Superman, although we will have to wait until the sequel to see him portray Clark Kent as an inept Daily Planet journalist. Kevin Costner is another decent actor, but he has very little screen time – which is slightly disappointing since the relationship between his character and Henry Cavill's character had a lot of potential. Because of its strong actors, nice visual effects and action scenes, Man of Steel is one summer blockbuster that is worth your money.Of course, that doesn't mean the movie is without problems. The directing of the movie bothered me mostly – unnecessary shaky cam, quick cuts and strange zoom-ins are what Zack Snyder decided to use in his vision of Superman. And, of course, Man of Steel is yet another Superman movie with its runtime of over 2 hours. That wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't for the tedious second half which is made of one action scene after another. I mean, they do look amazing but after some time you kind of get sick of them. However, that doesn't excuse the awful rating this movie got on Rotten Tomatoes. So ignore the critics, go watch this movie and enjoy yourself. Man of Steel is the best Superman movie so far – although, unfortunately, this isn't saying much.Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",7,0,3,16 June 2013
We're the Millers," Pass the Popcorn review
","Here's something I never thought I'd see again: a funny modern comedy. Because of the horrendous Movie 43 and all those Adam Sandler shits everyone seems to love, mainstream comedy is a genre I'd suggest to avoid, even if it has an amazing cast - unless it was filmed at least 20 years ago. But We're the Millers, surprisingly, manages to be an exception and makes you laugh easily. Even though its director isn't well known, and the cast features only a few famous actors, We're the Millers shows filmmakers something they should never have forgotten: to make a great comedy it really takes nothing else than good jokes and a good script. Are you taking notes, Adam Sandler? David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is a successful pot dealer who, one evening, is robbed of all his drugs and money. The next day he's kidnapped and brought to Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), a rich drug lord whom David owes money. Brad forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to erase his debt. Realising him going alone would cause suspicion, David convinces a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a young runaway (Emma Roberts) and his teenage neighbor (Will Poulter) to come along and pretend to be his wife and kids.The premise of this movie is pretty obvious and not too original: it's about a dysfunctional (and, in this case, fake) family in which everyone hates each other until they end up realising they are almost perfect for each other. You also learn that 'all you need is love' and 'no one likes to be alone' and all that sentimental stuff. But, interestingly, We're the Millers succeeds in making something so obvious come up as fresh and new. Even though we know that will happen - it must, it's a comedy! - this doesn't make the movie boring or predictable. This might sound contradictory, but the only thing you really do see coming is the happy end, and that's just because We're the Millers follows the standard comedy pattern - as it should. This again confirms what I said before: to make a good comedy you just need a good script and good jokes. And the jokes are good - unexpectedly, since they are mostly based on dirty words and slapstick humour.The characters are very well developed and work good together. Although Jennifer Aniston is way more famous than anyone else in this movie, you never think of that, as the movie doesn't focus on her, and consequently doesn't forget there are other, equally important characters in this movie. This also helps turn the protagonists themselves into good jokes: sure, they are somewhat stereotyped, but in a truly funny way. Ed Helms is fantastic as the rich and spoiled drug lord, even though he gets little screen time: you hate him as soon as he opens his mouth! Emma Roberts as the angry teenager, and Will Poulter as the 18 year-old who's never been kissed, are both remarkable. As you can easily understand, the movie's best quality is the ability to make old, stereotyped, already-seen humour funny again. Do not trust the cocky, wannabe-intellectual critics on Rotten Tomatoes and their bad ratings - this is truly a movie worth seeing that will make you laugh!Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,1,3,4 September 2013
Divergent," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Divergent is yet another bestselling novel I've never heard about, and part of yet another young adult trilogy, by yet another female writer (Veronica Roth) I've, again, never heard about. Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",5,12,20,31 March 2014
Ender's Game," Pass the Popcorn review
","Ender's Game is a movie based on the novel of the same name, written in 1985 by Orson Scott Card, which is supposed to be extremely popular, but I hadn't heard of it until I saw the trailer for the movie – and therefore, I didn't manage to read the novel. Many say the movie is awful, in comparison to the novel, and are also boycotting it because of Orson Scott Card's opposition to gay marriage, and homosexuality in general. I didn't know about this controversy either, but it's obviously a difficult issue to resolve: can we separate the author from its work? And since the movie isn't exactly/only Card's work, should we boycott it? And since nobody seems to have boycotted the books, wouldn't boycotting the movie be hypocritical? Finally, since the movie doesn't deal with homosexuality at all, wouldn't the boycott be pointless? I'm absolutely for gay rights and marriage, but I don't think it's reasonable to boycott this movie.In the future, Earth was attacked by an alien race known as Formics, and it was saved only thanks to the International Fleet Commander, Mazer Rackham's sacrifice during battle. After the aliens were driven away, the International Military started training the best children on the planet for the (supposed) next Formic attack. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited, one evening, by the prestigious Battle School, where he starts training with other children and young adults, under the ever-watching eyes of Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis), a gentle soul who seems to be the only person to consider the recruits what they are – just children.I should start by saying that the trailer for this movie is one of the worst ever: it makes you want to just skip this movie, and it makes the movie itself look awful and boring. The only positive thing it does to you is that, when you actually see the movie, you're pleasantly surprised. Ender's Game deals with tough topics, like violence, relationships among people, war and human psychology. Ender doesn't think it makes any sense to attack the Formics if they are not attacking Earth, and yet keeps on kicking people after he's won the fight with them and they are just lying on the floor – 'to prevent them from attacking again'. He's constantly reminded of this contradiction by the ruthless Colonel Graff and often fights him because of his views on war. The movie has managed to explore this topic in a very good way, which should be praised: it's not just another pointless Sci-Fi, and it's not for children (only).The main character is played by Asa Butterfield, whom you might remember as the character Hugo in the extremely successful movie of the same name. Here, he delivers another great performance and carries the whole story masterfully. Harrison Ford is a very good sometimes-antagonist, and can be truly difficult to take sides when his and Asa's characters fight. It's also interesting to get Viola Davis' character's view on the whole thing – as I said before, she sees the recruits as just children who can't psychologically take the war, and often confronts Colonel Graff about this. The CGI is excellent in this movie, but the thing that I liked the most is that the movie isn't CGI-focused. Most of it happens inside a space ship, and the few views of space and Earth that we get are wonderful. The only downside of the movie happens in the end, but there's no point in spoiling that. All in all, Ender's Game is a movie that will satisfy your need for a smart Sci-Fi, if you decide to see it.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,2,6,3 November 2013
Face_Off," Pass the Popcorn review
","Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers – both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers.Face/Off is a story about two men – one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma – but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) – and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse.The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed.Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8,1,2,19 July 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Rebooting the Spider-Man franchise just five years after Spider-Man 3 may initially seem like a pretty pointless and unusual thing to do. However, when you take in mind the Sony-Marvel contract, which mandates Sony to make a Spider-Man movie every five years or they lose the rights over the characters, the picture becomes clearer. Originally, Spider-Man 4 was planned, but there were some creative differences between Sam Raimi and the studio, so he pulled out of the project, and Sony ultimately decided to reboot the whole franchise. Considering how awful Spider-Man 3 was, the reboot idea doesn't seem that bad anymore, but The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't offer anything new and it still feels pointless.In case you don't know – the movie follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a teenager whose parents mysteriously left him when he was a young child and who now lives with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and aunt May (Sally Field). One day he learns of a doctor named Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who worked with his father, and decides to visit him at his workplace – Oscorp. There Peter gets bitten by a strange spider and soon develops spider-like abilities and uses them to become a superhero named Spider-Man. He meets his first villain when Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with mutagen chemicals and becomes the menacing Lizard.The Amazing Spider-Man definitely isn't a terrible movie: the casting and the acting are great – Andrew Garfield is a very believable Spider-Man, and the always likable Emma Stone is superb as his love interest Gwen Stacy, and they have a lot of chemistry. The action sequences and the visual effects are decent: they are by no means superb, but are exciting enough for a generic superhero popcorn movie flick. And the director, Marc Webb (who never directed a big blockbuster movie before), did a satisfying job. Furthermore, the movie is darker and more brooding than Sam Raimi's trilogy (actually, the movie is more similar to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy than to Raimi's movies), which works surprisingly well.Even though The Amazing Spider-Man has some strong points, the movie utterly fails script wise. The movie spends a big chunk of its over 2 hours runtime on a origin story which the audience is already familiar with. Not only that, but all the characters in the movie are conveniently tied to one another in an absurdly naive fashion. Moreover, some scenes are ludicrous (Peter not being able to control his powers and the infamous cranes scene). Because of that, The Amazing Spider-Man can get both tedious and silly from time to time, which may severely annoy some viewers. And speaking of silly, The Lizard design could have been improved to some degree (he should at least have kept his lab coat on!). In a nutshell, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't as bad as it could have been, but it still is a pretty dull and pointless movie which offers nothing new to justify the reboot.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6,2,5,21 April 2014
The Lego Movie," Pass the Popcorn! review
","To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it.  The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders.  Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities.  The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.

Dallas Buyers Club," Pass the Popcorn review
","Dallas Buyers Club is a low budget biographical movie, portraying the life of Ron Woodroof, a Dallas electrician who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986 and who soon after that started the 'Dallas Buyers Club' – a club made exclusively for people diagnosed with AIDS who paid a fixed membership fee and in return got as much experimental drugs (that were also unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration) as they needed. At some point in the development of the movie, first Brad Pitt and afterwards Ryan Gosling, were attached to play Ron Woodroof, but the role finally went to Matthew McConaughey – which turned out to be a magnificent casting choice, but I'll get to that in a minute.The movie opens with Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) engaged in activities he likes best – having sex with women, doing drugs and watching bull riding. However, his life soon takes an unexpected turn when he has an accident on his job, ends up in a hospital and is there informed by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) and Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) that he has AIDS and will die in 30 days. He doesn't believe them at first, but when he starts feeling more and more sick, he decides he will do anything to survive, including starting the aforementioned Buyers Club.Despite being a movie based on a real life story that deals with difficult topics, like living with AIDS, fighting the 'system' (FDA) and fighting for survival, Dallas Buyers Club is a surprisingly funny movie. The movie works both as a depiction of a real life drama and a black comedy - much of the humor comes from Ron's interaction with his transgender friend Rayon (Jared Leto) - and I enjoyed both of these aspects equally. Matthew McConaughey is an experienced actor in both this genres and he was the perfect choice for the role of Ron Woodroof. His performance was absolutely amazing and I think it's safe to say he will be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. And speaking of Academy Awards – Jared Leto is amazing as Rayon and I wouldn't be shocked if he got more recognition, in form of a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I'm not much of a Jared Leto fan, but I must admit he was incredible in the movie.Of course, not everyone in the movie was as good as McCounaughey and Leto. And with that, I mainly mean Jennifer Garner, who was just bleak and underwhelming as Dr. Eve Saks, and personally I wouldn't have minded if her character had been completely cut out of the movie. Actually, both her character and Jared Leto's character Rayon were made up exclusively for the movie (which is rather obvious since they fall into stereotypical Hollywood character clichés) but while Rayon's character and his relationship with Ron works and is somewhat plausible, the character of Eve was the movie's third wheel. However, McCounaughey and Leto have more than enough charisma to make Dallas Buyers Club a very pleasant and funny experience.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,2,3,5 January 2014
Now You See Me," Pass the Popcorn review
","Now You See Me is the newest movie directed by Louis Leterrier, the man who brought us mainly mindless action movies like The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans and Transporter 1 & 2, which is interesting since all the trailers presented Now You See Me as a movie that strives to become something more than a mindless action movie - they presented it as a somewhat intelligent crime/thriller movie. But, hey, even the movie itself says 'come in close, because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you'. And that's what happened, I saw the trailers and thought I will be seeing an intelligent crime/thriller movie; and I was fooled. Instead I got a boring, fairly mindless movie with some, clearly, needlessly long action scenes.Let me start of with the plot first. So, what is Now You See Me about? I could say that Now You See Me is a movie about 4 magicians called the 4 horsemen - consisting of J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) whose magic acts are a front for robberies, and try to escape an FBI agent who is after them. I could also say that Now You See Me is about an FBI agent named Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who, aided by an Interpol agent named Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), is trying to catch these magicians. I could even go as far as to say the movie is about an ex-magician named Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who tries to expose these 4 magicians and make money off of it. Furthermore, there is Michael Caine somewhere in the equation.I really applaud the movie for assembling such a great cast (maybe the best cast I've seen in a while), however Now You See Me's greatest merit is its greatest flaw. There are just too many characters in the movie, and none of them get enough screen time. Moreover, there are too many subplots, and the movie constantly changes its focus. Who are we, the audience, supposed to root for? For the magicians to succeed in their plans? For the agents to catch the magicians? For Morgan Freeman to reveal the magicians? As a result of these rapid focus changes and the undeveloped characters I completely lost my interest for the movie half way through. Which is a shame, since the majority of the cast are wonderful actors who could have shined in their roles - had they only had something to work with. Eisenberg and Harrelson have no chemistry whatsoever nor do they share much screen time, in spite of the superb chemistry they showed in Zombieland. The only pair that's worse than them are Laurent and Ruffalo, who are awkwardly forced into a romantic subplot.Of course, if you don't care about the characters and just want to see some pretty good scenes with amazing magic tricks (which were the best part of the movie), a somewhat decent and original story and obligatory car chase scenes, knock yourself out! Your money will be definitely well spent if you're not looking for anything more than a forgetfully fun movie. As for myself, I think the movie's title - Now You See Me - is pretty fitting. This is, hopefully, the only time I'm seeing this movie and never again. Since I don't want to get fooled again.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",6,1,4,28 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Pass the Popcorn! review
","X-Men: First Class was a successful movie and a most needed breath of fresh air in the franchise, but everyone knew that the X-Men franchise would be getting its real rebirth once Bryan Singer returned in the director's chair. It took over 10 years, but Bryan Singer finally returned with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which isn't the best X-men movie there is (X2 is still holding that title), but is damn near being so. X-Men: Days of Future Past is the first movie in the franchise that introduces a time traveling element in the plot, in an attempt to fix any continuity errors between X-Men: First Class and the rest of the franchise.In the future, the world has been torn apart by a war between the mutants and Sentinels (giant robots made for killing mutants). In a desperate attempt, the last several surviving mutants send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), because that event apparently triggered the mutant/Sentinel war. But Wolverine can't find Mystique alone – he needs help from the younger versions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). However, Charles Xavier is addicted to a medicine that helps him walk, but makes him lose his mutant powers, and Magneto is locked up in a super secret prison below the Pentagon.The plot Days of Future Past isn't a rather simple one – the movie occasionally shifts focus from the past to the future and back again. The plot is mostly described through exposition, in form of dialogue between characters. The quality of these expository dialogues isn't always that good; especially in the beginning of the movie, when the characters explain to the audience the whole back story in 30 seconds flat. Nonetheless, after getting by that forced exposition, the movie suddenly starts being quite enjoyable, fun and interesting. Days of Future Past is possibly the funniest X-Men movie there is, filled with pleasant characters (Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, stands out the most), great action sequences, and numerous amusing references to other movies in the franchise.All the actors in the movie, with a few exceptions, are comfortable in their roles and are as good as ever (after all – the majority of them portrayed these characters at least once before). The exceptions to this rule are Ellen Page and Jennifer Lawrence. Ellen Page, in spite of having a very short screen time, is very unconvincing in her role; and Jennifer Lawrence is unusually wooden, which is a shame since she is the almost sole cast member who has won an Oscar. Thankfully, there is much going on in the movie, so it's not like their performances badly hurt Days of Future Past. On the contrary, the movie could actually be hurt by its third act which doesn't feel like a real finale. Instead, it is a very mild ending to a highly entertaining movie.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,1,2,25 May 2014
Spirited Away," Pass the Popcorn review
","Spirited Away is one of the most famous Japanese animes in the Western world. It became the first anime to be nominated for and to win an Oscar in 2003 for Best Animated Feature. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, had considered retiring from directing after finishing Princess Mononoke in 1997, but was fortunately inspired to make this movie after meeting a friend's daughter.Chihiro (voice: Rumi Hiiragi) and her parents are driving to their new home when they take a wrong turn and end up in front of a tunnel in the middle of a forest. They decide to go in, and on the other side they find a street with lots of closed restaurants - apart from one, which is deserted but filled with food. Chihiro's parents start eating while she wanders around and finds a boy, Haku (voice: Miyu Irino), on a bridge in front of a bathhouse. He tells her to leave, so Chihiro goes back to her parents, and finds that they have turned into pigs. Dark spirits start appearing, and she tries to run back to where she came from, but can't because a great river blocks her way. Haku finds her and urges her to go ask Kamaji (voice: Bunta Sugawara), the boiler man, for a job, or else Yubaba (voice: Mari Natsuki), the witch that rules the bathhouse, will turn her into a pig too. Claiming he has all the help he needs, Kamaji sends Chihiro to Yubaba. Yubaba, reluctantly, decides to keep Chihiro as a worker in the bathhouse (whose guests are gods) and deprives her of her name, so that she can never go back home.First of all, this cartoon is beautiful. Even if you don't enjoy the story, you'll be captivated by all the colors, the different characters, the landscapes. Everything is kept simple while put in a surreal, dream-like environment. Being a Japanese anime, this is not meant (only) for children: one of the many contemplated themes is how the rapidly growing sex industry in Japan negatively affects young children - we discover that the bathhouse is basically a brothel, and that Yubaba means 'hot water old woman', and that a strange creature named No Face wanted to 'buy' Chihiro with the gold he was offering her. Another important theme is ecology: the director Miyazaki once participated in the cleansing of a river, from which he removed a bicycle. In the anime, Chihiro helps removing a bicycle and various other objects from a river god. Also, an elaborated subject, very common among Japanese people, is the collapse of their traditional society: the greedy frog that takes gold from No Face is swallowed right after, as a sort of punishment. In order not to perceive this animated movie as an absurd collection of random characters, it should be remembered that it borrows a lot from traditional Japanese folklore, which the Western society is not familiar with.I've noticed a lot of people don't like the English dubbed version. I have seen only the Japanese version, with subtitles, but I would still suggest you do the same. In my opinion, a dubbed movie is always worse than the original, it lacks 'that special something'. And in Spirited Away, the voice actors are amazing: the child characters are actually voiced by children, and an actress who voiced Chihiro's mother actually ate while speaking the dialogue in a scene where her character is eating. All of these little details give so much credibility to the anime, you feel as if you were watching a movie with real people. The soundtrack also helps establishing the amazing atmosphere, and the movie often easily switches from being a children's cartoon to an adult story, with many scary moments. I just think it would have been better if the ending had been a little longer and better developed - it seems a little abrupt.Rating: 8/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",8,0,1,16 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Pass the Popcorn review
","It is no secret that the first Hobbit movie – An Unexpected Journey – was somewhat of a let down. The fact that it makes no sense to create a trilogy from a 300 pages book has often been reasonably ridiculed/criticized, and because of this unorthodox (money grabbing) approach to the source material, An Unexpected Journey suffered from serious pacing problems. And when it didn't suffer from pacing problems, it suffered from poorly executed action scenes which looked like something that came straight out of a video game (the sequences in Goblin Town) and from unrelatable and undeveloped characters. After this disappointment, it was hard to tell what to expect from the second installment in the trilogy – The Desolation of Smaug. After watching The Desolation of Smaug, I can safely say that is, if nothing else, better than it predecessor.The Desolation of Smaug continues where An Unexpected Journey ended. Our party, consisting of thirteen dwarfs + Bilbo (Martin Freeman) & Gandalf (Ian McKellen), are hiding from the orcs and their leader Azog (Manu Bennett). Fortunately, they find a shelter inside a house of a strange being called Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), who is a skin-changer (shape-shifter), and they spend the night there before leaving for the strange mystical forest of Mirkwood, which is nearby. In front of the entrance to the forest, Gandalf leaves the party since he has to tend to more serious business. Without him, the dwarfs + Bilbo enter Mirkwood where more adventures await.Without any exaggerating, I think The Desolation of Smaug is the most beautiful movie in the whole Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit franchise to date. The scenery and the cinematography are breathtakingly astonishing. It's worth to see this movie on the big screen for the imagery alone. Everything is beautiful: from the mountains of Erebor to the haunting city of Lake-town. The Desolation of Smaug is a magnificent example of amazing eye candy. Moreover, the characters in the movie are handled better than in An Unexpected Journey. We see how Thorin's (Richard Armitage) dedication to his goal is slowly taking the best of him, and even the other dwarfs have more screen time and lines of dialogue (mainly Fili, played by Aidan Turner). Of course, I have to mention the dragon Smaug, who is definitely the movie's best aspect. It was worth to sit through almost two whole movies to see that dragon. Benedict Cumberbatch (who also voiced The Necromancer character) did an awesome job at voicing and supplying the motion-capture for the dragon. In addition to all this things, I thoroughly enjoyed the sequences in the 'trippy' forest of Mirkwood, up until the elves arrived.Speaking of elves, they are what nearly ruined the movie for me. Prior to the release of this movie, everyone was wondering how will they deal with the character of Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), a character who was completely made up for the sake of this movie. From my perspective, her character was dealt with rather poorly. She serves no actual purpose, other than being a generic romantic interest, and her whole relationship with Kili was rather cheesy – especially the dialogues. Unfortunately, the problems with elves don't stop here – most action scenes including elves look ridiculously goofy and campy. Furthermore, the character of king Thranduil (Lee Pace), Legolas's father, is as charismatic as a bowl of soup. Apart from the elves, the only major problem I had with the movie is its length and pacing. The Desolation of Smaug handles its pacing much better than An Unexpected Journey did, but I can't shake the feeling the movie would have been even better if it were 20 minutes shorter. However, if you can overlook the flaws I mentioned here, you'll probably enjoy The Desolation of Smaug more than almost every other blockbuster movie released this year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,5,11,13 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Pass the Popcorn review
","The first part of the long-awaited adaptation of Tolkien's The Hobbit came out in December of last year. It obviously made everyone interested and left different impressions. The whole adaptation's a little weird, since there's three movies planned, based on one book that has barely 300 pages, while one part of Lord of the Rings consists of more than 400 pages. So, no need to say that everything's going to be stretched out more than it has to be. The Hobbit also includes information and additions from other books, but that's not enough to create three movies. Imagine if LOTR had three movie adaptations for each book. Funny, right? Money clearly does its work.The story in The Hobbit is a prequel to Lord of the Rings. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), the Hobbit, goes on an adventure with thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and the well known wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), to reclaim the dwarfs' gold and homeland which was destroyed by a dragon called Smaug. This is the most simplified version of the plot. The film starts with old Bilbo (Ian Holm) who starts writing the story based on his adventures that started 60 years ago. It's a really nice beginning and intro to the whole background story that needs to be known in order to understand the plot, so I'll give Jackson an A+ for the beginning.I would also give an A+ to the next scene, which starts with an amazing display of Erebor – the Lonely Mountain and the city of Dale, which lays outside the dwarven kingdom, and which introduces one of the main characters – Thorin Oakenshield. His grandfather, king Thror, rules the Kingdom under the Mountain, which is wealthy and full of gold (who would expect that from dwarfs, eh?). All this gold attracts the dragon, who destroys the kingdom and claims the gold for himself. The film continues with one more scene with old Bilbo, who's remembering how it all started. Gandalf visited him asking if he's interested in going on an adventure, which Bilbo automatically declined. However, his response did not discourage Gandalf from his intentions, so he left a mark on his door which the dwarfs would later notice. The next half an hour is spent introducing us to the dwarfs who are coming to Bilbo's dinner party that Gandalf set up. In this part of the movie, some of the scenes and dwarf portrayals are a little goofy, but appealing. They show two sides of the dwarfs – the 'party' and the 'serious' side. At first, they leave a funny impression with all the eating and drinking, but when Thorin kicks in they're all up for some serious s**t.The book readers will notice one constant phrase that kept getting on my nerves – 'reclaiming the homeland'. The f**k? Of course that their mission involves 'reclaiming the homeland', but if the gold wasn't in their homeland I'm sure as hell they wouldn't care about it, since dwarfs are all about gold. I get that reclaiming homeland sounds more epic than reclaiming gold, but it keeps being presented as their main goal. As they start their journey, they meet Radagast (Sylvester McCoy), one of the five Wizards of Middle-earth (who was not in the book, but at the time The Hobbit novel is set was in the same areas as Bilbo and the dwarfs), who introduces Dol Guldur and the threat that lays in the abandoned fortress – The Necromancer. This is useful for understanding the complete story, even though the novel The Hobbit does not involve too many facts about Dol Guldur. This plot line about Dol Guldur will come later in play, possibly in the third Hobbit movie, when Jackson's planning to give more details about Gandalf's undeveloped disappearance in the novel. From this perspective, this introduction to Dol Guldur worked out great.There's one more thing that considerably differentiates the movie from the book and that's – drum roll – Azog (Manu Bennett). He is not present in the book, but here he plays a major antagonist role. Furthermore, the big problem is that he died in the battle of Azanulbizar (although he wasn't killed by Thorin) and yet, I repeat, he's the main antagonist in the movie, if we exclude Smaug (should I even call Smaug an antagonist?). There was a lot of material in Tolkien's work that could've been used instead of Azog that wouldn't have been so contradictory to the book. On the other hand, I understand that such a movie has got to have an antagonist, especially since Smaug's main part comes in the third movie (I guess).On a positive side, there are a lot of epic scenes in the movie, including Trolls, Rivendell, the Goblin king and Stone giants, and of course the amazing New Zealand landscapes. On a negative side, you can't really get attached to all the characters, since there's too many of them, and they all follow the same storyline so nobody in particular stands out – excluding Bilbo, Thorin, and maybe Balin. In conclusion, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a pretty good movie and I'm really looking forward to the two sequels. I guess Peter Jackson has many reasons for all the things that he included in the movie and that differ from the book, both the minor and major ones and I hope they'll fit in the whole trilogy.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,2,3,10 October 2013
Non-Stop," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Who else saw the trailer for Non-Stop and thought, 'oh dear, here's another movie that will make me feel ashamed when I go buy the tickets for it, I'll probably give it a low grade and write a negative review about it – what a waste of time and money!'? I hope it wasn't just me. I mean, an action movie, set on a plane, and the main character is played by Liam Neeson. Not my kind of movie, to be honest. I just couldn't understand what Julianne Moore was doing in the movies, as she's a good actress. Well, it turns out Non-Stop is actually a good movie that managed to keep me interested all the way. I was never bored and some scenes and twists even surprised me. My apologies to the movie makers for my jumping to conclusions! In Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U. S. Federal Air Marshal, and a divorced alcoholic who doesn't like flying. On the flight from New York to London, he meets Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), who asks him about his private life in order to relieve the fear he feels while the plane is taking off. While over the Atlantic, Bill receives a message on his secure phone from an unknown person who threatens to kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account. Bill asks the other air marshal on the plane, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), for help, but they get into a fight and to save himself Bill kills Jack – at the 20 minutes mark.Why did I presume this would be a bad movie? Well, first of all, it's an action movie. More often than not, little effort is put in creating an interesting and original story to accompany the action scenes in an action movie, and you get a Steven Seagal movie – which means a boring collage of shootouts, explosions and deaths. Fortunately, Non-Stop didn't make this mistake: its story isn't original, but it's entertaining and gripping, and the non-action scenes aren't just tedious fillers – you can actually enjoy the movie as a whole, as it doesn't rely exclusively on action. Of course, there are some cheesy and silly scenes, but they don't ruin the overall enjoyment this movie provides; they just temporarily relieve the tension in the scene.In action movies, acting can be bad, because who cares about the actors as long as there's guns and fire and car chases and bad guys dying? Again, Non-Stop avoided this trap gracefully. Liam Neeson is good, most of the time, Julianne Moore is great in every scene, and none of the other supporting characters feels unnecessary or acts bad. The only disappointment may be represented by the villain, who, when finally discovered, doesn't really have time to leave an intimidating impression, and whose motives are kind of silly and unbelievable. It would almost have been better had he remained faceless throughout the movie, but this wouldn't have made much sense. Overall, Non-Stop is a good action movie whose flaws are easy to ignore, and I'd recommend it for a Friday evening with friends.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,6,11,18 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Having only seen one movie by Wes Anderson before (Moonrise Kingdom), it was difficult to predict what to expect from The Grand Budapest Hotel. Moonrise Kingdom isn't a good movie, despite all the good reviews it got: in fact, it's quite boring, style-over-substance-ish, and counts on people liking it because the main characters are 'sweet innocent kids'. TGBH, on the other hand, looked promising – interesting, featuring an awesome cast, funny jokes and an actual story and events you can follow. And after all, Wes Anderson is considered a good director, whose movies, including this one, gained mostly positive reviews. Unfortunately, Mr Anderson will be Mr Anderson, and TGBH is yet just another style-over-substance flick.The movie starts with a girl, reading a book titled The Grand Budapest Hotel, next to its writer's bust. It then switches to the old writer (Tom Wilkinson), that starts recalling the events that led to writing the book. We then see the young writer (Jude Law), staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel and meeting its owner, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who decides to tell him the story of how he became the owner of the hotel. As a teenager, Mr. Moustafa was known as Zero (Tony Revolori) and worked as a lobby boy in the same hotel he owns. The legendary concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) becomes his mentor and best friend, and together they embark on strange and dangerous adventures.Despite being pointless and strange (since the characters of the old writer and the girl reading his book appear again, briefly, only at the end of the movie), this kind of beginning has its charm, and nicely introduces the whole story. The setting in general is wonderful: the costumes, the outdoors and indoors, the colors and all the playing with shadows and light make TGBH a truly beautiful movie, that's impossible to watch without wanting to be sucked into its world. Another great movie quality is represented by its cast of famous and excellent actors, who, luckily, don't condemn TGBH to the fate many other movies with good casts had recently (The Counselor, Movie 43). And even the less known actors, like for example Tony Revolori, are good.Probably the movie's biggest issue is that it can't decide whether it wants to be serious or silly. Both aspects work fine when seen alone, but put together, they just make the movie confusing – especially considering the background story is one of war and totalitarianism. One may argue that life is like that, a combination of seriousness and silliness, but that again doesn't fit the surrealistic vibe of the movie. There are also a lot of jokes that fall flat – if they are, in fact, jokes, which I suppose they are since some members of the audience in my theater were laughing hard at them. Ultimately, the story exists, but it feels like it would be the same if there was nothing going on: again, too much style, too little substance. TGBH definitely had potential, but ended up being an empty, cold and distant, although visually stunning, movie.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",6,1,5,6 April 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Pass the Popcorn Review
","Although it seemed that Steven Soderbergh would retire from film-making after finishing this year's Side Effects, he made another movie, Behind the Candelabra, and then stated he would just take a sabbatical. He might be just indecisive or he might be fooling us and doing it for the publicity, but after watching his last two movies I have to say it would be a shame to lose such an interesting and good director – and brave, I would add, since Behind the Candelabra was rejected by Hollywood movie studios because the story was considered 'too gay', so he made it as a TV movie.This movie is based on the autobiographical novel 'Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace' by Liberace's former lover Scott Thorson. Thorson (played by Matt Damon) and Liberace (Michael Douglas) met when the former was 17 and the latter 57. They started a sexual relationship and Thorson was also incorporated in Liberace's Las Vegas shows. He underwent plastic surgery to look more like Liberace, at the musician's request, and lived at his expenses. Their five-year relationship started to fall apart because of Liberace's promiscuity and Thorson's drug addiction.Behind the Candelabra is not just a simple biographic movie. It focuses mainly on the characters' relationship and growth as people, so it could be said that not much happens. Most of the scenes are shot indoors, and no character apart from Liberace and Thorson is really relevant. Thorson's evolution keeps the story going: in the beginning he's a healthy young man who wants to be a veterinarian, and then we watch him disappear, lose himself, becoming unable to control his life or his lover. When he tries to rebel, he is rejected and replaced. Liberace remains the same throughout the movie, but only in the end we realize that – he always grew tired of all his relationships.Douglas and Damon both deliver amazing, touching performances. Liberace's stage costumes, his and Thorson's outfits and the furniture in their houses are all over the top, but fit Liberace's persona perfectly, and Thorson's too, after he becomes sort of a clone of the famous musician. It is a truly great movie, but it might have been better had it concentrated more on Liberace's career and showman skills. In this version, it risks being seen as just another movie about bad relationships.Rating: 8/10",8,1,5,31 May 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Pass the Popcorn! review
","After the first X-Men movie and X2, the things were looking really good for the X-Men franchise, and then along came X-Men: The Last Stand. This drastic change in quality between movies is mostly attributed to Bryan Singer, the director of the first two movies, deciding to direct Superman Returns instead of this one, and being replaced by Brett Ratner. Since then, Bryan Singer has officially stated he regrets his decision. Considering how Superman Returns isn't a much better movie than X-Men: The Last Stand, it's a shame things went this way. Instead of a satisfying third X-Men movie, the world got a X-Men movie that felt like it was directed by Michael Bay.There are two main plot lines in X-Men: The Last Stand. The first one is about a cure for mutations that changes mutants to humans. The mutant community is divided by this cure – some of them want to change to humans, while the others strictly oppose this cure and want to destroy it by all means. At the same time, the X-men discover that Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) isn't dead, but Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) warns them she maybe isn't the same old Jean Grey they used to know. This turns out to be true when Jean Grey's alter ego, Phoenix, takes control of her body.While the first two X-Men movies are classics of the superhero genre, X-Men: The Last Stand is simply a very bad movie. It had almost twice the amount of its predecessor's budget ($210 million) and it still seemed like a cheaper movie. The special effects are bad, but so is everything else. The dialogue is worse than ever, the plot is uninteresting, and the freshly introduced mutants are awful. The X-Men franchise is mainly about its characters – misunderstood individuals feared by the general public – and their moral dilemmas; the strong characters and character developments are the main things that made the first two movies so good. Both of those aspects are lacking in X-Men: The Last Stand. New characters like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel (Ben Foster) are one-dimensional and forgettable caricatures, and the character of Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy aka Beast (Kelsey Grammar), while somewhat interesting, was a only of shadow of what he could have been.If you can get past the ludicrous writing, the silly acting and the simple characters, and just want to see mindless action scenes and mutants beating each other up, than X-Men: The Last Stand could just be the movie for you. However, if you strive to watch something above the generic Michael Bay tropes, you should definitely stay away from this movie. While there is some charm to dumb popcorn action movies, X-Men: The Last Stand is still an insult to the whole franchise, and doesn't deserve to have the words 'X-Men' in its title. Unfortunately, things for the X-Men franchise didn't get much better with X-Men Origins: The Wolverine.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6,0,0,23 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Pass the Popcorn! review
","In spite of earning a lot of money, the first installment in The Amazing Spider-Man franchise wasn't a very good movie. It had pacing and script problems while offering nothing new in return, and it overall seemed like a pointless reboot. Luckily, there's the unwritten rule that the sequel to a superhero movie will usually be better than the original. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows that rule, and is better than the first one, but not by a long shot. This movie has all the big problems its predecessor had, and if this franchise wants to rise above mediocrity, these problems should definitely be solved in future movies.Beginning where the last one left, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows the life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he somewhat struggles with being Spider-Man. He is in a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), although he feels guilty because of it, since he promised her late father (Denis Leary) he'll stay away from her. At the same time, he encounters a new threat in form of one Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) – an electrical engineer turned super villain during an accident. Also, Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to the city after his 8 year long absence, and he seems to have sinister plans of his own.The best thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is surely the charisma between its two leads – Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield found his voice to a greater extent in this movie - he seems somewhat more relaxed and natural in his role and is arguably superior to Tobey Maguire – and, of course, Emma Stone is as sweet and likable as ever. They are accompanied by another strong performance – that of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn. DeHaan was a breath of fresh air to the franchise and I personally can't wait to see him in future installments. In addition to the overall quality acting, Marc Webb's direction is great, even better than in the first one. Not only that, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is also a nice combination of, more or less, thrilling action sequences and some grim elements which should generally entertain audiences who are looking for nothing else.However, once again, the movie utterly fails in this, perhaps most important, aspect – the script. No one expects Oscar-worthy scriptwriting from a superhero movie, but the dialogues (and some scenes) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are laughably ridiculous, and the character of Max Dillon aka Electro was so poorly written that even an experienced actor like Jamie Foxx couldn't save it. Furthermore, once again, the villain designs were horrible: both Electro and Green Goblin looked cartoonishly goofy. And in spite of some action sequences looking great, some of them felt like they were taken directly from a video game (which is never a good thing) and were accompanied by a cheesy dubstep-like soundtrack. In brief, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is better than its predecessor, but that unfortunately isn't enough, since the movie is, at its best, mindless popcorn entertainment, and at its worst is a serious insult to intelligence.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at passpopcorn.com",6,5,13,25 April 2014
Evil Dead," Pass the Popcorn review
","To be honest, I was sceptical when I heard the news that an Evil Dead remake was being made. And, seriously, who wasn't? The original (and the whole trilogy) was an excellent trash movie that perfectly combined horror and low budget comedy. The remake couldn't have possibly top that. Regardless, a serious question remained – who will replace the genius Bruce Campbell and his character Ash? No one is good enough to fit his shoes. Furthermore, rumors started circulating, about the fact that Diablo Cody was going to write the screenplay. In that moment, I was sure the remake would be God awful. Suddenly, something miraculous happened. Initial reactions from the screenings were really positive. And, thankfully, Diablo Cody didn't write the screenplay after all. She just 'polished' and 'americanized' it (whatever that means), and wasn't even included in the credits. My hopes for the movie went up, I was actually eager to see it and when I finally did, I wasn't disappointed. Of course, that doesn't mean this remake is without flaws. And I'm still going to blame Diablo Cody for them, because I can.In case you don't know, Evil Dead is about a group of five young people who go into a remote cabin in the woods and there, by pure chance, summon bloodthirsty demons. The demons start possessing them one by one and the survivors have to fight for their lives. This time, there is a little twist on the classic story – the main female character, Mia (Jane Levy), is an ex-junkie who is going through withdrawal. In fact, her friends organised the trip to the cabin as a part of her rehabilitation and they plan on keeping her there, by all means necessary, until she gets better. Apart from that, the remake follows the original story – more or less. In addition to the plot similarities, there are numerous references to the original trilogy which I liked in particular. Currently, there are some other rumors circulating – that the original and the remake are a part of the same universe and that there could probably be a crossover in the future where Ash would meet the surviving character(s) (I won't give out any spoilers) of the remake. I stand behind that completely, and I would really love to see it happen.Anyway, the Evil Dead remake is pretty good. The movie relies much more on practical effects instead on CG ones, which is always a plus and gives it a certain old school vibe. That being said, the movie is rather gory. It's one of the bloodiest, most violent movies I've seen in quite a while. Which, depending on the way you look at it, may be a good or a bad thing. I certainly liked it – the original trilogy was also extremely bloody from time to time, although this movie does go an extra mile. The remake also has a creepy, uncomfortable atmosphere through it. It also produces several effective scares. So, strictly viewing it as only a horror movie, the Evil Dead remake fulfilled its cause. This time, we even had a little more insight on the Book of the Dead. That serves mainly as a plot device, to explain the nature of the demon that is possessing everyone. Still, it was nice to find out more about the whole Evil Dead lore. All in all, the upside of this remake is that it's a fun, violent, gory movie, with plenty of references to the original. If that sounds appealing to you and you're into the horror genre, this flick will surely keep you entertained. I'd even say that the majority of the fans of the original will be ultimately satisfied or, at least, won't be severely disappointed.As I said, the movie does have a few flaws. This one isn't necessarily a flaw, but all the characters in the movie seemed like stereotypic modern horror movie characters (damn you, Diablo Cody!). This isn't automatically bad, but it kind of goes against that old school vibe I mentioned. However, to be frank, the Evil Dead movies were never about the characters (save Ash, of course). Also the guy who plays the male lead David, Mia's brother (Shiloh Fernandez), did an awful acting job, I am not sure how he managed to land a role. The next flaw is that the movie sometime takes itself too seriously. By no means would I call this movie a serious one but still, the whole concept of the Evil Dead franchise is that they are just ridiculous movies and should be treated that way. So yes, this movie really did need an Ash character to elevate things a little. But, even though he wasn't there, I had a great time and enjoyed myself nevertheless.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8,0,10,16 May 2013
Elysium," Pass the Popcorn review
","I saw Matt Damon's newest movie – Elysium. I had great expectations, and I was curious to see this movie since it was directed and written by District 9′s director and writer Neill Blomkamp. Elysium reminds very much of that awesome movie and it has an interesting story and a good cast, so I think it was natural to suppose, and hope, that Elysium would have been District 9′s worthy successor. Unfortunately, this movie was a pretty big disappointment – and even if you decide to ignore the existence of District 9 and don't compare the two, it remains a bad movie. Also, I would have loved to see Ninja of Die Antwoord play the main role, but he turned the director's offer down.Matt Damon plays Max, a young man living on Earth in the year 2154: our planet is polluted, unsafe, filled with criminals and poor people who hope to one day get to Elysium, a man-made space station where all the wealthy people of Earth have moved and where they can live forever thanks to special medical machines. The rich would do anything to stop the poor from getting to Elysium, and the poor just want to get there in order to be cured. After Max is injured at work and has only five days left to live, he joins a group of criminals who attach an exoskeleton to his body and send him on a mission to steal some data from a rich person, and afterwards go to Elysium.First of all, the movie looks great. But let's not emphasise this: it's supposed to look impressive and have great visual effects, it's a sci-fi with a $115 million budget! Also, while there are some good scenes that manage to keep you interested, others look like a video game. Then we have the story. As I said, it's interesting, mainly because you have so much possibilities and you can exploit it in so many ways: you can show the sociological aspect of the situation presented in the movie, you can analyse the characters psychologically, or describe the class wars between the rich and the poor so we can understand how things happened before the rich went to Elysium and we can sympathise with the poor. The director did nothing of this. Instead, he just showed us – this is Earth and it's ugly and it's really sad, this is Elysium and it's nice but the people are evil. It's a pity, since Blomkamp wanted the movie to send a powerful message and to be a metaphor for today's society. Yes, we get the metaphor, but it's faintly delivered and it makes Elysium look like just another silly Hollywood sci-fi trying to be all smart and stuff (Oblivion much?).Regarding the acting, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were good, but their characters were too undeveloped. Especially Foster's role as the movie's antagonist, the Minister of Homeland Security Delacourt, should have gotten more attention, if not more screen time. Blomkamp could have just taken the hint from Foster's last name. Matt Damon, on the other hand, is constantly present, in almost every scene of the movie, so he manages to be a bit more developed. But there's his childhood friend Frey, decently played by Alice Braga, whom we should believe he loves and cares for, even though they haven't seen each other in years, and she has a child with another man (that we never meet). Their zero-chemistry relationship is just taken for granted in the script, and consequently, we can't care. Perhaps the worst characteristic of this movie is that's it's so damn long, it gets so boring and still manages to leave some things unexplained. I guess we can just hope Blomkamp will create something better the next time.Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",6,2,4,24 August 2013
Invictus," Pass the Popcorn review
","Because of his recent death, we decided it would be fit for us to try and honour the memory of Nelson Mandela by reviewing one of the many movies about his life. Even though there is much controversy surrounding his life and actions (great people are rarely not controversial), the majority of people still consider him an icon, a great politician and an extremely important figure in South African history. Invictus depicts Mandela's life after being released from prison, but since showing all the things he had done while president of South Africa would be impossible and make the movie a mess, it was decided to concentrate the story on the South African rugby team.After spending 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy, and finally being released, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is chosen as the president of South Africa. His mission is extremely difficult: to end apartheid and unite the people. He sees his opportunity in the South African rugby team, the Springboks, which is losing all of its games. As the team is a symbol of oppression (only white people cheer for it), the Sports Commission wants to change its colors and name. Mandela, unexpectedly, decides to back up the Springboks and opposes this decision: he doesn't want Afrikaners to believe Mandela wants to rid South Africa of their presence. He wants the nation to feel as one again by cheering for the same team.A lot of research and hard work was put into this movie: Clint Eastwood, the director, started watching so much rugby for the movie he ended up being a fan, Matt Damon interviewed Francois Pienaar and trained rugby, and Freeman, who had been Mandela's friend for many years, went to South Africa to get his blessing for the movie - which he gained. Unfortunately, the movie didn't turn out to be as good as one would expect. One thing that bothered me is that, no matter what a great job Freeman did and the effort and hard work he put in preparing his role, I could rarely 'feel' Mandela - it was just Freeman acting, though masterfully. Moreover, I felt the movie was too long and got tedious from time to time, especially when showing teams playing rugby: I know that's what the movie is about, but it could have been made more interesting, especially for people who don't understand the game.On the other hand, I thought it was an excellent decision to show how the relationships between black and white members of Mandela's security staff develop: Mandela forces them to work together and overcome their animosities, showing that people can change and, maybe most importantly, even a small change is (and was, for Mandela) crucial. It would have been nice to see more of Matt Damon's character, but he mostly plays rugby during the movie. Still, it is somewhat understandable: this movie is, after all, about Nelson Mandela, and what a huge inspiration and powerful politician he was. It is also about the good side of sports: there is no violence and flare-throwing silliness here, only excitement and the feeling of unity a nation like South Africa needed very much.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,1,4,7 December 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," Pass the Popcorn review
","It's a Wonderful Life is considered one of the best movies of all time, and also one of the most beloved Christmas movies in American cinema, even though it was a box office failure when it was released and received some negative reviews, and it won just the Academy Award for Technical Achievements, despite being nominated for five more. What I like about this movie is that it isn't a classic Christmas movie: the movie isn't about how things get better overnight for the main character just because he/she 'believes in Christmas', or some idiocy like that. Christmas just plays a small, but great role in the final part of the movie, which is, ultimately, about life.The movie starts with God and Joseph, explaining to the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) that he has to go to Earth and save George Bailey (James Stewart), who's contemplating suicide. God then begins to show Clarence George's most relevant moments in life, from childhood till the present. Most of the movie is actually spent showing us that George always wanted to travel but decided to stay in his hometown and save his late father's business, and that he's always been a good person, who's always thought more of the others than himself and has led a good life. But when he finds out he can't pay a debt, he wishes he'd never been born – and Clarence shows him what would have become of his town, had he never been born.As I've said before, It's a Wonderful Life is about life. When you're young you have your dreams and ambitions, and you're sure that you'll end up living an ideal life, just like the one you've always planned. But life just happens and you often can't control it, and one day you discover you're a completely different person from the one you wanted to be. Some of us can't stand this and eventually come to a breaking point: George in this movie wanted to end it all and thought everyone would have been better off without him, not realising he had done so much and that even the problems that seem insurmountable can be resolved, with help from friends and family.Because of its simple but timeless story, this movie has aged beautifully. Add to that the great acting and dialogues, the good sense of humour, the complex characters, the great cinematography – and you get a truly wonderful movie. It's impossible not to see and feel that George Bailey represents all of us, and it's easy to share his joys and sorrows as if they were our own. Ultimately, this is a movie that truly sums up what Christmas – but also all our lives – should be about: being a good person, because it pays off and because the richest people are those surrounded by family and friends, not the ones that have lots of money. It might be a naive and idealistic message, but it works amazingly for this time of the year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,2,5,25 December 2013
12 Years a Slave," Pass the Popcorn review
","12 Years a Slave is Steve McQueen's latest movie, based on the movie's main character Solomon Northup's book of the same name. As the title suggests, it's a movie about slavery in the US, in the mid-1800s. Some people ask, why do we need another movie about slavery? We already know all there is to know about this subject! Well, I might be the only one, but this movie showed me at least one thing I didn't know used to happen – and that is the kidnapping of free black man, to be sold as slaves.Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is an educated, free black man who lives in the 1841 Saratoga, New York, with his wife and two children, and plays the violin for a living. Two white man approach him one day, offering him a job: he accepts, and after he's done, the two men take him out to dinner to celebrate his good work. He gets drunk and feels sick, so the two carry him back to the hotel and put him to bed – but in the morning, he finds himself in a barn, chained, and realising he can't remember how he got there. A white man soon informs him that he's a slave who will soon be taken to the South and sold.No matter the fact that you already know the life and suffering of black slaves in the States, 12 Years a Slave will still manage to shock and surprise you – starting from the kidnapping and stealing of Solomon's free papers, up to the horrid life and working conditions in cotton plantations. Chiwetel Ejiofor leads the movie masterfully: in the few scenes with his family in the beginning, it's easy to see that he loves his wife and kids very much; in the later scenes, when he doesn't accept the state he's been brought in and is therefore punished by his owners, we understand, better than ever, how hard it actually is for every human being to be forced into slavery; in his isolation from other slaves, we realise how different he is from them, because he never gives up the hope of some day being saved.While Chiwetel Ejiofor obviously leads the story, the supporting characters are wonderful and complete him in such a way, that this movie can be compared to a beautiful painting, or a delicious dish – everyone does his part and everyone is important. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in portraying Ford, the 'good slave owner' – if there ever was such a thing – who forms a nice relationship with Solomon but has to sell him eventually. Michael Fassbender is one of the best, if not the best villain I've seen this year: simply the presence of his character, Edwin Epps, is extremely intimidating, and the way he treats his slaves makes you wish you could personally enter the movie to strangle him. Add to all of this the beautiful and occasionally shocking cinematography, and the wonderful songs the slaves sing while working, and you get one of the best movies of the year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,1,4,2 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Pass the Popcorn review
","The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, mainly because it features the famous director-actor duo of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have previously worked on many good movies, like Shutter Island and The Departed. This movie is based on Jordan Belfort's biographical book of the same name, and Belfort himself helped DiCaprio prepare for the main role. It's important to point out that, because it was independently financed, the movie features lots of nudity, drug abuse and over-the-top sex scenes, which might make the viewing uncomfortable for some.Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) starts his career at Wall Street but is soon fired because of the stock market crash in 1987 (known as Black Monday). He manages to get a job in an investment center and, being the most successful broker, he teaches his colleagues how to sell. Soon, realising his potential and finding a partner – Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) – he opens a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, where he and his colleagues start selling penny stocks and frauding people – all the while making more money than they ever imagined, and spending it on drugs and prostitutes.DiCaprio plays the perfect antihero: Belfort is a liar, he cheats on his wife, he steals money from people, he is constantly drugged out of his mind and so on. Still, it's very difficult to hate him, and I think most people actually envy him: who wouldn't want to have so much money, you can throw $100 bills in the trash without blinking? DiCaprio's performance is wonderful, and I hope he'll finally win the Oscar he deserves. The supporting actors find themselves somewhat in his shadow, but do a terrific work nonetheless – especially Jonah Hill, whose experience in comedies fits the dark humour of the movie perfectly. And because this movie is filled with humour, I had no problem with its length: you don't even realise it's 3 hours long because it's so entertaining.Like I said, the movie features lots of drug abuse and sex scenes, which some people may consider pointless or whatever, but I feel it doesn't make any sense (and is also hypocritical) to consider it bad just because of this – which is an attitude many people on the internet seem to have. Also, this movie does not promote immoral behaviour. It's like saying slasher movies promote killing: it's a ridiculous and ignorant way of bashing a movie when you have no solid arguments. Finally, if you go see this movie, you're going to get sex, drugs, violence and lots of swearing, all of it wonderfully incorporated in a great biography. The Wolf of Wall Street is not for everyone, but it's a great movie I recommend to everyone who isn't easily scandalised.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,1,6,27 December 2013
The Conjuring," Pass the Popcorn review
","James Wan is probably the most famous young horror director. He was involved in the Saw saga, directing two and producing all of the movies. He's also famous for including a specific trademark in all of his horror movies – that trademark being creepy evil dolls. But The Conjuring is supposed to differ from his previous works, since it's based on the true story of the Perron family and Ed and Lorraine Warren, the latter being famous paranormal investigators who worked on the Amytiville Horror case, among many others. The Conjuring was extremely well received, which is kind of a surprise, as new horror movies are not generally known for being good.In 1971, the Perron family – Roger, Carolyn and their five daughters – moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. On their first night there, they discover a secret cellar, and while sleeping, an invisible force pulls one of the daughters' leg. In the morning, they find their dog – who didn't want to enter the house – dead. The next days, more strange things happen: doors open on their own, clapping can be heard when there's nobody there etc. Frightened, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) convinces Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come and inspect the house. The couple discovers a malevolent spirit attached to the Perron family and decide to look for evidence in order to request an exorcism from the Church.The Conjuring isn't entirely faithful to the true story – for example, the Perrons lived in the haunted house 10 years, while the movie makes it look like just a couple of weeks, and they have reported the presence of good spirits, too. But that's not really relevant, especially because most people will find it much more interesting to speculate whether the spirits/demons are real at all (it happens with every movie of this kind). And also because The Conjuring is a great movie. It's not a typical jump scare plus murderous demon kind of horror, which is excellent because it really works hard to scare you, mainly by creating atmosphere (unlike the jump scares that just abuse human instincts). In the end, you find you were mostly afraid of nothing, because you expected something to appear but it never did. This is the movie's best feature, since all the other scares, featuring visible spirits, aren't quite as scary. I also appreciated the fact that the movie's following two timelines – the Warrens' and the Perrons'. The Warrens' especially adds a lot of drama to the movie, which makes it very relaxing from time to time, but also lets you connect with the characters a lot. Too many times do we see a horror movie in which people die before we've even learned their names.The acting is very good, too, especially the children's – who all look genuinely afraid when they have to – and even though there are no famous actors in the movie. Finally, the use of soundtrack was amazing, as a dramatically loud sound was rarely heard when something scary occurred: again, the makers of the movie didn't focus on humans' natural, instinctive responses in order to create fear. Now, about the things I didn't quite like. The movie starts out with the Annabelle doll story: a doll inhabited by a demon was taken by the Warrens to their home after they had performed an exorcism on it. There is absolutely no reason to start the movie off with that story, since it isn't linked in any way to the Perron family, either in the movie or in real life. Still, this start is interesting and creepy, and I admit it seems reasonable to use that story to explain what the Warrens do for a living. Moreover, the beginning is not as bad as the ending of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that all the build-up during the movie doesn't quite pay off and everything is kind of underwhelming. Nevertheless, The Conjuring is a very good horror movie that will intrigue and scare – and maybe even make you keep the lights on at night.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,0,1,28 October 2013
The Wolverine," Pass the Popcorn review
","After the disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Hugh Jackman is back on the big screen reprising his famous Wolverine role. 'The Wolverine' was initially meant to be directed by Darren Aronofsky - he even re-wrote the screenplay and aimed for a R-rating. However, after his departure, we got James Mangold's PG-13 version of 'The Wolverine'. Which is really a shame, since a movie like this truly deserves a R-rating. 'The Wolverine' surely is better than the aforementioned movies, but that isn't saying much. The movie is still underwhelming and full of flaws, the PG-13 rating being one of them.'The Wolverine' continues where X-Men: The Last Stand ended. Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who now looks like Jesus, feels guilty about killing Jean Grey aka Phoenix (Famke Janssen). He aimlessly lives his life and often has visions of Jean. One day he meets Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a somewhat strange Japanese girl who invites him to Japan to visit his old friend Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) because he is dying. There, because of some Sci-Fi mumbo jumbo, Logan is deprived of his superpowers. Weakened like that, he is forced to fight yakuza, samurai, ninjas and other Japanese stuff, while seeking a way to regain his superpowers and trying to solve the mystery surrounding the Yashida family.Due to the 2 hours length and poor editing, 'The Wolverine' is a quite boring movie. It is shot in intervals: first, there are pretty long intervals where nothing significant happens, and then this are compensated with intervals of too long action scenes. This kind of editing made the movie feel tiresome. Furthermore, 'The Wolverine' has a serious villain problem. There are just too many of them, and the majority are left completely undeveloped. The screenwriters should have left one or two of them out of the movie, and focus more on the rest. Also, the love story between Logan and Yashida's daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) was completely uncalled for and made little sense in the movie's story. Logan had much more chemistry with Yukio than with Mariko and she should have been Logan's new love interest, in case he absolutely needed one. Besides, establishing Logan's guilt because of the murder of his love, Jean, is useless if during the course of the movie he bones the first sexy Asian chick he meets. And of course, like I said before, in the world of samurai, katanas and wolverine claws, a R-rating and some Tarantino-esque violence is a must.Still, all of this doesn't mean that 'The Wolverine' is an absolute failure. I liked how the movie has a more serious, darker tone, than the Origins movie. The mystery regarding the Yashida family was also plausible (in spite of some obvious twists) and some jokes in the movie weren't as bad as one might expect. I particularly enjoyed the first act of the movie, before it went dull. 'The Wolverine' surely isn't disastrous, it has its good moments from time to time. I think it will satisfy the majority of its audience, especially the ones who were utterly disappointed with the Origins movie. Actually, it was quite nice to see Logan have some limitations and still fight his enemies. it would have been even nicer if his enemies were somewhat better written.Rating: 6/10",6,0,1,26 August 2013
Monsters University," Pass the Popcorn review
","It's been 12 years since Monsters, Inc. came out. It was a huge success and a great cartoon, so it's actually really strange Pixar hadn't decided to make a sequel/prequel to it earlier. Still, this year we got Monsters University. I must admit that when I saw the title I thought this was going to be an awful prequel that will simply ruin the franchise. But since it was – and still is – the second most financially successful animated movie this year, I decided to give it a try – and I was pleasantly surprised.Monsters University introduces us to a very young Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) who, one day on a school trip visits Monsters Inc., the scaring company. Since everybody looks down on him and doesn't consider him scary, he decides to prove everyone wrong and become a scarer. Years later, we meet an older Mike, who has just got registered at Monsters University and is starting his lessons. What he lacks in talent, he makes up for in hard work. An arrogant and conceited James P. Sullivan soon becomes his rival.First of all, I liked that the movie shows that, in order to be successful, you have to work hard. But it also demonstrates that if something isn't for you, no matter how much you want it, it's much better to let it go. Mike isn't a scarer in Monsters, Inc. because he isn't scary, and he learns to live with it at the end of this prequel – even though it means to give up all of his childhood dreams. But in the end he's happy and satisfied with his life and his job. So, on one hand the movie is a bit too idealistic for grown-ups (because sometimes, no matter how much you work, you'll get nowhere), but it compensates by having this realistic ending.The story itself isn't original – college life, enemies becoming friends and overcoming obstacles by helping each other – but some twists are truly unexpected. The humour is not as childish as one may think, and even the silliest scenes, like someone falling over, provide good laughs. There are a lot of other, supporting characters, and almost everyone is funny, interesting and developed enough not to be just dead weight. In conclusion, this is a very good animated movie, but it's not perfect. It lacks 'that little something', which might have been achieved by inventing a more original story. But it's not a movie I'd suggest you avoid, and if there's ever a sequel to Monsters, Inc. I suggest right now you watch that one too.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7,0,0,9 October 2013
X2: X-Men United," Pass the Popcorn! review
","The first X-Men movie was, in a way, a revolutionary movie. It was, more or less, considered a low budget movie and nevertheless it managed to earn a ton of money, making way for future movies. Not only did the movie turn out to be a huge financial success, but it was also quite a decent superhero movie which managed to perfectly combine action and drama. After the first movie's financial boom and positive critical reception, a sequel was bound to happen. 'X2′ was a much bigger movie then its predecessor – it had a bigger budget ($110 million), it earned more money (over $400 million) and was overall a better movie.The movie opens with a mutant, later identified as the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempting to assassinate the President of the USA. This failed assassination triggers a harsh human response against the mutants, and the Presidents goes with the plan of one William Stryker (Brian Cox), an army colonel who wants to storm Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for Gifted Youngsters. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) wants to learn more about his past, and Magneto (Ian McKellen) is still in his plastic prison, but Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) has her own plans for busting him out.'X2′ is the ideal example of a sequel done right. The movie contains everything which made the first one good (the social commentary, the acting, the memorable characters), and it upgrades some things that didn't really work in the first one (some of the dialogue, Halle Berry has a significantly smaller role), but still has a voice of its own. There are several newcomers to the franchise who are properly introduced and developed throughout the movie, but the one who stands out the most is Brian Cox as the movie's villain, William Stryker. Cox, aided by two other veteran actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen), makes for one impressive triumvirate of actors. This movie is worth seeing because of acting alone, but when you add to that the great fighting sequences, the amazing set pieces and strong writing – you get one really remarkable superhero movie.'X2′ is not only better and bigger than its predecessor, but it's also 30 minutes longer, which may be its biggest problem. Not that the movie is boring, but there are so many subplots in the movie that 'X2′ sometimes feels like two movies crammed in one, thus being somewhat overcrowded (especially in its third act). Nonetheless, 'X2′ is still an impressive entry in the genre of superhero movie and the whole X-men franchise. Unfortunately, right after this movie, things went south for the X-men franchise.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8,1,2,23 May 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Pass the Popcorn review
","The first Thor was a fun, entertaining movie, that featured interesting characters and a very interesting story (I simply love myths and legends), along with good acting and a great villain. It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public â€“ which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and â€“ according to the superhero movie rule â€“ the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.The first thing that you might notice about this movie is that it is laughably silly, but also very entertaining: it is almost 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it, and it doesn't bore. Actually, the ending almost feels rushed and I wish it were a bit longer and more developed. Action and non-action scenes alike are entertaining and interesting. But it is very silly: the Dark Elves, the exposition, the story itself â€“ everything feels as if it was made for really dumb people who, hadn't the movie been so simple, would have flooded the internet with 'I don't get it' threads. But still, I found it enjoyable and laughed at the silliness a few times, especially at that one scene â€“ that goes nowhere â€“ where we see Thor shirtless, washing his hands and then staring at the distance. It lasts a few seconds and is completely useless â€“ except for maybe making girls faint/stare in awe. A truly good movie feature is the villain: Malekith is quiet, ruthless, dangerous â€“ he doesn't joke around, he truly wants to kill everybody.Christopher Eccleston, who plays Malekith, is great (and maybe that's why he never looked good as The Doctor: he's much better at playing villains!), and I want to congratulate him for being able to stand 6 hours of make-up every time to look like Malekith. Tom Hiddleston is simply amazing as Loki, he stole the show and fit his role perfectly. Too bad he got so little screen time, especially considering the other actors. Hemsworth is still good, but Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman are just awful. I can understand Portman's horrible performance, since she wanted out of the project (but wasn't allowed) when Patty Jenkins, who should have directed this Thor, dropped out due to creative differences. I still have to find a reason why Hopkins looks so bored and tired the whole time. I sure hope one of them gets a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor, because they really ruined the movie â€“ just like the awful green screen in some scenes, which is shameful for a movie that has such a big budget. In conclusion, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining popcorn flick that could have been better but that you'll enjoy nonetheless.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,0,3,8 November 2013
Flight," Pass the Popcorn review
","From Robert Zemeckis, the director of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Cast away', it might have been logical to expect another good movie, although the aforementioned ones are pretty old. Also, the Oscar nominations for best actor (Denzel Washington) and best screenplay must mean something. Unfortunately, after the almost epic 20 minutes in the beginning, the movie seems to nosedive along with the plane.It all starts with Whip (Washington) waking up in a hotel room next to what I thought was a prostitute. She turns out to be a flight attendant who works (and occasionally has some fun) with Mr. Whitaker, the pilot. Now, I don't mind nudity in movies, but if you pick it for the first scene in the movie, whatever your purpose was, it won't turn out good, or even shocking – it's just going to look cheap and make people label the movie as 'not really good' straightaway. Even if the naked girl (Nadine Velazquez) is really beautiful. After that, we realize the main character is an alcoholic who takes cocaine for breakfast and gets high on oxygen, he does that in front of people he has never seen before (his co-pilot) and in front of friends, and nobody seems to mind or feels the need to report him. He is also divorced, has a son who lives with the ex wife, and rarely speaks to them both. The perfect antihero. This role is very suitable for Washington but it is far from his best and so this somewhat average performance questions his Oscar nomination. The plot moves on when Whip drugged and drunk but extremely lucid, operates the Flight 227 to Atlanta which, after some turbulences, starts to fall apart, and he is forced to crash land it in a field, managing to save the lives of almost everyone on board. He wakes up in a hospital and is informed that, because of the results of his blood test done after that crash, he could face criminal charges, and is advised to stop drinking, which is not easy.As I said, this movie starts out greatly, but fails to deliver. After the tense, scary, nervous first part, it's as if another movie begins – a story about an alcoholic who tries to make order in his ruined-by-an-addiction life. It's something we have seen many times, and here is not very impressive, especially because of the constant presence of religious symbols that end up reducing every event and action to God's will. Most of the other characters seem put in there just so Washington doesn't have to act alone, there is no real relationship between him and them, or at least you can't feel it. Apart from that, the story didn't have to be over two hours long – some scenes are either tedious or pointless, and should've been left out. The soundtrack, despite being obvious (Feelin' Alright by Joe Cocker plays whenever Whip takes cocaine), works really well, and the directing is fine. Therefore, I can't sincerely say it's a bad movie, I liked it. It could just have been better.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",6,3,5,12 March 2013
Godzilla," Pass the Popcorn! review
","The Godzilla (or, in Japanese, Gojira) franchise features a series of 28 original Japanese Kaiju ('monster') movies. Inspired by the success of 'King Kong', the first 'Godzilla' was released in 1954 and was extremely influential, and it was adapted by Americans into 'Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'. Godzilla inspired many other movies, video games and comics. Four Godzilla movies have been produced in America and one in Italy (also known as Cozzilla),while North Korea released 'Pulgasari', which was similar to Godzilla. The monster was created as an allegory of the effects and consequences of the hydrogen bomb, and represented the Japanese fear of the Hiroshima disaster happening again. This 'Godzilla' is a reboot of the one from 1954, and not a remake of the badly received 1998 version.In 1999, a couple of researchers are investigating the finding of a massive skeleton under an excavation site in the Philippines, along with a strange cocoon attached to it, and one that has apparently hatched. In Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is worried that the periodical 'earthquakes' occurring lately may cause damage unless the nuclear power plant he's working in is shut down. As his wife (Juliette Binoche) approaches the reactor to check it for damage, a strong tremor causes a breach in the reactor, Joe's wife's death, and the collapse of the building. Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lives in the USA but is called to Japan to bail his father out, who's been trespassing in order to find out what really happened the day his wife died. At the 'abandoned' nuclear plant, that has been turned into a military-protected research center, what happened in 1999 starts happening again.Interestingly enough, the two characters that looked like main characters in the trailer – Godzilla and Joe (Bryan Cranston) – are the ones you'll see the least in the movie. I didn't find this characteristic to be that bad, in regards to Godzilla. It manages to build tension and expectation as you wait for the monster to appear, and it also gives you time to appreciate the monsters Godzilla's fighting – the so-called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). But the fact that Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the 'human lead', instead of Bryan Cranston, was just bad. Because Mr Kick-Ass isn't a good actor, has no charisma, and the public doesn't get anything from the script that can help sympathize with him. He has a wife and small child, and I could really care less, because most of the (too many) actors in the movie are just expendable and forgettable. The dialogues don't help, either.On the bright side, like I said, the movie is tense. Many scenes occur at night, in silence – when all of a sudden a huge monster appears and destroys everything while shrieking maniacally, which is just beautiful. The CGI is great and the cinematography doesn't disappoint, just like the majestic soundtrack. There aren't as many action scenes as one would expect, and the MUTOs and Godzilla are gradually revealed, up until the final big fight. The fact that some serious effort has been put into creating an interesting story – and actually, the mere fact that there is a story, gives this movie an automatic thumbs up. All in all, this 'Godzilla' is an interesting, tense, fun monster movie to watch, that can be appreciated by newbies and long-term fans of the franchise equally.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7,2,4,23 May 2014
300," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Zack Snyder is probably one of the most divisive contemporary directors, with almost all of his movies completely polarizing the audience – and his 2007 box office smash '300′ is no exception. I first saw this movie – based on the Frank Miller comic book of the same name – upon its theatrical release, when I was still a lad, and I quite enjoyed it (as an early teen, who wouldn't?). Fast forward 7 years, I decided to watch it again, to refresh my memory in preparation for the unnecessary sequel – 300: Rise of an Empire. This time I wasn't as satisfied as when I first saw it. Actually, I thought it to be mindless and silly and I'm less enthusiastic about the sequel than ever.'300′ loosely portrays the Battle of Thermopylae during which the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler), aided by 300 of his finest soldiers, stood against the mighty Persian empire, ruled by the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) – and that's pretty much the whole movie. Of course, there are some scenes depicting the Spartan way of life, and a subplot concerning Leonidas' wife, queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), trying to influence the Spartan council to send more soldiers to aid Leonidas, in spite of corrupted councilman Theron's (Dominic West) intentions too keep the army at bay, but all of this is utterly overshadowed by the movie's action sequences.With its thin plot and extreme historical inaccuracy, it wouldn't be an overstatement to call '300′ a style-over-substance movie. Not that that is necessary a problem, but some people (including myself) may find the movie to be bland if they want something more from a movie, instead of excessive violence nearly all the time, and in return get senseless scenes and poorly developed characters (one of the more prominent characters, played by Vincent Regan, is only called and credited as Captain, and his only character traits are that he has a son, and is a captain). As for the movie's style, '300′ is most famous for its unrestricted use of slow motion, which, to be honest, does look impressive when used correctly. However, more often than not, slow motion is used incorrectly and in certain scenes is simply unnecessary. Due to this incorrect use of slow motion, quite a few scenes in the movie look like excerpts from some music video, which isn't a good thing.'300′ definitely isn't a horrible movie. Like I said, some action sequences look truly impressive (which should be more than enough for action movie fanatics) and the movie does have the charm of a mindless popcorn flick. In fact, I think '300′ could have been more enjoyable and better if it had been somewhat less serious than it actually was. Without that little special something, '300′, in spite of its cool looking action scenes, some memorable quotes and characters, doesn't really stand the test of repeated viewings, at least not in my case.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6,2,3,5 March 2014
The Hangover Part III," Pass the Popcorn review
","The first Hangover movie, released in 2009, was a breath of fresh air in the comedy genre. It was clever, funny and original, and people really seemed to enjoy it. Since the first one was such a big success, it was obvious that it would spawn some sequels. So, The Hangover Part II was released. The second Hangover movie was almost identical to its predecessor – it had the same formula, same setup, the same narrative structure, the same plot points; even though it was considerably less funny, it was also still an OK movie. The third movie completely disregards the famous franchises' formula and goes in a different direction.This time there is no wedding, no a bachelor party, no party, nor do the members of the Wolf Pack get drunk/high. This time the plot is very straightforward – Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) have to find Chow (Ken Jeong). Apparently, Chow stole 40 million dollars worth of gold plates from some mafia guy named Marshall (John Goodman), and so in return Marshall kidnapped Doug (Justin Bartha) and blackmailed Phil, Stu and Alan to find and bring him Chow, or else he will kill Doug.Basically, this movie lacked the elements that made the first Hangover so good. Of course, the classic Hangover formula needed some experimenting but if you completely abandon the ideas that made the first movie feel so fresh and original, there is a decent chance you'll just end up stuck with an unoriginal, bland movie. Which is exactly what happened to The Hangover Part III. In a nutshell, Hangover Part III pretty much fails as a sequel to The Hangover. But hey, that doesn't mean that Hangover Part III fails as a movie, does it? Well, sort of. First of all, Hangover Part III is – once again unlike the first two movies – a much more action/thrill-packed movie. By no means would I call it an action movie, but it definitely shows overtones of one. I didn't really like these kind of scenes since they didn't seem vital to the plot and they were far from spectacular. Second of all, Hangover Part III isn't that funny: I chuckled here and there but the jokes were far from the first Hangover. So I'm not quite sure whether I would give this movie a passing grade. It wasn't terrible but I feel I could have spent 100 minutes of my time doing something better – like watching some other movie.But what do I know? The audience, whom I watched the movie with, really seemed to enjoy it as they were laughing quite often. However, in the credits there is a scene that shows the Wolf Pack waking up from what is implied to be yet another bachelor party. Of course, the setup is classic – they don't know what happened the night before and are shocked by the mayhem that is surrounding them. This scene was very short and the audience laughed more during those few minutes than throughout the whole movie. Their reactions portrayed my emotions towards this movie very accurately.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",5,0,0,8 June 2013
Her," Pass the Popcorn review
","I wrote and posted this review using my computer and the internet, and you are reading this review using a computer and the internet – it's not a secret technology has forever changed how we function, operate and interact with other people; technology has become a big part of our everyday life. And from the looks of it, technology in the future will become more and more advanced and will soon play an even bigger part in our life. Spike Jonze's latest movie – Her – deals with the topic of human obsession with technology (among other things) and is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while.Set in what is, possibly, the near future, 'Her' follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely man whose job is to write love letters in the name of other people. He leads a troubled life – he's recently gotten separated (but not divorced) from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) and he spends his solitary life, mostly, by having a hard time prioritizing between video games and Internet porn. Apart from his work colleagues Paul (Chris Pratt) and Amy (Amy Adams), he has no interactions with other people whatsoever. One day he decides to purchase an operating system, chooses the operating system's voice to be female and the operating system introduces herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Soon he falls in love with her.While the premise of 'Her' is rather simple and the movie itself isn't groundbreakingly original (it tends to get kind of predictable and it somewhat reminded me of Lars and the Real Girl), Spike Jonze easily managed to overcome these obstacles and to create a very sweet and charming movie. And he managed to do all that by creating fascinating, appealing characters and developing interesting relationships between them. The relationship between Samantha and Theodore is at the same time unquestionably touching and challengingly provocative. 'Her' attempts to portray more than stereotypical love: it attempts to analyze the nature of love itself, the nature of people, and the nature of artificial intelligence – and it often works both as a character study and as a philosophical movie.Even though Theodore's compassion and love for Samantha can be rationally explained, his actions are still undoubtedly driven by his emotions. It's the same for me. My love for 'Her' could easily be rationalized – I could explain how Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as ever, how Scarlett Johansson is the perfect choice for the sensual voice of Samantha, how the movie's soundtrack is great, how Spike Jonze's directing is brilliant and how it accurately portrays the human race's obsession with technology without patronizing too much – but all these arguments fall flat in comparison with the fact that 'Her' is a heartwarming, heart-wrenching, soul-stirring and a very beautiful story overall.Rating: 9/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",9,1,3,15 January 2014
