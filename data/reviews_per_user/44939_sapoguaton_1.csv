Scarface," the original is better, for long
","This is a good movie, that is a fact. But its predecessor, the 1932 Hawks movie, its a lot better. First, Muni is a lot more credible like a half stupid and half brute criminal, who fight in the world where all is possible in the only way that his brain can handle. In Muni character violence is essential and a particular language to deal with a world open for anyone that can handle it. Muni, at the opposite side of Pacino, is very human, human to act and human to die, and he die as his boss die under his hands, how any criminal, in a good tale about moral and the right way to do things define, must to die: praying for his life, defenseless against a society that is a lot more than him. Its not a minor point, in fact its a huge point, the radical difference between Muni shoot dead for policemen without excess and Pacino fighting some kind the little war against numberless henchmen send by a drug Bolivian landlord. A lot more credible is also the Muni sister reaction, who at last just must to recognize the undeniable fact that both are the same because are in the same side of the world, than the Pacino sister with all that twisted incestuous allusion, besides the incredible bad skill with the gun. If you liked this over-sized remake you must to watch the original one...",5,0,2,26 September 2012
