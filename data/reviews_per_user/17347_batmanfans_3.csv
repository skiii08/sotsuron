Ford v Ferrari," Good entertainer but not in a documentary, story telling, screenplay sense
",Its fun and all but it lacks the real story and the tension.. thats where it lacks.. it's fun.. but.. not accurate.. if u can get me,7,0,1,4 December 2019
Knives Out," People compare last jedi and rated this film high or honestly, genuinely rate this film (dillema)
",The rating is low.. due to it being very predictable and being overrated.. you can guess it within half and hour or within 45 minutes max.. and even if you didn't it gives you hints halfway.. and even if you didn't find it till the end.. (seriously) you're dumb.. You're actually dumb.. i can't express it even more explicitly.. the casting itself is obvious..It doesn't feel like a whodunnit.. really.. i didn't feel the twists.. i didn't get the ohhh factor.. if you can get me..A perfect popcorn or netflix entertainer for sure.. but.. not as a masterpiece.. not really a perfect whodunnit.. I'm just disappointed.. really.. i expected alot and i didn't get the end result.. maybe you should go into this movie with lowest expectations possible..,4,5,12,4 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I would rather watch The Last Jedi 10 more times that watch this ðŸ˜”
","The ending that we fans were not looking for..I didn't believe the negative reviews.. (shame on me)Please don't go to this movie.. save ur time and money.. i beg of you..The VFX and the composition is the only thing that is good.. the rest is garbage..They ruined this franchise.. they ruined the story, its characters, George Lucas vision..Bad screenplay, bad choreography..It also fails as a standalone movie and it also fails as a entertainer..There is a lot of things they ruined story wise.. they essentially ruined star wars franchise as a whole.",1,48,84,25 December 2019
