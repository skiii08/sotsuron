Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 9 out of 10
","I wanted to give it a 10 of 10, but the truth is that it wasn't as sublime as, say, Hitchcock's Vertigo, so I couldn't do that. However, it was only when I saw Vol 2 that I realized the extent of Quentin's brilliance in composing these two back-to-back blockbusters. Considering the length of these films, esp when laid back-to-back, it is amazing to me the mastery Quentin has over his material that not a moment is wasted. Far from it, every moment is poignant with some kind of word, action, music, or other, and it all fits like a dovetail, like a man who knows what he's doing and is going about it with a sense of purpose. I've been a fan of all his films until now, from Reservoir Dogs to Pulp Fiction to Jackie Brown, and I can say that it was worth the wait.As for the acting, as usual the casting is superb. Unlike the usual parade of stars, Quentin finds the people who've been out of the limelight for sometime, or were never quite in it, and somehow or other they are great actors and actresses in front of his cameras. This time, for me, it was David Carradine who was the surprise. And there were many other great performances throughout, but of course this is blondie's movie. I don't think there's a moment that goes by with her on the screen that I am not filled with lust and desire for her body and her soul.This is an absolute masterpiece and my only question is: when's the next one Quentin?",9,0,1,5 March 2005
Vertigo," one of the greatest works of art, alltime
","There are many good films, and it may seem pretentious to think in terms of superlatives.  There are many good paintings, good plays, good books, but then there are some that tower just so high that they dwarf everything around them and defy analysis of any kind, either technical or aesthetic.I have just about every film which appears in the 'top 250' here at imdb, and Vertigo is my favorite, by a steep margin.  It's sublime, it hits on so many cylinders.  The color, the lighting, the symbolism, the drama, the personal dilemmas, the acting, the direction.There are some moments in art that are so rare, that they cannot even be measured by media, let alone eras.  In the genre of staged drama, 19th century and forward, I see maybe four titans: Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, and Hitchcock.  I can't think of any other movie director who soars as high, and it's not just Hitchcock who soars high in this movie.  It's also Bernard Hermann's music and Jimmy Stewart's acting.  It's the people who shot the film.  It's just a magical moment. What makes it happen?  Hitchcock, who is not only at the height of his powers, but is delving so deep into his subconscious that it defies analysis.  He creates an image in a movie with the same frenzied detail that Scotty seeks as he re-creates Madelaine.  The richness of Hitchcock's vision here is without rival in this history of film, as far as I am aware.As for other great Hitchcock films, there are Rear Window, Notorious, North by Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, and one of my personal favorites, Psycho.  But this one, Vertigo, this one goes all the way into Hitch's deepest thoughts.  It may very well be the greatest artistic creation of the 20th century.  It is certainly one of them.",10,10,15,23 May 2003
Shakespeare in Love," no substance
","Geoffrey Rush should have played the part, instead of a supporting role. He clearly has the bearing and the depth to bring the fractured soul and eagle-like genius of Shakespeare to the stage. Not that boy, the tall thin handsome one. They coughed up the truth. But this was just the beginning.This play serves as the ultimate turn-off for potential Shakespeare fans and established ones alike. Skeptical neophytes often dismiss Shakespeare, assuming that fans are merely drawn to Elizabethan pronouns, accents, and costumes. Their prejudice will be confirmed by this picture, if they assume this is a reflection of the real thing. The language is uninspired, even by Hollywood's standards. Bugs Bunny does a better job of twisting a line. The hallmarks of Shakespeare's writing go missing here. I wonder - how many people were tempted to read a Shakespeare play who never had, based on a viewing of this movie? Mozart got a better 'shake' with Amadeus, a movie which generated enthusiasm for his music. Amadeus patronized banality, but never sunk below.Terrible music also.I give this movie a 3, in honor of the costumes and staging.",3,8,16,19 January 2002
North by Northwest," blueprint for the 007 series
","This is the first and the best of the cold war spy thrillers, with a possible exception for Smiley's People.   But this one is perfect.  There isn't a wasted scene, and the momentum keeps going.  There's a lot of interesting dualities and psychological substance to ponder, and it's plenty thrilling besides.  Oddly, the romance appears a little cold to me.  2 planes, 2 trains, 1 elevator, 2 automobiles, this one takes Hitch's older b&w Saboteur and raises it to a whole new level.   Saboteur is pretty good too though, and viewers who like this should check that out.",10,0,0,4 May 2003
Being John Malkovich," uneven, but has bright spots
","There are some good performances by John Cusack and Cameron Diaz. The heart of the matter for me though is the moment when John Malkovitch becomes John Malkovitch. It's one of the best comedic sequences in motion pictures. I won't spoil it for you beyond that, but it's worth pointing out that John Malkovitch is a splendid actor who carries this movie on his back. He's only in it for about 1/3 of the time, but during that time I get a reminder of what a great talent really is, even if he is full of himself, with his periwinkle bathmat, LOL. The director loses focus during an extended session where we see proof that the puppeteer has become John. There's an interview with Sean Penn which does nothing to advance the story.The character Maxine is an intimidating and disheartening reminder of how beautiful single women can sometimes behave.",7,0,1,15 January 2005
Saving Private Ryan," excellent war film with occasionally poor dialogue
","In terms of verisimilitude to an actual battlefield, Saving Private Ryan is without a peer in the history of film. I go back to the 1910s, Birth of a Nation, which had some panoramic battle scenes, and to Platoon, which had some credible scenes, to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now (which is the closest challenger for realism), Black Hawk Down, The Big Parade (wonderfully realistic early silent film of WW One), and many others. None of those takes so much effort and genius in recreating a probable past, in terms of recreating the war torn battlefields/villages in the most minute detail. The first 20 minutes of this film are a landmark by which all other war films will eventually be measured.Tom Hanks is the emotional anchor for this film, giving us a portrayal that is sensitive yet firm. He's not of the blood and guts John Wayne tradition. His character is a thoughtful man who finds himself in a position to, in his view, do some good in the world by managing this apocalypse on earth in such a way that it actually saves lives.Spielberg's consistent attention to visual detail and style is what sets SPR apart. The images are grainy, and rely on blues, greens, grays, and browns, with scarcely any red or yellow. He creates battlefield scenery with precision, accuracy, and depth of field. Wonderful work.Meanwhile, set against this, is a dialogue which can be passively entertaining at times. The urgent conversations in the battlefield are most effective. However, some of the more heavy conversations which take place during the lulls are so poorly thought out, I can scarcely believe any professional screenwriter could have been associated with them. This is a recurrent problem.Finally, I guess it couldn't be avoided that a film like this would attempt to advance allied propaganda. Genreally, the film tries to stay away from that, and I give it credit, but at other times the propaganda asserts itself in a subtle way which detracts from the overall effect. Most Americans and Western Europeans are numb to this, but I notice it and it disappoints me, although I will reckon that this film does not lose itself in propaganda. It's just an overtone.",9,1,3,30 January 2005
Schindler's List," worth seeing
","This film gets sucked up as fuel for propaganda by those in the west who continue to nurture the Holocaust industry for all it's worth. This film stays true to the filmmaker's desires, which is to present a quasi-historical, quasi-fictional account of the German incarceration of Jewish prisoners in WWII.The film does a good job of depicting the dehumanizing treatment and mental torture, as well as the robbery of prisoners' personal effects.The acting is very good and the pace is lively. For a long film, it's easy to watch.It's good that there are films like this, but it's a pity that Hollywood hasn't made a similar film about the Palestinians who are holed up in the refugee camps, with Israeli occupation tanks and such surrounding them. It would make an interesting epilogue. Perhaps one day.",8,9,13,11 January 2005
The Elephant Man," 9 out of 10
","I wish I had as much time to comment on this movie as some of they put into this movie. I will try to make a sensible comment in a short space of time.It's not my favorite film, there are some problems with it. I'm not sure of the life of John Merrick (sp?) other than what is related by this film, but I would imagine the film would have been more challenging (to us, the viewers) if the deformed man wasn't so sweet, contrite, and appreciative. Perhaps the meanness of his treatment should have been reflected in his behavior. This would have presented us with a more difficult dilemma, of having to penetrate not only the visual aura of this sick man, but also a barbed personality.However, they took the easy way out of making John Merrick a wholly sympathetic character. The film delivers something of the black and white industrial age austerity of David Lynch's preceding film Eraserhead (which is sadly becoming hard to find). I thought Eraserhead was a more tightly focused on advancing those kinds of atmospheres.The acting in this film as one would expect, considering the quality of the actors involved, a stellar British cast. Just look at all the names. These are great actors and actresses.This film could have been better, but measuring it against the other films I know (including most of the films in the IMDb top 250), this definitely deserves a place even higher than it's been rated. I would have liked more time spent on the John Merrick's personal character.",9,2,3,4 February 2005
Black Hawk Down," full length feature/commercial for armed services
","Join the modern US army, which is engaged in killing natives everywhere. I'm waiting for the follow-up about the 'Gulf Wars'. A film like this celebrates every lost American life as if it was the greatest sacrifice after Christ, but takes no pains in bringing us the faces of many of the dark skinned people who are mowed down by machine guns. They are just animals, targets, and legitimate targets of course.Hear the US soldiers bemoan fighting a war with one hand tied behind their backs. Why can't they just nuke the place?All in all, this is a glitzy package of war production and war propaganda from the (i.e. with the support of) the US government. If you're pro-war on any pretext and like 'flying the flag', this one is for you.From a dramatic standpoint, there really isn't meaningful drama, although one aborted rescue attempt is memorable. I must say though, the one photo which actually made the news footage back then said volumes more than this movie ever did.",3,7,16,27 January 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," nice film
","** possible spoilers **Part of my attraction to this film is admittedly Nicole Kidman's beauty, Tom Cruise's performance.  Kubrick is visually stunning, as always.What is this film about?  It's a film noir, in vivid color rather than black n white.  It's a film about sexual intoxication, and about fidelity. Through all of Tom's escapades and Nicole's dreams, their two characters remain faithful.This film is a document of a real life marriage, between Nicole and Tom, and their breakup was probably mirrored well by this plot, the only difference being that the characters have a daughter whereas Nicole and Tom did not have any children.  I wonder whether their divorce was already in the cards prior to shooting this film, or whether perhaps this film served as something of a catalyst.At the film's conclusion, Nicole's character tells Tom's that she cannot guarantee endless fidelity, but that they should have sex and play it day-by-day.  In other words, the only resolution is that the two characters finally have sex.  Neither of the characters had sex with anyone through the duration of a film which is saturated with sexual fantasy and orgies. 
This film is about how marital relationships and sexual relationships interact.  The film also documents the effects of economic/class standing and its effect on sexual expectation.  And it's a very colorful   moving picture.",9,0,1,14 May 2003
Psycho," Hitch's best
","With so many great films, how can we pick Hitch's best?  For me, this is it. The Victorian house, the b&w, all of Hitch's convoluted personality conflicts and dualities all rolled into his most direct masterpiece, plus Bernard Hermann, so good for so long, has never been as effective as he was here.  Many other good films to be sure, such as Vertigo, N/NW, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (34), 39 Steps, Frenzy, but this one has the most impact for me.  Vertigo is a close second, very close.",10,1,2,4 May 2003
Jaws," I guess I have to fall in line here and...
","....give this movie praise, along with everyone else. In the beginning, it's a shallow, predictable, embarrassing 1970s 'horror/shock' flick.By the time the longshoreman enters the picture, along with the bearded scientist, the movie takes on a whole new tenor. Now it's about something else, something eternal, and this is where the movie finds its light. This is why the movie is revered the way it is. There's something cosmic about that shark, the skipper, the scientist, and the policeman. These people love the shark (except for the cop), and they hate each other. They are jealous lovers of a shark, in a fatal embrace.A good story for kids or adults, it transcends itself.",8,4,9,27 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," great
","Given everything that had to go into this film: a confluence of music, effects, and acting, I have to tip my proverbial hat. I grew up mesmerized by the 1977 Star Wars ('may the force be with you' was a cultural touchstone), and the Empire Strikes Back (1980) was a worthy successor. Return of the Jedi was a slip into insipid sentimentalism and puppetry, a case of style over substance.When Lucas began this second trilogy of prequels, like many I could not sit through the first installment, and skipped the second. The word of mouth on this third was so good, I had to check it out and I'm glad I did.There are enough images here, with a story rich enough to make me feel fully engaged. The horrific images of the burnt Anakin clawing from the flowing lava with a delighted Senator Palpatine nearby is worthy of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.The music goes a long way towards advancing the film. At times the effects seem little more than a blur, but they can also impress.I strongly recommend this film for all movie goers, of all ages.",9,2,5,17 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Not
","I've been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months, but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film, I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of view.The Shawshank Redemption is an obvious, thinly characterized, visually uncompelling film.  Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the  white guy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and reflections.  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve.3 out of 10.   For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark.  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke.  I heartily agree with those choices.",4,11,23,9 July 2001
Jackie Brown," questions and thoughts
","This will undoubtedly contain some spoilersJackie Brown is, in some ways, a rejuvenation of the Carmen opera.  In Carmen, the exotic, beautiful, willful outlaw of a woman seduces a straight arrow soldier of the barracksAbout Max Cherry, the film in many ways centers around him.  All the other characters are acting almost entirely out of selfish motivations.  Max takes considerable personal risk to help a woman he adores, and yet he doesn't impose himself sexually on her, and asks only his 10% professional rateWhen Jackie tells Max that she never used him, he replies 'I never said you did'.  That doesn't necessarily exclude the possibility that he did think that.  In my opinion, Jackie did use Max, and Max did what he did for her knowing that she was using him.   Max is in true love.  Jackie was smart enough to use Max in a way that didn't hurt him, to be honest with him about her true intentions via the plan, and thereby establish an intellectual intimacy.  Jackie may be an enticing woman, but Max's feelings for her actually enhance our perception of her beauty.  Max's ability to appreciate people for who they are rather than what they can bring him is what makes this movie unique.  Without Max, this movie would only be a story about greed and money.  Jackie never does anything for anyone but herself.   Her only redeeming quality is that she is able to realize Max's love for her and use him in a way that doesn't belittle him, i.e. she's honest with himI am confused about several parts of the plot.  I don't understand the switch in the Trial Run.  I don't see Sheronda handing any bag to Simone. Simone isn't facing Jackie, but Ordell said he wanted her there so that she could see how it went down.   If they've exchanged the bag already, why does Simone bother to ask Sheronda for the time?   What gives Simone the knowledge/sense of when is the right time to ask?  If Jackie doesn't know that Simone is going to be there, how does Max know to stay, waiting to follow Simone after Sheronda has left?  Clearly Simone got the money, because she vacated her premises immediately after.  Jackie approaches Ordell in anger because she claims not to have anticipated Simone being part of the plan.  Again, if that's so, how does Max know to watch her?  And if it's not so, then why does Jackie put on the charade of being surprisedI am confused about the scene where Ordell gets shot.  Ordell calls Jackie, who is at Max's office, and then Jackie quickly dials other people: probably Winston and the police.  They all arrive pretty quickly.  I wonder what Jackie would have told them to induce them to go there and wait in the back room.  It just seems like a lot to have happen without an explanation. Furthermore, I think it is out of character for Ordell to walk into a trap like that.  He already knows he can't trust JackieI am confused about the scene where Max comes out of the movie and passes Ordell.  Max goes to meet Jackie in what looks like a pre-arranged meeting. Ordell thinks something is suspicious when he seems them together.  Well, duh?!  Why doesn't he at least tail her and quiz her later about this?I have noticed that the bag of money shifts in the dressing room seat between the time Jackie and Max are in the fitting room",10,0,1,16 January 2003
Jackie Brown," beautiful love story
","There's something beautiful about a character who has grown, experienced life's many letdowns, first hand, and emerged from an angry, vengeful, egotistical, attention-seeking twirp into a reticent, humble, calmer, sadder/happier adult.  How do you feel about getting older?  This is the question of the movieI'm getting older.  Pam Grier and Robert Forester, in their roles, reminded me of the grace that comes with age.  I've read other comments on this board, about how some people feel that this film almost gave us the impression that we have been living with these people for some time, and gotten to know them pretty well.  I feel like I definitely got to know them. That sad quality of Robert Forester, the melancholic mood, it's become more and more a part of my character.  The unrequited aspect of the plot, it too is something I can identify with.  And Pam's character, she's such a wonderful person anyway.  She's had her hard knocks, in real life.  Haven't we all?  But she wears it well.   To me this is a triumph of character. Jackie triumphs over the people she must overcome, while staying true to the one person who is true to her: Max Cherry.  Max is true to just about everyone, and he is the most sympathetic character in the filmI saw Reservoir Dogs when it came out, and loved it.  I laughed when a friend described it as the 'feel good movie of the year'.  I thought Pulp Fiction was, to a certain extent, a sell out, in that it took the basic ideas of Reservoir Dogs, and made them more saleable by virtue of the big names: Bruce Willis and John Travolta.  So, when the bad reviews came in for Jackie Brown, I figured his goose was cooked.  Here we are in January 2003, and I only just saw Jackie Brown for the first time one month ago.  It has become my new favorite film.  It has replaced the Sorrow and the Pity as the 'regular' flick in my VCR.  I think I have seen it eight times, or moreI'd say this is his best film yet.  Granted, we needed the other two films to get to the point where we are now, but his story of redemption, and tender, unrequited love, the acting, the soundtrack, the casting (except De Niro, who was underplaying to a fault) - it's a combination that I can't easily forget.  My favorite scenes are, first, when Max meets Jackie at the gate, as that song is playing.  And, second, in their last meeting, the tender kiss and the even more poignant look on Max's face as he excuses himself from his phone conversation to look out the window, with that 8 year old look on his face, I can feel his stomach getting sockedIt's a bittersweet film.  It's a calmer film.  For those who say it isn't 'Pulp Fiction', or at that level, all I can say is that I actually prefer Jackie Brown.  These characters are loveable. Even Samuel Jackson's dispicable character is otherwise loveable, or at least valuableI love the people who put this movie together",10,0,1,11 January 2003
All the President's Men," fine but politically motivated
","The film gives the impression of being factual, but of course this is a movie, and an expertly done movie at that.Some people may find the office atmosphere stifling, but it all contributes to an air of authenticity.  The acting, each line and gesture, is marvelous. But this movie is also a piece of left-wing politics.",Null,2,9,19 January 2002
