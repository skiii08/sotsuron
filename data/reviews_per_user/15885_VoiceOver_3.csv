The Blair Witch Project," Boo!
","I originally saw this movie during a visit in the US and at the time quite enjoyed it. Of course a lot of hype was surrounding this movie, but if the audience member is willing to suspend disbelief and allow him- or herself to be taken by the hand by our three starting moviemakers, he/she will experience a spooky evening, that long afterwards will be remembered. It's a refreshing movie in a genre that according to some, to which I include myself, was walking on its last legs.Negative publicity surrounding this movie was often aimed at the amateuristic filming, but to the viewer that enters the cinema open minded this only increases the sense of realism.Of course, planning any outings involving hiking in woods immediately after seeing this movie I'd discourage, but that's just wimpy old me.",Null,0,1,18 September 2001
Amélie," All is forgiven!
","I hereby forgive Jeunet for his horrific trip to the Hollywood dungheap called 'Alien 4', since just in time, before getting too contaminated, he has retraced his steps back to France and made the type of movie again that we all enjoyed so much before, even though this obviously is quite a step away as well from both Delicatessen and La cité des enfants perdus. Audrey Tatou (and no, she's no bloody Audrey Hepburn, Americans always try to claim something as their own; get a life and lose that inferiority complex, however well deserved) is simply magical in this movie and I only hope she can make movies after this without being identified with this part. Jeunet's direction is flawless and while his past movies leaned a bit towards stringing together a series of visual ideas, this time his creativity is completely subservient to the story and that's why this is his best film to date. Anybody who doesn't like this movie should check their heartbeat, because I'm sure they will find it missing.",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
Cube," Sliced and diced
","A well made and original sci-fi/horror movie and a shame it was never released in the regular cinemas in my country. Luckily it's been released by now both on video as well as on DVD.The story involves a group of people that wake up in a construction made up only of cubes. They don't know how or why they ended up there except that they better get out since their captors didn't see fit to supply them with either food or drink. Each cube on each side is connected to another one and some can be entered safely, while others contain deadly booby traps of diverse nature, a fact pointed out to the viewer already in the spectacular opening scene. To put it mildly it is a risky undertaking that awaits the characters of mixed plumage and they'll need each other badly to complete their journey, if they can that is, which naturally I won't divulge.The relationships between the characters are fascinating and include surprising developments that perhaps sometimes seem a bit far fetched and over the top, but they do raise the suspense in this low budget movie. The movie looks, especially in view of the low costs, very well and suspense is kept up right until the end.As a first, this movie by Canadian director Vincenzo Natali shows great talent. For what it's worth, I'd recommend it to any horror/sci-fi afficionado.",Null,0,1,18 September 2001
