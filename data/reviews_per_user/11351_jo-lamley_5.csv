The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," loved it
","This film is great, seen all the Twilight saga they are all great. I don't know if this is the best film out of all of the Twilight saga, I think that the first film is probably the best. but love this film I think it is quite bloody in places and makes you cringe at part when she is giving birth but other wise it is great. The start is different not like the other films because it goes straight into the film. it is happy at the start but gets worse as it goes along. I would warn people that it does leave you on a dramatic end and you want to know what happenes next. which is very annoying if you have to wait a year to see the next film in the saga, lucky I got warned about this and waited until breaking dawn part 2 was nearly out so I didn't have to wait as long.",6,0,6,20 November 2012
Dear John," So Sad
","This is one of the saddest films I have ever watched, I have never read the book but I love the film. the Actors are great and really make the film. I have watched the film twice now and both times I have cried at it, it is so sad and I think even people who don't cry at films will cry at this film. The film is one of those films that people cannot miss if you miss even a short minute of it you will not know what is happening everything is relevant to the story. this is good because you don't get bored of it, you have to be watching all the time. I think the film could be better at the end and tell us a little bit more and if they got back together to if they just meet by chance again.",8,0,1,21 November 2012
The Bourne Identity," Great
","This is a great film which I would recommend to anyone who loves action films and the spy type of film. This is not like the normal type of spy film it is very different to most of the others. This makes it a must see. One thing that let it down was the car action which you could tell was fake but apart from that the film was spotless. You didn't actually see him doing his job and his task, instead you got him running away from the people he work for that are trying to kill him. The actors in the film are great they play the roles really good and that the thing seem real like you are in the actual film and part of the people in the film. It is gripping near the end and you just want to know what happens and if he is going to die.",7,3,3,8 February 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Amazzing
","It is the best film in the Twilight saga, i loved the rest but this one tops all of the movies I have ever watched. Great effects and great plot bit different from the book but it makes it better than the book, all the best bits from the book are in it but also there are bits that you want to happen in it so it makes it even greater.If you love Twilight you will love this film it has everything and I know I may sound cheesy saying its great but it really is. I advice everyone to see it even if you don't like twilight. It also has a good ending which is always good if it the last one and it ties all the films together so nothing is left out.",7,5,13,28 November 2012
Taken 2," Good but not Great
","I have never seen the first movie taken so I didn't really know what to expect but my friends said that the first one was good so I went with them to see the second one they had told me what the first one was like and it sounded good. I watched it and thought that it was good not great but it was worth the money as I only paid Â£4.00 because I has orange Wednesday but I wouldn't have paid anymore. My friends said after, that the first film was better but I would recommend it because it was good but don't get your hopes up if you have already seen the first one and expected this one to be better because it isn't. I don't think they should have made another film because it is basically the same as the first but a different person gets taken.",6,0,0,12 October 2012
