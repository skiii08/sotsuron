Gremlins," Wickedly funny classic
","Gremlins is the classic creature-feature with the lovable cutie Gizmo and his offsprings who set the small town of Kingston Falls completely ablaze when their owner Billy fails on one of the 3 crucial rules; feeding them after midnight.Everybody knows Gremlins and it's a complete classic. Gizmo was a household name in the 80's and most kids had numerous toys and teddy's of him. Snow White got somewhat revived as it was the creatures' favorite film and that's just funny. Many hilarious moments are here as the Gremlins start chewing up the little town and wrecking more havoc than George W. Bush could with all his arsenal (Mrs. Deegle's fate is, as said before, a classic).Gremlins was so good when I was a kid but you notice some other things as well when you see it as an adult. The level of violence is surprisingly brutal and the little critters are very, very nasty. This is nasty humor all the way. And my god is Zach Galligan a horrible actor. I thought David Duchovny was the most expressionless actor around but I was wrong. There are also some very downbeat moments thrown in here which could so easily have been edited out (a point which Gremlins 2 actually made fun of).Overall the film completely deserves the classic stamp though. Gizmo is priceless, the critters even more priceless and it's wickedly funny with many hidden gems (ever noticed that time machine at the convention!). And it's surprisingly well crafted with good special effects that don't look bad at all today.",7,0,2,18 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk re-imagined
","This re-imagining of the green Goliath works far better than Ang Lee's 2003 outing, that's for sure. Being an avid admirer of the Bixby/Ferrigno series in the late seventies and early eighties I found this film to be closer in spirit to the series and I definitely liked that.The Hulk's origins are played out at the very beginning and once that's over and done with audiences are in for a fast paced and enjoyable ride. The film attempts to keep people who liked the series happy as well as the crowd who want it firmly rooted in Marvel tradition. The Hulk battles a foe called The Abomination in the final third, and by the way that fight is pretty awesome, and I gather that that's a person to be found in the original comics.While some aspects from the film can be linked to the original series, the characters here are from the comics. Here are General Ross and his daughter, who were also present in Ang Lee's version. The Hulk not only battles The Abomination but also the U.S. Army and that wasn't the case with the series. Banner did get captured by the army at one point but that was never a recurring thing.But a big thumbs up for the homages to the old series. Only a few minutes in we're greeted with a small tribute to the late Bill Bixby, as Norton switches channels in Brazil and watches for a few seconds an episode from 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father'. Lou Ferrigno gets a small speaking part that comes off very well, a journalist named Jack McGee is mentioned and that envelope with 'David B.' was a nice touch. I think all the fans of the original series appreciated these little touches.While Eric Bana was one of the few things that was positive about Hulk (2003), Norton betters him here. He's such a natural performer and he can convey so much with mere expressions. He was the perfect choice to play Banner, in some ways he reminded me of Bixby. Tim Roth is one of those actors who's always good and he doesn't falter here. But William Hurt really surprised me. I've always thought he was good but I'd have to say this is his finest performance in many years. General Ross is a much better written character here than in the 2003 version and Hurt simply excels in the part.As for the CGI, they work really well. The Hulk looks extremely cool and far better here. He doesn't continue to grow as he gets angrier and while that may annoy some I actually found it a plus. And those huge leaps are history as well, he jumps far enough but nothing compared to Ang Lee's version.The Incredible Hulk does well what it intends to do which is entertain. It's full of action, very well acted and fairly well written overall.",8,3,5,16 June 2008
As Good as It Gets," Simply great
","As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining. It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.What works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.",9,53,71,19 September 2005
Closer," Relationships aren't all fun and games
","Closer is a brutal, uncompromising, sometimes quite witty but most importantly a very sober examination of relationships.Expertly performed by a top notch cast, their characters feel real and authentic in their bravery and utmost cowardice. While the characters aren't fully fleshed out they seem very authentic and may even provoke viewers to examine their own personal lives. The dialog, while pretty rough at times, is also spot on.You really don't know who to hate and who to sympathize with and that's the beauty of the film. The people are so flawed and most likely you're left pitying them instead of despising them. Seldom has a film about relationships left me so stunned and yet so speechless. I find it very hard to put into words why it moves me so. Watching these people rip the guts out of one another in this dry fashion is indeed very sobering.I highly recommend this film but, admittedly, you have to be in the mood for it.",9,1,2,5 September 2008
Rocky II," Entertaining with a great finale
","While this is by no means as effective a movie as the first one, this is however a worthy sequel and entertaining as hell.You all know the story; Rocky, a media sensation after the fight with Appollo Creed agrees to fight the champion one more time. In the meantime he gets married, spends all his money, has a baby, gets on with training and competes in the coolest boxing match ever filmed (f*** Cinderella Man).This is basically a repeat of the first film. Rocky's down, gets up, goes back down, gets up and gets the job done with style. Stallone, director here as well as the writer, does a good job in every department, making Rocky II an entertaining (if a bit overlong) sequel that's sure to delight everyone who liked the first film. The film feels like treaded ground, but isn't that what we want? That final fight is awesome even to this day, Stallone spent 4 months alone editing it. It payed off.",7,1,1,9 October 2005
Notting Hill," Charming romantic comedy
","A fantastic movie, really. I found out you don't even have to be a fan of Hugh Grant (although I am personally) to really get the charm of this movie. Grant goes through all his usual stutters and silly manners but that's a thing he does very well. But Notting Hill doesn't have to rely on Hugh Grant alone, it's simply got a very witty and intelligent script by Richard Curtis (who later went on to write and direct Love Actually), fantastic British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral), Julia Roberts at her most charming and best and a bundle of supporting actors who are quite simply excellent.Despite a 2 hour running time the film's never overlong. Full of sentiment to go along with the humor the 2 hours plus go by very fast.Highly recommended.",9,0,1,4 December 2005
The Thing," One of those perfect horror films
","The Thing is one of those perfect horror films. Everything seems to fall into place. In short this is a magnificent viewing experience.I assume you know the plot so I won't go into it here. It was a strong move by Carpenter to utilize to original plot from the short story 'Who Goes There?'. The Thing has the ability to assume the identity of it's host and therefore can go about undetected among the men. This causes the immense feeling of distrust among them and Carpenter milks it for all it's worth. In the original there was simply a guy in a costume portraying The Thing and that was a real letdown.By setting the film in a virtually timeless no-man's land, Antarctica, Carpenter maximizes the utter isolation with it's magnificent snowbound scenery and bitter cold. When all radio contact has failed, these men are quite simply alone in the world. And when The Thing starts absorbing them one by one, up until the point that we have no idea who is left intact, their isolation and despair become frightfully real and tangible to the audience.Carpenter's direction is nothing short of spectacular. This film, along with Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13, is his crowning achievement. Genuinely haunting, terribly suspenseful with an eerie, all to real ending, this is one film you won't forget easily. Ennio Morricone's music, which is very similar to Carpenter's own orchestral works, is quite simply stunning. Operating like a slow, emotionless heartbeat, it enhances the impact of every scene. Another triumph for this movie are the special effects. This is 1982 and I have yet to see a horror film that surpasses this one in terms of monster effects. Granted the effects are disgusting but, very importantly, do not lessen the impact of the story. It never succumbs to being a special effects extravaganza, it's limited to only a handful of scenes. In short, this film is unbearably athmospheric and has terrific special effects to boot. They make the film more effective, and that's a rare thing in a horror movie.The performances by the actors are superb. Carpenter regular Kurt Russell makes a solid hero and the rest do an impeccable job in varied roles.One of the best horror films ever, top 10 easily. Can't recommend it enough.",10,1,2,3 June 2005
The Village," Disappointing
","I assume you've read the storyline elsewhere, so I'll skip it.I was profoundly disappointed by this movie.  Shyamalan has shown himself to be a unique and utterly capable director (Sixth Sense, Signs) but also not infallible (the utterly boring Unbreakable).  Here he is on Unbreakable territory.  He completely indulges himself in every little thing, assuming the viewer is so captivated in what he has to say here, which in the end is nothing special at all.  Worst of all, he has little flashbacks of dialouge near the end, telling us that 'intelligent viewers' could have figured out the plot.  What's most irritating is that I get the feeling he crams these surprise twists just for the sake of surprise twists.  He did it brilliantly with The Sixth Sense, but here, it seems idiotic.  But to say this movie is bad is not a fair assessment.  Shyamalan is very good at creating a moody athmosphere and he can create genuine suspense out of almost nothing.  He makes me jump out of my seat a few times, with well timed shocks (maybe he should make a full blown horror film).  But when the end result is anything but interesting, what preceeds it seems somehow a cheat, a false buildup. The packaging looks good, but there's no substance.Another plus are the performances.  William Hurt is excellent, it's always nice to see Sigourney Weaver and Phoenix is his usual good, but somehow sterotypical, self.  5 out of 10.",5,0,0,30 August 2004
Rocky IV," It works for the fourth time. Unbelievable!
","In most respects the Rocky series reached full camp value with the fourth entry. This time The Italian Stallion goes up against a superhuman Russian fighter who, with the aid of steroids apparently, seems to be invincible.Russian boxer Ivan Drago fights with former champ Apollo Creed and literally kills him in the ring. Rocky then decides to battle the Russian in his home country on Christmas Day in an ultimate fight between East and West.The clichés come fast and furiously. Once again Rocky must cope with the loss of a loved one and step up to the plate. Now matter how much he's accomplished, Rocky always ends up as the underdog and must face his greatest challenge yet. The film comes complete with trips down memory lane, Adrian once again bringing him down and then up and, my favorite part, the Russian crowd starting to cheer on Rocky in the boxing match. And of course there's an overblown speech Rocky makes in the end about how everybody can change.But, in the face of all the odds and clichés, Rocky 4 is mostly a winner. It's a huge credit for Stallone how he can make the same formula successful 4 times in a row. Rocky 4 boasts some of the coolest training montages ever and with the help of a knockout music score the film is simply cool. The film clocks in at under 90 minutes so the dramatic parts are handled with speed and viewers don't have to wait long for the action to kick in. There are two training sequences where he's in the snow either running or training furiously with just about everything in sight. Then there's the epic battle between Rocky and Drago in the ring which still today looks smashing.The cast is always right on the money and Dolph Lundgren is still a childhood favorite of mine after playing Drago. Rocky looks quite a bit different but he's still appealing.Rocky 4 is a formula but it's got great set pieces, cool training scenes and a killer soundtrack (No Easy Way Out is probably my favorite ever song). It doesn't move viewers like the first one did but it kills 90 minutes very easily.",7,0,0,8 April 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Overrated
","Although it's quite a novelty to see the character of Andy, the virgin who's 40 years old, depicted as a nice and likable guy this movie is fairly one-dimensional all the way. In the instances that a male virgin is the subject they're usually weird and repulsive in some way, so Andy's character comes as refreshingly original. In some ways he's peculiar; his collection of toys and posters etc. but the film doesn't go overboard in that area. I can imagine that this rite of passage can seem like a mountain to climb if delayed too long, and in Andy's case it might just seem like an impossible task. Relatively late bloomers (say; just over 20) are nervous but how on earth would it be if you're 40.The film has some hilarious moments when focusing on Andy and his ever mounting fear of his impending task. The 'boner' scenes sure do bring back memories. It's when his friends occupy a lot of screen time that the film isn't as interesting. Andy's friends are all complete stereotypes, straight out of American Pie it seems.Subtle messages, such as; 'it's really O.K. to wait for the perfect one' are present but not really hammered on, this film more or less shows you that you truly can't be happy unless you 'do it'. In our sex driven modern atmosphere this movie simply reinforces our believe that sex is the most important thing you will ever encounter.I had high expectations for this film and on the whole was pretty disappointed. There's nothing that justifies over 2 hours running time, the film drags in the end; some pruning would have helped a lot. Still, it has it's moments and a wonderful comic performance by Steve Carrell.",6,0,1,11 February 2006
American History X," Absolutely riveting
","This is one powerful movie. Not only is this movie an excellent showcase of dangerous thinking but also the misguided ways and wisdom that led to it.Edward Norton's performance is nothing short of spectacular, playing basically two versions of the same man. Utterly convincing and extremely menacing as the hateful C.O.D. leader, recruiting armies of impressionable people in the fight against society's parasites. Completely convinced in his cause, there's no better soldier for White Power. Norton's equally convincing as the broken down, fully repentant 'born again' man released from prison, after committing a brutal act of violence.There's no sugar coating here; Norton is as brutal as they come. An intellectual filled with hatred finds just the right place to vent it and his mentor (a slimy and effective Stacey Keach) pushes all the right buttons.No less effective is Edward Furlong, as Norton's impressionable younger brother. Idolizing his brother, Furlong attempts to impress his brother by following in his footsteps, though it's somewhat apparent that he's not at all like his brother in way of thinking. He can be force fed, but ultimately with right guidance he could be steered in the right direction.Also interesting here is the film's statement about where the evil seed is sown. At a casual conversation at dinner time, the hard working father of Norton explains (somewhat clumsily) to him to question things and not take things simply at face value. Displaying some irritation over affirmative action the father exposes some racial concerns that may be attributed to racism. But the overall impression of the man is that he's decent, with some strong viewpoints which all may not agree with, but the scene clearly implies that racism can be passed on. Once his father dies in a shooting, the troubled son focuses his rage in all the wrong places and a figure like Keach provides him a dangerous feeding ground to nurture his rage.But this rage only taints his soul and causes sorrow and heartbreak for all around him and in the end proves quite costly.American History X is a sobering look at a massive world wide problem and it makes a strong case for what kind of people get involved with a cause like White Supremacy. Troubled or alienated kids, looking for a place in a detached cold world could easily find solidarity in a group like this. The same can apply for almost any group, be it a community of gay people, religious groups or activists against seal killing, whatever, people look to belong to some kind of community. The trouble here is that these people breed a dangerous, dividing way of thinking and, at worst, killers for a very misguided cause.American History X is one of those must-see movies. I cannot recommend it enough. Rambling over.",10,0,2,10 February 2009
Back to the Future Part III," Solid closure to the series
","Marty and Doc are now in the Old West and must figure out a way to return to 1985.The first one was perfect. One couldn't figure out how they were going to follow it up with any degree of real success and in the end they didn't. Part II was miles behind the quality of the original and, while it was pretty solid in it's own right, left most viewers dissatisfied. To my utmost surprise (in 1989 at least) the second chapter ended with a brief trailer promising a third, and final, installment. This time in the Old West and then this long story would come to an end.First of all, 'Back to the Future, Part III' is an improvement over Part II. It's more pure fun than the second one and the climax on board the train is quite spectacular. Everything concerning special effects is outstanding but that was also the case with Part II.Director Zemeckis's fetish with having actors play opposite themselves isn't taken to the extremes here as in Part II but the story is still somewhat confusing. I'll never get that part with Clayton Ravine and how on earth Doc managed to build this Super Duper time machine in the end but it's not like the first one was crystal clear either.Fox is always a hoot as Marty and Lloyd is still perfect as Doc. Steenburgen is barely passable as the love interest (something about her always bugs me) but the real star here is Thomas F. Wilson, this time (mostly) playing 'Mad Dog' Tannen, a crazy and quite stupid gunman who's ultimately as unfortunate as his great great grandson Biff. Like in Part II, he completely steals the show and here he has most of the great lines ('Forfeit...what's that mean?', Priceless).",7,6,7,15 March 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Top notch Swedish suspense film
","As a virgin coming into this film; I was very impressed. Having heard nothing but great things said about the book, expectations were pretty high but the film delivered.The mystery is a good one; yes, somewhat clichéd as far as the bible quotes are concerned but well written, suspenseful and always interesting. It's a nice touch how clues are always scattered about and some really insightful viewers may pick up on it.Now the characters; Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is the disgraced journalist who, thanks to his dogged dedication in pursuit of the truth no matter what the cost, gets lured in by a wealthy man to try and solve a forty year old mystery. Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) is the emotionally scarred, tattoo filled and pierced computer hacker who eventually teams up with Blomkvist in his search for the truth. These are two interesting characters, somewhat a cliché if you want to focus on the negative but well played out; especially Lisbeth who we'll probably get to know better in subsequent films. Blomkvist somewhat takes a backseat to Lisbeth but the two complement each other very well.Along with being a good mystery and suspense film; 'Man som hatar kvinnor' is also quite the brutal film, with excessive scenes of rape, beating and utmost humiliation. While somewhat tough to watch, they don't feel out of place and do enhance the plight of one of it's main characters.Technical credits here are also top notch. Terrific cinematography and beautiful scenery abound here, top notch music score as well. All actors come off well, particularly Rapace as Lisbeth.If they do as well with the subsequent films in the series we're well on our way to a great Swedish trilogy of suspense films; and that's only a good thing.Highly recommended.",8,5,9,25 July 2009
The Evil Dead," The king of low-budget horror
","Ultra low-budget horror movies simply don't come any better than this. Wonder kid Sam Raimi concocted a really scary demon flick here and with the use of some incredible camera work, very inventive make-up effects and surprisingly good special effects he made one of the best horror films of the eighties.The woods scenario had been used a lot, even demons had made many appearances but this flick makes it look so fresh and insanely creepy you forget all that stuff and really sink head first into this nightmarish vision. Granted, the fog machine is used way too much and Hal Delrich as Scott is incredibly bad in his role, but still, all this works in the film's favor. Bruce Campbell is very subdued here compared to his Ash in Dead's two subsequent sequels but even this early he shows leading man potential and why he is one of horror's true cult legends.Some scenes here are creepy as hell and it's got a few very nasty shocks in store, even for seasoned horror viewers. Raimi hits all the right notes here; there's a creepy basement, fog bound woods, blood and guts in big doses and there's even a chainsaw here. As said, make-up effects are really spectacular and the gory show still impresses nearly 30 years later. Humor is also well placed and delivered; though this flick is indeed a horror film as opposed to the more comically driven sequels.I really don't know what to say more about 'The Evil Dead' that hasn't been said (and written) many times before. If you're one of the lucky few who hasn't seen this horror masterpiece; stop reading now and go watch it.",9,1,3,13 June 2009
World Trade Center," Blown away; great drama from Stone
","I'm not an American but I did watch the events unfold on TV as most people did. 9/11 had a huge impact on the world and more people than just Americans were shattered about this tragic event.When I read that Oliver Stone was making this film I expected it to be a little on the political side. I was profoundly surprised that it's about the human courage and sadness that the event brought forth. Stone's approach to the film; focusing on two NY policemen and their families as they're trapped in the ruins and awaiting rescue totally grabbed hold of me. I've noticed some negative reviews stating the film doesn't cover enough ground or something like that. I think Stone's right on the mark, displaying the best human beings have to offer in a time of extreme crisis and how we can forgo our worst to help the next guy who needs it.Convincing performances are all around and really bring the characters and their dire situations alive. The highest credit goes to Oliver Stone who here creates a real human drama about human courage and shows us that that's the best way to think of this horrible day. I was blown away and could hardly keep from crying.",9,1,4,22 October 2006
Major League," 'Yo' bartender, Jo-Boo needs a refill'
","A major league baseball team in Cleveland gets taken over by bitchy Whitton who plans to insure that the team performs so badly to finish dead-last. Then she can relocate the team to sunny Miami and live the good life. However, the washed-up and burned-out ballplayers give their all to make sure that doesn't happen, and perhaps even win the championship.This formula driven sports comedy rises above mediocrity thanks to a superb cast, well written one-liners and sure handed direction from the man who brought us the Oscar winning 'The Sting'. Tom Berenger is terrific as a burned-out ball player, James Gammon is a hoot as the coach, 24's Dennis Haysbert is great as Voodoo worshiping Cerrano and even Corbin Bernsen is good as well. But the real star here is Charlie Sheen, displaying a delightful comic talent, as Ricky 'Wild Thing' Vaughn, the half blind, unbeleivably fast-throwing pitcher. The ending, while predictable, is sure to delight. 8 out of 10",8,1,3,21 October 2004
Groundhog Day," A perfect comedy
","Comedies are pretty hard to rate on a cinematic scale. You usually judge them much differently than you would a drama film. Most comedies are lacking in some area and therefore don't usually score high amongst voters. I'm pleased to see that this film is on the top 250 list on IMDb, it SOOOO belongs there, because Groundhog Day is just a perfect comedy.Bill Murray is nothing short of sensational as Phil Connors, the man who visits the town of Punxsutawney to cover The Groundhog festival each year. This to him is a boring assignment and he can't wait to get the hell out of Dodge once his job is done. But fate has a another plan for him, as he awakens each following day and it's always Groundhog Day.This is such a well written, expertly performed and hilarious film and it never fails to amuse, no matter if it's the 10th time you're watching it. The premise is very original, and in lesser hands the film's repetitiveness could have gotten tedious, but with this sure-fire script, Harold Ramis's superb direction and, of course, Bill Murray the film is a non stop laugh riot all the way.Recommended for everybody who enjoys a truly funny film.",10,1,3,13 December 2005
Rocky," 70's trashy fairytale story
","Stallone is just perfect as Rocky, a 'bum' who gets a shot at the Heavyweight title in Boxing. What works perfectly here is the era in which this film was made. I seriously doubt that had this movie been made a decade later it would be half as charming. It's got that glorious 70's trashy style film-making and setting which made films like Midnight Cowboy or even Five Easy Pieces so appealing to begin with. The characters here feel real and authentic, and most of all, completely human. Nothing spectacular about them, more or less lowlifes who wouldn't arouse any interest in other people than social workers perhaps. The script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well. This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and almost feels very real.",9,37,68,9 October 2005
Pretty Woman," Enjoyable fluff
","Overall this is a cute film but in many ways it's highly questionable. I remember when it was released a lot a people felt the film's flamboyant portrayal of prostitution sent a wrong kind of message. In many ways I agree with those people.But putting the harsh realities of the real world aside, Pretty Woman is a fun little film. Never expecting to gross a lot of money, this was a completely unexpected hit in 1990. Keep in mind that Gere's career was going down the toilet and Roberts was still a relative unknown, despite her Oscar nominated performance in Steel Magnolias (and it was Gere who was chosen because of his looks and Roberts because of her charm and talent).Gere and Roberts play extremely well off each other and they're chemistry is what makes the film a success. Roberts isn't believable as a prostitute for a minute but she's so charming you can't really hold that against her. Ditto for Laura San Giacomo, not always a likable performer but here she's a riot as Roberts's best friend. Hector Elizondo proves to be a real scene stealer, as always. Gere is really good as the lonely and somewhat cold business man, he's very low-key and he seems to realize that it's best to let Roberts chew the scenery with him supporting her (and he's a damn fine piano player to boot).This is pure Hollywood fluff all the way and as such it's enjoyable. The upbeat music is fantastic (and has aged surprisingly well) and there are enough heartwarming scenes to ensure that a few hankies are in order for sentimental viewers.Trivia note; I'll be damned if that romantic instrumental tune (credited to James Newton Howard) isn't a complete rip off of Bruce Springsteen's piano intro to 'Racing in the Street' from his 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town. A useless trivia but I just had to mention it.",7,0,1,8 September 2008
Rocky III," Round three and still going strong
","As the Heavyweight champion of the World, Rocky seems to have no peers. Until one Clubber Lang (a mean looking Mr. T) challenges Rocky to a fight. Rocky agrees and gets beaten. A rematch is unavoidable and this time Appollo Creed handles Rocky's training.Third time around? Why on earth not. It worked twice before and this time it works as well. Stallone manages to bring some freshness to the Rocky saga and it's all well played out. The leading characters are fleshed out a bit more and Stallone once again shows that he's quite the talented writer. Rocky's adversary, Mr. T, is more like a villain here than Appollo was in the previous two and Mr. T plays the part wonderfully. As before, the finale doesn't disappoint but it's not as spectacular as in the second.The entire cast do a good job as before, the training montage is great and I completely enjoy cheering Rocky on for the third time around.",7,0,1,9 October 2005
Love Actually," Pure movie magic
","I can't exactly say why I love this film so much, I just do. 
This is one of two, maybe three movies I have seen in my lifetime that I can say is just perfect.  Everything falls into place here.  Every character is interesting, well written and expertly performed by the most irresistable cast ever.  Every story is touching and you wouldn't want to drop any from the film.  If I had to pick a favourite, Colin Firth's romantic adventures and his unforgettable proposal.  And also, who wouldn't want Hugh Grant as Britain's next Prime Minister.The 2 hours plus go by too fast, actually. You laugh, you sigh, you cry (well, very nearly) and when it's over you're all cheered up. 
If that's not movie magic I don't know what is.",10,1,3,30 August 2004
Wedding Crashers," Vaughn and Wilson are terrific
","Wedding Crashers is downright hilarious at times, thanks mainly to the chemistry of it's two stars, though especially Vince Vaughn, who really shines here as the film progresses. Putting aside the fact that the film, nor any of these characters, seem authentic in the least, the film manages to entertain through sheer willingness of everybody involved.It's a bit mushy at times, that ending, I mean how many times do they wrap up these comedies in that fashion, with the hero confessing his love in front of everybody. Well, I could do without it. There are some real cardboard one-dimensional characters here, but hey, let's not nit-pick here, after all, I did laugh out loud on many occasions and left feeling mostly satisfied. Will Ferrell is a riot in his small role.",7,0,1,13 August 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," Fun flick
","I went into this pretty blank; hadn't even seen the trailer - just the tag line 'Live-Die-Repeat' and already I thought of 'Groundhog Day'. Little did I imagine that this would, in fact, be somewhat of a kindred spirit to that comedy gem. When all is said and done; 'Edge of Tomorrow' is pretty entertaining and doesn't take itself all too seriously. Tom Cruise is in fine form and reminded me, at least, how likable a performer he can be. There are of course a number of action packed set pieces that look good and the special effects are top notch. There is at least one heartfelt moment midway through that I thought was well played out but the film pretty much steers away from sentimentality. The supporting cast is good; Emily Blunt is a good match for Cruise and Bill Paxton is always fun as an army officer. Minor spoiler alert.I felt it lost a bit of steam towards the end but nothing detrimental as to ruining the whole experience. It's capped off with a 'what the...' type of ending but it's not too mind bending and really is in good flow with the overall tone of the film. End of minor spoiler.'Edge of Tomorrow' was just plain fun and I recommend it.",8,1,3,29 May 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," 'When in Rome...'
","Anchorman goes for stupidity each time and it's pretty successful at it but not always. Some jokes here miss completely but overall the film works well. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Ron Burgundy, the world's most egocentric and overall stupid anchorman, hugely successful in the city of San Diego.An eager-to-please supporting cast does well, alongside some very funny celebrity cameos (Ben Stiller very funny as a Spaniard, Tim Robbins in a very funny hairdo and more) but Anchorman cannot be considered as a first class comedy in my books, it simply has too many jokes that miss completely.But when it's funny, it's funny.",6,1,2,10 February 2006
The Wrestler," Glory days... they'll pass you by
","A lot has already been said and written about 'The Wrestler' and I really have nothing of novelty to add but I wholeheartedly agree with most reviewers who say this film is absolutely incredible in it's brutal honesty about a broken down man who's glory days are most certainly behind him. What's worst about it is that he has very little to show for it.Rourke is quite simply amazing here and if you can talk about actors being born to play a part, well, this is one of those examples. You get the feeling he's reliving his life to some extent rather than portraying a character. Marisa Tomei shines here as well, displaying once again what a quality actress she is.The movie stays with you long after it's ended. People make choices in life and 'The Ram' made a clear cut choice; rather than care for and nurture those around him he wanted to follow his dream, and in the end, do the only thing he was ever really good at. To me, he is not a bad person, he's just a man who took the easy way out and ends up regretting it. He's a fragile human being, like all of us.Possible spoiler Salvation for him lies in his fans, who demand pain and blood for the sake of entertainment and he's more than willing to please, 'cause his only faith is in the broken bones and bruises he displays. At one point he says that he'll never stop until they tell him to. Which will never happen. There he finds his reason for living...and dying ultimately.End of spoiler 'The Wrestler' is one powerful film and is not to be missed.And yeah, I did steal that line from the Springsteen song. Amazing song as well, captures the character incredibly well with only a few verses.",10,0,1,19 February 2009
Halloween," THE perfect horror film
","Absolutely one of the best horror films ever.In 1963, on Halloween night, 6 year old Michael Myers brutally stabs his sister to death. 15 years later, to the day, Michael has escaped from his lunatic asylum and proceeds to wreck more havoc in the peaceful community of Haddonfield, Illinois. A masterpiece of horror film-making. Granted, today's audience might not appreciate the film for all it's worth, but in 1978 this was groundbreaking stuff and set the tone for future horror films. John Carpenter's masterful horror film has yet to be surpassed in many respects. It's the level of craftsmanship that is so effectively on display here. Working on a shoestring budget, Carpenter went as far as to paint the leaves on trees to give the film the appropriate look. The music he made himself (the least costly choice, he said), and it's one of the most instantly recocnizable movie scores ever. The music plays a big part in the film's atmosphere. In fact, the music basically creates the film's mood. Sounds a bit like a combination between Goblin's scores for Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso and Suspiria, it's one of the film's best assets. Dean Cundey's cinematography is nothing short of superb, the film's opening scene alone is worth noting. Lighting is brilliant, an often copied scene near the end (you'll know which one) is yet another indicator of the talent behind the film. Carpenter's ability to create and sustain suspense has never been showcased better than here. It's tension filled grip on viewers begins from minute one and doesn't let up until the end credits roll (and not even then, it stays with you afterwards). A lot of thought went into creating the boogey man and Michael Myers is the perfect embodiment of what would scare us to death. An emotionless, nearly robotic force of evil that kills without remorse and seems to live for only that. The Shape is his official name, aptly titled given his mask, appropriately indicating his soulless nature. Acting performances are generally good. Donald Pleasence is perfect as Dr. Loomis, Michael's main nemesis. Jamie Lee Curtis is very good as Laurie, Michael's main target. Charles Cyphers gives a good supporting performance as the town's sheriff. Other actors aren't as good, but not distractingly bad either. People who say horror movies aren't very good should check this one out and try to argue their case. 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,11 March 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Disappointing
","Marty and Doc travel into the future to solve some problems, travel back to 1985 only to encounter more problems and the only way to solve those problems is to go back to 1955.Overly complicated and pretentious sequel to the classic original. The futuristic sequences seem silly and overblown and the 1985 reality is so bleak and uninteresting with cheap humor. It's only in the final third, when they go back to 1955, that the film comes to life for an exciting finale.Zemeckis drowns the film in special effects, has some sort of compulsion to have all the characters meet their other selves and really stretches every bit of credibility to the point of absurdity (the tunnel scene not only unsuspenseful and unconvincing but badly edited). The film somehow feels rushed, not made with a whole lot of passion, even the cast somehow seem disinterested. Thomas F. Wilson however gives another great performance in no less than three roles and is by far the best of the bunch this time around.Back to the Future Part II is not boring, but in comparison to the first rate original it comes as a sore disappointment. Fortunately they made Part III and finished off on a high note.",6,13,23,27 January 2006
Casino Royale," Back to basics
","This latest James Bond adventure is truly one of the all time best. Going all the way to the original source, Casino Royale, the first novel written about the super British Agent.The story is great and the best since 1987's The Living Daylights. This is a real spy story, with many red herrings and plot twists and you're never really sure who the real bad guy is. And despite many truly magnificent action set pieces this is actually one of the more earth bound Bond flicks around.Daniel Craig is great as Bond. He looks the part, certainly built for it and displays a wide range of emotions giving the character more depth than Brosnan and certainly Roger Moore ever did. And that just makes him more human. He even makes mistakes here and grave misjudgments of situations and is physically and emotionally bruised. A bold move but the right one as the series was certainly heading into oblivion with just another one of those pesky indestructible characters who save the world with not a scratch on them.Going back to basics; covering the origin of Bond, makes for a possible great new run for the series and the story here certainly lays solid ground for the next entry. Some trademarks are present but in alternate form and some aren't and, to be honest, I didn't miss them. New dimensions are added for Bond and the series and it all looks great.Can't wait for the next one.",10,1,4,21 November 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 1, 2, I recommend this one to you
","The original Nightmare is still the best in the Freddy Krueger series. Here, Wes Craven manages to build some terrific suspense with a highly original idea and also creating a truly scary horror villain (whose impact has lessened dramatically with all the sequels, unfortunately).The idea that when kids are killed in their dreams, they actually are killed for real is one kick-ass idea and Craven milks it for all it's worth. The atmosphere is tense and solid throughout with some solid scares along the way.Acting performances are generally O.K. John Saxon is good as always, Heather Langenkamp is pretty solid as Nancy, Freddy's main nemesis and a young Johnny Depp is also quite good. The film does unfortunately have a very weak ending, which undermines the overall impact of the film, but up until then, this is a first class horror film all the way.",8,0,0,18 June 2005
Shall We Dance," Enjoyable romantic comedy
","Richard Gere plays John Clark, a rather uninspired lawyer who feels his life needs some form of life injected to it. Happily married (to Susan Sarandon no less) with two children, John still feels like there's something missing. John decides to enroll in a dance class and finds that he truly has a passion for it and that it makes his life more enjoyable.Many reviewers compare this film to the Japanese original and it seems this version suffers in comparison. I have not seen the Japanese version but I liked Shall We Dance quite a bit. The fact that Gere's character felt there was something missing despite him having a good life is a feeling I think everyone can relate to, to some extent. Feeling guilty about wanting something on top of what he already has makes the character more real, to me anyway, and it explains well why he kept it a secret from his wife.Gere's moments in the dance class provide the film's real laughs and it's fun to see those guys get the feel for dancing. Jennifer Lopez, for once, gives a good performance as the moody dance instructor and her low-key presence is a huge plus. Where the film falters somewhat is when Sarandon hires two private detectives. Their characters are a little too silly and they don't fit comfortably in the film as a whole.Overall I found Shall We Dance to be an enjoyable romantic comedy. Gere and Sarandon are both very good, Lopez as well and the supporting actors give their all to please the crowd.",7,0,0,10 January 2006
Back to the Future," Just perfect
","Quite simply the most entertaining time-travel movie ever. The story is magnificent all the way, expertly written with some of the most memorable dialog ever to grace the silver screen. It's lighthearted approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not least the cast is the best.Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel. Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it. This is timeless entertainment and in light of recent comedies one can better appreciate the level of fun this movie provides. They simply don't make 'em like this anymore.",10,2,3,27 January 2006
Jurassic Park," Still terrific
",Just caught a 3D screening of 'Jurassic Park' a while ago and it's still a very entertaining slice of popcorn fare; in fact it's the Steven Spielberg us movie aficionados knew and loved. The 3D effects look good and it was certainly fun to experience the film this way. The ground breaking visual effects (some 20 years ago; man how time flies!) still hold up extremely well. As for the film; the 3D doesn't make it better but it doesn't detract anything from it either. Compared to today's big budget summer flicks 'Jurassic Park' would undoubtedly be considered fairly slow moving but it builds momentum very well and climaxes in a number of knock out suspense sequences. It's fun to look back at the cast 20 years back; Jeff Goldblum is fun here and you can easily see how his fledgling career got second wind with his performance here; Sam Neill demonstrates why he could have been a possible successor for Roger Moore as James Bond and Laura Dern was quite the eye candy in 1993. And now we know that Wayne Knight didn't die a nasty death; he simply went into hiding and found work as a postal worker in New York :)'Jurassic Park 3D' was a fun night at the movies. Spielberg really knew how to make great adventure flicks and his old movies hold up really well.,8,0,1,6 November 2013
Valkyrie," Entertaining WW2 thriller
","The most elaborate and extensive plan to kill Adolf Hitler is depicted admirably in Valkyrie by none other than Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise, a slew of quality British actors and the director of X-Men and Superman Returns.Now I'm no WW2 history buff, but I gather the film is mostly historically accurate. I did admire how much suspense the film generated despite the known outcome. This plot to kill Germany's most demented individual was well orchestrated and very close to working like a charm, only a few mishaps and human errors prevented it from succeeding.As for the performances, the British guys owned it. Branagh, Stamp, Wilkinson, Nighy and even Eddie Izzard are flawless in their depictions as Nazi soldiers who are disgusted by their leader. Tom Cruise is neither here nor there, playing the leader Claus von Stauffenberg. He is not bad, just not very good either.With the outcome previously known, I approached 'Valkyrie' as pure entertainment. It's always good to leave a film a little wiser about history but this film didn't leave me breathless or astonished in any way. The film is suspenseful, well made and written and is most likely a very welcome addition in the genre for WW2 buffs.In the end, what stayed with me was that it seemed likely that some higher power was watching out for the demented leader of Germany as no less than 15 assassinations were attempted and in the end he died of his own hand. It's a funny twist of fate.",7,2,5,19 February 2009
All the President's Men," Terrific look at in-depth investigative journalism
","For people interested in an in-depth look at investigative journalism in movies; All the President's Men is the final word on the subject.The film is blissfully free of over dramatizing the investigation that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. In a cool fashion the film follows the reporters step by step as they uncovered the scandal and for once doesn't sugarcoat the lead characters as the mercilessly turned over every stone imaginable to progress in their investigations.Robert Redford and especially Dustin Hoffman are credible as Woodward and Bernstein, Jason Robards is fantastic as their editor. The script, based on the reporters book, is overflowing with information but the entire proceedings are so well handled by Alan J. Pakula that the film isn't too hard to follow, but don't look away for too long or you'll definitely miss something.",9,2,2,13 October 2006
