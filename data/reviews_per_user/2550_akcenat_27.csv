Ford v Ferrari," Superb movie not just for a racing fans
","'Ford v Ferrari', based on the 2009 book 'Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans', is adrenaline-fueled entertainment, not just for a for racing fans but non-racing fans too. What makes this movie so great are the performances of all the cast, but especially M. Demon and C. Bale - who gives a rock-solid performance that shows the intensity and determination of his character. Damon as - a quite memorable character too, is superb as - 'Caroll Shelby' as he fights for what he believes. But actually, what really makes this film even better is the chemistry that Demon and Bale create together. It feels like they've been friends for life. If the film has a fault, it's that it stops short of showing us what exactly drives both men. The racing scenes are superbly realized, kinetic and thrilling, although there's often a little too much fast-cutting pedal-shots. No mater, the crowning achievement of 'Ford v Ferrari' is its portrayal of the Les Mans race in 1966 with quite emotional climax. Ultimately, film doesn't disappoint and is highly recommendable.Rating: 8-",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Rocketman," A musical fantasia about Elton John's life that overdoses on drugs and sex.
","Dexter Fletcher, director of the 'Rocketman' is also responsible for rescuing 'Bohemian Rhapsody' when its original director (Bryan Singer) was fired. It might be unfair to compare these two movies because they are the stories of two distinct artists. But, each film tells stories about a British gay rock 'n roll superstar during roughly the same period, each film uses an artist's hit song as the title, each film displays the artist's flamboyant on-stage and off-stage personas and each film has plenty of hit songs. Despite the high energy and exorbitant costumes and eye-wears, the Elton John character in this film lacks the exhilarating visual appearance compared to Freddie Mercury. Even though Taron Egerton (Kingman and Eddie the Eagle) is good at playing Elton John, he doesn't reach to the same intensity as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury. Although this film doesn't whitewash Elton John's homosexuality, it doesn't really explore the theme any deeper than Freddie's either.The enduring warm relationship with Bernie Taupin, his longtime lyricist, and the reliable and likable Jamie Bell is the solidest & warmest presence in the film. Ultimately, 'Rocketman' is not so much a biopic as vibrant, full-fledged phantasmagoria of a movie musical. Also, with a piano man as world-renowned as Elton John, the songs should really speak for themselves in a biopic about his life but mostly they don't. The tunes sometimes take center stage, although the musical arrangements have been changed ... for the worse. Perhaps this is a sin to say, but 'Rocketman' is one film soundtrack I never care to hear again.The fact that Elton John is one of the executive producers and his husband David Furnish is one of the producers makes us wonder whether the film can be reasonably objective about which stories should be told in the film about Elton John.Rating: For fans 8+, for us others 6+/7- and please lower your expectations.",7,1,2,19 August 2019
A Star Is Born," Starts strong, but from the middle energy is just tapering off
","The 2018 version of 'A Star is Born' follows the same beats we've come to expect from the 1937, 1954 and 1976 versions. Bradley Cooper is a star-studded musician, consumed by alcohol and drug addiction that meets young aspiring female musician (Lady Gaga). For me, BC was stunning especially in the first 2/3 of the film LG not so, almost in all parts. Supporting actors somehow are all lost here without any deeper meaning. I personally didn't felt chemistry between BC and LG as other people. Actually I cant see them (movie characters) as a couple. Movie especially toward the finale is ticking all the cliches. What to say about the film music, except that I definitely will not buy the soundtrack. Maybe I'm subjective, but LGs form of pop music is unlistenable, BC was ok, and that's that. I don't know, after all the hype, I really expected more from this movie. Good production, not so good result. Average 'B' movie, with lot of money poured in into. 6-/10",6,0,3,20 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Marvel Studios' first female superhero movie
",Big production but easily forgettable movie with some average acting. It seems that 'Captain Marvel' carries the faintly desperate aroma of a franchise running on fumes and struggling to be anything we haven't yet seen from superhero cinema. Pity poor Marvel.Rating: 6 just because of Samuel L. Jackson,6,2,8,18 September 2019
The Hunger Games," In 2020 this looks boring and dull
","I Watched this movie for the 1st time during corona lock-down (2020) 8 years after it was released and let me tell you, it is boring, oversimplified and poorly-executed from just about every conceivable angle. It has an air of pretentiousness around it, and its 'serious' nature attempts to disguise its superficiality. There is little substance to this film, and even its simplicity seems offensive. Highly NOT recommended.Review: 5-",5,2,6,8 April 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Utterly ridiculous but wonderfully feel-good entertaining
","Netflix (123 min) new movie arrives with little buzz or advertising, yet in a world of COVID-19 pandemic it's quite O.K. to say that the world needs movies like 'Eurovision Song Contest'. Fire Saga's core of sweetness might just keep growing on you more and more in hindsight. The film is perfectly watchable, light and goofy funny. The kind of movie that is really built for viewing at home and the type of film which doesn't push the limits of this type of comedy. Some aspects work better than others, but inaccuracies do not affect the overall enjoyment. All of the musical segments were amazing and I will definitely look for the soundtrack on Spotify. Director David Dobkin's visiable experience shooting music videos for the likes of Elton John and Maroon 5 ensured staged spectacle. Rachel McAdams was both gorgeous and hilarious, while her sub-plot was very heart warming and her character overall was such a joy to watch with an almost childlike naivety on her journey of self discovery. Other highlights include Dan Steven's brilliant inspired Russian entry. Pierce Brosnan is absolutely brilliant choice for Ferrell father because the sheer irony of casting him following his role in ABBA adaptation 'Mamma Mia' is genius. The film also features the BBC's talk show host Graham Norton as a color commentator. The finale is gloriously uplifting and guaranteed to make your heart Ja Ja Ding Dong, while 'Eurovision' itself would be proud, especially since there is no Eurovision this year which makes this film is a quite suitable replacement. I also hope to see the real Eurovision Competition in 2021 look somewhat similar to this, with Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams making a surprise appearance.Rating: 8",8,2,2,7 July 2020
Knives Out," The classic Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, that turns into something unexpected
","'Knives Out' is a solid made mystery that not only churns out terrific performances, but also helps the viewer engage in the case as a whole as you will keep on guessing until the very end. The acting is incredible, while the production is top-notch. It's also refreshing to see a murder mystery actually set in the present day, considering the history of the genre. Actually, the film has it all - a great plot, great characters, great performances, good music, and great writing/directing. At the end, 'Knives Out' doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor does it try, but it does what it aims to do incredibly well being fun and worth your time, this 'donut hole within a donut hole' of a film. Enjoyable movie.Rating: 7+/8-",8,2,3,6 April 2020
The Irishman," Slow burn de-aged vfx gangster movie that feels like high school class reunion
","First 1/5th of a film feels like some off-cuts of 'Goodfellas' / 'Casino' or it feels like 'we already seen this story before'. After it, it changes its tempo especially in the last 1/5th of the movie (after De Niro went into airplane to meet Pacino) and soon after, it feels so anti-climatic. Obviously, 'The Irishman' had good director so despite its flows, it is well-made, but I'm just not over the moon with its final result. Female companions are barely seen no matter that mobsters usually do have passion for women. The one we do see is (De Niro character daughter) Peggy with almost no words to speak in it. Oddly enough, good thing here is that the film was not as long as you might think after seeing its runtime: three and a half hours. At the end, the movie is OK, at least just for the performances of De Niro, Pacino & Pesci. So, it's what it is.Rating: 7+ (just because it feels so familiar, which I don't want from a new story)",7,1,4,20 March 2020
Deadpool 2," I really, really dislike this movie
","For me it was so bad that I stopped watching it after 30 minutes. What I saw I can explain as an absurdly graphic and violent gore-fest. Maybe I'm too old for this kind of ... film(s), but for me this was pointless movie, much worse than the first one with no soul, not whatsoever. A complete waste of time, at least 30 minutes of my time.

The Hateful Eight," Unnecessary bloody and too-long movie
","This is classic Tarantino neo-Western - a mystery set shortly after the American Civil War which unfolds mostly in just two setups.Movie itself is relaying too much on a dialogue to build the plot which could have been done in half the time. 'The Hateful Eight' moves very slowly and I don't see the point why it was needed to be 3 hours long. If you like Horrors, Westerns, Agatha Christie mysteries, violence and lot of blood you will enjoy this film, otherwise you will be bored. It seems it was shot through with cruelty for cruelty's sake. When the violence comes it's more graphic than even a horror movie fans could have reason to expect.I did like 'Django Unchained' but I'm not much fond of 'The Hateful Eight'. 5+/6-",5,7,21,20 January 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A strong movie (with some unfortunate flaws)
","The movie follows grieving mother (Frances McDormand) after the unsolved murder of her teenage daughter. As she becomes frustrated with the local police's lack of progress, she decides to rent three billboards on the outskirts of her hometown to send a personal message to the authorities... but what those billboards trigger is not what she expects. Great characters, great performances and great writing make movie memorable. McDormand is simply superb as the mother whose anger is just part of her problems in life. Movie is a hugely entertaining, no mater basically it's a drama. But, at times, the plot is lacking in direction and can come across as a little too sarcastic and even cartoonish at times, but overall, the writing is so strong and the acting is so on point. As a result, film is not for general viewing audiences but if you are a film buff, you should enjoy the film. 8/10",8,1,3,9 September 2018
Bridge of Spies," Another Steven Spielberg history lesson (and based on Wikipedia not very much true)
","This film was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. It's directed by Steven Spielberg, has Tom Hanks in the lead role and has a script written by Joel and Ethan Cohen, but...it's more conversational and seems to be more dialogue intensive rather than any movement or action. Also, the movie is too long for the story and unnecessary baggage of scenes are added. Absence of adequate background score makes many scenes sound boring. Generally, there's not as much tension as one might hope, especially once Hanks is in Berlin, when film becomes slow as we wait for the deal to be brokered.It is OK movie, but that's about it. The film runs for over two hours and is almost nothing but talk, which makes it a bit of dull historical movie. In some ways, it feels like a film for school children. The flick's headlining novelty is Mark Rylance, who plays Abel with mesmerizing performance. Compering to him, Austin Stowell as Powers comes off as the equivalent of actor negative space. Overall, it just didn't make a huge impression on me. Rating: 6-Favorite quote: 
James Donovan: Aren't you worried?
Rudolf Abel: Would it help?",6,1,4,28 January 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A slow, washed out, fairytale of sorts
","The film of alternate histories takes its time to build up atmosphere and character, but at an astonishing 2h 41min feels too slow with some (a lot of) material that doesn't really advance the plot. That is why it is also uneven, with distinct variance in tone and not without its flat patches. It is watchable, but I don't want to re-seen it again or buy it. I was mostly entertained by it, but it is a bit of a mess. Bruce Lee is little bit more cartoonish than rest of characters and didn't come off well, while Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) comparing to male characters feels a little bit flat. I just felt unsatisfied after it was finish. Love him or not, when you're watching a Tarantino movie, you know it is a Tarantino film. I'm just not a big fan of his.Rating: 6/7- just because of fantastic and hard to achieve effortless Brad Pitt",6,1,2,10 January 2020
1917," Immersive war experience with the incredible cinematography, but pretty traditional at its core
","Because, much of the movie has been made by using of 'one single shot' (very linear plot) approach (like in the Birdman) for me, after an about one hour of its runtime '1917' became little bit too much and dull experience. There are long stretches without dialogue, while the movie which is treating one of the titanic events of modern times is largely conventional and intellectually shallow. Actually, the uncomplicated screenplay retreads classic war film themes without anything new to say. At the same time, while watching '1917' there is a sense that you are waiting for an interesting point but that never comes, mostly because audiences really don't need '1917' to tell them in 2020 that war is hell. In the movie, there are two real stars - one is cinematographer Roger Deakins and the other is George MacKay. As much acclaim Dean-Charles Chapman and director Sam Mendes are gettin, it's MacKay that is the break out star. Ultimately, you get the idea that the basic script was one hour long. '1917' is a decent war film, but after all the buzz, I was disappointed.Rating: 7+ Just because of the first 60 minutes of almost perfection",7,0,1,6 April 2020
Midsommar," Bizarre, long slow-paced horror that combines paganism, ritualistic sex and cultic violence
","The film draws on pagan European folktales and rituals while tries to make it as shocking portrayal of cult life. But, after its long runtime (147 minutes) reached finale, the horrible pacing has robbed the movie of any kind of emotional impact and just leaves you without any feelings for the remaining characters and easily drives you into boredom and apathy.Rating: 6-",6,1,3,15 April 2020
The King," English period drama with story we've seen before
","In keeping with the surge of medieval dramas - popularized by Game of Thrones - Netflix has released another period film 'The King' that sheds light on the lesser-known history of King Henry V of England during the early 15th century. One of the biggest issues with this movie is it last for more than two hours and I'm are still trying to understand protagonist's motivation. How did Henry V go from a reckless youth all the way to calling out an enemy to fight in single combat? How did he go from refusing his father's throne to accepting it? etc. The reasons are a little muddled. At the end, movie is an admirable, albeit forgettable, retelling of a well-known (Shakespeare) character. While it does have its qualities, the flimsy character development hindered me from investing emotionally into this portrayal. I'm glad I saw it, but I doubt anyone (except some old English people) will rush back to see this in the movies.Rating: 7",7,2,3,14 December 2019
Sicario," A solid suspense thriller that packs some punch
","In the area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted by an elite government task force official (Josh Brolin) to aid in the escalating war against drugs.The film has its virtues, but the trend of female (Emily Blunt) and black guy (Daniel Kaluuya) continues and sadly in this movie both characters are absolutely useless. Del Toro's acting towards ending is magnetic, despite bland Blunt being the central focus of the movie. I didn't like or enjoy Blunt's performance at all, but because of Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro I'm rating the movie a little bit higher than I intended - 8",8,0,0,18 January 2016
Joker," It was slow burn cliche film and I blame director for it
","'Joker' (2019), set in 1981 fictional Gotham City, is the latest DC feels dark film with an obvious 'Taxi Driver' (1974), 'Network' (1976), 'The King of Comedy' (1982) and 'V for Vendetta' (2005) influence that shows how society of today is treating poor, disenfranchised and mentally ill with potential consequences of such inaction. 'Joker'is undoubtedly a one-man show with an integral reliance on Phoenix being the right lead. Here he is very good in his portrayal of 'Arthur Fleck', a delusional and impoverished clown-for-hire (that sucks at his job) with an uncontrollable laughing condition who descends into the chaos that is the legend of his (Batman mythology) character. When he dances on the long concrete stairway with Gary Glitter's 'Rock and Roll Part 2' soundtrack, it's a moment of transcendent insanity going with the flow of his madness and it awesomely done. As a film, its predictable, occasionally surprisingly dull and not a particularly good one. Basically, a former comedy director uses the 122 min film as a character study or as a journey into evil, but he is doing it in a such way that is so cliche. Almost everything we see is so familiar - mishmash of other movie borrowed parts - which is actually boring. Beautiful cinematography and physically transformative performances here are merely clown's makeup that distracts viewers from way to simplistic script and shallow directing. Arthur's love interest (Zazie Beetz) was wasted as a character who doesn't need to be there at all and serves no purpose, which is also the case with some other sub-plots. I'm disappointed. Movie is big marketing and hype DC machine release.RATING: 6, Just because of Joaquin Phoenix.",6,2,10,21 December 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Good makeover on of Conan Doyle's 'Sherlock Holmes', it's not an amazing film, but it was pretty good one
","Director Guy Ritchie has tried to include something for everybody in the film - occult conspiracies, brutal fist-fights, a pretty face (or two) thrown in for good measure and you have all the ingredients for a fine non-summer blockbuster. Hans Zimmer's quirky score keeps the action moving along, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot's seductively dark cinematography gives London a Gothic atmosphere and the sets & costumes are all nicely stylized. Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are great fun together, Mark Strong is a suitably evil villain and even though the story has its flaws (for me, especially in a Dr. Watson fiancee Mary - Kelly Reilly) it is entertaining enough to fill the void between elaborate action sequences. However, it's at least 30 minutes too long and the film drags noticeably when Holmes and Watson aren't on screen together. At the end, 'Sherlock Holmes' still was an enjoyable adventure and a worthy reboot of the franchise. As such it is a case that it is basically visual entertainment with action and quirky humor but for those who want more will find the convoluted mess of a story lacking. At the end, It's a rapidly paced and funny Victoriana adventure popcorn movie.Rating: 8-",8,1,1,30 November 2019
The Big Short," I expected more
","'The Big Short' tells the story of different individuals who foresaw the 2007 credit and housing bubble collapse a couple years before the U.S. financial crisis got underway. The film is an unconventional movie that covers a lot of ground. It's more economics lecture than a movie. Transformation of Lewis' not-so-cinematic book into an engaging big screen narrative isn't a complete success. All the pieces of a great film were there but movie fails to deliver. Bale's at once fragile and seamless characterization of Michael Burry is one of the film's most understated yet effective contributions, while Steve Carell again demonstrates his impressive versatility. Verdict: The movie certainly has important information to impart, but it's more exhausting than exhaustive and long on words instead of wisdom. As an information dump, 'The Big Short' is a solid success, as entertainment, it's just a bull in a bear market. Rating: 6+/7-",6,2,5,3 January 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Lifeless and flat
","The most characters are lifeless and flat (especially Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter and Henry Cavill). It doesn't help that this overlong film a lot of the times is an astounding bore. Most of movie's problems revolve around the characterization of Lex, whom J. Eisenberg plays as a twitching weirdo with none of the depth and all of the tics. It's a profoundly irritating feat of overacting - he's less cartoon-ish villain and more villainous cartoon. Film also features African terrorists, Russian mafia, Justice Leaguers The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, an alien autopsy, congressional Superman hearings, Kryptonite weaponry, dream sequences with flying insect-men and gothic gargoyles, spaceships, the Batmobile and Batwing, nuclear bombs, and a CGI monster that feels like it was borrowed from the 'Lord of the Rings' movies. If you might be wondering about the story that involves all these elements - there isn't one. 'Batman v Superman' is a collection of striking scenes and imagery that has apparently been filmed without the benefit of a coherent screenplay to tie them together. Simply put, 'Batman V Superman' doesn't give fans what they were promised. The end gave me a feeling of anti-climax.Rating: 6- just because of big production",6,0,3,3 July 2020
Midway," A solid WW2 tale, especially in comparison to Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbor'
","The film was released on Veterans Day, very appropriately, and is a solid effort from R. Emmerich who tends to be a director bent on spectacle especially as it relates to disasters on a grand scale (Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, White House Down). But, with this movie (budget of $100 million and runtime of 2 hours and 18 minutes) he takes a step towards substance which is positive, but again retains too much of his desire to make an CGI event picture. Emmerich, also, goes mercifully easy on the flag-waving patriotism and he's pretty even-handed, too, in his portrayal of the Japanese enemy. But at its runtime, film could have easily lost 30 minutes and been a lot more enjoyable. Ultimately, I give 'Midway' a lot of credit for exceeding my expectations and providing more entertainment than I could have predicted at the outset. This movie is definitely a must-see for action fans who don't mind a little bit of a wandering story.Rating: 7+/8-",8,1,1,8 April 2020
Green Book," Feel-good road-trip movie based on 'Driving Miss Daisy' formula
","'Green Book' does a fine job of depicting the rampant disrespect that people of color were shown in the US during 1960's. Main problem is, as politically corrected movie, 'Green Book' tries very hard and wants not to offend sacrificing the complexity of one of societies great ills in favor of script clarity. On the other hand, the film's effectiveness is especially due to the talents of the two stars - M. Ali and V. Mortensen, veteran actors who just do not ever give an inferior performance. At the end, it is a heartwarming and enough entertaining movie that shines a light on (a difficult part of) American history without patronizing. A real crowd pleaser.Rating: 8-",8,0,0,8 May 2020
Spectre," The 21st Century Bond formula is wearing thin
","This is a classic Bond. There's an evil organization infecting its way into power of the entire world through maniacal means that is quite literally obsessed with Mr. Bond, who only has his wit and some gizmo's to bring them down. 'Spectre' isn't a bad film. It just isn't really a great one. Movie is worth seeing as a big budget Bond epic that ticks all the right boxes without hitting all the right notes. It reportedly cost $300-350 million and it's apparent in every frame packed with extras, expensive equipment, and grand locations from Mexico to Britain to Italy to Austria to Morocco and to the African desert. If 'Skyfall' was the pinnacle of Craig's run as Bond, 'Spectre' signals a slight downturn and a need for the series to break new ground and redefine who James Bond is for the next generation. Unlike the Mission Impossible franchise, the Bond franchise has sacrificed vitality for action.6/10",6,5,10,14 February 2016
Joy," Soap Opera Movie - Too Long - Expected More
","Joy is the biography movie about the girl who becomes the woman who founds a business empire...This is David O. Russell's latest attempt to recreate magic of 'Silver Linings Playbook'. But sometimes, you can't return the wheel of life. Actually, if anything, 'Joy' makes me appreciate the Directors brilliance of 'Silver Linings Playbook'. 'Joy' is watchable, a bit inspiring, but at the end it's soap opera version of 'Erin Brokovich' with almost cartoonish characters.  You won't be missing out much if you decide to skip this one. Much better, look for your old copy of 'Erin Brokovich'. Rating:6",6,2,5,18 January 2016
The Proposal," Amusing, enjoyable and predictable rom-com perfection even in 2020
","'The Proposal' (2009) is basically a fun, family romantic comedy even in 2020. Chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds makes the movie one of the above average rom-coms. The supporting casting is brilliant, especially Betty White, because she does practically steals her scenes from anyone she is involved with. Ultimately, the story is a bit over the top and simplistic while 'The Proposal' offers little surprises and is one of those movies where you know what's going to happen but, the lovable cast and the random laughs make it a fun and fluffy pick for a relaxing family treat in front of TV during corona pandemic because it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.Rating: 8 - Fun flick, plus you will get to see Sandra Bullock (mostly) naked.",8,0,0,20 June 2020
13 Hours," Solid packed full of action movie
","The contractors in '13 Hours' are mercenaries, a bunch of battle-hardened ex-Navy SEALs, Marines and Rangers hired to provide 'babysitters' for the CIA operatives who go into Benghazi to gather intelligence. The movie is like a throwback to the best of 90s action, but as a Michael Bay film, it's runs a bit long (144 min.) and would have benefited from a bit of trimming. Still the battle sequences are well depicted while performances are decent, especially J. Krasinski as a contractor taking the gig because his family needs the money. Ultimately, movie have a likable cast and blistering action scenes, although a few special effects might have been over the top. Highly recommended for any action moviegoer, one of Bay's best to date.Rating: 7+/8-",8,0,0,11 April 2020
