Blade Runner 2049," Probably the best we have seen this year
","For me this is the best this year. And yes, I have seen Dunkirk. Denis Villeneuve is the new rising star who has constantly surprised us with exceptional direction. Blade runner, just like Arrival, seems out of the world. It's almost 3 hours long but I just didn't want it to end. It reminded me of Gravity. I didn't want to miss even one scene. It was captivating. It was new in all sense, but there was a hint of the original which made it memorable. The cast was well suited, with Ryan Gosling giving a ravishing performance. This creative venture is going to stay for long in people's mind as it is definitely a classic. I urge everyone to go and watch it in theatre as it is an experience worth your time. The movie is struggling on box office as it does not appeal to mass audience. But still I will ask them to give it a chance for the shear pleasure of watching stunning visuals which this film has captured and also, the music, which is the soul of this movie.",9,2,10,15 October 2017
Deepwater Horizon," Impactful depiction of the actual event
","Deepwater Horizon is based on a true event which happened in 2010. It is considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the world, and the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history. The film is made in such a way that you will be attached to the characters before 'anything explodes' and when it does, you stop moving and hope that your favorite character survive. The first half is slow, a little too much some would say which I think, was vital in this case as it will make you feel more connected to the characters. But, a thought will be there in your mind that the second half better be good.It is. It is mind blowing!The second half of Deepwater Horizon is so thrilling that it made me sit on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was impossible to take my eyes off it. It is jam-packed with explosions, fire and gas leaks. It is rather technical what caused the explosion but you'll get it as it is explained in the first half very efficiently.The movie is also well equipped with a stunning star cast including Kurt Russell, Mark Wahlberg, John Malkovich, Dylan O. Bryan and Gina Rodriguez. Also, the background score and the camera work is quite effective to create a sense of thrill in the audience. I will recommend this movie to all those who won't mind a long (but necessary) build up before the good stuff.",8,1,2,9 December 2016
Us," US - Truly a Masterpiece
","Did you ever get a feeling that however normal your life seems, something sinister is always lurking around. Something, hidden in the shadows, is observing you and trying to get closer every second. That feeling came true for Adelaide when she revisited one of her childhood vacation place with her present family. Suddenly, the sweet family getaway becomes a fight for life for her family when they are attacked by some home invaders who share a close connection to them. They ARE them.Jordan Peele has done it again. He has made another movie which will be remembered in the history of times as a movie which made everyone ponder over it longer then they should. With Get Out, he made a clever satire about the inherent dark side of the elite white families in US. I liked the way how subtly that point was put that many still don't see it that way. In US, he has gone one step further. He has made a movie which can have multiple interpretation for anyone who's watching. Any interpretation you go with, one thing that we are sure of is that it's not just a home invasion movie.US has layers like an onion. On the front it seems like a horror thriller featuring a family being terrorised by their doppelgangers. But when you dwell more, you'll see how it presents different themes. Saying anything more than that will spoil the experience of those who are yet to watch it.One great thing about US is that it is a perfect blend of horror and comedy without actually being a horror comedy. It's very easy to bifurcate both moments in the film. You'll be laughing at one moment and in the next you could be extremely terrified. This energy keeps you hooked to it. The performance of almost every one is beyond great. The centre stage is held by Lupita N'yongo and she does everything with finesse. She is almost unrecognisable in as one in both her personas. Other things that make the movie an amazing watch are it's background score, the story and the climax.Although, like Get Out, I found the big reveal tad bit predictable but it is clearly visible that the reveal is not just the one thing which is holding it all together. Everything about the movie contributes to the big picture and makes it a cinematic marvel.Leave all the things and go watch US in theatres. It is one such film which has the power to strike long debates. What it more exciting that watching a movie which stays with you even after you're done watching it?!",8,0,1,13 April 2020
About Time," What a delight!
","I am a fan of Rachel McAdams. So when i heard there is a movie with her and time travel and similar concept, i had to watch it and those who liked 'The time traveler's wife' should too. I must say i am impressed.This movie is a fantasy where Domhnall Gleeson, about whom i didn't even know much before this movie and am thinking right now that nobody could do this better than him, got to know that he has the ability to travel back in time.So, we cannot say that it is a new concept, but when i heard that he uses his ability to get the girl, my decision to watch this movie was shaken. So when i started watching it, i had no expectation of originality at all. Maybe this is why i liked it even more.My favorite part of the movie were the conversation between Gleeson and McAdams. They were sweet and witty at the same time. Sometimes, it felt like the film is dragging and carrying unnecessary detailing with the core story, but it all sorted out quite fast.So, those who would like a sweet fantasy, with a little romance and family drama, they will like this too.",7,3,4,21 June 2015
My Neighbor Totoro," Breathtakingly Calm!
","My neighbor Totoro is an incredible film. Its about two sisters, who have this awesome dad and a sick but loving mother and how these two sometimes float into this mythical world where various nature spirits exit. One of the things i noticed was that the creators have given crucial amount of time to make the movie detailed. Like when one of the sisters trip and fell, they have dirt on their knees when they rise, like how strikingly similar features these sisters have like their parents. Watching this film, i had a smile on my face all the time. It has a calming effect which make you look away from all the tension in the world and just enjoy the adventures those girls are facing.I think it is an amazing and a must watch movie for kids.",8,0,1,6 April 2016
Moana," Songs that will touch your heart!
","Disney never seems to fail in amazing me. Whenever you feel that this again would be similar to what we have seen before and there Disney is with yet another unique concept.Moana is a story of a young girl who sails through the sea to find a demigod Maui, who will help her to save her island. It is a musical which has great songs (reminded me of Frozen) and heart touching background score. The story is simple but sensible and amazingly executed. It is NOT a spoiler, there is a chicken which made me laugh so hard tears fell from my eyes. Moana is a perfect blend of everything important for an animated movie to be likable and enjoyed by all. This is definitely one of the best Disney has delivered. Watch this movie if you like, well, just watch this movie I am sure you will like it.",8,3,14,2 December 2016
Doctor Strange," Another delight by marvel!
","Doctor strange is, well, strangely different but at the same time, similar to other Marvel movies. It is intriguing and thrilling but at the same time it seems like it is shot in a completely different style. As I said, it is a delight to watch, but gave it a 7 because I expected more. When you have such an elaborate concept on which you can build on, adding the almost perfect star cast why does it feel like that still something is missing? The film failed to thrill me when I expected the most. I was looking for some 'wow' moment which never came. Even if the movie is good, you need that moment which remains in your mind when you go home after watching it, i think the movie lacks that.There is no way I would ever blame the star cast for this because these are all my favorites, like McAdams, Ejiofor, Cumberbatch, Swinton etc. All played there part as smoothly as they did in Spotlight, 12 years a slave, Sherlock and (so many good ones for Swinton, but)We need to talk about Kevin, respectively. So, I would totally recommend you to watch this movie, if possible in 3D IMAX, because that is the main pull factor of this one, effects.",7,1,3,19 November 2016
Baby Driver," The most stylish movie of the year so far
","I knew I will like this movie as soon as I was finished watching the first trailer, but I didn't know I will be so pleased. Baby driver is not just a film, it can easily be one of the best musical we have seen so far this year. Every scene, every action has a rhythm to it. Every dialogue, every expression attached to a musical note. This movie is a good example of how greatness can be achieved by efficiently scoring the movie.Baby driver is about a getaway driver who got mixed with the wrong crowd when he was young and is now forced to pull heiss with them. Everything goes 'Bananas' when he falls in love and starts finding a way out.I've always been a big fan of Edgar Wright. But I always thought it is because Simon Pegg is his lucky charm. I know 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' was good but it was nothing compared to 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz'. I even like 'At World's End' more. But at last, he has proved me wrong. Before going to watch Baby Driver, I also thought it could be that the movie may depend too much on the performances by the big names like Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, but that was not the case. It was the amazing music and insane action sequences which are the actual star of the film.Some of the amazing scores of the movie are, 'Hocus Pocus' by Focus, 'Tequila' by The Champs and 'Brighton Rock' by Queen. Other worthwhile mentions are Egyptian Reggae, Bellbottoms, Smokey Joe's La La and B-A-B- Y Baby. I remember I was shaking my head in the theater on every one of these songs. It felt like every song just fits with the frame perfectly.There was this one scene which reminded me of another one from Shaun of the Dead, where Simon Pegg wakes up and goes to a shop to buy something. There is a similar one-shot scene here as well which resembles. I found out that such long one shots can be seen in other Edgar Wright movies as well.Ansel Elgort has done amazing in a movie which could be his big break into critically acclaimed mainstream cinema. Although he shared the screen with Kevin Spacey and others, he made sure that audience will remember who the movie is really about. His character is cool, stylish, mysterious but funny at the same time. Spacey and Hamm both looked badass. But Jamie Foxx was the one who I liked the most, after Elgort off course. His character was the usual type of villain you love to hate and Foxx played it exactly like that. Also, Eiza Gonzalez played this hot love interest of Jon Hamm's character. Lily James looked cute.So, in the end, I would like to say that Baby Driver is an awesome start for this season. After this, we have Spiderman – Homecoming, War of the Planet of the Apes (I am really excited about this one) and Dunkirk coming right after on another. So go watch it instead of going for Transformers and The Mummy.",8,7,12,6 July 2017
Split," SPLIT - James McAvoy's Finest!
","When I first saw McAvoy in the movie Wanted, I pegged him as just one of the plethora of actors who come and go and you don't even remember their face after some time. After about a year, I watched Atonement. I was surprised because the actor who I saw on the screen was no rookie, and before that, I was seldom wrong about such thing. So, I started looking for all the movies starring James McAvoy. In my quest, I found Filth and Trance, after which I became a die hard fan. He carries every one of his performance with a finesse which could pull up the entire movie by itself.So naturally, I was very excited about Split. One other reason was M. Night Shyamalan in whom I had faith even after watching The Visit. So, I went to the theater yesterday. First-day first show in Pune, India, about a month after its release in the US. There were 7 silhouettes I could see in the hall and I was afraid they would cancel the show, but I was wrong, fortunately.Let me tell you something about Split. It is not meant for a mass audience. The film is about a man named Kevin who has 23 different personalities and a 24th is about to come out. He kidnaps 3 girls for some sort of ritual to be performed before the 24th personality arrived. Some of the personalities are dominant and are eagerly waiting for the 'Beast', the 24th entity. The girls have to escape somehow before they become the victim of the beast. Also, apart from these 24 Kevins and the 3 girls, there was also Betty Buckley portraying Kevin's psychiatrist. I have to say the movie left me speechless, especially the second half. It took advantage of the silence so very well that we had to refrain ourselves from taking our eyes away from the screen because it felt like anytime the movie is going to throw something awesome on our face. The main story line is in perfect blend with the past story of Casey, played by Anya Taylor Joy who did an amazing job by the way.But, McAvoy stole the show. He played every one of his personalities so very well that in some of the scenes, he won't even speak a word but you will know from his body language what character he is in at that moment. In the second half, when the movie picked up a pace, you can hear a trace of a slur in his voice and then he would be a totally different person, with a different voice, accent, and behavior. My favorite out of the 24 was Hedwig, a 9-year-old child, who McAvoy portrayed with all the innocence he could bring up in his eyes. But that is the thing, there is this one personality which you would hate to love and there is this other one you would love to hate. Such a character can only come alive on screen if played by the finest actors we know.",7,1,9,23 February 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Hey look, this one had a story!
","I had a problem with the avenger movies. They get around with too little a story to tell. There is a bad guy, he did something, then the avengers discuss something and they fight this ultimate battle that nobody can deny loving. Captain America is not this sort of a movie. Russo brother must have given an amazing efforts, and took a chance to make a movie this long to convey a story. But it paid off, the action became sideline because the story is gripping.The character build up was precisely done. On top of that, the new and returning characters were given adequate importance. Ant-Man was great, Spidey and Black Panther had a great intro, Cap and Stark had marvellous confrontations.Now talking about action scenes, they were innovative. We saw a lot of it never scene before. It was fresh and kept us at the edge of our seats.Bucky did good too. He had a fare share of footage and most of the story revolved around him. Daniel Bruhl, another new addition was mysterious and well suited in his role. Friendship was the root cause of this civil war, so I was expecting some heated arguments between friends who are facing each other, But I got more that what I expected, and I had high expectations I tell you that.The climax was exhilarating. With a good ending, all is set to make it one gem of a movie.",9,3,7,6 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," As entertaining as first one!
","It has a very strong story, stronger than the first one. I found it very fascinating that it was very easy to feel connected to the characters, to feel bad for them. It was a strong point for the first one also. The thing about conjuring is, and I am talking about both of them, is that it may not be scary enough for you, but it has all the element that a good girl movie should have, which is lacking now a days.They had to show what was happening with the affected family as well as they had to show the connection between Ed and Lorraine. They succeeded in doing that effectively. There was no problem in the acting department. Even the kids did there part very well. I've always been a fan of James Wan. He did miracles here too. There was this feel of constant tension on screen which holds well with the story. So, my verdict is that you should check it out, like seriously make sure you watch this one. Can't decide which of the two films I liked better.",8,0,2,12 June 2016
Inside Out," Thoroughly enjoyable!
","PLEASE WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY !!!I've been waiting for this movie for so long, so i decided to watch it first day first show, and it was one of my best animated movie experience. The movie is so interesting that it can easily be enjoyed by adults also.The movie tells the story of a little girl named Riley and why she does what she does. So, the concept is that there are these little people, if you may call them that, in everyone's mind which focuses on the mood of the person who's mind they live in. So Riley has Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. The film then tell us what happened when Riley's parents suddenly decide to move, but instead of How Riley is dealing with it, we see it inside out, that is, how these small creatures are dealing with it.The movie is thoroughly entertaining in all its aspects. Some people are arguing that its too complex for a kid's mind but what can they do when people of our age will love it. It contain a lot of perfect pixar moments, like Toy Story 3. It also tell the tale of how kids deal with all the stuff around them, and what is going on in their mind and as i see it, inside out has done this job perfectly. I liked it instantly because it is funny and then sad but something never seen before. The crew that was behind this movie should really be appreciated for being so original and creative. There were some shots which clearly tell us that the movie makers didn't bother if the shot could be too heartbreaking. They went on with a focus storyline and everything fall into its place. Just like any other pixar movie. So, please go check it out. I think it has that quality which we once saw in Toy Story.",9,5,28,25 June 2015
A Quiet Place," A Silent Masterpiece
","A Quiet Place is a movie which tells the tale of a family which is forced to live in silence when their lives are threatened by some sort of creatures who have taken over the world. The cast includes real-time couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt along with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. The film is directed by John Krasinski himself who, before this, has one more directorial credit before this movie. First of all, let me try to make it clear how much I liked the film. I think this movie is a silent masterpiece and there are so many others which try to reach this level but haven't in my opinion. This movie had the power which Don't Breathe (2016 crime thriller directed by Fede Alvarez and starring Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette) only touched upon but couldn't master. Movies like these force the audience to hold their breath as if they're in the film's setting and even one sound from us could also be harmful to the characters inside the film. This was strengthened by the crisp and effective development of characters so that we immediately felt connected to the family and also feared for them. I was 10 mins in and I knew I am going to like it. In just 1.5 hours the movie has so many awesome scenes that throughout the movie I had a lump in my throat. I wouldn't say that I was scared, not at all, but I'll say this much, this movie made sure that I'll stay clear of any kind of rusty nail (you'll know, go watch it). Now, let us talk about what makes it so good. First, the silence. The music is perfect and only used when absolutely required. Kind of like Gravity (2013 Alfonso Cuaron directed, should not need any more introduction than that), where the music only comes into play when the debris from the spaceships becomes visible. The similar concept was tried in Hidden (Also about a family, living in a bomb shelter after an outbreak on the surface, hiding from whatever is out there), 2015 horror mystery by Duffer Brothers, but as I said earlier, A Quiet Place perfected it. The star cast limited and fitting. The reason this movie was my most awaited this year was one, intriguing trailer and two, Emily Blunt. After Edge of Tomorrow, Blunt is my new favourite. Krasinski was a plus as I wanted to see what he would do here, something totally different than what he is known for. Also, Simmonds continues to amaze me. After a decent performance in Wonderstruck, she deserves a thumbs up here as well. A similar comparison can be done with 10 Cloverfield lane, a 2016 horror mystery which worked because of an outstanding cast including Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman.I just don't understand how these actors are so good at directing suddenly. First Jordan Peele with his Oscar-worthy direction with Get Out and now Krasinski. The direction in this feels so mature that it was hard for me to believe at first that it's his second feature. The editing reminded me of Baby Driver (which I feel was the best last year, Dunkirk, a close second). So, in conclusion, I would say I loved it. Go watch it as soon as you can in your nearest theatre, I know I will watch it again whenever I get the chance. I have only one complaint and that is why did it end! Can we have a sequel, please!",8,2,3,11 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Repetitive and boring
","Dead men tell no tales takes Jack Sparrow, Henry Turner and Carina Smyth on an adventure of finding Poseidon's trident, which has the capability of giving its bearer the full control of the sea. Henry is non-other than the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Kiera Knightley) from the 'Curse of the Black Pearl' trilogy. Henry wants this trident to break his father's curse. But like all the other POTC movies, there is a villain who wants the same thing at the same time and also, wants to kill Jack Sparrow. And there is Barbossa because he has to be in all the movies. A critic from Screencrush wrote, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales is the sort of sequel that's so bad it makes you retroactively wonder why you liked the original film so much in the first place.' I just watched it and felt the same. They have put all expected clique of the previous movies and mixed it up to present before the audience hoping that we will like it. We liked it the first time, In 2003, when Curse of the Black Pearl came, everyone was in love with the character 'Jack Sparrow'. It was a completely satisfying swashbuckler fun but it was also complete in itself. After looking at its success, they made two more. I won't deny saying that I found them okay too as any production house might have done that and also, they were not quite bad. The trilogy was complete and they should've stopped there. But, then the graph took a nosedive. On Stranger Tides was bad but this one is a mistake. It is so boringly repetitive that I lost interest during the climax. The jokes were not funny this time. It felt as if they asked Johnny Depp to do something 'Jack Sparrowy' and they recorded it. The character additions played by Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario were not convincing enough. Geoffery Rush's Barbossa is now unbearable. Javier Bardem tried but you cannot save a sinking ship alone. They even tried to bring some characters from the initial movies back to send you into nostalgia but it is not going to work. These thoughts about how much I disliked the movie came later. What came to my mind after coming out of the theater is that there were serious plot holes. SPOILER ALERT => Salazar and his crew had some connection with Jack's compass. They came to attack mode after Jack gave it away. But as far as I can remember, Jack has lost it or given it away to someone a dozen of times in previous installments. Where was Salazar then?It's not like there is nothing to like, there are some moments to laugh. Also, visual effects are great. But the series has lost its touch. Maybe instead of heavily relying upon Jack Sparrow to make people laugh, they should focus more on what else can be done, what new horizons can be explored. I am telling this because they are planning to make another one. It is starting to feel like transformers, should've stopped after the first one, or after the trilogy.",5,6,15,27 May 2017
Lincoln," Daniel Day-Lewis
","This movie has been reviewed more than 600 times so no need for me to say the same things again. But after watching it, i felt compelled to speak out how much i loved Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Lincoln. I could not have imagined him as Lincoln before i saw him. Now, when someone say Lincoln i see Daniel's face.The dialogues were amazing too. They way Lincoln tells any story was captivating. Not to mention how well these dialogues were delivered by Lewis. No wonder he won Academy Award for this.I have seen only one of his movies before this, In the name of the father, but now, after watching this, i am a die hard fan.",7,1,2,17 November 2015
Jurassic World," not satisfied....
","Hey guys...! Have you seen Jurassic World yet ? I have and i think if you have seen the Jurassic park, the first one, you will be least impressed.Here is what i think of the movie. Jurassic World comes with all the clichés we already saw in previous editions. Obviously those things made the first one a masterpiece, they make this 'something we have already seen'. You remember those shots when they present a giant dinosaur, they focus on its feet and then slide fast hiding the body of the dinosaur and then a close shot of the eye, yeah i am talking about these shots. They were there back then, they are here now. Andi don't know why, in all Jurassic movies, kids doing the dumbest possible thing never get killed. Just joking, everybody love kids.Chris Pratt is no where near his performance for Guardians of the Galaxy. Bryce Dallas is surely someone to look forward to, and Irfan Khan has been on screen definitely more than i expected, that is good.So, if you want an experience like Godzilla (the new one, which i liked more, but they are kinda similar) where their are 'some' awesome shots with thrilling music and dinosaurs roaring (yes, only those were awesome when the dinosaurs were roaring) you can have a go at it. It maybe the case that you like it only on big screen. I think this could happen.",6,4,11,12 June 2015
Logan," Logan - review of an awesome emotional drama
","Buzz was all around about this one. Many have been waiting for long to watch it. The trailers were remarkable. I was eager too, but I was skeptical about it at first because I have seen the first two wolverines. Now, as I am here writing this review, I just cannot stop thinking how oddly satisfying that movie was. I was glad to see a marvel movie that is SO NOT marvel. It had elements which we do not expect a superhero movie to explore. That is why I can say with no doubt it was a breathtaking emotional drama.It's 2029. Wolverine is old and a junkie. He drives a taxi for a living, just keeping his head down hiding from his past. He helps around to take care of Charles, Professor X who is not capable of what he was once. Mutants are gone. What is left is a life which is hard for everyone, with only one purpose â€“ survive, somehow. It was really gloomy seeing two of our beloved characters in circumstances like this. Then, they found a purpose. A girl, mutant, just like wolverine and then begins the ultimate chasing game.Some of the scenes were so powerful, you just can't help but feel bad for the characters, especially Logan. Quoting Pierce, played by Boyd Holbrook, 'Logan, just seeing you like this broke my damn heart!'. Also, the movie is brutal to the core. Everyone in the theater was gasping during the action sequences. This is not it. The movie plays with humor effortlessly, placing it at precise points in the perfect amount. The character development is so strong, that you will overlook that they have superpowers. I remember there was this one conversation on-screen and it was such an emotional one that I was thinking about it long after it was done.The actors did a wonderful job. For Hugh Jackman, I have no words. For me, it was his best performance so far. Patrick Stewart's old sick Charles will unquestionably be remembered for long. Daphne as the young girl was superb. I don't know how they managed to show the kind of fight she did but it was something incredible to watch. A special mention should be given to Boyd Holbrook, who played mean villain Pierce. His humorous demeanor and southern accent added to the charisma of his role.So, go watch Logan as soon as you can to your nearest theaters. Some would say that it is the best superhero movie they have seen in a very long time. I would say that for me the best would be Civil War. This is because I won't put Logan and other superhero movies in the same category. Logan is something different altogether. All the more reason to watch it right?",8,2,6,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Liked the first one more.....disappointed.
","Lets start with all the good things, all the treats that this movie brought us because no doubts there are plenty of them. Stark tries to jump start a peacekeeping mission and something unexpected happened and now avengers have to deal with it.Movie starts with a bang. Avengers are all set for a mission and they are jumping their and dodging this and all that and 'the twins' are introduced. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver played by Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson respectively. I must say this new addition is really exciting, not only in this movie, but i am waiting for more involvement of them in future avenger projects, despite of such an enormous star cast. Now one by one let us talk about the director and the actors. Joss Whedon, he is a genius, or was, i don't know, all i know is i liked Firefly very much and this movie, i don't think it can compete with that, but what i was disappointed to see that as the movie proceeds it executes a very good story, also long, in a very easy going way. It does not have any of that charm that the first installment had. Also there are too many one liners, you know those sarcastic dialogues given to the actors (mostly to Downey Jr.) where they expect small laughs from the audience. I mean they were good in the first one but really used here over the limit. But no problem with the direction business. Its just when i hear Joss Whedon, i think of something that is perfect for me, this movie isn't.Now Robert Downey Jr. is again in his best form, nobody can deny that when he is there, only he is there. The story around iron man is not so exciting though.Chris Evan made an impression. There was a small portion about Captain America's past and his choices for his present, that i liked very much. Mark Ruffalo seemed tired, mainly because he turned green for a long time in this movie, but his screen sharing with Scarlet Johansson was okay. Scarlet was sexy as always with some really great action moves. Chris Hemsworth has some important part to play with which he did justice. Jeremy Renner was really looking good when standing with all those superheroes, i mean in the first he was almost insignificant.Elizabeth and Quicksilver were good, but their role was too small, they almost weren't looking that special, nor was Paul Bettany, i am a huge fan by the way, but seeing his suddenly appearing as a very important character felt forced. The movie was good, i gave it 8 right, but the thing is i gave the previous Avengers a 9. I missed the thrill that was there all the time in that film, maybe because it was a new concept and now when this is a follow up, it isn't looking so exciting.",7,1,7,25 April 2015
La La Land," 'Here's to the fools who dream....'
","When I was finished watching the first song of the movie, I know I am going to like it.La La Land made me smile all the way till the end. It is well written, well scored, well directed or should I say choreographed. It was like that Damien Chazelle succeeded to do exactly what he had in mind. I laughed and I sighed like a 14-year-old schoolgirl. I am still hearing those songs as I am writing this 2 hours after I watched it.The performers have done a great job. I like Emma Stone but was not a fan of Ryan Gosling. Now, I definitely am. Both of them gave a phenomenal performance Everything in this film, it just fits.But what will sweep you off your feet are the songs, 2 songs in particular. 'City of Stars' and 'Fools who dream'. For me, these two are going to be the top two songs in the playlist.I will recommend it to all of them who liked Whiplash, those who love musicals and even those who would want to watch just a romantic flick.",9,1,6,15 December 2016
Don't Breathe," Made me hold my breath!
","The way this movie plays with the silence is amazing. The audience focus on each and every breathe the characters take, each step they take. This movie certainly stands out as a benchmark for all the thriller but slightly horror movies out there. All the actors did a fantastic job and we get to see the best of all expressions, which is fear, on their face. The story line is great but I think I found out few loopholes, which I am totally going to neglect because overall it was an excellent experience. The characters were all very witty, not at all dumb like they are in similar kind of movies as we have seen in the past. So, I would totally suggest you watch it in theaters. The sound(or I should say silence) creates the atmosphere as if you are in the same situation, in the same house. Also, some of the scenes were, yes, breathtaking.",7,0,3,19 September 2016
The Witch," Will make you feel uneasy in your own skin.
","This is again one of those films which people who really admire watching good quality movies will love, the rest will think that it is not their cup of tea and would not even bother to give it a chance.I personally was not happy to see the movie. Now, it does not mean that i didn't like the movie. In fact according to me it should be placed among the best of the best horror movies we have seen so far. It was just that it is so dark that you might develop a feeling that what if all this is true. The aura of the movie, the grave expressions on the face of the actors, the horrifying locations, it all fits to scare you. Some of the scenes are so powerful that you might want to see them again, but at the same time you will be scare to do so.Watch this film to find out the how easily a movie can scare you, without enormous visual effects and jump scares.",8,4,9,22 April 2016
Kong: Skull Island," An edge of the seat action monster flick!
","Kong: Skull Island is about a team of scientists and soldiers who went on to explore an uncharted island. Little did they know that they are trespassing into the territory of the Kong, the King of Skull Island. Also, the island is filled with many mythical creatures, hidden from the rest of the world. Now, the team must fight to escape the wrath of these creatures. The movie is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, known for 'The Kings of Summer', and starring a stunning cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly. The special effects team is the one to give credit for the success of the film. The movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang. Everyone of the action sequence, whether it be the introduction scene of Kong or the final fight between Kong and 'Skull Crawler', are so created so well that it develops, and maintains the thrill throughout the movie. The film is well paced. Character build up is concise as we were not there to know about a bunch of soldiers or scientists were we? We went to the theaters to watch the Kong, the mighty monster. We wanted him to throw things, to smash something, to kill and that is what the movie makers understood while making the film. They introduced Kong early and gave him ample extent of screen time. I saw many from the audience screaming in enthusiasm every time Kong appeared on screen. I guess the character has gained a decent amount of fan following. There were a lot many scenes involving different mythical monsters which added to the excitement.Apart from the constant edge of the seat action, two other things which I liked were the location and the soundtrack. The film is set in the era of 1970s, right after the Vietnam War. So, its soundtrack gave a feel of the 70s with songs by David Bowie, Iggy Pop etc. If we talk about acting, well, there was not much need of special efforts to be put in this department. If I have to mention someone I would say that I really like the character Hank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly. He was responsible of providing half the humor the movie has. All the other just added to the star value of the film. I can confidently say that the film fits into the pattern of a well- executed monster movie. Compared to the one which came in 2005, this one definitely has much more to offer, but I still can't choose if you ask me which one is better. But what I can tell you is that this one is going to be a part of something bigger, so make sure you watch this, and the 2014 Godzilla movie. Legendary films have recruited writers to create a monster universe (A Mosterverse!) including Godzilla and King Kong, how cool is that right!",7,6,11,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," the grand finale.....! Not that grand.
","Obviously it is a Peter Jackson movie, it has to be good. It has amazing special effects, emotional stuff, out of the world action sequences but then i don't know why i do not feel satisfied with the way this series has come to an end. The series ending movies has to be the best so that the greatness of the series will stick to people's mind. For example we remember Breaking Bad as an exceptional series and its smashing ending that is in our heart till now, but we remember Dexter not because of its amazing 7 seasons, but the season that came afterward, a total waste and unsatisfying finale. Same trend can be seen when it comes to movies. Now this Hobbit is surely less deserving then its predecessors. It loosely connects us with start of LOTR. May be it was lack of story as they have to make 3 movies out of 1 book or those long never ending battles scenes, something was not up to the expectations. But as i said earlier, it is a Peter Jackson film. It is surely watchable and enjoyable, just not as much as the other two Hobbits.",7,0,2,23 December 2014
Arrival," Mesmerising is what it is!
","This one, from start to end has a slow but engaging pace which may be boring for some but was essential for the theme of the movie if you ask me. I think the director made exactly what he had in mind. This is an example of next level cinema when you see the bigger picture but you have to step back a little.Arrival is a film about a linguistics specialist, played by Amy Adams who works with the government to find out what the entities in the spaceships, which suddenly ended up on earth one day, want. She is being helped by a specialist in physics, played by Jeremy Renner. Both of them do what is essential to interact with these entities, or aliens, to get to the bigger picture and ask bigger questions like what do they want from us?The movie does not only contain these conversations. Those are just the main pathway around which the whole story is build like a big city. The involvement of others, people's reaction to this event, mistrust among world powers are all things considered by the writers. This is what makes the movie special. So, I will suggest that sit back and enjoy this movie. Do not try to find meaning in everything or look for an explanation after every scene, because after some time the explanations will present itself to you in a subtle way which will leave a smile on your face.Also, I would like to add that I think you may not like this movie if you generally don't stand a slow pace. If you like Denis' other movies such as Enemy, Sicario and Prisoners you should go ahead with it.",8,0,3,1 December 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," No improvement at all.
","Hold the fingers of your hand so as if you are holding an egg. This is the size of what was important in the movie. Then hold your arms wide open. This represents the length of the film. So, i am not saying that it was a total waste of time, but it sure is near to it. You should not make a multi million budget film which is a sequel and not improve it. I see no difference. Shaky cameras, falling buildings, wrecking cars, its the same. Batman by Ben Affleck was the most tolerable thing for me, also Hans Zimmer's score was good but when it isn't. The film has so many characters and it failed to build everyone of them. There is just no sympathy for anyone of them in the heart of the audience. They tried to make it look tense but when the tension builds up they just crashed it face down.Go watch this one time watch movie if you liked Man of Steel and hope that the upcoming follow up of it will be better.",6,1,2,26 March 2016
Son of Saul," Maybe there is something that I didn't get.
","One thing can be easily said, it is definitely a great movie. There is a tension build which is so strong that you feel you are there standing right next to Saul. The camera is set as if the director wants the audience to stay with Saul the whole film(almost the whole movie). This helped us analyze every situation which is faced by him. The grave expression on his face tells a story in itself altogether. The background is faded, but you cannot help but notice everything that is going on around him. It is gruesome, but not the one the director wanted you to focus on. The thing which I don't get was the ending. Also, I think there may be some problems with the subtitles I was using because some of the dialogues made no sense at all. That is why i gave it this much. I will surely be watching it again some day because it is one of those movies which you don't forget. Even if you don't get it properly. :)",6,3,4,28 August 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Welcome Back, Mr. Wick!
","I've been waiting for this one for I don't even remember how long. Since I watched its John Wick in 2014, I became a fan of this character. John Wick, living a dull life, keeping it to himself and far away from the world. But when you mess with him, he will end you.First of all, I would like to say that I loved the first movie. I watched it, then I rewind it and watched all the action scenes again. It was classy, smooth, had great background score and most importantly, all the action scenes were so well choreographed that it looked like as if they were dancing.So naturally, my expectations were too high when I went today to watch Chapter 2 and I must say, it was every bit as awesome as the first movie. It was all there! The attributes of the chapter 1 which made me love it so much. The style, the class, sexy action sequences, the fear that the name 'John Wick' brings upon the faces of the bad guys, the slight humor about his retirement, his (another) dog etc. made it an apt sequel. Chapter 2 is similar to its predecessor on so many levels but still offers so much more. For example, a jaw-dropping ending which left the audience wanting more.The cinematography is definitely better. As far as the performance goes, Keanu Reeves never disappoints me. I like all of his performances but now I think I will always remember him in this avatar, as John Wick. The supporting cast did their part pretty well. There were some old faces, mostly new. Special credit should be given to Riccardo Scamarcio, who played Santino D'Antonio. Along with that, I liked Ruby Rose as well. She played a silent sexy killer. She was mute, but even she had some kick-ass dialogues, shown translated on screen! I loved the experience I had watching this movie. The deafening sound of the guns, the flashing lights, the flying bad guys and (a small spoiler :)) the bloody pencils! That is why I suggest you go and watch it in theaters as soon as possible. If you like the first movie, I am sure you will definitely like this one too. I don't know how long will they take to bring out its third installment but it better be quick.",8,3,8,18 February 2017
Annihilation," Beautiful, unique and captivating
","Annihilation is a movie about a team which goes into the Shimmer - this eerie place which suddenly appeared on earth one day and is now spreading its range. The team's objective is to find out what is happening inside which is making the previous teams to never return. The task seems simple enough but its not though. The movie is directed by Alex Garland from the fame Ex Machina. With only two credits to his name, Alex has achieved wonders. Annihilation is as beautiful as it is engaging. The movie has the precise amount of obscurity which is essential for it to stick to audience's mind and persist for a long time after watching it. I was really disappointed when they decided to halt the worldwide release and make it available on Netflix, because the visuals are amazing. Natalie Portman was astonishing as a soldier scientist who goes into the shimmer out of curiosity to know what happened to her husband, the sole survivor who does not seem himself since he returned. Apart from her, I really liked Jennifer Jason Leigh's character portrayal.
Annihilation is like Arrival (2016 movie by Denis Villeneuve) in so many manners. It is not quite an alien invasion flick. For most part, you don't know a lot of things but you're so enthralled by the movie that you will most definitely stick till the end to clear all your uncertainty, even come back to some of the scenes to gain clarity. I would love to see something like this again. It was original, visually stunning and captivating.",8,1,4,23 March 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," So much more than just a car chase.....!!!!
","Honestly speaking, i wasn't going to go to theater to watch it but the initial ratings had me wondering, how can a movie, which looks so full of wild looking people, whole trailer filled with sand and other things mainly of the shade of orange and brown and every scene of the trailer shout at the top of its voice that it is just a chase, can have a rating like this, and also the meta score.Out of respect to meta critics and the trust over the people who rated it before me, i went to check it out. Nobody in my circle for ready for this so i have to practically force some people to go with me and then they came out of the theater with satisfaction and respect of the idea.The idea behind this movie is to convert a car chase into a high octane, thrilling, jaw dropping and applauding sequence of action packed masterpiece.The actors were good like Tom Hardy has done a great job with a handful of dialogs given to him. But the movie belongs to Charlize Theron. Her expressions were too good. This movie from start to end present a chase on the road and nothing else, but i have never experienced this feeling of satisfaction and admiration after watching a movie with such a little story. I don't mean that there isn't anything worthwhile to follow during the film because their was, but it wasn't the center of the movie. The movie revolved around the action and violence every scene contained and not the story.I am glad that i watched it in theater and you should do so too. Mad Max would always be suggested in the greatest action movies from now on.",9,3,10,16 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Enough to keep the series going.
","Alien Covenant is definitely made out of the fear that what if the audience is not able to digest it, like what happened with Prometheus? So, they made sure to put a lot of masala in this one. By masala, I mean the scenes directly taken from the first 4 alien movies which we loved, the ones which made us jump with surprise. Alien Covenant is a follow-up after Prometheus. 2 prologues were released to connect the two film more appropriately, which I will suggest you watch before you go for this one, to connect the dots. The movie is about a colonization ship which is going to a planet but the crew decides to check a different planet first, from which a mysterious signal is being received. I like Prometheus unlike many of my friends as they missed the 'Alien' touch in it. So, when we saw Covenant with all the 'masala', they loved it. For me, the best part is Michael Fassbender's, David. It makes the film more interesting and brings depth to it. With his appearance, you start asking questions like, what happened to Dr. Shaw? What he's been up to till now? Does he still have 'issues' with humanity? The ending is quite intriguing and builds curiosity. Covenant is good enough to look forward to further installments.",7,10,23,14 May 2017
Furious 7," A furious ride....
","A furious ride, is what this film is. I love the franchise very much but it has made me question my liking to it not once but twice. Not this time. The series has gained a new life from furious 6 and then they came with a bang with this one. It's an amazing movie and a tribute to Paul Walker. The director, James Wan has become one of my favorite since insidious and conjuring but now he has done well in an entirely different genre. The action scenes look smooth and the cast, well it is the best ensemble the series had till this movie. I was on the edge of my seat every time Jason Statham pops on the screen. He displayed a style and finesse in his act which is difficult when their is Vin Diesel sharing screen with you. I loved this movie very much and i hope if the series continues that i will see something i new again.",8,0,0,8 April 2015
