Catch Me If You Can," Speilberg gets back to making family movies! (more or less)
","I finally caught up with this movie after trying to see it twice  and both times it was sold out.And what a film! Speilberg is having fun with his most joyously entertaining movie since Jurassic Park, possibly even Raiders of the Lost Ark. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Frank Abagnale Jr, the wayward runaway teenager who successfully outwits the FBI for four years, disguised as an airline pilot, a doctor and even a lawyer. Tom Hanks is back in comedy mode after his heavy performances in Road to Perdition, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away as the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail, whilst having to cope with incompetent staff and getting colours mixed with his whites at the launderette.This is Speilberg's most enjoyable film for years, and acts as a kind of redemption from the downbeat work he's presented us with over the last ten years.",Null,0,1,9 February 2004
Minority Report," And here is my Minority Report
","Minority Report had a lot to live up to for me, so perhaps I was building myself up for a bit of disappointment. I wanted it to forever banish A. I. from my mind. Now don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed the film and felt the the direction and main leads, Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow, were excellent. The story was well constructed, although there were several plot holes that only really became apparent as we talked about it on the way home. For me the main problem was the last three quarters of an hour, where the pace was allowed to slip, and there was a little too much explaining being done. I'm sure Spielberg did this so as not to fall into the same trap as the original version of Blade Runner, also based on a Philip K Dick story, which proved to be baffling to a great deal of the audience. There was also some rather alarming similarities to the noir classic L. A. Confidential, which I won't give away here in case you haven't seen it.Having said all this, I would still recommend this film, as it is a cut above the usual multiplex fare, and shows that after almost thirty years in the business, Spielberg is still a director full of suprises.",Null,1,2,9 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny and the Pirates (Not very original I know)
","In a summer full of blockbuster sequels like the Matrix , X2, Terminator 3, etc, it's great to see a new contender enter the ring. Okay, it's not entirely original as it's supposedly based on the Disneyland theme park ride of the same name, but I'm willing to forgive them in this case. This film is one of the funniest, most exciting and entertaining films I've seen in a long time. This won't surprise you if you're a fan of Mousehunt like me. In that film director Gore Verbinski proved that he had the great ability to balance slapstick comedy with dark subject matter. Given a larger canvas, exotic locations, a huge budget and Johnny Depp he has given us a movie that proves the potential he first showed.The plot follows the adventures of pirate Jack Sparrow as he attempts to track down his ship, The Black Pearl, and get his revenge on the crew that betrayed him. Meanwhile however the crew have fallen foul to an Aztec curse that has turned them into the walking dead, doomed to appear in their true form (frightening rotting corpses) when exposed to moonlight. This doesn't sound like the basis of a rollicking action comedy but believe me, it is. Johnny Depp based his pirate character on Ronnie Wood (of Rolling Stones fame), reasoning that pirates were the rock legends of their day, and results have to be seen to be believed. When you leave the cinema you will believe that Depp is the greatest actor of our generation, and if he doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this I will lose all faith in the Academy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to younger children, as I think the scenes with the zombies could cause nightmares, but for everyone else - you must see this film!",Null,0,0,9 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," Evil Dead fans will not be disappointed.
","This will just be a short review. But not too short or IMDB will keep telling me to add more lines.THIS IS A GREAT FILM! SEE IT NOW!Sam Raimi is brilliant. I've loved his films for years, but with Spidey he has surpassed himself. The way he balances the emotions with the action is amazing. You wouldn't expect a summer action blockbuster to have this much introspection and angst, but it does! And it works!Lots of people will talk about the special effects, which are great, but unless you have a good story to go with it it just doesn't work (see Van Helsing for confirmation). My only gripe with this film is that Doctor Octopus is underdeveloped as a character. But that's only a small gripe.I have a feeling that I will enjoy this film even more on subsequent viewings, and I can't wait to try. Roll on Spidey 3 in 2007!",Null,0,0,23 July 2004
The Others," Another great Haunted House movie
","Haunted house movies usually come in two categories: really good or really bad. In the latter are films like The Amityville Horror, and in the former I would add this movie along side classics such as The Haunting (the original).This is not a film for those with a nervous disposition. Hailed as the next Sixth Sense, a comparison that that is perhaps a little unfair, this movie will have you trembling in your seats and spilling your popcorn.Nicole Kidman stars as a mother trying to cope with bringing up two children in a large house on Jersey in 1945, still waiting for news of her long absent husband. Soon after the arrival of three new staff, strange things start to occur... If I told you any more of the plot it would spoil it. This is definitely one film where the least you know before hand the better. All I will say that it represents everything that is good about film; there is no swearing, gratuitous violence or nudity. Instead there is suspense and a great deal left to the imagination. I would certainly say it was suitable for anyone 12 or over that doesn't mind being frightened out of their wits!This film deserves to become a classic, and hopefully it will be allowed to shine on its own merits, and not draw too many comparisons with Sixth Sense or Others.",9,0,1,10 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode 3: The Typewriter Strikes Back
","This movie was a lot longer than I'd expected. I felt that the first half was a little to slow, and a bit flat, character-wise. George Lucas doesn't seem to be able to write convincing dialogue any more (Harrison Ford would argue that he never could in the first place). At some points it seems that he can't remember how to direct real actors either, so caught up as he is in the digital revolution. The second half was definitely an improvement, and Christopher Lee still commands  attention. It's a shame that he was not on for longer, but as he escaped at the end there's room for him in Episode 3. Let's hope so!",Null,2,5,9 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The film of a legend that is destined to become a legendary film.
","This movie is the first in a trilogy following Tolkien's epic translation of the ancient records, as they refer to the War of the Ring. This first part covers the gathering of the fellowship and the early part of their adventures as Frodo attempts to take the One Ring to Mount Doom to be destroyed. I don't wish to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet, but I can let you in on one secret - He doesn't get there by the end of the movie. I say this now because a lot of people I know forgot they were watching the first part of three and were most surprised at the end to see the quest unfulfilled. Parts two and three would be a bit pointless if it was.It's difficult to find the right words to fully describe this film. It is truly one of the most stunning, mesmerising movies you will ever see, and I have not the slightest doubt that The Two Towers and The Return of the King will be as well. The director Peter Jackson, a native New - Zealander, has created something that you will have never seen before. Only a film on this scale could possibly do justice to Tolkien's work, and if he were alive today I feel I can safely say that he would approve.There are however some elements that may well upset the die-hard Tolkien fans among you; most notably the omission of some fairly major characters such as Glorfindel and Tom Bombadil. However with a running time of over three hours, I feel Jackson can be forgiven. He has captured the feel and excitement of the book, and given it a great sense of reality. Tolkien created Middle - Earth to give Britain a mythology to match other great epics like The Iliad, and whilst watching the film you cannot help but believe that this is more history than fantasy.To say that I am looking forward to the release of The Two Towers in December would be too much of an understatement. I can't recommend Fellowship of the Ring enough, whilst I will readily admit that this is not a film for everyone, young children particularly, (despite its PG certificate), or people like my Mum that get motion sickness from fast camera work (she really did throw up in the middle of the film you know!).",10,0,1,9 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," PETER JACKSON IS A GENIUS!
","That statement pretty much sums up The Lord of the Rings. I could go on for hours about the incredible sets, the mind-blowing special effects, the emotional impact of the acting, the awe-inspiring scenery, the stirring score and the sheer bravery for anyone attempting to make these films in the first place, but I won't. I've already gone on about it to anyone that will listen for hours on end.So all I will say is that you have to see this film. You also have to see Fellowship of the Ring first or you'll annoy everyone in the cinema by asking 'Who's that?', 'Why is that happening?', 'What's going to happen to him/ her?' etc. for three hours.",10,0,0,9 February 2004
School of Rock," School of Rock rocked (original I know)
","This is a great film for all the family to enjoy, unless you don't like rock music. Actually, even if you're not keen on the likes of Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, you will still find something to like (even my wife liked it, and she's usually the first to complain when anything vaguely seventies comes on the stereo). Jack Black is very funny as the wannabe rocker who becomes a substitute teacher, but the real stars of the film are the pupils who are transformed from public school snobs to rockers in just a couple of weeks.On the negative side it's not a particularly original plot (it's basically Dead Poets Society with pre-teens and loud music), although it doesn't go for the most obvious ending, and no one commits suicide.See it now!",8,0,0,10 August 2004
The Green Mile," I have the solution! (Major Spoilers ahead!!)
","Okay, so it was a nice film and all that, but I can't enjoy it now because I've seen such an obvious solution to their problem that now it just bugs me that they didn't do it. Don't read this if you don't want the plot revealed to you - (SPOILER ALERT)John Coffey showed Paul that it was Wild Bill that killed the little girls, and that is why he turned Percy Wetmore (quite a funny name, which I'm sure was done on purpose) into a vegetable, who in turn shot Wild Bill. Paul then had to explain that Percy just went nuts, and this was in no way connected to John Coffey's magic powers. Later on he can't decide what he is going to do about John's execution, so they end up putting him in the chair.So here's what he should have done: Told the warden that Wild Bill confessed to killing the two girls, and Percy in his loony state shot him in disgust. Therefore John is innocent, and they have four witnesses to back up the story, so they can let John go. He can then live forever with Paul and the mouse and no one needs to ride the lightening.Simple huh?
(END OF SPOILERS)Leaving all that aside for a moment, The Green Mile is still a good film, but I don't think it's good enough to be in the top 250. The main problem is that there are two films in there- a top notch prison drama and a supernatural thriller. For me the two elements just didn't gel together to make one good film. The use of CGI jarred with the 1930's setting. They could still have had this guy with powers but I think it would have worked better if more was left to the imagination, not CGI lights and magic flies. This kind of thing probably read well in the book, but there are some things you should definitely leave out of Stephen King adaptations.",7,1,2,13 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," To paraphrase Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon, 'I'm too old for this Sith'.
","I went to see Star Wars at my local Warner Village in Newcastle under Lyme, and who should be there in person but Darth Vader himself, Dave Prowse! I was gutted that I didn't know in advance or I'd have brought my one of my Hammer DVDs for him to sign. He once played Frankenstein's monster, created by Peter Cushing's Baron. I was there too late to go home and get it, so I just went and spoke to him instead. He seemed quite pleased that I wanted to talk about Hammer films as no doubt everyone else was all about Star Wars. He was charging £20 for signed photos, so I made do with a handshake.As for the film itself, I was bored. It was at least an hour and a half too long. However, I'm sure that anyone under the age of seventeen will love it. I was very disappointed at Christopher Lee's brief appearance as Count Dooku. He cancelled his Manchester signing last summer that I had tickets for so he could go and do re-shoots down in Shepperton, and for what? He could have shot all that in about half an hour! So, in brief, see it if you are a child, or have children. For everyone else, stick to episodes IV - VI. I think part of my problem is that one of the things I love about the original trilogy was that it felt like you were coming in on the middle of something, like there was a history and a back-story that gave it all depth. I think it cheapens that by actually showing it. The way Anakin finally turns to the Dark Side was just a bit lame. I'd rather not have known! It is for this reason that I hope Peter Jackson never makes The Hobbit into a movie. It's the history that gives these films greater depth. We don't need to see that history made into a movie!",5,2,5,20 May 2005
Vanilla Sky," At last! The title makes sense!
","Before I saw this film that title made no sense to me. Now it does.
***SPOILERS AHEAD!***It's a bit like Sixth Sense, in that it's not until the end when it all makes sense, and you could go back to the beginning and pick up on all the clues. In Sixth Sense it was the different coloured door handle, in this it's the titular Vanilla Sky.I do have one rather obvious question about this movie, and I'm sure I'm not the first to ask it - If David could choose when his real life ended and the dream began, why didn't he pick the night he spent with Cruze before he got into the car with his psycho girlfriend? That way he need never have had the crash, complete with scars. I guess the answer is that it wouldn't have made for a very interesting movie. Also, perhaps if he had done that he would have just got into the car with her again anyway. Who knows.This is a good movie. It's got too much sex in it, but it does make you think, which doesn't happen enough in films these days. I've never seen the original so I can't compare them, but it does seem as though Crowe and Cruise have done a good job.",Null,1,2,15 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A long way since Meet the Feebles...
","As the poster for the recent Scary Movie 3 boldly declares - 'All Great Trilogies Come In Threes'. And thus comes to an end one of the greatest trilogies of all times. No, not Scary Movie but LOTR. I have been to see this film twice now and all I can say is 'Incredible'. There aren't enough words available to describe how I felt at the end of this movie.I've said it before and I'll say it again: Peter Jackson is a genius. He seems like a quiet, overweight, unassuming, slightly eccentric character (Fact: he never wears shoes, which is all well in good in nice clean New Zealand, but he goes barefoot even when he visits London!), but he has had the bravery and audacity to pull off the unthinkable and create three of the greatest cinematic works of all time. The thing that saddens me the most is that it's entirely possible that there will never be films again as moving and breathtaking as these. One of the trilogy's strengths, The Return of the King in particular, is that not only does have it have amazing special effects and completely unbelievable sound design (this film more than any other makes me want surround sound at home), but at it's core it has heart and emotion. You care so deeply about the characters that you cry when they cry, laugh when they laugh and feel fear when they are in danger. This for me is Jackson's greatest achievement. It would have been easy for a lesser director to lose sight of that in a large spectacle picture like this one (think Pearl Harbour), which just proves that Peter Jackson truly is one of the all time great directors and deserves all the praise and accolades that can be heaped upon him. But he's not interested in any of that. He's just happy to be making movies that audiences enjoy. His hobby is now his full time job.",10,0,1,9 February 2004
Gladiator," 'I'm Brian, and so's my wife,' OR 'What have the Romans ever done for us?'
","We saw this in a local flea - pit and sat in front of an old guy who gave a running commentary to his friend all the way through ('Look at the size of that spear, etc.'). Luckily it only served to enhance our enjoyment, rather than detract from it, providing a certain comedy element that was otherwise lacking.If you've seen Ben Hur, Spartacus and Braveheart then you've already seen Gladiator (not forgetting Life of Brian, which features one of the most memorable gladiator scenes in movie history). The action scenes are fairly entertaining, but not to be recommended to those of a squeamish disposition. The main character, Naughtius Maximus or something, is supposed to be Spanish, but sounds remarkably Australian throughout the film.
It's nice to see Oliver Reed back in action, reminding us that he used to be famous for more than appearing drunk on chat shows. However, for those of you that are unaware, he sadly passed away before the film was completed, calling for several rewrites and some technical jiggereypokery. Possibly the film does suffer as a result, as you get the feeling that some elements of the last act were stuck on with blu-tak.However, I did actually enjoy a lot of Gladiator, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the cowardly emperor who's desire for power (and his sister) gets a little out of hand. For those of you who like your action loud, brutal and featuring men in skirts I highly recommend this movie.",Null,0,1,10 February 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Don't forget your travel-sickness tablets!
","As you will no doubt be aware, this is the sequel to the highly successful spy thriller The Bourne Identity. All I want to say is that the plot, acting and direction are excellent, but there is one element that lets it down. This is a special warning to my Mum and anyone else!This film gave us all a headache. I was with a group of friends, and we all felt a bit ill by the end. The camera movement is unrelenting. The whole thing is shot cinema verite style, and as a result is very shaky. It's like the cameraman was wearing very lumpy shoes or something. In all the fight scenes there is so much movement you can hardly tell what is happening. Every time there was a smooth, steady shot you could hear the audience collectively breath a sigh of relief.So be warned! Don't watch this film if you're epileptic, or just easily nauseated by wobbly cameras!",7,0,1,16 August 2004
