The Ring," there are no words to describe
","When we went to the theater in a new town tonight I was astonished to find that ticket prices are almost $10. I reluctantly handed over my hard earned money to watch a movie I knew nothing about other than a few teasing commercials. Looking back, I would never question doing it again. The cinematography alone was enough to keep me there, but the story line, the plot, the ending...all of it was so twisted and catchy like the first time watching the Closure videos by NIN. I was hooked. I tell everyone to see this movie, dont take anyone's word for it but your own. It was a work of art that I will be thinking about weeks to come.",10,0,0,22 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Hope you weren't expecting the Matrix.
","Being an avid Matrix fan I was highly anticipating this movie...which was the worst let down I have experienced in years. The movie had several disappointments. (I don't know where to begin) Basically, they turned Trinity into the beginnings of a housewife, Neo's fight scenes were bad computer animation I would give 5 steps below a Final Fantasy, and the novelty of bullet-time action wore off last year. I think they actually de-evolved in the making of this film. The only credits I give this movie were the fight scenes with Morpheus, and the creation of a few new characters. Save your money...wait till the video.",1,0,0,16 May 2003
It Chapter Two," Probably the worst 'horror' movie I've ever seen
","I really enjoyed the first one - not an avid Steven King reader but this is a classic. First off, Pennywise feeds odd fears. Apparently it was stuck in clown mode because everyone kept getting the same version of pennywise and it didn't adapt to each person's fears like they do in everything else It related. The adults look nothing like the kids. I mean seriously they weren't even trying. There's a music scene in there that gave me Deadpool flashbacks that actually was an editing accident but they were too rushed to fix it. There were so many stupid jokes that it outnumbered their very poorly executed jump scares 10-1. The movie was so predictable that I could say what was going to happen right before it did. Why and how did a child go missing in a fun house for that long - getting trapped inside a glass box in a mirror maze - and no one noticed he was gone?? How are these guys not in prison they literally left a trail of bodies, including one of them putting a pickaxes in someone's head, then puking, and then fled the scene. They left a guy buried in the bottom of a well?? And fled the scene were a kid was murdered?? And then went home. Yeaaahh no. And since when is pennywise a frikkin alien?? Why did the tub they burned everything in not burn up? I mean seriously leather or wood the thing is gonna go up. And did this girl just walk into someone's house, go into the bathroom and just start ripping baseboards out? Not even quietly. And then left it. Why did the kids have completely different personalities than they did in the first? And why did they start off talking about the part they don't remember AFTER pennywise but suddenly we are having flash backs before then and it has nothing to do with their conversation?
Okay so this guy slit his wrists because the memories hit him and he went mad. It's the reason they all stayed, because if not they would all end up dead the same way...but yet later they read some letter saying he did it because he wasn't strong enough to go back and knew they would fail if he was alive and didn't go. But wait doesn't everyone have amnesia about that summer? Which one is it?
Omg I could keep going. The only saving grace is pennywise had a fantastic performance, but it was incredibly overwhelmingly stupid. They tried to cover how stupid the movie is with generic one like comedy. Which completely suffocates the horror movie feel.
I can't believe they released this garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass those adult actors off as grown up versions of the kids. I can't believe they spent half that movie in conversation that contradicts itself consistently. 'We have to stick together or we fail' 'everyone split up and find their artifact' 'I can't wait there's no time' (while everyone is right there in the house). Or how about at some point it turned into evil dead and a zombie was driving a psychopath around on a murder spree against the main characters with absolutely no explanation as to why.
Just horrible. If you're reading this and haven't seen it, don't waste your money. I'm sure it will be streaming soon enough it's just a pile of poop. Even my 11 year old hated it. He said the theater smelled because the movie was so much poop you could smell it. It was that bad.
Only reason it's not a 1 is for the inside joke about Steven King not being able to write a good ending. Even tho they beat that one into the ground too.",2,5,10,14 September 2019
The Breakfast Club," this movie
",This movie has some of the quotes that defined the 80's. It faces every subject and then throws it into a mixture of what-if's. It also started some of the 80's legendary actors of that generation. A must see!,8,0,1,4 August 2001
