The Ring," A total let down
","I expected a lot from this movie but it was a huge let down. There are merely no well known actors in this film. Naomi Watts does a mediocre performance in her lead role in this movie. The acting is sub par. The scenes in this movie where it's supposed to be scary are weak. Some scenes are scary and I do mean some, but the overall movie was weak. The plot of how she has to do research and the tv video tape thing is lame it is all lame and it gets boring and dry during the movie as well. The pace was bad about going to die in 7 days after watching the video tape. I mean it was just weak. If I were you I would avoid it.",6,0,0,2 November 2002
