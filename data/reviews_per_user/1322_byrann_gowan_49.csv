Moneyball," Every player is worth something
","It's the end of the 2001 season and the Oakland A's just lost the American League Division Series. To add insult to injury, they have just lost their star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen. Needless to say, the Oakland A's and their General Manager Billy Beane (played by Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt) is caught in a rut, and it doesn't help that he has the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If they want to win the World Series, they have to come up with something new. Eventually, he and his new assistant Peter Brand (played by Academy Award Nominee Jonah Hill) shake up the game when they use statistical analysis to place value on the players that they pick - a decision that has their entire scouting team and coach (played by Academy Award Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) up in arms about. This is a great film. Plain and simple. This film was nominated for a number of Academy Awards and, although it didn't win any, it clearly deserved each nomination. I don't know much about Sound Mixing and Film Editing, but kudos to those guys also getting some Academy love! However, let's start with the writing. First off, amidst two other guys, one of the writers is Academy Award Nominee Aaron Sorkin, who also penned A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War, The Social Network and Steve Jobs. Needless to say, this guys is a natural talent, and it was good to have him on here. Academy Award Nominated Director Bennett Miller is a master of knowing how to use his actors in each scene he directs; his movies are all about character development, and they delve into the psyche of each character. He really should've been nominated for Best Director for this film over Terrence Malick for The Tree of Life.But of course we must now turn to the actors involved. First I want to start off with some of the more supporting actors in this film. In one scene, you have Golden Globe Winner Robin Wright who, in her one scene, is absolutely amazing :) Then you got Chris Pratt, who is especially well known for his portrayal of Star Lord in the MCU, Emmet in The Lego Movie franchise and Owen in the Jurassic Park franchise (yes I know he's in Jurassic World, but let's face it, that's an entire franchise from 1993 - present); he does a good job with the limited amount of lines he's given. But now to the main three actors. First off to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays the General Manager Art Howe, a man who is a traditionalist; he believes that baseball was built on the greatness of the scouts and players. Hoffman captures the gruffness very convincingly; he is a great actor who is still sorely missed. The biggest surprise to me was Jonah Hill. The mark of a great actor is when they can pull off different genres. While Hill is most well known for his comedies, this was his first non-comedy movie, and the next year he would star in the action-comedy 21 Jump Street. Needless to say, I believe that Jonah Hill will be considered a great actor in the years to come. I was hesitant to see him in this role, but he knocked it out of the park and he was excellent as Peter Brand. But of course, most of the credit has to go to Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the sports GM who is looking for a way to change the game in their favor, since it is his job that is on the line. If his way doesn't work, he will be out on the streets. Pitt conveys the desperation that Beane went through at that time; you can see the pain of a man who was once a promising young baseball player but who ended up being a disappointment. He really wants that ring on his finger, and he is willing to pull out all the stops to do it. Kudos to Pitt for such a great job!Overall, go and watch this movie! It is a great movie!",8,1,1,31 August 2018
The Avengers," I have one piece of advice for reviewers:
","GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Like, right now. Just drop everything, and go see this movie!!! It is 100% worth it.When Loki, the god of mischief who we saw in 'Thor,'played by Tom Hiddleston, threatens the safety of the world, SHIELD director Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, brings together a team of superheroes, most of which come from the last few Marvel superheroes movies: Iron Man, played brilliantly once again by Robert Downey Jr., Captain America, played by Chris Evans, The Incredible Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo (taking over for Edward Norton), Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, Black Widow, played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, and Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner. Together, they must stop Loki from initiating his plan.Let me just say this as my starting point for the review: A movie about a team of superheroes is always risky to make, the risk being that perhaps one of the superheroes will get the short end of the stick. Well, I can easily say that each one of the Avengers get their own scenes, their own stories, and their own moments. In other words, thank God for Joss Whedon and his team for coming up with a script in which everyone plays a good part of the story in some way.Now the actors: Each one of them does a very good job in their role. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is very good as Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston really knows how to deliver the bad guy character, especially when it comes to the Norse god of mischief. Jeremy Renner is great as Hawkeye, as is Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow. You can tell that there is something between the two characters. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and Mark Ruffalo proves that he is one of the better actors when portraying Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, and of course, like I said, Robert Downey Jr brilliantly plays the Iron Man character well. Just seeing someone so noble like Captain America argue with someone really arrogant and cocky like Iron Man is always a pleasure to watch.As for the action sequences and the special effects: do I really even need to comment on this part? This is the reason why you are seeing this movie (or at least the main reason). You want to see these guys battle it out in awesome battle sequences, which they do. The 3d, believe it or not, is actually pretty good in those sequences, specifically when something blows up and debris is flying everywhere and when Hawkeye's arrows go toward the screen.All in all, a really great movie. Joss Whedon, we trusted you and you did not let us down, buddy. If you want, I'll get you a beer and we can talk about the sequel (speaking of which, stay after the credits). The Avengers lives up to the excitement, with a script that never loses the heroes compassion, and with great action sequences. A 10/10 for me.",9,3,8,10 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Not Tom Hanks best film, but...
","... He is perfect as Robert Langdon. I don't blame him for this movie, and The Da Vinci Code, for getting the hatred that it did. That blame should go to the writers of this movie. In my opinion, they did a good job with this movie in particular, but of course, it is probably not as good as the book (I'm saying 'probably' because I've never read the book, but I know that movies that are based on books are almost never as good as the books themselves). The writers had a hard task of transferring this to the big screen, and while they could not get every single detail in, they do stick with the main source of the plot, so it is still a decent enough movie. Again, it's not Tom Hanks best movie (watch Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, the Toy Story movies, and Saving Private Ryan if you want him at his very best), but I blame the writers for that. So, an 8/10 for me.",7,2,3,30 October 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," An improvement over the first
","'Sherlock Holmes' was a great movie. This is even better.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as the famous detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson, as they try to take down their fiercest enemy, Moriarty.This is a great movie. The action scenes were great, and the story was great as well. The slow motion sequences were always put to good use, but there was one sequence, in which they are running through the woods, in which it worked the best. Guy Ritchie proves that he is still the guy to direct these films.However, what makes this film great is the actors and their characters. Watching Downey Jr. and Law interact with each other was always amusing, but another aspect that made this film great was Sherlock's interactions with Moriarty. Moriarty is just as smart and as cunning as Holmes is, so while this proves a great challenge for our famed detective, it is always intriguing to see them interact with each other. For this reason, it is always fun to see who comes out in the end. And speaking of the end, I won't mention what it is, but the last scene is so strange and so well done that it is without a doubt the best scene in the movie.Overall, I recommend this film. This is unlike any Holmes that we've ever seen (other than the first film). He is old London's Jack Sparrow, and therefore, he is such fun to watch. A 9/10 for me.",8,0,2,30 December 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Leave your brains at the door
","I truly do recommend this flick to anyone who loves action.The story is that Ethan Hunt must deal with an arms dealer while protecting his identity from his girlfriend, Julia. The story here really doesn't matter, since the action is the main thing in this series, but the actors do deliver here.This time around, Hunts team is played by Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, and Ving Rhames. All of these guys do a great job in their roles. Keri Russel plays a field agent that Hunt and his team have to rescue in the beginning, and she does a great job as well. Michelle Monaghan is great in the damsel in distress role, and unlike many other damsel in distress roles, she's not annoying at all. Plus, she's hot, so that's a bonus.Philip Seymour-Hoffman plays a great bad guy. He is truly the baddest of the bad guys of all of the Mission: Impossible movies, and he is so believable, he almost steals the show. However, you can't have a Mission: Impossible movie these days without the main man Tom Cruise. This is, without a doubt, his most famous role, and it is a role that he was born to play. In 20 years, I could still see him playing this role.All in all, a great action flick. The performances are all great, but you will only enjoy it if you leave your brain at the door. I know I did, and I loved every bit of it. A 9/10 for me.",7,2,3,21 December 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the greatest young adult films you will ever see
","In this film, Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is an outsider who is coping with the suicide of his best friend, as well as with his own mental illness. He struggles to find friends, but soon finds them in Sam, played by Emma Watson, and Patrick, played by Ezra Miller. He is particularly smitten with Sam and they go on adventures, showing him what it's like to be a teenager.This is such a beautiful film. It really is one of the greatest young adult films ever, and it's all sold in the main three actors' performances. Logan Lerman is perfect as the guy who nobody notices at a party, while Ezra Miller is great at playing the wild and unusual character. The one who really surprised me, though, was Emma Watson as Sam. It was going to be hard for her to come out of the shadows as Hermione Grainger, but she does it so effortlessly that I think that, although it will be her most famous role, she doesn't seem to have any problems branching out and trying new things.What really got to me more than anything was the characters themselves. You really cared about these guys. You wanted them to just be there for each other through thick and thin, no matter what the cost was. This is a beautiful film about friendship and I just can't say enough about it. Go and watch it. You'll know what I'm talking about.",9,4,6,22 August 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's not the years; it's the mileage
","You could pretty much say the same thing about this movie. Although over 30 years old, this movie holds up incredibly well to today's standards: fun, action packed, exciting, with a bit of religiosity in it (you'll see what I mean when I tell you the plot summary). This is everything that you could possibly want in an Indiana Jones flick.I know that pretty much everybody here has seen the film, but for those of you who are living under a rock, here is what it's all about: Indiana Jones (played to perfection by the legendary Harrison Ford, a man who's made his career in playing grizzled action heroes), an archaeology professor, sets off to find the lost ark of the covenant - the ark which was supposed to hold the broken pieces of the tablets which had the ten commandments on them (like I said, religiosity). He travels with his love interest Marion (the best female sidekick of the series, played immensely well by Karen Allen) to Egypt to dig it up, but his old nemesis Rene Belloq and a whole bunch of Nazis are also searching for the ark in their pursuit of power.Okay, do I really need to say how amazing this movie is? It's a classic! Harrison Ford is known for playing heroes such as Han Solo from the Star Wars franchise and Rick Deckard from the Blade Runner franchise; here he plays possibly the world's greatest adventurer and he seems to really love the part. While I have also mentioned Karen Allen's performance, I must also give a nod to Paul Freeman for convincingly playing an evil archaeologist whose lust for power is not healthy to say the least. All of the other supporting players do superb jobs as well.But you can't review this movie and not give credit to the two men who are responsible for getting it made: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. What's to say about Spielberg? This is the guy who made Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc. When it comes to directors...heck, when it comes to movies...he is the guy who changed the game forever. And as for George Lucas, say what you want about his Star Wars prequels, but he was the one who introduced us to a galaxy far far away. Simply put, these are two of the greatest storytellers of all time.I think I've said enough. Now go and watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.",9,0,0,23 August 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Wooo! A Great Adventure Movie!
","Anybody and everybody should see this movie. Period. End of story.I'm 18 years old, I was born in the 90's, and so I watched films like Aladdin, The Lion King, and Toy Story. However, I am not oblivious to the awesomeness of the movies of the 80's and this is just one of those movies.First off, let me say that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, both having directed a few not-so-good movies, are both masterminds when they put their hearts and souls into movies; this is one of those movies. Spielberg proves once again why some of his movies, like 'Jaws,' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' 'Jurassic Park,' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' to name a few, are among the most famous movies in history. As for George... well, let me just say that he has shown here that he can do more than just outer space battles in a galaxy far far away...Now, to the cast: I think that we all agree that they are all pitch perfect here. Paul Freeman is great as the antagonist Belloq. Karen Allen is stunningly beautiful as the damsel in distress Marion, although she clearly shows that she can hold her own in battle. And, of course, the man Indiana himself. No one can play the role better than Harrison Ford. He brings life to the character, the movies, and so if I had to choose his signature character in any of his movies, it would be Indiana. I think I speak for a lot of people here.All in all; it's worth it. Rent it, buy it, do whatever you can, just make sure you go and see this movie. It's 100% worth it.",9,1,2,16 October 2011
Star Trek," Abrams has boldly done what no man has done before
","And that is reinventing the Star Trek franchise, and giving it new life.Supposedly, according to some people's opinions, this tells of the early days of Kirk and Spock as if it is an origins story of Kirk and Spock. It could be taken this way. I, however, prefer to look at it actually as a continuation of the old franchise for reasons I will talk about later.Let me just say that everyone that was a part of this film deserves a round of applause. The acting and the behind the scenes work (all of it) was spot on, and I couldn't find any reason to not give this film a 10/10.Let me talk about the acting, because, while I could go on and on about the action scenes and the special effects, it's really the acting that stood out in this. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto: I can imagine what it's like for you guys to take on enormous roles as Kirk and Spock. Great job, you guys; you have made new fans of the series, and the old fans are proud of you guys.There are actually quite a lot of well-known actors and actresses here, but that doesn't deter the film, as it does in other films. We have John Cho playing helmsman Hikaru Sulu; Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek; Bruce Greenwood as USS Commanding Officer Pike; Simon Pegg as Chief Engineer Montgomery 'Scotty' Scot; Winona Ryder as Spock's mother Amanda Greyson; Zoe Saldana as Chief Communications Officer Uhura; Karl Urban as Chief Medical Officer McCoy; Anton Yelchin as USS Navigator and security/tactical officer Chekov; Eric Bana as Captain Nero; And... get ready, because a bomb is coming... Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime! That's right! Leonard Nimoy! Quinto must have been shaking in his boots at the thought of portraying Spock in front of Spock (literally!)! I know I would have. A great job to everyone here; you all did your job well.There is a lot of action, but before that happens, we see a little bit of back story to the Spock and Kirk characters, and because we get to know them, we start to care about them.Overall, it's a great film that gives more life to a classic series with humour, action, a great story, great acting, and some very pleasing special effects. This will please the usual Trekkie fan, and perhaps gain new ones. A solid 10/10 for me.",8,7,12,18 February 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A rebellion built on hope
","In between the events of Episodes III and IV, it seems like all hope is lost for the rebellion when they find out the existence of the weapon known as the Death Star, which is well-known in the movie universe as a weapon that can destroy whole planets. However, when it is learned that there is a weakness in the Death Star plans, the rebellion - led by Jyn Erso (played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones) - go all out to get the plans to the Death Star so that there can once again be hope in the galaxy.All in all, a great movie! The actors are all great in their parts. Felicity Jones plays off the plucky, rebellious hero well; she is dealing with the absence of her father, who was taken by the Imperial forces when she was a young child. Diego Luna is fantastic as her right hand man, while Emmy Nominee Alan Tudyk (who by now is well known for his voice over roles) provides comic relief as K-2SO. We also get some accomplished veterans that join the Star Wars universe; Academy Award Winner Forest Whitaker plays the wise Saw Gerrera, while Mads Mikkelsen portrays Jyn's father.While the only well-known director in the Star Wars universe used to be George Lucas, in recent years, it has gotten more well-known directors in the directors chair, such as J.J. Abrams, Rian Johnson and Ron Howard. This time, it is Emmy Nominee Gareth Edwards, who is well-known for his direction in Monsters and the big monster blockbuster Godzilla. Here he takes the Star Wars direction to new places, and while I did miss the lightsabers, it was a refreshing change of pace for the Star Wars franchise. He focuses more on the war aspects of the story and not just the characters or the flashy moments.All in all, a great Star Wars film! Go and watch it!",8,2,4,30 August 2018
The Impossible," A horrific look at one of the biggest natural disasters in human history
","No matter how different people are from each other, there is always an event that seems to bring people together. Unfortunately, it is usually when something bad happens and such a thing happened on Christmas of 2004 in Southeast Asia when a Tsunami hit many countries in the area. One of the countries that was hit the hardest was Thailand and this movie clearly shows the devastation of the horrific event.The movie is about a family of 5 - two parents (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three kids (one of whom is played by a young Tom Holland). They are vacationing in Thailand. They are having a wonderful Christmas when, all of a sudden, a tsunami hits the streets and literally destroys everything in its path, tearing the family apart.Before I get to the amazing performances - and indeed they are amazing - I must start off with the wave sequence itself. Everybody that was a part of this sequence deserves an Oscar for their stellar work. Although horrific, every aspect of it is beautifully done. We see people getting hit around by debris under water; we see people hanging on to fallen trees for dear life; we see people struggling to stay afloat amidst the roaring waves. J.A. Bayona has created a great sequence in a great movie and he really should have been recognized a lot more for this movie.That being said, it really is the performances that sell this movie more than anything. Naomi Watts gives one of the best performances of her career, earning the Oscar nomination for her part in the film. She spends about 2/3 of the film beaten, bruised and looking nothing like a Hollywood star, and you can really see the emotions that are going through her head. There's one particularly scene towards the end where she says something that will make your heart break. I won't say what it is, but you'll know when she says it. Ewan McGregor also gives an unbelievable performance; seriously, when is the Academy going to honor this man? He really deserved the Oscar nomination for Moulin Rouge and he deserved it here too. I really hope that he gets recognized someday because he really deserves it. However, the true star of the show here is future Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland. Even before he was saving people with his webslinging abilities, he was saving them with his compassion in this movie! He spends the movie helping a lot of people - whether it's his family or other families. When he sees the other families reuniting when his has not, you can really see the mixed feelings of joy and pain in his face. A mature actor who will one day get an Oscar.My one complaint about this movie: I wish that they had spent a bit more time on Ewan McGregor's character and the two younger boys. Once the wave hits, we spend a lot of time with Naomi Watts and Tom Holland, but there is a moment in which Ewan McGregor tells his little boys that he was the most scared when he saw that he was alone and then he saw his two little boys and that he wasn't scared anymore. That would have been such a great moment to see on film and it really would have made the movie even better in my opinion.All in all, a beautiful movie with superb performances all around. Definitely a great movie!",8,1,2,22 August 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," One of my favourite movies of all time from one of my favourite books of all time
","I will start off by saying that, while this is a very good movie, I do think that the next two are unfairly criticized for not following the source material as this one did. Now, I haven't seen 'Dawn Treader' yet, but I should remind people that 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,' is, in my opinion, the most famous Narnia tale of all the Narnia movies. For this reason, I think that the people behind the scenes had a bit more freedom with the second and third movies, while this one, they had to have it really close to the book in order for it to work the way it did. Don't get me wrong; it is good to follow the books. I'm just saying that 'Prince Caspian' and 'Dawn Treader' are not as famous as TLTWATW.Now, onto this movie.I'm really surprised that this only got a 6.9. This deserves a way higher rating. I won't go into too much details about the story, but for those who don't know, it's basically about 4 children who end up stumbling into a magical land via wardrobe, and find out about a prophecy that includes them in a huge way.I can't emphasize how much I love this movie. I'm 18 years old, and as a Christian person, I instantly fell in love with this back when it came out in theatres. I wasn't worried about whether or not it would follow the book, and I'm glad I wasn't worried. This film delivers.You could say that the special effects are amazing, but what really steals the show are the performances. Let's start out with the stars of the film: the four Pevensies. William Mosely definitely is the weakest, and is really the only reason why I gave it a 9 out of 10, but he is good. Anna Popplewell has that motherly look that you feel when she is on screen, which makes her perfect for Susan. Skandar Keynes is great as the mean little brat known as Edmund, who learns a 'little' lesson as the film goes on. But, Georgie Henley is the star that shines the most. It is through her character that we see Narnia first, and when she's on screen, she gives the child-like energy to her performance that is needed for the character of Lucy.Now, it's not all new faces here. The first movie star that we see is James McAvoy as the faun Tumnus, and he gives off a performance that will make children love Mr. Tumnus just as much as he seems to love them (as seen in his interaction with Lucy). Tilda Swinton gets the most screen time out of the heavyweights here, and she is chilling (no pun intended) in her performance as the White Witch. Fans of the Shrek series will recognize Rupert Everett's (aka Prince Charming) voice as the fox who appears throughout the movie. But, the most recognizable actor here is the voice of Liam Neeson as Aslan. I could listen to that man read a telephone book with that voice. He is among Morgan Freeman and James Earl Jones as to having a soothing voice, and he proves it with his performance of Aslan.Overall, this is a film that should not be missed; it will please you whether you are old or young. The special effects are completely first class, the story is gripping and stays true to the book, and the actors all do their jobs well. A 9/10 for me.",8,1,1,19 November 2011
Troy," Some flaws, but overall a good movie
","Troy is a good movie that history buffs can relate to, and while it is not perfect, overall it delivers.What makes this movie good, in my opinion, is the way it depicts reality today. This is not a movie that is 'good vs. evil.' Every character of this movie has flaws. Achilles is arrogant, Paris is selfish and ignorant, Agammemnon is power-hungry, Priam is cocky; I could go on and on. This is what gives the movie its spark, and I thank Wolfgang Peterson for giving it that.Now, to the actors: If anybody stole the show for me, it was Eric Bana. His character had depth, he had feelings, and his character was the most sensible out of all of the characters. You really believed Bana every time he was on screen. What he lacked in 'Hulk,' he more than made up for in 'Troy.' Most of the rest of the actors were good as well. Brad Pitt was good as Achilles, although he did look and sound a bit out of place. Diane Kruger was beautiful, but that was the main thing that saved her; she could have done a bit more with the acting. Brian Cox is great, as is Brendan Gleeson, and Peter O'Toole shows that he is still as great as he was back when he played 'Lawrence of Arabia.' My one problem: Orlando Bloom. He was not believable, in any sense of the word. His acting could have been way better, and his dialogue was really cheesy (I blame the writers for that one). So far, he has only been good in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and of course, the Lord of the Rings movies, but here, he's just not at the top of his game.That being said, overall, it's a good movie. It's obviously not awards-worthy, but if you're a history buff, or you love a good action film, this is the movie for you. Go see it, enjoy it, in the end, it's all good fun.",Null,2,2,16 October 2011
The Prestige," Christopher Nolan is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever seen
","Plain and simple. You cannot dispute this fact. There are some filmmakers where from the very beginning you can tell that they are going to be legendary. Steven Spielberg obviously comes to mind, but I also think of filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and James Cameron. But there's one other name that I think should be on that list: Christopher Nolan. This man has yet to make a film I didn't like or even didn't think was at least great. From the Dark Knight trilogy to Interstellar, from Inception to Dunkirk, this man has done so many amazing things with film-making today. I have yet to see his first three films 'Following,' 'Memento' and 'Insomnia,' but from what I've heard, they are also great films. As for The Prestige, well, that is just another amazing films in a career of amazing films!The story is this: In London, there are two men named Robert Angier (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Academy Award Winner Christian Bale). These men are helpers to a famous magician, but when a magic trick goes horribly wrong - thus resulting in the tragic death of somebody close to them - the two men turn on each other and become enemies, sabotaging the others' shows whenever they can. However, Alfred performs a trick that is so memorable that Robert is obsessed with finding the secret - an obsession that has tragic results.I've already talked about Christopher Nolan, but now let's turn our attention to the main cast. First off, to our two leading men: Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally superb in their parts. They keep you guessing every single time they are on screen - perfect for the role of magicians I'd say. But they are not alone: Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia, a woman stuck in between the rivalry of the two men. Unfortunately, Johansson is the weakest thing about this movie, but she's not actually there for too much of the movie, so it didn't hamper the movie's greatness. Academy Award Winner Michael Caine - a favorite actor of Christopher Nolan, since he has used him from everything since Batman Begins (whether it's a main part or a small voice cameo in Dunkirk) - is sort of like the narrator of the film, telling us what has happened and why the men became bitter rivals. He is always entertaining to watch, so he definitely pulls it off here.To put it simply: Go and see the movie! It's amazing! The vast majority of the actors know what they're doing, and Christopher Nolan...well, he's Christopher Nolan. Need I say more? Oh, and another thing that Christopher Nolan does well is twist/ambiguous endings, and boy does he pull it off with this one! Definite recommend!",9,2,4,25 August 2018
Moana," Okay, if anybody doesn't like this film, they have no idea what they're talking about
","Seriously, I saw a lot of less-than-5 star reviews on the first page of the review page. It seems that there are a lot of people that just want to try to bring the rating down because they can't stand it when a movie they hate gets all the love in the world. In the case of Moana, do not listen to said people.This is a beautiful movie and does deserve the moniker of 'Disney Classic.' It has just about all the elements of a Disney Classic: Great animation, great songs, great voice performances and a payoff that is well worth the journey.The story is about a young Polynesian girl named Moana who is the princess (again, Disney) of her island. However, where she really longs to be is on the water, even though she has been told not to go out there. However, when things start looking bleak for her island, the only thing to do is to cross the Ocean, find Maui, a demigod who stole the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, and return the heart.While there are many aspects of Disney in this movie, there are also some freshness in the movie. First off, the Polynesian feeling of it all; Disney has never had a movie in which these people were the stars, and yet here they are, and I love every minute of it. Secondly, while Moana is a princess, she is not a damsel in distress like most Disney princesses. She never gets kidnapped and is a hardworking girl who would rather get her hands dirty (or, in this case, her feet wet) than wait for a man to sweep her off her feet. All of this is very refreshing to see in a Disney film.So yes, definitely see this movie! Do not worry about the trolls that are trying to bring the rating down; this is a Disney Masterpiece, and anybody who says otherwise is only fooling themselves!Oh, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson can sing! What's not to love?!",8,0,3,22 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," In heroes we trust
","Imagining awakening up after about 70 years of being ice cold. That is what Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) has to deal with, and it's not just about watching every single classic movie since the 40's. It's also about morality and finding out that those who you trust may not be so trustworthy. When Captain goes after the Winter Soldier, he is branded as a traitor and must line up with Black Widow (played by Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) to get to the bottom of what is going on here. He also finds out that the Winter Soldier is more than just an assassin.Let me just say this: Spider-Man is my favorite hero, while Batman has produced the best superhero of all time (The Dark Knight). But, when it comes to the MCU, my favorite hero is Captain America. In this film, not only does he fight for what's good for America, but that also includes going against government officials whose morals have gone out the window. If the American government is corrupt, he will go against it. Captain America is a hero that we need in this time of government turbulence.As for the actors, well they all play their parts well. Steve Rogers practically IS Captain America, and he conveys the confusion and the morality of Captain America well. Scarlett Johansson is at her MCU best in this film; she is the one who stays by Captain America throughout this whole process. Academy Award Nominee Samuel L. Jackson is his Samuel L. Jackson self in this film, which is always a good thing. But this time we get a couple of newcomers. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Falcon, as he gets a few pretty sweet moments himself. And the great Academy Award Winner Robert Redford always does a great job with whatever role he is presented with.All in all, a great film! Go and watch it!",8,0,1,31 August 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of Marvel's weakest, but still a good setup for an amazing hero
","1942. America has just entered the war and Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) wants to join. However, he is skinny, small and extremely sick, so he is constantly rejected. That is, until Dr. Erskine (played by Academy Award Nominee Stanley Tucci) recruits him for a science experiment that turns him into a buff, healthy young man - namely, Captain America. Although initially used as a propaganda tool, he proves to be more than just a soldier when he rescues 400 soldiers from behind enemy lines, including his friend Bucky (played by Sebastian Stan). They, along with no-nonsense Colonel Chester Phillips (played by Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones) and the beautiful agent Peggy Carter (played by Golden Globe Nominee Hayley Atwell) plot to take down Hydra leader Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving), before he and the entire Hydra army unleash havoc on the world.Honestly, it's pretty typical origins story stuff here. There's nothing new and that's kind of a problem. We know what's going to happen; we know that the hero is going to save the day, fall in love with the girl, and become a true hero, etc. Director Joe Johnson kind of plays it safe and that's the films weak point.However, the actors all bring it up from mediocrity. Chris Evans, who was still reeling from his disastrous turn as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, finds the true hero that he was meant to play in Captain America. He is good; he is pure; he is ready to fight for the good of the people. Evans brings out that patriotism that Captain America imbues, proving that he was right for the role all along. All of the supporting actors are great as well. Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter is not a damsel in distress, but rather a woman of action in a time where women still stayed home during the war. She is more than capable of proving her own. Sebastian Stan is the best friend that everybody wants to have in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, who also encountered a bit of failure in the Superhero genre with his disastrous turn as Two-Face in 'Batman Forever,' more than makes up for that in his portrayal of the Colonel. He does have a couple of comical moments, but he is never loony like in said Batman film. And finally, while Red Skull isn't exactly compelling, Hugo Weaving has had a history of playing bad guy roles - looking at you, Mr. Smith - that he clearly relishes playing the over-the-top bad guy. Safe to say, he does it very well here. Like I said, not compelling, but definitely memorable and fun.Overall, I'd see this movie. It's not new territory, but it's fun and the actors are all having a good time doing it. It is a good set-up to The Avengers, as well as to the future Captain America movies.",7,0,1,26 August 2018
Rush," A race to the finish line
","Ron Howard is an amazing director. While he has had his ups (A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon) and downs (The Dilemma, Inferno), he generally has made consistent in being a top notch director. Even his most recent film, Solo: A Star Wars Story, while not the best Star Wars movie, was fun and exciting. Here he is with stars Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Daniel Bruhl (Captain America: Civil War) in a true story about legendary Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth), who is a playboy, and Niki Lauda (Bruhl), who is methodical and brilliant.Both actors are at the top of their game here. Hemsworth proves that he is more than just a man with a hammer, thunderbolts and lightning (although I do love Thor); he is charming, captivating and charismatic. In this movie, the ladies love him and he loves the ladies. He gives life to what could of been a one-note character. But it is Bruhl who steals the show in his Golden Globe-nominated performance as Niki Lauda. In my opinion, Bruhl should've also been nominated for the Oscar in the same category. He gives the performance of his career here, way better than his performance in Captain America: Civil War. You care about his character; as a matter of fact, I found myself cheering for both drivers. That's the mark of a good movie for me about rivals; when you find yourself fascinated by both sides of the spectrum, you know something was done right. And something was definitely done right here.All in all, an amazing piece of work that is capped off by stunning direction and brilliant performances by the two leads. Why this wasn't even considered for Best Picture at the Oscars, I will never know.",9,0,2,18 August 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Honestly...
","I liked this film. It wasn't as good as the original Terminator film, but it was popcorn entertainment, and for that reason, it was a decent film.So, for the plot: John Conner, played this time by Nick Stahl, now in his early 20's, is living as a drifter, when all of a sudden, he is once again thrown into the world he tried to forget. A Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, has set out to kill John Conner, while the Resistance decides to send another T-101 to protect Conner. Notice how I didn't put who played the T-101? That's because I don't have to tell you, because we all know who it is. So, while there are different elements to the movie, it is kind of similar to the first two films in that a Terminator comes to kill John Conner (or, in the first movie's case, his mother), and someone, or something, also comes from the past to be the hero of the film. Same old, same old, but it's still entertaining.The actors did a good job. Kristanna Loken was quite sexy as the new Terminatrix who sets out to kill John Conner. Claire Danes is along for the ride as Kate who turns out to play an even more important role in the Resistance than even she realizes. Nick Stahl does a decent enough job as Connor, although he probably wouldn't have been my first pick. And, of course, who must come back to play the character we all know the most, but the Governator himself. Arnold's acting is kind of robotic, and while that seems like a bad thing, considering the fact that he does play a robot, it really works in this film.The one thing that makes me rate it lower than the first two films is that there were quite a number of times in which I actually laughed at some of the one-liners. While they were funny, they really shouldn't have been there. It kind of made me wonder why the film was rated R in the first place to tell you the truth. But, some of them were funny, so I won't detract too much points from the film for that reason.The action sequences though were top notch. This is the reason why I watched the film; I don't watch the Transformers movies for the acting because I know I'll be disappointed. The same thing kind of goes for the Terminator films, although the acting here is quite a bit better than that of the Transformers films. It is the action sequences that you want to see here, and so, if you go into this film expecting it to be about acting and dialogue, you might be a little disappointed. But, if you go in with popcorn entertainment on your mind, you won't be disappointed.All in all, though Terminator 3 by no means attains the pinnacle that was the second and the first movie, it is still a refreshing add-on to the Terminator franchise. An 8/10 for me.",7,2,3,17 February 2012
Over the Hedge," Not DreamWorks' best, but still fun
","When thinking of DreamWorks, one often thinks of their more classic movies, such as Shrek, Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda - all of which have spawned successful franchises (with the Madagascar films getting better and better with quality and the third How to Train Your Dragon film coming out in 2019). However, some of their other films get lost in the kerfuffle and, unfortunately, this is one of them.However, it is nowhere near their worst movie. In all actuality, it is kind of fun. The main character is RJ, a raccoon voiced hilariously by Bruce Willis. He's got one week to fulfill a bears request: have the food that he destroyed back in a week or else he is on the menu. He finds a group of forest friends led by Verne, a tortoise voiced by Garry Shandling, and he realizes that they could help him get the food from the suburbs that live just...well...over the hedge. However, they catch the eye of a determined woman who then calls an exterminator to help deal with the so-called pest problem.There are a lot of hilarious moments, particularly from Steve Carrell's performance as Hammy, an energetic squirrel who you should not give any caffeine or sugar to. While Bruce Willis is mostly known for being an action star, a lot of people forget that he won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy for his role in Moonlighting, so needless to say, he actually does have a background in comedy and is able to bring it to light. Garry Shandling plays the part of the straight man - or should I say, tortoise - who doesn't want anything to do with the hedge.The problem with this movie is that, in spite of all its funny moments and star-studded cast, it just isn't as memorable or in the top quality that other DreamWorks animation films are in. The story isn't as good, and the characters aren't as memorable as Shrek, Po, Toothless, or any of the characters from Madagascar.So, while it isn't their best film, I still recommend this film, as it is a lot of fun for the whole family. See it, enjoy it, and hopefully you'll remember it tomorrow.",7,0,0,22 August 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Watch for the signs
","Pat Solantano Jr. (played by Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper) is just getting out of the mental hospital; he was in there for beating the man that his wife was cheating on him with. He comes home to live with his parents, go to therapy and to find the silver lining in things. Eventually he meets Tiffany (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence), who has her own problems. He forms a connection with her and she even offers to help him get a letter to his wife, and in exchange he helps her with a dance competition. Pat Sr. (played by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro) and Dolores (played by Academy Award Nominee Jacki Weaver) are Pat's parents and Pat's father is somewhat OCD; he likes his remotes a certain way, he doesn't want anybody in his study and he believes that his son is the positive juju that the Eagles need to win the Super Bowl. The question is: Can Pat Jr. find the signs? Or will life get him down?This is a great movie, plain and simple. The editing and writing of this film is top notch. David O. Russell is at the top of his game with this film and he earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for both writing and directing the film. Whether you agree with his directing style or not, it is clear that he loves these characters and, in spite of all their faults and differences, he makes them all likable in many ways. Kudos to Russell for pulling off such an amazing feat!But let's face it: the real stars are the stars themselves in this movie. Let's start out with our main character. Cooper is a revelation in this role. This was the role that got him out of his comfort zone - the comedy zone - and into the world of versatile acting. He is now known for his supreme acting chops and he knows how to make it work in a drama. He knows how to create characters that can be crazy but in a good way. Definitely deserving of the Oscar Nomination. With Jennifer Lawrence, while I can't say that she deserved the Oscar (it should have went to Emmanuelle Riva for Amour), I can say that this is the best she's ever been. She is on the top of her game in this role and it is clearly a role that she loved to play. Her and Bradley Cooper went on to star in two more David O. Russell films - American Hustle and Joy - and it is very clear that they love working with each other; you can practically feel the chemistry that these two share. She definitely at least deserved the nomination.But let's talk about the supporting characters. Robert De Niro is a prime example of 'when you grow older, you start getting the grandpa roles in crappy movies.' While the dude can act, it's no question that he is in a slump. It's this movie, however, that showed that he's still got it and that he is not going away anytime soon. This is the guy who won awards for being a younger version of Marlon Brando and for boxing other guys in a ring. It's good to see that guy again; definitely deserving of the nomination. But the person who I believe should have actually won in their category was Jacki Weaver for her performance in this movie. She is the Mom who is worried sick about her son because he was in a mental hospital and she just wants him to be a part of the family. She is amazing in this role and she also gives the best performance of her career!Needless to say, a great movie! What more can I say?",8,2,3,29 August 2018
Shrek Forever After," Still not as good as the first two, but better than the third, and a great way to end the wonderful series!
","While it definitely feels like it's a rehash that's trying to go for the jugular and try to pack some jokes that mirror the first movie, Shrek Forever After is definitely an improvement from Shrek the Third. The plot is that Shrek is bored with his family life, and he decides to sign a deal with Rumpelstilzkin, so that he can become a feared ogre for one day. Did I spell Rumple's name right? Anyways, it turns that the be-careful-what-you-wish-for theme comes true for Shrek, because he has to give up a day of his past in order for the deal to work. Rumpel, being the evil genius that he is, decides to give up the day Shrek was born, so if Shrek can't share true love's kiss (guess who it has to be with), he will no longer be existent.There are definitely a lot of good things to look at here, but I will just focus on the voice acting and the plot, seeing as that's what truly gives the movie away. Myers proves that, despite being a decade older than he was when he first started out as Shrek, he still has the it factor for Shrek. Murphy is just as funny as he was the first time around. Diaz is great as the Princess Fiona, although in this film, we don't see her as being much of a Princess. Banderas is still one of the greatest things to happen to this saga as Puss in Boots. All the other voice actors do their thing, as well.The story works here, too. I personally found this story to work because, well, Shrek has had more at stake here than he had in the previous three movies. In the first two, it was just his love to Fiona that was at stake; from what I remember from the third movie, his life ended up being at stake; in this one, well, not only is it his life, but it's everything about his life that's at stake. Fiona, his children, his friends; if Shrek does not share true love's kiss with Fiona, he will cease to exist, as will the world in which he comes from.The main flaw, however, is that this film relies on too many things from the first movie. First of all, there's the fact that he wants to be a real ogre again. While this does work, it's not as effective as when he is a real ogre in the first film. Secondly, he goes to visit the castle to see if Fiona's still there. Third, the whole true love's kiss thing was the main theme in the first movie, and it's the same here. While I do applaud the makers of this film for successfully coming up with this stuff, it's also the movie's main flaw, since it is too dependant on sources in which those themes work better.Overall, though, I do recommend this movie to all Shrek fans. It's a great ending to the series, and despite the fact that I don't want to say goodbye to the characters, I think it's time. I felt the same way with Toy Story 3; they were about Andy's toys, and since Andy gave them away, it's time to put that series to rest now. But, Toy Story and Shrek, you guys gave me some of the best times of my childhood when I was growing up. I thank you so much for everything that you had to offer. This movie deserves an 8/10 for me.",7,0,1,26 November 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Better than Spiderman 3, not as good as Spiderman 2, on par with Spiderman
","The story of this superhero movie is that Peter Parker is struggling in his life. He's the punching bag for Flash, the bully at school, and he's trying to figure out why his parents left him so many years ago. After he gets bitten by a spider (go figure), he starts to develop powers, which puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Conners' alter ego, the Lizard.First off, let me say that this movie is a huge step up from Spiderman 3. I know that this is a reboot and really isn't a part of the Sam Raimi trilogy, but let me tell you that this movie is on par with the one from 2002. That's how good it is.Next, I'm going to say that it's about time that we had the Lizard as the villain. We've already seen two films where Dr. Connors plays a supporting role, so it's great to see him as a main character to the movie, and Rhys Ifans plays him well.Speaking of Ifans, he, along with Garfield, Stone, Leary, Sheen, and Fields all deliver terrific performances. Sally Fields plays Aunt May, the protective Aunt who worries about Peter when he's out late. Then there's Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, who provides many words of wisdom for Peter that really echo Peter's destiny as a hero. Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest of Peter/Spiderman, while her father is played by Dennis Leary, who is great as always. As mentioned above, Rhys Ifans is a great Lizard, but if anyone steals the show, it's obviously Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He seemed to be comfortable in balancing Peter the insecure nerd and Spiderman the loudmouthed crime-fighter, which is a good thing.Overall, a job well done to everyone. It doesn't quite hit the heights of Spiderman 2, but it is enough to say that the franchise has been rebooted and it's in safe hands. A 9/10 for me.",8,3,18,4 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," It is time to unite!
","In the future, mutants are all united under one common enemy: the Sentinels. Unfortunately, the mutants - and the humans helping them - are all getting slaughtered by the Sentinels, machines that were created in 1973 by Dr. Bolivar Trask (played by Golden Globe Winner Peter Dinklage) by using the DNA of Mystique (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence). Professor Charles Xavier (Played by Golden Globe Nominee Sir Patrick Stewart) explains that, in order to win this battle, Wolverine (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) must travel back in time to 1973, using Kitty Pryde's (played by Academy Award Nominee Ellen Page) abilities. He must join up with younger versions of Professor X (played by Golden Globe Nominee James McAvoy) and Magneto (played by Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender) to help prevent the Sentinel program from taking form.What an amazing film. Not just great; AMAZING. Everything from the direction to the acting is awesome. The effects are amazing. The soundtrack is amazing. The actors are amazing, particularly Jackman and McAvoy :) I'm just going to say it; this movie is GREAT!!!",9,0,0,4 September 2018

All three casinos are owned by Terry Benedict (played by Academy Award Nominee Andy Garcia), who also is seeing Danny's ex-wife, Tess (played by Academy Award Winner Julia Roberts). To pull off a heist like this, Danny needs the best team alive, so he brings in Frank Catton (played by the late Golden Globe Nominee Bernie Mac), Rusty Ryan (played by Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt) and Linus Caldwell (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon). With a crew like this, the question is this: Are you in or out?Suffice it to say, I am in! This is an entertaining film that never lets up. All the actors involved in this film are at the top of their game, and they are having a good time at this. Also rounding out the cast includes major actors like Academy Award Winner Casey Affleck and Academy Award Nominee Don Cheadle, so this is definitely one to see. Oh and I forgot to mention that it is Academy Award Winning Director Steven Soderbergh who brought THIS crew together to steal our hearts and walk away with a smile!Needless to say, a great film!

The Theory of Everything," Redmayne's performance is still the best Oscar winning performance of the decade!
","This film is about the life of Stephen Hawking - played by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne - and his wife Jane - played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones. When he was at Cambridge, he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, with the doctors giving him only two years to live. Needless to say, he was distraught. But it was his love for Jane and her love for him that pushed him forward. Needless to say, he lasted way longer than two years. As his condition deteriorated, his mind soared to new heights and he is considered to be one of the best scientists of all time. But it was the struggles and the triumphs with Jane at home that really tested their relationship.You can't review this film and not talk about the phenomenal performance that comes from Eddie Redmayne. I simply cannot say ANYTHING bad about his performance here. He throws himself into the role and his dedication to it was absolutely astounding. Apparently, he sat in that wheelchair for so long that he altered his spine. But in the end, it was worth it, as his dedication and performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was well earned and well deserved, as his performance reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot. Yes: Redmayne was THAT good.However, what makes this film truly great is that neither of the two leads outshine each other, which brings us to Felicity Jones' performance. Her performance provides the other half of the emotional weight of the film. As Jane, you can see how much she loves Stephen...how much she cares for him...and how much it crushes her to see his condition deteriorate. You can also see the emotional toll that it takes on her, as she balances dealing with a husband whose condition is worsening and kids running around the house. You can see the struggle that she faces while juggling all of these things. While Eddie Redmayne's performance was superb, Felicity Jones was just as good, and both of them provided the story with an amazing amount of drama.Absolutely go and see this movie. Go and see it for these two performances. While there were many great things about this film, it's really Redmayne and Jones that bring out everything great about it. It's the chemistry between them; it's the sadness between them; it's the joyfulness between them; it's everything between them. They are the film, and they truly shine!",8,0,0,24 August 2018
Good Will Hunting," It's never too late for a new start on life
","Will Hunting (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon) has a brilliant mind. He can solve any equation and loves to read school books, thus he is very smart. He is also there for his friends, particularly his best friend Chuckie (played by Academy Award Winner Ben Affleck). But he is also very young and reckless. After one too many brushes with the law, Will is placed in jail, but he is offered a way out: study mathematics while his professor (played by Stellan Skarsgard) tries to get him job offers and he will get psychiatric help. After going through many psychiatrists, he finally meets his match in Sean Maguire (played by Academy Award Winner Robin Williams). Whilst doing these math problems and going to appointments, he also meets a beautiful young woman named Skylar (played by Academy Award Nominee Minnie Driver). All of these people are amazing people who are there for Will. The question is: Can he figure out his own problem before he pushes them all away?This is a beautiful movie. Plain and simple. The editing...the music...the song 'Miss Misery' by the late great Elliot Smith...there are so many things that are worth mentioning here. But let's start with the writing. I said that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Oscars in their career. Well, it was for this movie and it was for their writing skills. This is the movie that put both actors on the map and they have done it in a way that nobody else has ever done. There is a lot of swearing in this movie, yes, but it is essential to the story. It's an amazing thing, the writing in this movie; they were in their twenties and they both wrote this movie as if they had been doing this for a long time. An Oscar that was well deserved.Also worthy of praise is the great Gus van Sant. While he hasn't directed a lot of films, two of the three that he is well known for show his greatness as a director (Every director has their own personal 'Psycho' remake, unfortunately). While he was also nominated for his direction of 'Milk' in 2008, it's this film that shows his strengths as a fine director. He knows what to do; he is a hands-on director. One such example of his hands-on approach is the painting in Sean's office. That painting was painted by van Sant himself. It is just a small but vital example as to how van Sant knew what he was doing. Honestly, he should have gotten the Best Director Oscar that year.Speaking of well-deserved Oscars, let's talk about the cast here. The two main cast members that were not nominated for Acting Oscars - Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard - both do an outstanding job nonetheless. If Ben Affleck's movies have convinced you that he can't act, check this movie out. Without a doubt, he pulls it off. And Stellan Skarsgard pulls it off as a professor who just wants to see Will succeed wherever he's at. But let's face it: there is a reason why Damon, Williams and Driver got nominated for Oscars. They are the true standouts here. Driver is so much more than just a girlfriend to Will; she has her own backstory and, although it is only briefly mentioned, you can tell that it is an important moment in her life - a moment that has defined her. Driver definitely should have gotten that Oscar. Damon is also amazing in the main role; there are a couple of scenes where he gets to me, particularly one where he truly reveals what has happened in his past. When he reveals what has happened in his past, it is very clear as to why he acts the way he does - why he pushes people from his life. Damon portrays that inner conflict very well in a role that should have landed him his first Acting Oscar (no disrespect to Jack Nicholson, though).However, the standout performance is that of the late great Robin Williams. A lot of people remember him for his comedic roles like Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and Good Morning Vietnam. Some remember him for his dramatic roles in Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, One Hour Photo and Insomnia. Some remember him for his adventurous roles in Hook and Jumanji. But this...this is my personal favorite performance that he has ever done. He is able to tone done his crazy antics for the most part, but when he does up the crazy a bit, it is certainly viable to the scene. But that park bench scene and a certain scene towards the end are my two favorite scenes that he has ever done.While I spent a lot of this review giving credit where it was due, I do have to end off by saying: Thank you, Robin. Thank you for all the magic that you have given us. Thank you for the laughter, tears and smiles that you gave us through your amazing performances. I am truly sorry that you could not find that joy within yourself, but I hope to someday see you up in Heaven with God and the rest of His Angels. Just remember: it's not your fault.",9,2,3,27 August 2018
The Game," Wow
","That's all I can say: Wow. What a movie. This is a psychological thriller, in every sense of the meaning. Thankfully, I knew what I was going in for, so when I watched it, I enjoyed it. Great premise, great script, great acting, great behind-the-scenes work; I could go all day on this one.Michael Douglas has hit a home run here, ladies and gentlemen. He is flawless. Sean Penn is great as well, despite the limited screen time that he is given. Everyone else did good as well, but it is really Douglas' character that you feel for the most, which is obviously a good thing since he is the title character.All in all: a phenomenal film. If you like watching psychological thrillers, go see this movie. However, if you leave your mind at the door, you will be way too confused when it comes to seeing this movie. This is a thinking movie. That being said, it was very well played out, and everyone involved in this film should be proud of themselves. 10/10 for me.",Null,1,2,28 October 2011
Transformers," Watch this if you know what you are in for
","For those of you who are not fans of Michael Bay: for starters, do not watch this movie. It's really as simple as that. But, I've read some of the negative comments on this film, and it baffles me to read that all this film consists of is hot girls, hot action, and not the greatest acting. Come on, guys. This is a Michael Bay film, and let me emphasize the words MICHAEL BAY. When I think about him, I think about entertainment, and entertainment only, because that is what his films are about. With films like this, I don't go in expecting some great story, with amazing dialogue. This movie is not academy award worthy, nor should it be. This is an action film, that's what it's meant to be, and when it comes to action films, Bay knows how to deliver. Again, the storyline could be better, and Megan Fox could use some acting lessons, but like I said, when you watch these movies, you should watch them for entertainment. So, if you know what this film delivers, and you don't like Michael Bay, then by all means, skip this movie. But, if you do end up watching this movie, and say that it's nothing but a bunch of clanging metal and hot girls, well then, welcome to the world of Michael Bay. I saw it in theatres back in 2007, I went with an open mind, and I enjoyed it. 9/10 for me.",Null,6,8,27 October 2011
Guardians of the Galaxy," I'm...hooked on this movie!!!!
","First off, let me be honest here: while I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - I think even their worst movies are good - there really are only two movies that go beyond great into the Amazing territory: Avengers: Infinity War and this one. I gotta say that Marvel had the biggest risk with this movie as virtually NONE of the characters were well-known. Well, when Star Lord told Ronan the Accuser who they were at the end of the movie, he wasn't just saying it to him; he was saying it to the entire world watching the movie, knowing that they were all here to stay!First off, let me compliment director James Gunn. While what he tweeted all those years ago was horrible, IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO!!! Disney needs to rehire him, if only one more time, to complete the Guardians' story arc in the MCU. Only he knows how to do it; this is his baby. What makes it even more sick is that it was an alt-right group who unearthed the tweets. The hypocrisy is downright sickening, and Gunn is unfairly in the firing line. That's right, Disney: you know I'm right. Rehire Gunn, if only for just the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie.Okay, so back to the movie. You want to know what it's about? For those of you living under a rock, it's about a human (Chris Pratt), a green alien (Zoe Saldana), a tattoed (?) alien (Dave Bautista), a raccoon (Bradley Cooper), and a tree (Vin Diesel) in outer space trying to save the galaxy from an evil blue alien (Lee Pace). I know; it sounds so unbelievable and somewhat stupid. But it's not; it's SO MUCH FUN!!!The soundtrack, first off, is amazing. It is full of cheesy hits that have since resurfaced, largely thanks to this movie (seriously, did anybody else listen to 'Hooked on a Feeling' before this movie came out?). Featuring songs like the previously mentioned 'Hooked on a Feeling,' 'I Want You Back,' 'Come and Get Your Love,' and 'O-o-h Child,' the soundtrack for this movie is just so off-the-charts, it's awesome!Finally, to the actors. The main reason why I thought Avengers: Infinity War was awesome was due to Josh Brolin's amazing performance as Thanos. Well, with Guardians of the Galaxy, it is the heroes who are the real reasons for the films awesomeness. Chris Pratt is so likable and charming as Star Lord that he comes off as a jerk that you just can't help but root for. Zoe Saldana is fierce and knows exactly how to balance between kicking butt and making people laugh. Dave Bautista, who people mostly know as a wrestler, is set to become the next Dwayne Johnson, since he very clearly loves to act and is having lots of fun; his character Drax has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper, who is well-known for both his comedy and action roles, fits in perfectly as a raccoon with an attitude problem. And who knew that a tree voiced by Vin Diesel that could only pronounce the words 'I am Groot' could provide us with the biggest emotional scene in the movie?! Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan are all in fine and weird form with their characters, while Academy Award nominees Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and winner Benicio Del Toro all give a certain amount of pedigree to the filmUnfortunately, this movie was made back when Marvel had a problem with its villains, and Lee Pace's Ronan the Accuser was no different. The best villains are the ones that you sympathize with, but because we are given no backstory to the character - because we don't see why he feels the way he feels or he does the things he does - we don't feel connected to him.But, honestly, that's the only weak spot and it is a little one compared to the awesomeness that is happening in the rest of the movie. Thank you, James Gunn; thank you to the music people; and thank you to the actors who all clearly looked like they were having the time of their lives. You guys are the best!!!",9,0,2,18 August 2018
Clash of the Titans," Yeah, it could have been better...
","...but I take what I can get.This movie... what can I say? It's just worth it. Nothing more. It has some good things for it, but there are also some bad things going for it as well.The good: First of all, the acting. I know people are going to disagree with me on this, but I think that the reason why the acting wasn't the best was because the script wasn't the best. I mean, come on! The script was really cheesy, and plus, we've got Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in this, both of whom starred in 'Schindler's List!' They clearly know how to act, and to tell you the truth, they are the stars of the show. That being said, I think the entire cast did with what they could.Secondly, the CGI. Let me warn you that this is CGI-fest. You see giant scorpions, Medusa, and of course, the Kraken. And, I got to say, they look pretty decent in this movie. So, yeah, the cgi is great here, nothing to complain about that! Thirdly, Gemma Arteton. Need I say more? She does know how to act, and quite frankly... I thought I was going to faint when I first saw her on screen. She is drop-dead gorgeous! When you have beauty and acting skills, like she has, then you've got a dangerous weapon at your side.Now, the bad: I will start off with the worst problem of the movie: the script. The dialogue was quite weak, and like I said before, I think that was the reason why everybody could not give their 100%. This was the main reason why the film didn't do so well with critics, from what I've read.Also, there were so many inaccuracies with Greek myth. The first one I heard was when Io said that Zeus tricked Hades to become god of the Underworld. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but in Greek myth, didn't Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon cast lots to see who would become god of what? Secondly, when they speak about how Medusa came to be: they mentioned that she apparently didn't want to make love with Poseidon. Not only do I not remember that in Greek myth, but I don't think they mentioned that the reason why Athena never helped her was because they had sex in Athena's temple. Yeah, it may be a film, but there were so many mythological inaccuracies. That being said, I'm glad that they at least remembered Zeus' animal.All in all, it's just worth it. If you have anything else to do for your evening, then please do it. But, if you go into this movie, just keep in mind of everything that I have told you. I was able to enjoy it enough as a popcorn flick, like most action movies, but in this case, I could not get over the script and the inaccuracies. 6/10 for me.",Null,0,1,12 November 2011
Logan," Here's to you, Wolverine
","It's 2029. The mutant population is pretty much gone, with only Wolverine (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman), Professor Charles Xavier (played by Golden Globe Nominee Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (played by Emmy winner Stephen Merchant) left. Logan, aka the Wolverine, has aged quite a bit, is an alcoholic and even his healing powers are dwindling. The three live out the rest of their days in an old steel mill in El Paso, Texas. However, once a little girl (played by Dafne Keen) comes into play, the Wolverine is brought back into action. It turns out that this little girl has powers just like the Wolverine and she is being chased throughout the desert by dark forces - the dark forces that made her from Wolverine's DNA. With all this going on, the Wolverine must decide: should he live out the rest of his days in peace or is it finally time for one last fight?I can't stress enough what a near-perfect movie this is. As a matter of fact, the only X-Men movie that surpasses this one is Deadpool 2. Make no mistake, though; this is a Wolverine film, through and through. While it is a superhero film, it is not a superhero film for the faint-hearted. That R rating is well deserved here and it is the only way to tell the final chapter in the Wolverine story. We finally see Wolverine's berserker rage in all its rated R glory and it truly is glorious! The writing in this film is also spectacular, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay (which it should have won for sure). James Mangold ups the ante from the previous Wolverine film 'The Wolverine,' proving that he truly was the best director to bring the hardened Canadian hero to life.But let's talk about our three starring performances. First of all, this is not just Hugh Jackman's final outing in an X-Men film. Patrick Stewart is also back as an ailing Professor X whose tragic past continuously haunts him. He is originally seen as a mumbling fool by Wolverine when he continuously says that he is waiting for someone (turns out he is right). It is kind of sad to see the Professor like this, but Patrick Stewart also gives his best performance in the series. He is more compelling than he ever was in the X-Men franchise; while he was a crowd favorite, this is his best performance by far. Also along for the ride is Dafne Keen, a newcomer who plays Laura, the little girl who Wolverine protects. Has she really only started acting last year? While she may be just a kid, she acted like she had been in the game for more than 20 years. I hope she gets more roles as she gets older; she is a sight to behold as Wolverine's daughter. She even shares a similar story to Wolverine: someone who has had it rough, who has been unfortunately turned into a monster, and who now needs the guidance that Professor X gave Logan. Only this time, it's Logan who has to guide her. She is just absolutely astonishing in this role; she nailed it.But of course, who are we all here for? We are all here for the man himself, the Wolverine. Not only does Patrick Stewart give his best performance as Professor X, but Hugh Jackman gives his best performance as Wolverine. This is his last X-Men film, so he lays it all out there. He puts all of his cards on the table. He goes out with an unimaginable bang. Each X-Men film that stars Wolverine starts out with him having lost his hope, but this is different. Here we truly see a broken man who, until Laura comes in, seriously has nothing left to fight for. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine will go down as one of the greatest film heroes the world has ever seen and one of the greatest super hero portrayals ever. He is Wolverine. No one will ever even come close.Here's to you, Wolverine. Don't be what they made you.",9,2,4,27 August 2018
"Girl, Interrupted"," Go a little crazy
","18 year old Susanna (played by Academy Award Nominee Winona Ryder) is disillusioned with reality and so she overdoses. As a result, she is checked into a mental hospital for her disorder. However, she has trouble coping with that too, and things turn even more dramatic when she meets a crazy patient named Lisa (played by Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie).I have no idea why this got mixed reviews when it first came out because it is a great film! A lot of it is because of the performances. First off, let's start with Ryder. She is a very capable lead who is struggling not just to fit in with the patients of the mental institution, but also with herself and how to deal with the effects of her disorder. She portrays that struggle very well, showing us that Susanna was indeed a real person. The film also boasts an incredible supporting cast including Academy Award Winners Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave and Jared Leto, all of whom do fine work in what little screen time they have (okay, maybe not so much with Goldberg, but you get my drift). But the star of the show is without a doubt Angelina Jolie. I don't feel like her Oscar win was deserved (it should have gone to Toni Collette for The Sixth Sense), but she definitely is the one who deserved the nomination and all the recognition for this movie. She is the reason to watch this movie and, in this movie, she proves that the acting chops that her father had have indeed been passed down to her.In a nutshell, go and watch this movie! Definitely a great movie!",8,1,2,30 August 2018
Up," Pixar has done it again!
","First off, let me jut say that this is not my favourite film from Pixar. 'Finding Nemo' and the 'Toy Story' movies, especially the third one, go into that slot.That being said, 'Up' does not disappoint. It is basically about a 70-year-old man who decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and go to a beautiful place called 'Paradise Falls,' a place where he had always dreamed to go.Everything is beautiful here, but what truly makes the magic of the movie is the acting. You really feel for the characters, and their voices, especially Ed Asner's character. After going through a lot of things in his life, you can just tell from the start that he has always loved adventure, but has always been stuck in the same old house. Christopher Plummer, whose character does not come in until later on in the movie, is great is the movie's antagonist; I've only really known him from 'The Sound of Music,' so it was great to see, or should I say 'hear', him play something else.All in all, a very beautiful movie. The only reason why it was not as good as 'Finding Nemo' and the Toy Story movies is simply because of the fact that I grew up with those movies (except for the third toy story, in which I re-visited my childhood when watching that movie). But, overall, I can't complain here. 9/10 for me.",9,0,0,9 November 2011
Woman in Gold," Justice is a masterpiece
","The movie - based on a true story - is about a woman named Maria Altman - played by Academy Award winner Helen Mirren - whose painting of her aunt was taken by the Nazis in World War II. She hires Randy Schoenberg (Golden Globe Nominee Ryan Reynolds) to help in her battle. Not only was this a battle for what belonged in her family for centuries, but it was a crusade for justice of yet another crime perpetrated by the Nazis.While this got mixed reviews from the critics, I personally thought that this was a beautiful movie that was elevated by the performance from its two leads. Helen Mirren is always a sight to behold in each of her movies and her performance here brings a sort of history to the movie, as we are reminded once again of the crimes that the Nazis have done (and I'm not just talking about the artwork). Ryan Reynolds is always fun to watch, but here he downplays the comedic persona for something a little more serious and it surprisingly fit him like a glove! Even in some of his more serious movies, he had a bit of comedic charm to him, so it was nice to see him go way more dramatic in this role. The supporting actors are all good as well. Katie Holmes did a good job as the wife that Reynolds is supporting (thus being a big reason as to why he's taking on the case), Golden Globe Nominee Daniel Bruhl is always a talented actor no matter what he does, and Golden Globe Nominee Tatiana Maslany does a great job in portraying a younger version of Helen Mirren.Overall, go and see this movie! It may seem a bit cheesy at times, but the actors all bring life to an interesting subject, particularly Mirren and Reynolds. It's a great film; don't miss it!",8,1,2,24 August 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," While not as good as the original, still a great heap of Marvel entertainment!
","While Marvel has come out with many a great film in the past 10 years, let's be honest: Guardians of the Galaxy ranked near the top. It was such a surprise hit to everybody, but once people knew who these guys were, everybody wanted to be as good looking as Star Lord, deadly as Gamora, strong as Drax, quick-witted like Rocket and just plain awesome as Groot. It was such a massive success that no one saw coming, but did the sequel live up to the same hype?Well, I can safely say that, while it is not quite as good as the original, Vol. 2 definitely lives up to the hype!While the special effects and action sequences are all amazing, what really makes a Marvel movie is the performances, and the ones in this film are no different. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan all do an even better job at their respective characters, but the new characters are all just as fascinating. Pom Klementieff plays a new character named Mantis who can feel the same emotions as someone else when she touches them; Sylvester Stallone makes a great cameo appearance in the film as Stakar Ogord, who true fans know as Starhawk; and, of course, Kurt Russell dons the mantle as Peter's father, and you could really say that these guys really were Father and Son. Oh, and the villain of the movie is really amazing; I won't say who it is because I don't want to spoil it, but it's such a surprise towards the end of the movie!So, why do I rate this lower than the original if I felt the performances were better? Well, to be honest, a bit of the originality was lost in this one. Don't get me wrong; the songs, the dancing, the quick-witted jokes, they were all there and they are all a big part of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. It's just that I expected them to come when they did.But all in all, a great popcorn flick to enjoy with the family! These guys really do know how to entertain!",8,0,0,21 August 2018
The Da Vinci Code," Makes me want to read the book
","I don't know why this got such backlash, when it got released.When it comes to the movie and the book, they are both hot topics for discussion in religious circles. Quite a few religious circles around the world had issues with some of the aspects of this film and book; Some believed that it was basically an insult to the Catholic faith and to Jesus Christ. What I don't get is: Why is this an insult? There really isn't anything to get all negatively hopped up about. Okay, maybe it's a little shocking to think that Jesus had a wife and a daughter, but first, let's take a look at the gospel of Philip; this gospel states that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were 'companions,' which, according to this movie, means that they were partners. It also says that He loved Mary Magdalene more than His disciples. Now, we all draw our own conclusions here, but really, I am a Christian, and yet, I find nothing wrong with this image; I mean, He was married, and He had a kid. That's just my opinion, but you've got to fill the holes in the bible.Anyways, enough ranting, more critiquing. This movie stimulated my interest as I was reading about the plot of the book. I decided to watch the movie, despite the negative reviews from the critiques. I can honestly say that this is not as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, it could have been more, but if it had've been even 10 minutes longer, it probably would've felt too long.The acting is on par, as well. Alfred Molina (Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2) is good as Bishop Aringarosa; Paul Bettany is quite creepy as Silas. While I couldn't make out a whole lot of what Jean Reno said (because most of his lines were in French, I believe), he did seem to be into his role, which was good. Ian McKellen is always great in everything he does. Audrey Tautou is beautiful as Sophie, who finds out a little secret about herself towards the end. And, of course, Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon: this is a role that fits him, and fits him well. Good job to all.Overall, if you're going to see it, be aware of the ideas that it brings up; go in with an open mind, but make sure that you are ready to think. After I finish 'Angels and Demons,' I think I might pick up 'The Da Vinci Code.' A 7.5 out of 10 for me.",7,0,0,7 January 2012
Titanic," A legendary film
","This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.The story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal's and her mother's hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.James Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You've done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.I must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.However, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.Overall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it. The dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle, but the actors are great, the story is great, the direction is great, etc. Overall, a 10/10 for me.",8,4,7,11 July 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," Very Good
","I went into this thinking that it would not be that great. I had heard some not-so-good things about Keanu Reeve's acting, but the thing that helped me to overcome that was the fact that I saw this mainly as an action movie with some story involved. With this type of movie, you don't need to be a great actor to make it work, and I think that if people see this with that in mind, they will enjoy this more. It obviously was not academy award worthy, but then yet again, it doesn't need to be. Just about everything works out in the end, we get some great battle sequences, and some even better slow motion sequences. In the end, it's all fun, although do not ignore the rated R rating. There is quite a lot of violence in this movie, so see it before taking your kids to it. All in all, 9/10 for me.",Null,0,1,11 November 2011
Zombieland," Welcome to Zombieland!
","Zombies have officially taken over the United States of America, thus making it the United States of Zombieland. Columbus (played by Academy Award Nominee Jesse Eisenberg) is surviving due to his list of rules that he follows. Soon enough, he meets up with a zombie-hating cowboy named Tallahassee (played by Academy Award Nominee Woody Harrelson) and, later on, two sisters (played by Academy Award Winner Emma Stone and Academy Award Nominee Abigail Breslin). Can they each survive the zombie apocalypse and, more importantly, each other?This is such a fun movie. It is so clear that each and every performer in this movie had the time of their lives making this film! What makes this film even more enjoyable is the fact that there really isn't a standout performance between each of the four leads. They each have their own moments to shine in the hilarity spotlight. There is even an awesome cameo in this movie that makes it even more fun!Honestly, the only complaint about this film is that it is way too short. That is really the only reason why I gave it the 8 rating and not higher. But seriously, if you're looking for a fun night out with the guys, rent this movie and just enjoy the laughter! It's definitely worth it!",8,0,0,30 August 2018
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful movie for a beautiful mind
","This movie is very loosely based on the life of one John Forbes Nash, Jr. There are definitely some additions to his life in this movie, but, from what I read about his life, there's still quite a bit from his real life in the movie, which is one of the reasons why I give this movie a perfect score.First, let me tell you a little about Nash: He was a genius who worked in game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. However, his life was plagued by the unfortunate disease known as Schizophrenia. He spoke of characters, such as Charles Herman and William Parcher, characters who did not exist. His life became one nightmare after the other during this time, as these visions would threaten everything in his world, including that of his then-wife.Ron Howard definitely deserved the best director award here, but if anything, it was the acting that got me hooked. Russell Crowe does a very good job as Nash, who, all his life, wanted to look for an idea. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia Nash, who starts off as a student of Nash's, and ends up becoming the wife who fears for Nash. Connelly definitely deserved her award for this; If any other work of hers parallels 'Blood Diamond,' it is this one. Ed Harris, of course, is always great in every movie he's in, and this one is no different. He plays the Parcher delusion, who is an agent for the Department of Defence, and is trying to get Nash to help them fight the Soviets. Paul Bettany is great as the Charles Herman delusion, who becomes Nash's best friend throughout his university years. Josh Lucas is great, and those who remember watching 'The Sound of Music' when they were younger will be delighted to see Christopher Plummer on the screen here.All in all, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a well-acted movie that is both a touching love story and an educational look at any type of psychiatric disorder. 10/10 for me.",9,0,0,21 January 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," How the world truly split up into what we know today
","Ice Age: Continental Drift tells the story of...well... how the continents came apart into what we know today. As this is happening, Manny, Diego, and Sid are separated from Ellie and Peaches during this continental crack-up, and they must find a way back home. Unfortunately, they run into a few pirates along the way. While this is happening, Scrat finds a map to acorn paradise and is trying to find it.This is a worthy sequel to a great franchise. I don't know why the only one that got the best reviews on Rotten Tomatoes was the first one. To be honest, each movie keeps on getting bigger and bigger, with this one not only having a huge problem, but a bad guy along the way.The voices are all great, as well. We have Nicki Minaji, Drake, Jennifer Lopez, Peter Dinklage, and Wanda Sykes were all truly welcome to this franchise. However, it is the main voices that are the true stars here. Queen Latifah is great, as always. Sean William Scott and Josh Peck do a great job at Crash and Eddie, Ellie's possum brothers. And, of course, the main trio. Dennis Leary as Diego is great (Dennis is doing a great job this year; he's got 'The Amazing Spider-man' under his belt, as well). John Leguizamo is always hilarious as Sid. And as for Ray Romano, let's just say that I'm a big fan of him and his old show 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' so anytime I get to hear him in a movie, I'm all up for it.Overall, it's a great movie. It might seem a little stupid, but it's the Ice Age series, so it's all good fun. An 8/10 for me.",7,1,2,18 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Huge step up from episodes 1 and 2
","After the annoying catastrophe that was Jar Jar Binks in episode 1 and the wooden acting and cheesy love story that was episode 2, I can honestly say that George Lucas has given what the original fans of the series have waited for all these years.Honestly, I don't think I need to say what happens. You just really need to know the background of these movies to appreciate the story of this one. Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Luke and Leia are born. Padme dies. Everybody knows this, and yet, Lucas is able to weave the stories together in this instalment.Episodes 1 and 2, as mentioned above, had some major weak moments. The weakest thing in this entry is Hayden Christensen. He has definitely improved from episode 2, but he still overacts his scenes, particularly those when he is mad and transforms to the dark side. He is the main reason why this movie does not deserve a perfect score.All in all, though, the acting is quite good. This is Ewan McGregor's best outing as Obi-wan. He's no Alec Guinness for sure, but he does pull off the role nicely here. The same thing can be said for Natalie Portman; this is her best outing as Padme, and she definitely has matured into a fine actress in today's world. Samuel L. Jackson is always great even when he is in movies that really suck, so aside from Christensen, there really is nothing to complain about here.Overall, it's a great Star Wars movie, an almost complete return to form. Is it as good as the original trilogy? No it's absolutely not! But I can safely say that it comes the closest, and it comes quite close, actually. As for the special effects, well, it's Star Wars; I don't think I need to mention the special effects. All in all, an 8 out of 10 for me.",8,1,2,9 June 2012
The Woman in Black," Dan trades wands and flying broomsticks for a haunted house and the woman in black
","And the result is a near-perfect movie.So, the story here is that a young lawyer, played by Radcliff, goes to an isolated village where he is trying to sell a house known as the Eel March house (or something like that). When he gets there, however, he realizes that, not only do the villagers seem very unwelcoming, but he realizes that they keep their children inside the house for most of the movie. That is because they are trying to protect them from the woman in black, who is a ghost that is hell-bent on taking the lives of children, basically as revenge for when her own child died.The result is that of a great movie. I must say that this is the first time in which I went to a horror movie in the theatre. They scared me so much as a kid, that I did not want to watch any single one. Even the 'Goosebumps' on television scared me. But, when I saw the preview, I felt that I should see this movie, even if it is just to see Dan in his first post-Potter role.Speaking of which, the acting is great here. Ciaran Hinds is great as Daily, the only guy who tries to help Arthur (Dan's character), whether it is to sell the house, or if it deals with the woman in black. Janet McTeer plays his wife, who has some scary moments of her own.But, I can't leave out Dan. Unfortunately, there was one aspect of him that made me deduct one point from the film, and that was the fact that he was a 22-year-old, playing a father of a four-year-old. He just seemed a little too young to be portraying that aspect, and so because of that, I was, like many others, reminded of Harry. Nevertheless, he is still able to hold his own in the film, and his character is actually someone that we care about.Speaking of which, what really works in this movie is the character development. We are immediately introduced to Dan's character; the movie does give us glimpses of his past, which is good, because we get to know him more that way. Same with the other characters; Daily is a really likable character, and the villagers are not so much angry as they are scared. It is great character development, and that is very much needed in a film like this, because in a lot of horror films, we just get the young kids who just like to party. Not here, though.And finally, the scares. This is a movie that doesn't rely on blood, guts, and gore; also unlike other horror films, it simply relies on chills and scares, which is a nice break from the horror films. And let me tell you; there are scares. I definitely jumped a few times, and if a film makes me do that... well, I give it props.Overall, a great movie. Rotten Tomatoes said that there may not be enough chills for viewers that are more used to the horror films that we usually see. I disagree; there are chills, and there are times where you will jump. Plus, the actors all did a great job, even though there were times that I couldn't get Harry out of my head, and the script and the characterization was well-done. A 9/10 for me.",7,0,1,18 February 2012
The Greatest Showman," The movie that made me stop listening to critics
","Before watching this movie, I was someone who listened to the critics and based a lot of what I wanted to see on their opinions. This movie changed all that. While it has garnered a mixed review with critics, this movie is widely adored by audiences; guess which group I agree with.First off, let me just say that the music is absolutely STUNNING. My five favorite numbers (in no order) are 'The Greatest Show,' 'Come Alive,' 'The Other Side,' 'This is Me,' and 'Rewrite the Stars.' These songs incorporate a mix of Broadway and Pop, and the vocals are absolutely amazing on each and every song!Speaking of performances, they are all outstanding. Zac Efron's return to musicals after the success of High School Musical is well worth the long wait, while Michelle Williams completely took me by surprise with her great singing voice. Rebecca Ferguson and Loren Allred both give Jenny a beautiful voice, but there are three people that steal the show above all the rest: 1) If you're seeing this show, part of the reason why you're seeing it is because of Hugh Jackman; this man truly is The Greatest Showman, and I honestly put his performance here on par with his performance in Les Mis (he seriously should've been nominated for an Oscar here, too); 2) While I never listened to Zendaya's music, I definitely will from here on out. This woman has the VOICE OF AN ANGEL; her performance with Zac on Rewrite the Stars is absolutely heartbreaking and beautiful. Also, for the first time ever, Zac found someone with as much chemistry with him as he had with Vanessa Hudgens; 3) The breakout performance definitely goes to Keala Settle; it is her song 'This is Me' that will make you want to get out into the street and start dancing. She has so much power in that voice of hers, and I was so happy to see her perform the song at the Oscars (seriously, this song should've won over Remember Me, and I almost never think that a song should beat out a Disney song).In other words, if you've seen this movie, go and see it. This might just be my favorite movie ever. These guys absolutely hit it out of the park, and if it takes a few years for the critics to realize just how wrong they are, then so be it.THIS IS THE GREATEST SHOW!",10,3,7,17 August 2018
50_50," How to stay positive while dealing with the most negative situations
","This is one of the best movies, if not the best movie, of 2011. Everybody in it did their job perfectly, and with that, this is an example of perfection.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is perfect as Adam, the guy with the cancer. Everybody reacts in different ways to how he has cancer, but it's with how he reacts to it himself that attach's us to his character. We know that, even if he says that he's at ease, he's really not, and that is something that, in this movie, Gordon-Levitt knew how to work. For that, he gets applause.Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, in this movie. Now, to all you Seth Rogen haters, I know it may sound like a bad thing, but it actually isn't. He is the comic relief of this movie, and while he has the most profanity in this movie, his character is a likable character, based on the fact that he is the one that Adam looks to the most for support in this movie.Anna Kendrick is great in this movie as well, as the nervous therapist in this movie. While she is his therapist in this movie, we know that there are some feelings between the two, even when Adam is with his girlfriend.Speaking of his girlfriend, Bryce Dallas Howard is who we hate the most in this movie (or, at least, who I hated the most), but no worries: it is solely her character, and not her acting, that we hate. She may seem like a good girlfriend, but as we see later on, this is not the case (I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched it).Anjelica Huston is very good with the limited amount of screen time that she is given. She is the overbearing mother who just wants her son to be okay, and will do anything to make sure that he's okay.All in all, a perfect movie that shows that it is always good to make the best out of the worst situations. Everybody played their part well, and everybody deserves a round of applause. Academy Awards, take note of this movie, and its performances. 10/10 for me.",Null,1,2,30 October 2011
Fast Five," Best Fast and Furious movie of the series!
","I gotta say that, every time I watch this movie, I get excited because it is so much fun to watch. That's the thing about these movies; they may be ridiculous, but they are soooooooo much fun! It is clear that everybody on this film had an absolute blast and I loved every minute of it!With that being said, the thing that I like about the series now is that it isn't just focused on the cars. I feel like the earlier installments, while still fun, were somewhat all style and no substance. Yes, I know that I'm talking about the Fast and the Furious movies, but it felt like this one had an actual plot outside of fast cars racing down the street. It was entertaining; it wasn't just nice looking.As said before, the actors all had a lot of fun with this movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, of course, are the guys that heads the crew, while the rest of the crew are their usual, wisecracking and fun-loving selves. I particularly enjoyed seeing Gal Gadot pre-Wonder Woman. This time, they are joined by one of the most entertaining people in the acting business, Dwayne Johnson. Johnson was made for a series like this, and he gives it all he's got in a various amount of action set pieces.My one complaint is that the villain felt a little one-note. I didn't feel like there was any motivation for him, other than revenge. But, that is only a minor complaint, as the film itself was great!Definite recommend!",8,0,0,18 August 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Welcome back, Mel
","Over the years, Mel Gibson had developed a bad rep in Hollywood, most notably for his drunken anti-Semitic rants. It seemed like he was going to be blackmailed for the rest of his life by Hollywood. But, in a Robert Downey Jr.-like moment, he has returned in full form with his first directorial feature film since Apocalypto and, I have to say it, it is so good to have him back in the good graces of Hollywood!Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector who joined the army in the midst of World War II. However, due to his beliefs, he did not allow himself to touch a weapon, thus causing a rift between him and the rest of his fellow men. However, once they arrive at Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa, they - along with us - see a true hero emerge as he saves the lives of countless men fighting alongside him.As mentioned before, Mel Gibson has created a masterful stroke of genius, and it was so good to see him get recognized once again by the Academy over 20 years after his previous Oscar wins for Braveheart. While he is a good actor, it is behind the camera where he shines the most; he knows what angles to use, what direction to take. Also, since this is a war film, I must remind everybody of one of Mel's previous films, The Passion of the Christ. Since that movie is considered one of the most violent movies ever, it is safe to say that once the war scenes come in this movie, you know that Mel will not hold back. But with a war film, that is definitely a good thing. There is no sugar coating war of any kind and thankfully they got the right guy to direct the film.But he is not the only one who gets all the praise. Andrew Garfield received his first Oscar nomination as Desmond T. Doss in a role that cemented him as a great actor. While Garfield is well known for his turn as Spider-Man, it is his turn as Doss that will go down as one of the greatest movie heroes ever. Throughout the film, you see the struggle with his morality - you see it when he is being beaten by his own men for not touching a weapon and you see it when he is in the throes of battle. Garfield pulled it off so effortlessly that I truly believe that he was the one who was truly deserving of the Oscar that year. As a matter of fact, this film should've won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in my humble opinion.But this film would not have gotten made if it weren't for one man. On that note, I must pay my respect to soldiers who give their life to fight not just for their country, but for all countries in all the world. While I am not a supporter of war and violence, I have a lot of respect for those who stand up to the bully. As for Doss...where there was hell, you showed us Heaven; when there was darkness, you showed us light; when there was despair, you gave us hope. Thank you so much for never giving into your morality and for saving all those men on the battlefield. Your courage has not been forgotten.'With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together.' - Desmond T. Doss, Hacksaw Ridge",9,1,2,24 August 2018
The Fighter," Fighters and Dreams
","'Irish' Mickey Ward (played by Academy Award Nominee Mark Wahlberg) is considered a stepping-stone for those who are on their way to the top in the world light welterweight title. His trainer is his brother (played by Academy Award Winner Christian Bale), his mother is his manager (played by Academy Award Winner Melissa Leo), and his girlfriend is his number one support system (played by Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams). This movie details his million-to-one rise to the top as he goes to show that he is not just a stepping stone. However there are more problems than just his fight; his brother is a drug abuser who hangs out at a crack house, thus pushing Mickey away and leading him to be pulled in two different directions by his family and his girlfriend.What a great film. Plain and simple. The editing of this film was on pace with the rest of it, and the story - which is based on a true story, btw - is an absolutely astonishing one. I recently reviewed David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook,' which he made after this. Both movies prove that the director is a modern genius. Whether you agree with his tactics or not, you cannot deny that the guy is talented and knows how to get the best of the best from his cast.And speaking of which, I just got to say that the cast all brings their 'A' game to this movie. I would like to talk about the supporting characters first, because their characters are just as important as Mickey himself. Amy Adams is brilliant as his no-nonsense girlfriend, while Melissa Leo is great as his no-nonsense mother. While I do believe that they weren't the most deserving people to win Best Supporting Actress that year (that should have gone to Helena Bonham Carter for The King's Speech, imo), both actresses provide their characters with enough of a hard attitude that it's not surprising to see them fighting against each other for Mickey. Yet you can't help but love either one of them; as a result, both actresses at least deserved the nomination. The same can be said for Christian Bale; while I don't think he was the most deserving actor for his category (that award should have gone to Geoffrey Rush for The King's Speech), he gives the most well-rounded performance in the whole entire movie. He is the loser who once had his shot but who is now considered a lost cause. He is considered a pity case. He is a drug addict. And yet, due to the love he has for his family and his brother, you can't help but love him and hope that he defeats his battle against drugs. Bale did not miss a beat; thus he did also deserve a nomination. However, the one actor who did not get an acting nomination was the main man himself, Mark Wahlberg. While he did get nominated for the Best Picture category as a producer on the film, I found it tragic that he wasn't recognized in the lead actor category. He should have been nominated over Javier Bardem's performance in Biutiful; Wahlberg is the guy that you hope gets the shot that he needs for his career. He is amazing in this role and he hits all the right notes.Finally, I got to pay my respects to Mickey Ward and Dicky Eklund, who both fought very hard battles to get where they are today. While I do not watch boxing, I have nothing but respect for those who fight for what means the most to them. Fighting against drug addiction is hard and so is being considered a stepping-stone. Here's to two men who truly are...THE FIGHTERS.All in all, a great film! Go and watch it!",8,0,0,3 September 2018
