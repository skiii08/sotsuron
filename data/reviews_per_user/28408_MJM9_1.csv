The Blair Witch Project," worst movie of the year (possible spoilers)
","don't believe all the hype, i found nothing scary about this movie. heck barney is even scarier. i mean, what is so scary about a bunch of dried up twigs that the 3 people find through out the movie? and, where is the logic behind filming the objects that scare the people?  the actor will be crying and screaming but still be filming the thing that scares 'em.  i think if something was frightening you, you would run, not stand around and film it.the characters in the movie are really obnoxious. all they do is whine, cuss, cry and scream at nothing.  i kind of wished this was a horror movie, so these actor could be killed off in the worst ways",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
