Walk the Line," Living From The Heart
","I just came from seeing (in the UK) 'Walk The Line' - I have come back from the movie theatre in a total trance. What a wonderful movie !!! It IS the story of Americana, not just Johnny Cash - or you could say JC IS the story of Americana -- rural poverty, hard work on the land, family tragedy, talent, more hard work risking everything, the fall from grace and descent into Hell, the resurrection with the help of friends, and ultimately redemption -- and all through Love, and above all Passion. It's like Hollywood is AT LAST standing up and saying, 'Hey,World! THIS is what 'America' and being 'American' is REALLY all about !!!' This has GOT to be HOTTEST for the Ocars. In case anyone ever doubted which side of the line they stand, this is Highly highly highly recommended !!!",10,1,2,12 February 2006
The Departed," Too long, too noisy, too boring - a pastiche
","What IS it with Scorsese and endless VIOLENCE ? actual violence, communication violence, interpersonal violence, and on and on. Another East coast violent gang movie ? in 2006?! I don't think so, thank you very much. If it had been made in 1990, then maybe .... But today we have enough real violence on the TV news each night about a real increasingly violent world. Nothing fictional can compare any more, and it is pointless to try. Where was all the subtle character analysis? and growth? and inner dilemmas ? and on and on. And Jack Nicholson hammed it up good and proper - what else could he do? - at various points the audience in my theatre (in the UK) were LAUGHING !!! And the movie was too, too, too L-O-N-G ! And as for the number of tedious F-words ! seemed like the scriptwriter was trying to vie with J D Salinger in -The Catcher in the Rye- for the number of G--D-----s. In today's world? Pathetic ! Come on, Marty baby, you CAN do better than this - before you get too old to try !",4,4,6,21 October 2006
Casino Royale," The Perfect Bond for today's world
","I saw the movie last night (17 Nov 06) in the UK -- totally brilliant! What a marvellous evening of pure - and purely professional - entertainment! I enjoyed every action-packed, self-controlled, tender and vulnerable moment. Daniel Craig is terrific - as well as terrifically gorgeous ! Without derogating one bit from his own original approach to the character (and what a refreshing update!), Daniel Craig is So-o-o-o Dry and Cool (neither shaken nor stirred) and is surely, without doubt, the new Steve McQueen - the Steve McQueen of The-Thomas-Crown-Affair-meets-Bullitt - and he's British !!! Congratulations to ALL involved in making this movie - from the script to the music to the (relevant) special effects to the stunts to the locations to the pure True Grit involved in it all ! MORE PLEASE !!!",10,1,3,18 November 2006
