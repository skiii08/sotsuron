Ford v Ferrari," Wow!
","I will have to start by saying I am biased allready before seeing this movie. Sorry, but that's the truth. I am a huge fan of Carroll Shelby, and especially of his awesome creation, the classic, 427 Cobra. He is also an automotive legend who, togeather with Ken Miles, made racing history. I can only say thank you, to the both of them, thank you very much!The film Ford vs Ferrari was truly exciting from start to finish (line), and I loved every second of it. Just as other great racing films prior, like the classic Le Mans with Steve McQueen, and Days of Thunder with Tom Cruise, it brings out the best of automobile racing. These films all capture the essence of motor sports, each in their own way, showing what it takes to be a winner, including the dangers of speed that follows.The film gets a perfect 10 in my book as I felt completely entertained throughout the whole film. I am not rating it on absolute historical accuracy, or total perfection when it comes to the art of filmmaking, but as an enthralling, riveting, really awesome, kick-ass movie for all to enjoy. It may be a bit much jargon for those with less interest in cars or racing, but stil, one hell of a flick!R.I.P. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles!",10,2,4,30 March 2020
Climax," Irreversible was better...
","That's all you need to know.no really, it didn't give me enough of what's going on inside the people's minds to give me a scare. i've tried lsd and i couldn't relate to this version of a nightmare, but then again, that's lsd for you. totally unpredictible and everyones trip/bad trip is their own. no two are alike. maybe if there was a bit more scary effects to give you the feel of how warped out each persons mind is becoming during the whole duration of what's going on, then you'd be more a part of that persons trip. what i mean is i didn't feel the effects of lsd watching this. i did see the madness going on, and yes it was scary. but i don't feel druggged watching it. irreversible made me feel like i was there, being raped, that's how great it was filmed.lsd is the hardest experience to relay to other people, even if they've tried it themselves. it's more or less 'you had to be there to beleive it' kind of thing. and if you weren't tripping at the same time you weren't there.but, i have to give No√® credit for trying, that's for sure. he's one of a very few to depict anything in and of the drug scene that is happening all round us on a daily basis. thank you! i am guessing you are becoming one of us by now, and will keep trying to give the rest of the population a hint of what it's all about ;)",5,1,4,11 October 2019
