Blade Runner 2049," Many of my fellow IMDB User Reviewers are Replicants
","I make a habit of watching a movie first before I read any reviews and without watching any trailers. Basically, I watch with virgin eyes. Thank God I have this unusual habit because the User Reviews on IMDB lead me to conclude many of my fellow User Reviewers are shallow, misogynistic air heads who lack creativity and artistic presence, and approach movies with a technical Replicant point of view, lacking anything human.This is Ryan Gosling's best acting to date. I was blown away by much of the non-verbal communication present in this movie. The movie was long and some say scenes lingered, but they need to be...the whole premise of societal breakdown as a result of an unanticipated 'miracle' is felt with the apparent 'slowness'. I was caught up in every moment and loved this ride. I kept hearing Jeff Goldblum's voice in Jurassic Park, 'Life finds a way.'",10,3,7,7 January 2018
Conquest 1453," For once we see the manipulative underhandness of the Greeks
","I absolutely loved this movie. My mother is Greek and I was raised more Greek than my German father's heritage. I know the Greek mindset and the subtle and not so subtle ways of manipulation and political intrigue. This movie in the first hour exactly portrays the clever manipulation of all parties concerned to achieve their respective goals. I am also an independent scholar of everything Byzantine. Too often a battle movie only centers on the war strategy, the action scenes and the political statement the writers which to convey. The Eastern Roman empire after their defeat at Manzikert in 1071 was in severe decline thereafter. The only manner, therefore, in which the 'Byzantine' empire was able to continue for so long afterwards was by political manipulation and payoffs. The ending obviously shows the writers' intent on being a pro-Turkish movie at the expense of some minor points in its historical portrayal. But, there is nothing of historical discrepancy I found that was fatal to the story. In fact, the story does not go far enough in showing how Mehmet II rebuilt the city by rebuilding the population with Christians and even Jews. He showed religious tolerance and even re-established the Greek Orthodox Patriarchy. I could go on and on about the wonderful manner in which Mehmet governed Constantinople after the conquest, and it shows his unique genius. Therefore, I understand why the Turks emulate him so much. Regarding some of the historical discrepancies some viewers point out in their reviews, there is much about the battle we simply do not have a definitive account: Was a gate left open on purpose or by mistake? And was this gate the reason why the city fell? Did Constantine XI die in battle or did he commit suicide? How many men did Mehmet actually have? How many men did Constantine XI have? One thing is sure, many of us have been wrongfully assuming Constantinople was a weak city which was easy to conquer. There is no evidence of this. The empire was non-existent. Yet, in fact the walls of the city were in good repair having been strengthened before the siege. Therefore, I believe the director took what pieces of discrepant history he thought important to adapt to his theme of the movie. I have no historical problem with the director's approach. The set pieces and art direction were superb. The battle scenes wonderfully done. The acting breathless.",9,3,7,12 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great kids movie...Adults only need the last 30 minutes
","After an hour into the movie I was ready to go home. The magic was not there. I cared little about any character, the strategy and the over emphasis on special effects. There was little to no comic relief and the little comic relief was childish and not clever.***Spoilers ***It was not until the death of the Sith and the battle with the guards that i started taking notice. The fight sequence was well done. I liked Kylo Ren wanting simply to wipe out everything both light and dark...anything which reminded him of the past and start something new. God knows i feel like that sometimes. It was a touching moment to see Luke and Leia holding hands in reunion....an end of an era...this scene brought me back to 1977 and the first two sequels...what a ride back then! This reunion redeemed an otherwise worst of the Star Wars saga movies into an acceptable segue. So skip the first hour and a half and watch the last 30 minutes and you will have everything you need to know for the next one which I hope will spend more time in intergalactic intrigue, suspense and more adult cynical comic relief rather than puppet penguins imitating the 'Home Alone' face burn and the giant fish complaining about the damage to their cottages. I give it a 3/10 because this is a great movie for kids and the reunion of Luke and Leia...otherwise it is a big fat zero.",3,0,0,18 December 2017
