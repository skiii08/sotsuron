The Blair Witch Project," I Dig this Flick
","People really some to either love or hate this film. I had a group of friends over last Halloween to watch it. Half of them were freaked out and the others were just puzzled. Most of the puzzled crowd didn't understand what was going on in the final frames, or were unable to suspend their disbelief enough to enjoy it. Too bad for them.Sure, the film has weaknesses, but do yourself a favor and don't fixate on them. Instead, focus on the greatness of the film. The makers of The Blair Witch Project showed that you can make a great horror film with a couple of crummy cameras and a kick-butt classic ghost story.If you have not seen it and are thinking going to, just make sure to pay attention to the details of the Blair Witch/Rustin Parr legend as they are laid out. Ignore the hype and just watch it alone with the lights out.",9,1,2,31 October 2004
