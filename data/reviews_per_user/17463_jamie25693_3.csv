The Incredible Hulk," Happy, But Not Satisfied.
","Marvel did not serve this movie justice! The only reason I liked this film, is because Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. My problem with this movie is that they made the hulk look like a cartoon character more than something realistic. I really liked Ed as 'Bruce banner' but until I saw 'The Avengers Assemble' I thought Mark Ruffalo portrayed the character justice. The acting is somewhat good. Tim Roth who played 'The Abomination' also made this movie more enjoyable but other than that I think it was very disappointing. I am such a huge Hulk fan and for them to design the hulk the way that they did, really made me think that there will never be a good hulk movie. Hopefully Mark Ruffalo will have his own solo movie as 'Bruce Banner' and we will get the best hulk movie it deserves.",4,0,1,24 April 2015
The Babadook," Relief To Know That These Sort Of Films Are Still Being Made.
","I went into this movie expecting not a good story and not a lot of scares. But what I got was something spectacular and stunning. We have a mother and son who are the main characters in this movie and from the get go you can tell there is something not right between the mother and son. The movie is more psychological than horror, although in some scenes you feel on edge and waiting for something to happen. The acting between the mother and son is outstanding, even though we know that the mother has got issues, the way the two characters let it affect their relationship is astonishing. Movies like this are rarely made nowadays but the twist at the end is surprising and fits so well with this movie.'The Babadook' delivers chills, somewhat horror and over all a good look into the mind of someone who is losing their sanity.",9,0,3,24 April 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," mainly disappointed
","Where do I start?? First I want to say that Paul Giamatti portray of 'The Rhino' was absolutely horrible. I was happy that he was only in the movie for a short period of time. If he was in it for any longer than I would of without a doubt, walked out of the cinema. Andrew Garfield portray as 'Spiderman' is still watchable but the main and only reason I enjoyed this movie is because of Dane DeHaan. His portray as Harry/Goblin was perfect. As soon as I heard his laugh as the goblin was spectacular. But considering that his portray as the goblin was only about 15 minutes long, I thought that was shocking that this new villain with amazing acting skills and bringing the goblin to life only had over 15 minutes on the big screen was disappointing. As for electro I am not even going to comment on his performance, lets just say how disappointing it is.",5,1,6,24 April 2015
