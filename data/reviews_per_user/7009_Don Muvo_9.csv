Black Swan," You have to suspend belief too many times.
","This Polanskyesque horror movie appeals to some as a perfect mixture of genres, constantly resorting to ambiguity in order to extend the attention of the audience to its hero, Nina (Natilie Portman). This actually weakens the film's connection to its target, which is a ballet production, however, which seems a waste, although eventually it becomes clear that all of the other characters must gradually become mere cogs in the grinding wheel of Nina's egoism. In the end we are left with only one character, the hero, and her death, as the perfect consequence; and as death sublimates the existence of all, not just its victim, the movie neatly resolves all of its many conflicts.It is as if Aronofsky, the creator of The Wrestler, is bragging to us, 'See how easy it is to end a movie with death! You can dissolve every conflict at once, no matter how poorly constructed it was, and the audience will never realize how it happened in their grieving!' To his credit, he has taken care to reconcile the other characters with Nina before or at her death, yet the I find the notion that the snuff ending has become the new panacea of film making repulsive.",Null,0,0,2 September 2011
Casablanca," Everything that Hollywood should be
","I can't see what to write here, since so many people will be moved by this film and write something about their experience in seeing it, often time after time, 'As Time Goes By'. This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, with an array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning of World War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that will always be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that it is. Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie. It all has to do with time, place, and character. It's so easy to get embroiled in one or two of the character's performances that you'll miss half of the film. It's an amazing film to watch multiple times.",10,2,2,4 July 2003
Crash," Finally, another important movie
","Paul Haggis is a gifted writer. You can read his biography here http://imdb.com/name/nm0353673/bio. I heard this was an inspired movie and it has won 26 awards in total. None of this prepared me for the hard-edged reality this movie dishes up. It has some of the same feel as Memento, but this movie has more of a Hollywood look, and less of the quirkiness of Memento. I apologize for giving it a 10 rating despite the fact that it has production flaws. It's just that there isn't anything better out there, and at least one film deserves to get a 10. Haggis has proved that he can direct a great film on a budget, and should be getting even more financial support for his projects in the future.The film is an ensemble piece that argues that, in a world with Political Correctness, no one is really safe. In LA is where it all happens, about every 5 to 10 years or so, it even snows, at least somewhere, in LA. This film is about what happens one evening when it snows, and during the 24 hours leading up to it. Four of the main characters are members of the LAPD, two others are the District Attourney and his wife. After this is a film maker and his wife, an Iranian shopkeeper and his daughter, a Mexican-American man and his daughter, and two street hoodlums. The script and camera make plenty of use of parallelism and foreshadowing. For the most part the story pivots and weaves amongst these 14 characters, allowing our minds to make whatever connections we find most suitable. We may side for or against any of the characters at any one time, but if we do, it is merely a temporary illusion that has allowed us to do that, an illusion as apparitional as race itself.The Crash, which occurs, is merely a metaphor for the life-changing event which will occur in the life of most of the main characters. A transformation, in each case, that was 'meant' to happen.In the end, almost all of the survivors have undergone a transformation, and not merely a 'spiritual' transformation. The transformation is usually that their life has changed and they will never be the same person again that they were before the 'Crash'. One of the deeper interpretations of this movie may be that we should perhaps be someone other than who we are, but we have not yet realized the reality that exists within us because we have ignored or suppressed it day after day in our quest for a peaceful, secure lifestyle.You can place this movie next to Fargo and Casablanca in your collection, and be assured, it will not wear out its welcome.",10,3,8,29 May 2006
Fargo," See the Snow!
","This is my absolute favorite movie of all times. It's the kind of film you can see over and over. It's the kind of film that can make you cry in unexpected places, like at the end, around the 3rd or 4th time you've seen it. Part of the greatness of this story is that it grows out of the location and characters where the authors grew up, around Fargo, South Dakota. The characters are another important part, because not only are they interesting people, but they represent a cross-section of common attitudes about justice. Jerry sees justice in terms of financial and personal advantages. Gaear understands justice as always doing what is necessary to survive, given his criminal life style. Carl defines justice as being in the right (probably like most of us). Finally, justice to Marge means no harm done so that tomorrow will be better.The snow is a metaphor for purity or perfection, against which backdrop, the conflicts of the world must take place.",10,0,0,26 August 2005
Before Sunset," About the Gap Between Commitment and Fullfillment
","The resolution of this movie is simply about the fact that feelings may trump commitment. Now that that's over, I can go on to say why I think this move is such a bad movie.This movie has a theme, but that's all it has. The acting is atrocious. Ethan Hawke isn't capable, and because this movie is meant to be an improvisational tour de force, his character's lines are constantly jarring our belief. His lines and delivery throughout cause us to doubt that he is really a writer (even though we see him signing books), that he is really a parent, even that he is really a married man. I guess if you buy the bit about his being a writer, you'll buy the family stuff. The scene at the end with Julie Delpy mimics the deceased bebop singer/pianist referred to only as 'she', is psychologically the coup de gras, since so much of the movie before seemed so disingenuous. Finally nothing is said for the 'feelings' he has for his son, 'I don't want to ever be without him for even a minute!', nor what it is he is unable to give his wife that she 'needs'.Besides the theme, which is a good one, the only other mixed feeling I have is about Julie Delpy who turns in a reasonable performance, and some of the photography.",2,7,16,19 October 2007
Mulholland Drive," Really confusing but not bad
","I just saw SSZ1-1's analysis in the user comments. Since he knows just about everything about this movie (at least partly from reading David Lynch's hint document) I feel I have learned something at last about this very confusing film. The one thing I think he might have missed was that Camilla Rhodes's role in the second half of the film was to push Diane over the edge. When things were going pretty bad for Diane at the party, she gives her the 'girl glance' aimed directly at finishing her bruising ego. Notice how she appears out of nowhere and exits quickly. The part she plays in the dream (first part) is 'the one', the interloper who will replace whichever girl deserves the movie role.I had originally seen the second half of the film (the reality) as an inversion of the first half (the dream), which it was, I just missed all the clues (that should have been so obvious) about why the dream was a dream. Now why did I miss all those clues? Am I really that dense? I think not. The problem is that I was guilty of not being a David Lynch fan already. I was watching the film under a pretence that David Lynch is a director who is crazy about making films that look like dream sequences, and I had better watch it and like it, even if half of everything did look like a dream. I was so proud of myself for coping so well, that I did not even notice the 'reality' the woken-up sequence. So does D.L. do a good job of clarifying his intentions? I think not. Is it a bad movie? No, just a bit confusing, so confusing that it requires serious discussion, to try to put the pieces together with others that have seen it. Is it worth watching more that once? Probably. I gave it 7 stars on the plus side, for being a good movie, but 3 less than a perfect score for being confusing as hell. The cowboy reminded me of an existentialist guru who was lecturing the director on his attitude; thus he is my favorite character.Am I a David Lynch fan now? Probably. Maybe the blue box only exists in someone's psychotic dream imagination, and not in reality. If so, it sure causes one to loose a lot of sleep unnecessarily!",9,1,2,6 June 2002
Prometheus," Stronger characters than some of its predecessors
","I thought that this movie answered a lot of the questions posed by Alien 3. It also has one of the nicest sequel setups I've ever seen. There are a few unexplainable scenes such as why the giant is being attacked at the escape pod at the end of the movie by the octopus-like creature (Why not have him attacked on his own ship?) The main theme, how the creatures that made us were destroyed by their own biological weapons of mass destruction is very clever, and puts a nice period on the Alien series. It was a nice touch having the main character motivated by her, 'legacy', Christian religion to finally find out why our creators wanted to destroy us. I can only imagine that the, 'dirty little secret', is that the universe is really only large enough for one species of infinite potential. I'll pay to see the sequel though, so I can know for sure.",7,0,2,31 May 2013
Signs," Weak Sci-fi/horror, yet speculative
","There's a lot to like and dislike in this film. First, the film is not really as scary as Knight Shyamalan, its writer and director, and the studio implies. As science fiction, it is pure schlock. There is a message that the movie tries to deliver however, so I will pay the movie (7.5 user rating!) it's due, even though I didn't really like it. The rest of this review is pretty much a spoiler, so don't bother reading it until you've seen the film. If you have seen the film, and feel dissatisfied, perhaps you will agree with some of my points. I'll discuss some of the negatives, some positives, and what I think the filmmaker was trying to do and why it is pleasing to so many despite its faults.The fear factor: No scene is really scary. Part of the problem is the poor character development which may be attributed to the actors: Gibson, especially, is horrible by Hollywood standards, seemingly just 'going along' and overacting for the director so that the studio can get it's money out. The performances by the children are also way below the standard here. Clearly Shyamalan is not a 'people person', he is not getting the best out of his actors. Another problem is that Shyamalan is a trying to work within a minimalist horror ethic that really doesn't work cinematically. Minimalist concepts are important in film, it's just that a lot of the techniques that the director tries to bring off, just end up being annoying: The knocking all over the house for example to tell us that aliens are there, as well as the test pattern on the TV, which frankly just went over my head the first time I saw it. (Shyamalan wants us to interpret it as 'destruction' of our media resources by the alien attack.) Further, the still shots on TV and alien in the alley, presented to convince the characters and the viewers that there is a world wide attack going on, are pretty lame. It seems that Shyamalan is hell-bent (my expression :) on not spending 'too much' money on effects and wants to 'show what can be done' with just a few resources and one damn :) expensive actor. He doesn't succeed very well, and any illusion that he has should be exposed. There is one reservation I have to make, however, it is that Shyamalan sincerely trying to draw a picture of hysteria-based reality. He is stating here that reality is NOT a fixed entity based on some objective 'out there', but is based on culture, which of course, includes media such as film, television and books, as well as social interaction. He is quite successful in making this allusion and this contributes to the existentialist interpretation of the movie's message, as well as to the likelihood that the movie is going to make it onto some lists despite all of its roughness. 
The script: That Shyamalan is not an especially good writer of dialog seems obvious from listening carefully to what these people are saying to each other: how they often answer different questions to those asked, and speak disjointedly in general. If he feels this has a positive dramatic effect, then this brings into question what is drama, and how it works. At any rate, if this was his intention - to create a disjointedness feeling in the film viewer based on the disjointedness of the dialog - I don't think it was artistically or elegantly done, once again - it was mostly annoying. I kept asking myself, 'Would these people all watch this and want to suspend their belief if Mel Gibson were not in it?' The feature videos on the DVD indicated that Shyamalan is a meticulous story-boarder. This may be his main talent, not bringing his own somewhat naive ideas to the screen in a minimalist style.The aliens: Not much to comment on here. They sound a lot like raccoons, have the classic skinny look almost to the point of effeminacy (but not so much that a man can't fit into the costume) and yet, look a bit like Spiderman. (Was it a left-over pattern from wardrobe?) Water kills them, which seems to imply that they come from a part of the universe where ordinary properties of matter don't apply. Oh yes, and they have poison gas jet in their wrist, which they use to kill humans one at a time. Hmm, this echoes back to Spiderman, doesn't it? And even though there are many of them in their flying saucers and a gang of them pounding on the house, there are only two in the movie, one in the house and one running though a back-alley in Brazil (probably the same actor). Believe me, E.T. was a lot better.The story: Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was a priest who lost his belief when his wife, Colleen, died because of a careless driver (the sixth character, Ray, played by Shyamalan). Gibson's character is actually the strongest element of the film and clearly calls for an actor of his stature. Also, the portrayal of Colleen's death becomes a central element in the apotheosis of the movie, as Graham Hess gradually comes to realize that her final words were inspirational instructions to him on how to conduct himself and the family through their time of need (the alien invasion). This makes some sense on at least two levels: 1) That Graham was to recover his religious belief as a result of surviving this test and abandoning his angry disbelief; and 2) existentially and metaphorically, as the character says, 'Everything happens for a reason', therefore the wife dies, she gives advice, the advice is followed and the family survives the alien invasion. Viewers may respond then to this according to their own personal degree of religiosity: the more religious will tend to see it as a reconversion story, echoing their own reconversions. The non-religious can weigh the existentialist message, 'Everything happens for a reason', and reflect on whether their own experience bares this out and perhaps, whether or not it should. This is a positive message and a coherent statement by Shyamalan, which will not play as well in Peoria (Christian fundamentalists may consider this as too mixed a message, while they should 'thank God for small favors' in that Shyamalan puts religious belief in so positive a light. Only the skeptical empiricists will be left completely out in the cold. Oh well, you can't always please everyone, right?In summary, I think that Shyamalan has made a movie that will be often discussed and will always have to be judged on its own merits, which is probably as it should be. The film is important in that it deals in speculative matters of human knowledge (not the existence of alien beings), rare in American Cinema.",6,0,2,12 January 2003
The Great Gatsby," The movie brings out the book's one great insight
","I saw The Great Gatsby on the weekend, and I'm quite excited about it. I was glad to hear the director say that living to repeat the past is quite impossible, but I have to admit that Fitzgerald's suggestion is quite fascinating, even if it seems wrong-headed. Since time points forward for us except when indexing thoughts and media, we never look into the past, even relativity doesn't permit that in any direct sense. The past is read-only. Our minds can survey the times that already happened, and we commonly assume that it is unhealthy to dwell in the past excessively.That's what the novel is about, at least. It is a fascinating attempt by a character to live out his own religion not so much in a quest for spirituality, but in a quest for something he feels a need for in his life. Since life is very much about needs, this opens the question of in what contexts it becomes important or relevant to recreate the past.One recreates the past whenever one tries to preserve love. Love only happens in an instant, and the spectacle of couples trying to preserve their custom of alliance with each other is clearly one in which reproduction of the past plays a big part. That is 'Great' Gatsby's great insight: That the moment of memorializing love, in essence attempting to make it eternal, is the reproduction of, and return to the past through repetition.",10,3,5,29 May 2013
