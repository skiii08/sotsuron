The Avengers," Marvels The Avengers Movie Review
","Team of a Lifetime The Avengers is not just a film- it is a well thought out story. However, the background of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man 2, are almost mandatory prior to watching, or The Avengers will make no sense, and possibly bore you to death. The combination of five different films, introducing us to different characters and stories, turns this movie into reality. Throughout the different Marvel films, there was question to whether the writer/director, Joss Whedon, was going to follow through with his previous productions and deliver a film that lives up to the fans' expectations.The Avengers is, without a doubt, classified as a science fiction movie filled with countless amounts of action and comic book references. The Avengers is made up of an assortment of intense music, ambitious characters, fast-paced plotting, special effects, rivalry between the hero and villain, and suspense. According to Marvel fans, this movie, by far, sky rockets their expectations.The complex movie begins with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, all teaming up and creating the Super Hero team of a lifetime. When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, the director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, finds himself in need of a phenomenal team to save the world from disaster. Therefore, a daring span of recruitment begins. However, once brought together, the Avengers struggle to trust each other and work as a team. Meanwhile, in previous movies the super heroes were forced to work individually. Therefore, the film's theme arises when the outsiders start to realize that by using their outstanding super powers and working as a team, they are capable of becoming something great, and in this case capable of saving the world from Thor's adopted brother, Loki. Loki has characterizes of each superhero he is facing; therefore, it takes the teamwork of each superhero to defeat the Loki.It would be unfair to focus solely on the positives when negatives do exist in The Avengers. It seems as though Joss Whedon focused more on the battles and special effects in the movie, then on the actual background and explanation of defining the characters. Without the additional background of the prior films, The Avengers seems to be confusing. The two and a half hour movie almost needed to be stretched out to a three hour movie in order to include all of the important background information to get the movie off to a better start, and to make more sense to viewers who have not seen the background films. Besides, with the lack of character explanation, the film has a rushed feeling, and can become rather confusing.",8,0,3,6 April 2013
