The Blair Witch Project," Ho Hum
",After sitting through this 'HORROR' film I have decided that this film was pre-planned and used actors and not 3 young photographers as we are led to believe.  After a half hour it became boring and tedious.  If this is considered a horror film the producers should go back to the hey days of films to find out what a GOOD HORROR FILM SHOULD BE LIKE.,Null,1,3,16 July 1999
Notting Hill," An entertaining farce
","It was the supporting cast of this movie that made it worth while seeing.  Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant were entertaining, but the rest of the cast carried the picture. When is Hollywood going to learn that ALL pictures do not have to be 2 hours +.  This one was 20 minutes too long.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
U-571," FINE WAR MOVIE, VERY REALISTIC, AND VERY WELL DONE
","I had seen the coming attractions for this film a few weeks ago, and decided I had to see it.  I was not disappointed in the least.  It made you feel that you were part of the crew, and that you were living the adventure.  I cannot recommend it too highly, go see it, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.",9,1,4,19 April 2000
American Beauty," OUTSTANDING BLACK COMEDY OF THE YEAR - ACADEMY AWARD FOOD
","The acting in this movie was just excellent, and especially the two principals, Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.  It was oneof the fastest two hours I have spent in the theater in a longwhile.  I think that men will enjoy this more than women will,but overall a joy to behold.  Mr. Spacey gets better and better with each and every new picture he come out in.  Keep up thegood work.",10,0,0,23 September 1999
For Love of the Game," A nice movie, but drawn out toooooooo long.
","This is a nice little movie, which I enjoyed very much.  Kevin's acting is fine and so is Kelly's.  Made you feel that you were there at Yankee Stadium and side by side with Kevin.  The one fault I found with the movie was that they tried to stretch out the plot and after 2 hours it began to be tedious.",Null,0,0,15 September 1999
The Insider," GREAT STORY, GREAT ACTING, BUT MUCH TOO LONG!!!!
","The acting in this movie is great, and Pacino as always is a class acting job.  Crowe is fine, as well as the rest of the cast.  As with a great many movies showing now it was just too long.  The camera work got annoying and the music was terrible. If you want to rehash the tobacco suits all over again go see it, if not my recommendation would be to skip it.",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
The Green Mile," just superb
",I am not a Stephen King fan but this movie is superb.  The acting is Oscar quality from the star down to the little mouse who is so important to the plot.  We need more quality movies like this one.  Hollywood you can do it!,10,0,0,8 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE
","It was a pleasure to see Bruce Willis in something other than a shoot em up, blow em up performance.  I think he did an outstanding job in this  film that keeps you in suspense.  Haley Joel Osment was excellent and I think this young man has big future in movies. Go see it, you will be on the edge of you seat for two hours.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
