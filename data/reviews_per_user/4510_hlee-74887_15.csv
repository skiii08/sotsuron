Changeling," One of the most underrated film
","'...And You are in the position to embarrass them and they do not like it. They will do everything they can to discredit you.'Some times, justice is not the antithesis to injustice. It is a politicians word to mask the world from their embarrassment of truth. What is the truth? No one knows when you blur the line between manipulation and actual truth. When insanity becomes the weapon of choice for law enforcement, the path to true justice runs through the hand of the only person willing to stand against corruption. John Malkovich plays one of the most important roles. This movie will mesmerize you....even as the truth is finally revealed.",10,0,0,24 May 2020
Suicide Squad," Movies do not get as corny as this
","Will Smith is walking with his daughter. But as they turn into an alley, Ben Afflect swoops down just to say he doesn't want to arrest him in front of his daughter. So I'm asking this to myself...'why is Ben Afflect in a bat suit?'Okay...let's pretend Ben Affleck is Batman, than wouldn't he have mastered the element of disguise? Could he not have picked a different time to arrest Will Smith?And Jared Leto plays a Joker that makes every Dark Knight fan give up on the Batman series from nauseation.And this is just the first 15 minutes. From there on, watching this was like torture. The only way i would watch a movie as bad as this is with my eyes pried open in a Clock Work Orange like punishment.The thing is this...I love how comics have come to life in movies recently. But even if this was the only movie in this world, I wouldn't watch this.",1,2,2,7 July 2019
Interstellar," Work of Art
","Imagine you are set out to save this earth. A one shot to risk your own life for the world.....but you realize later, it's not your life you are risking...its your own children. And its your children who were risking their life to save yours.I don't want to reveal the entire film but I can't stop thinking of this film. I'm a huge Drak Knight fan, but this film may be Nolan's best. I guarantee the ending will break you down.",10,0,1,9 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," They saved the worst for last
",A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.,1,117,196,6 September 2019
Black Hawk Down," The best war film to date
","Black Hawk Down begins and ends as a high octane action film. Accompanied with a great sound track, there is rarely a break from the action. But what makes this film great is the lingering theme that runs in the dialog of 'what' and 'who' the American soilders are fighting for. The dialog of Mogadishu being a 'civil war' is an idea the rebel forces use in defense of their killings. The American side speaks for the thousands of lives lost calling the rebel's action 'genocide.' The war takes place in the busy urban streets heavily populated with civilians. The American soilders are grossly outnumbered but utilizes tactical warfare governed by the 'rules of engagement.' By this rule, the only way to tell apart civilians and rebels is to see who's shooting at them first. There is no glorious victory for winning the war in this film. The fight is to end the rebel genocide. The heroes are the ones who will risk their own life to leave no man behind.",10,1,2,27 April 2019
Prisoners," Everything but a real ending
",This movie had every element of a great suspense thriller....almost a perfect film...than the movie just shuts off. Or at least that's my opinion. It's like the budget fell through and they had to stop making the film five minutes too early.,9,0,0,8 April 2020
The Dark Knight," This film will go down in history...
","I can talk on and on about this film, but it's something you already know.......from the Dark Knight Trilogy, or any super hero genres, this film is the most complex. The power struggle from the macro view of Gotham's criminal justice system to the individual will to survive in chaos. It all comes to a collision in the hands of the puppeteer, the one villain who wants nothing more than to put blood on the hands of justice. And like the blind lady who holds the scale, Gotham's fate rocks back and forth as the Joker begins to invert order into chaos. Turn good into evil. Reveal honor to be the bleeding valor of his deception.Heath Ledger's performance can be a one man act to steal the spotlight accept it only brings the best out of the entire set. This film is an accomplishment. This movie kicked Batman Saga to a new level. It is going to be hard to out do Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Series.",10,1,2,1 December 2019
Into the Wild," A Spiritual Journey
","This film takes you on a journey of McCandless. A smart youngman from a well off family who becomes disillusioned by the mess that hides under the covers of their priveleged life. He sheds himself of his trust fund, his car, Ivy league college and all the things nepotism offers as he goes searching for his own identity.He was hailed as a leader and an above intelligent student. But when he peels the layers of the 'priveleged' perspectives, just how much of that is true? Just what are the boundaries of his 'priveleges' and would he make it without it? Just who is McCandless?This film is a spiritual ride as he travels the heartlands of America coming accross people of all background. He begins to challenge his old self and come face to face with nature. The only thing better than the film may be the soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. The only thing better than that is the novel by Krakauer.",10,3,3,19 July 2019
Taken," Do not #$&$ with Liam Neeson
",'Schindler's List' turned Liam Neesom into a legend. 'Taken' turned him into the baddest guy you don't want to #$&# with.The story has enough interesting twists and surprises to keep you guessing. But it's Liam Neeson's very believable acting that will draw you to follow every turns and dead end. He leaves no prisoners and shows no mercy to get back his daughter. An absolute adrenaline rush.,10,2,2,16 July 2019
The Happening," It's a sin to watch movies this bad
","If the two worst film makers got together and had a baby, and he made a film, it wouldn't be as bad as this film. In all seriousness, this movie is probably the worst movie you will see. This movie is the reason why God made it a sin to waste your time. Save yourself...do not waste your time watching this film.",1,0,1,8 April 2020
Joker," A Work of Art
","Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker walked the line between evil and demented. His motive wasn't for money or revenge. He wanted to expose the fallacies of humans that deep down inside, we are all as twisted as him...he's just ahead of the curve. From Harvey to Batman fleeing in the final scene, Joker was the only villain to have won.Rewind back before the Joker became the evil genius of the dark lore. When he was working clown gigs, taking 7 different anti-psychotics, scheduled visits with a mental health specialist, while bathing and feeding his mother. A crab in the bucket of poverty. A victim of the broken system that divided the wealthy and the working class to demeaning jobs and inept mental health facilities. He was slowly discovering how his life was meaningless. He was gaining a perspective on how the world views him as...a joke.Joaquin Phoenix plays the beaten down Arthur Fleck to perfection. An unassuming altruistic son while his counterpart, Thomas Wayne, plays the egotistical politician of Gotham. In the Dark Knight, Thomas Wayne is the sympathetic voice of compassion. A philanthropist behind the scenes who let's his board members deal with the politics. In this film, he is loud, brash and comes across aggressive, like a punch to the face. He is the antithesis of what the Wayne family stood for in the Dark Knight series.'those of us who have made something of ourselves will always look at those who haven't as nothing but clowns,' Thomas Wayne says. And a mob of angry clowns is what he gets.The established elite comes to a conflict with the forgotten poor and it all comes to a boil in the final riot where Arthur makes his transformation to the Joker in the same scene Batman is born.This film is as perfect as origin movies get. It transcends genres and can stand alone. The throw back setting is perfectly matched with the rich techni-colors. The music deservedly received recognition for best score. The director Todd Philips presents the film through Arthur's view. This brings a side to Joker that viewers can almost sympathize or relate, only if he wasn't a psychotic homocide killer deep down inside. But there is still a humanity the viewers can appreciate, like the scene between Arthur and Gary. The catalyst of the public acceptance of the Joker is best said by his social service worker...'They don't give a shit about people like you Arthur. And they don't give a shit about people like me either.'This film is a winner.",10,2,4,3 January 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Arguably the best cinematic film of all time
","I have watched this film a million times and it is always on cable channel. But every time I come across it, I have to pause and watch it again as if I do not know how it will end.This film is a testament to human will where hope never dies. Andy Dufresne was falsely imprisoned and forced to live a life as a murder convict. Every day in the Shawshank Prison is another day that can break the will of his unyielding humanity that could never be caged.This movies leaves me speechless and wanting to watch it again. Absolute masterpiece.",10,0,0,10 November 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," How badly can someone destroy the Batman Saga?

The Pursuit of Happyness," Pure inspiration
","Don't ever let someone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you you can't do it. You want something, go get it. Period.",10,1,1,13 November 2019
