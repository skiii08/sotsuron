Captain Phillips," It was just too real.
","While going to watch a movie, I didn't have any clue what was it about. But having Tom Hanks in a main part was already a big expectation. Believe it or not, but I found the movie (even difficult to call it just a movie)one of the best for a very long period of time. The action, the people, the characters, the story itself made me cry, tremble, co-live it! It was just a play of 7 people in general and they got me till the bones. I forgot I was in a theater. I was there, with them, frightened and nervous, willing to survive. Amazing picture. People around the world should watch it not only for pleasure but for awareness. Well done.",9,2,3,28 November 2013
Django Unchained," Blows out your brains.... as well as the characters'.
","As expected - tons of tomato juice on the walls, faces and... brilliant music as a background.. apparently to make you suffer less.Tarantino getting older but his vivid mind never dies. Picture is bright, characters are splendid, music is in very Tarantino-style. Albeit, story is vague and somehow doesn't teach anything. Happy ending?In some way one does expect it from him, but what surprises me more is how directors can't manage movies of less than 2 hours nowadays? Why does movie should be of 2h45mins? Can't one tell the story in a shorter way?..Despite it's duration, movie goes smoothly. Facts of the past make you suffer in the cinema chair, bluntness of the scenes makes you turn away and drain you out in the end, but that was it - the history of mankind. We can't turn away from the truth.",7,0,2,3 February 2013
