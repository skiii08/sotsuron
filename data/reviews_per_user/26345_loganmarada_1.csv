The Avengers," The Avengers achieves its goal, but could it have been better?
","Walking into The Avengers I was expecting a total 'popcorn' film with great visuals, explosions, and awesome fighting. I got that, but I also got a pretty good story, great comical dialogue, and a great mix of badass-ery and fun. I think their aim with this film was to have the awesome explosions, as well as the funny script make this movie enjoyable for the whole family. With this aim, I think they pulled it off flawlessly, the fighting sequences had you ready to stand up and applaud, and the lines were legitimately funny, and there wasn't a corny superhero line throughout the whole thing! Thank the lord. Now, to answer my question above, could it have been better? My answer is yes. I think the movie was a bit too predictable in ways, like how in every moment of trouble somebody comes out of nowhere and saves the day. I mean of course they can't have anything too extreme, but it was a bit campy in the sense of how Iron Man would fly out of nowhere and swoop somebody up seconds before the get destroyed. Also, the biggest problem I had was with Loki. Loki was a decent choice for the villain, but The Avengers had absolutely no trouble with him. Not at all. I mean, he is a GOD and they beat the crap out of him each moment before he got done talking. I almost felt like there really wasn't any struggle in this film, other than the city getting demolished, but in the end I was excited and had a great time watching it. I give The Avengers a 7 out of 10.",7,2,7,6 May 2012
