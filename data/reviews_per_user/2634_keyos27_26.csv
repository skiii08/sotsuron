The Equalizer," Morose and feisty, decent enough to catch action movie buffs' eye
","What makes a great action film? Showcasing a charismatic protagonist that bustles all sorts of powerful moves? Or would it be the thrilling plot that revolves around intriguing motives and cynical enemies? The Equalizer possesses both elements while featuring a veteran, Denzel Washington who plays Robert McCall still has what it takes to waltz through a plethora of wrongdoing by helping others and equalizing the corrupted society.The movie gets intense as the days of McCall ensue. It begins with an ordinary routine by showing McCall commuting via public transit and gradually foreshadows unique aura that differentiate him from his coworkers in the warehouse center. Then he spends his night reading in the café where he often chats with an indecent and polite girl, Teri played by Chole grace moretz. She manages to handle such a promiscuous role pretty well. It will take anyone by surprise when you find out her age.The prowess of Washington really makes this movie worth watching as his indomitable strength nonchalantly gets unleashed in order to take out the mafia. Nifty, swift, and impeccable, every movement he makes is a sight for sore eyes. Thus the editing seems well-done in terms of cutting and panning the scenes. The Russian mob and their dastardly stooges fit in well as they go head to head with Washington verbally and physically.However, there is a number of improbable moments that put you into thinking that perhaps McCall is invincible. Despite his strength of being such a skilled combatant, it is unrealistic for one guy to catch his counterparts red-handed in a jiffy as well as thwarting the armed group of mob. Although, that might get resolved by the scene where he heads to the majestic dwelling to debrief his enemies from a lofty couple who seem to be related to the president. It is safe to posit that McCall used to work for the United States Secret Service which explains why he is so formidable.In a nutshell, the equalizer is packed with breathtaking fights in which Washington acts like the present version of cavalier. It is also a no-brainer because there is neither conundrum nor mystery thus you don't need to heed the plot but let your emotion and time to be enraptured by a series of exciting and stimulating scenes that do not feel redundant.",7,1,2,6 December 2014
Gravity," The most affordable space travel that is worth experiencing
","Several Visual effects companies nowadays vie to procure a number of jobs of bringing magnificent space scenes to audiences whose expectations are high. So it has become much more challenging to create a successful Sci-Fi film that isn't always profitable genre anymore as more people are accustomed to common and groovy visuals.So what truly keeps audiences captivated? I think it comes down to producing a balanced combination of Visual effects and storytelling that comes along with great acting. The 'Gravity' is about Dr.Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) going through a sudden predicament that strikes them in the process of improvising the contraption over earth. Since small number of characters, it gives you a feeling of first-person movie.It is more of a different type of Sci-Fi. What I can guarantee is the immersive experience that can put you in awe. The way the movie presents by showing mechanical details that beautifully capture both inner and outer space shuttles is even more overwhelming than mystical feelings that you get from watching a series of space documentaries.Watching troubled astronauts hovering around the orbit on the brink of disappearing in the middle of space where their presence can easily become neglected is quite nerve-wrecking. Also, the beautiful and threatening space in 3D definitely has potential to appall and deafen the every theater.There are of scientific elements to be found as it stimulates the concept of what it takes to explore the space. Some may feel remorseful while others may feel motivated but if there is one thing that we all learn from this film is an awareness to appreciate great nature that exists on the earth.To reaffirm, 'Gravity' does not take you any further than the rim of earth. There are no aliens, UFOs, and meteors. So if you are looking forward to encountering dynamic battle scenes that involve eccentric creatures, it won't be a movie for you. But that does not mean it is not worth watching as there won't be movies that can appeal the greatness and mechanics of both gravity and space better than this one for a while.",10,2,3,15 October 2013
Fury," An emotional war movie that evokes intense sentimentality
","The cover of the movie, displayed with well-known group of cast along with the mighty artillery and the name of Brad Pitt above the title definitely makes me want to consider watching it. However, it also creates a deliberate debate about whether the content actually lives up to billing or not. And, it turns out to be a well-acted and well-directed war film that dramatically depicts explosive and scenes of World War II.The first glance of the scene is quiet gloomy and cruel as it takes place to a smoky land, fraught with crummy tanks and corpses scattered around. It gives you the surreal feeling of you being in the movie to sense a long-standing animosity against Nazi. From there, a series of emotions and battles build up till the final stage where a five U.S. armed contingent tries to execute a very reckless ambush while getting outnumbered by an advanced and a plethora of German legion. Things that differentiate this film from other counterparts are strong sympathies towards hand-to-mouth citizens whose lifespan being on thin ice every moment by relentless barrage of bombs falling from the skies and mass shootings. When you realize that the death is approaching, anything can happen in such a short period of time from falling in love with someone you just met to killing anyone regardless of age or gender. The last but not least, we all shall remember that any of us would not be able to watch this film or possibly, this movie might not have been made without the sacrifices of those who fought through their precious youth to provide us the rosy future that we are experiencing right now in some extent. I hope all the autocrats or leaders manifest themselves that declaring the war does not solve anything but leaves needless casualties and morose memories.",8,2,6,12 November 2014
Argo," A persuasive, funny, and nerve-wrecking movie by an astonishing actor
","When it comes to deciding what movies to watch, there are a few certain things that I carefully consider. It narrows down to the cast, types of genre, and the length of the movie. When I watch the trailer, I feel 'This is not a type of movie that I would be interested in. But, that changes my mind after finding out the identity of protagonist whose face is covered with bushy beard, Ben Affleck, who is both director and actor with experiences of delivering a heart-breaking performance in 'Town.' In 'Argo', he plays Tony Mendez, CIA technical operations officer that is destined help six Americans escape from Iran with a risky plan.As it is based on a true incident that transpired in 1979, collecting old references, thorough research, and casting actors/actresses who closely resemble the real people that are involved in the event must be a challenging and time-consuming task. Surprisingly, it is by far the most nerve-wrecking and plausible film. The reason would be the editing and composition. In order for us to easily and quickly grasp the story, it promptly begins with a narrative introduction of how and when the incident occurs by showing the actual clips from the past. Secondly, a shout-out to the herd of intimidating Iranian citizens who show an enthusiastic emotions that keep the entire theater petrified and quiet. Especially their skeptical and scornful glare towards the Americans in disguise was memorable. Last but not least, the realism. Do you want to feel an overwhelming atmosphere that pushes you to the brink of banishment?Also, try to avoid presuming it is all about seriousness because Ben Affleck and the writers know how to make audiences laugh with a unique sense of humor. Try to pay close attention to the dialogues carefully. Because they aren't cliché or sarcasm.",9,2,4,8 November 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," No need to be a fan of Captain America to enjoy an amazing action-packed ride
","Some of us aren't a fan of action movies especially the one that requires a deep level of knowledge about the main super hero or villain with an unfamiliar background for us to fully understand the concept. 'The Winter Soldier' might be an exception. It is a sequel that showcases the challenging life of defrosted Steve Rogers, aka Captain America in the modern world after 50 years of time skip. Based on the movie, I don't think it is mandatory to watch 'The First Avenger' to enjoy 'The Winter Soldier' as I am satisfied with the majority of contents despite not being able to vividly remember everything that happened in the first one. The fast-paced battle scenes that keep the audience's in awe along with feisty one-on-one and group combats that are highlighted by an eye-popping Captain's shield control, nifty movements of Black Widow and an array of high-end aircraft along with Falcon's acrobatic move take me by surprise.Of course, it would be wrong to judge the film solely on actions. Yes, this film does have a decent amount of storytelling and intriguing twists that explain the protagonist's past and villain's true colors. There are also nicely arranged humors with a bit of cliché. They pan out because they are used by the right cast in a timely fashion.Again, even if you are unfamiliar with the Marvel comics or the Captain America, no sweat and watch as this film succeeds in unleashing the greatness of Russo. brothers and it is the epitome of action movies.",10,1,2,10 April 2014
Life of Pi," The new Cast away
","The title of this review may seem offensive to some people, especially those who exceptionally enjoy the marvelous and emotional performance by Tom Hanks. As much as my affinity towards 'Cast away' still vividly remains in my memory after 12 years, I can honestly say 'Life of Pie', based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel is impressive in terms of both staging and acting.The plot is simply about a French-Indian boy, Pie, encounters a life-threatening shipwreck during immigration to Canada with his family and a herd of Family-run Zoo animals caged in the Japanese cargo ship to start a new life. However, the main story focuses on Pie and the tiger, aka Richard Parker, trying to survive after being stranded in middle of the ocean. The two who consider each other as enemies developing a heartwarming friendship by going through all sorts of conflicts with hand-to-mouth supplements on the rescue boat is what makes this movie adventurous and distinguished. The Visual effects consists of computer generated animals that interact with people. The magnificent underwater scene amuses me with a detailed presentation along with a giant wave where tremendous storm devours the ship. The most amazing part of the movie is to be able to witness the surreal CG tiger who steals the thunder of other animals using its fierce eye and charisma.On top of that, a young and novice actor, Suraj Sharma should get nominated for an Award for his incredible performance. Despite there are hardly anyone around him while shooting due to the large amount of CG used in the movie, he executes his role without being awkward. Endeavoring to engage with imaginary CG animals and trying to stay focused while being surrounded by the sea hazards must be as challenging as what Tom Hanks did in 'Cast away.' I can see a bright future ahead of him.Overall, this is an emotional and inspiring film for everyone who loves watching the nature and survival stories. One flaw of this movie would be a slow-paced storytelling. Things that transpire in the beginning is partially incoherent. However, that does not negate the fact that this is worth watching as it also contains a lot of hidden messages that are worth learning.",8,4,8,16 December 2012
Pacific Rim," Mega details transcend the expectations and comparisons
","I rarely write a review by solely narrowing down significant elements that make the movie so special and stand out. But, as 'Pacific Rim' which is subliminally forced to put in an unexpected competition for reviving childhood memories of those who grew up watching Godzilla or Transformer, when it is merely made to give us an entire new perspective about 'How to defeat Monsters if they really happen to attack earth.' So here it goes, it rocks harder than all the present monstrous movies because 1. There are detailed and logical explanations for the origin of the monsters that let you not only experience immersive and inconceivable scenes but comprehend the story without being perplexed by sloppy settings.2. Massive details on robots aka Jaegers unleashes the magnificence of their luster, mechanical textures, and operational systems that were created by stunning Visual effects and efforts of stunts.3. Again, there are tremendous details on monsters aka Kaiju that not only it looks realistic but possesses jagged skin with frightening body structure that can easily threatens even a giant 250-feet tall robot.4. The movements and actions during the battles are wonderfully depicted without shifting too fast which often results us in confusion for 'Who hits who? or How does it that happen?' You can vividly enjoy spectacular motions that occur in both city and ocean environments along with dynamic camera angles. 5. Every character play the role with vehement passions. I agree with some of the lines and expressions being quite shallow and cheesy. However, if compared to emotional relationships and conflicts between characters that this film offers, the acting part can be forgiven as no other counterparts have as much scientific explanations and a compelling story as this one. It is so mega from the intro to the end.",10,24,39,30 July 2013
American Sniper," A movie in which everyone can emotionally relate to
","A lot of times, a well-edited trailer with a bit of cliffhanger at the end entices you to watch the movie out of curiosity and often get the wool pulled over your eyes. Gladly, it has been a while since I have encountered a powerful war film that is based on a true story about the most lethal sniper who had over 160 kills under his belt in the Iraq War.The title really lives up to the hype and breaks down the cliché of standard war movies that are known to be showy and frantic as there are valuable perspectives and immense emotions you are able to embrace, sympathize, and get the most out of this film. Although, it does not deliberately cover the true color of the deceased sniper, Chris Kyle as well as the relentless and aggressive sides of American soldiers against innocent citizens, I believe the director's focus is on America's point of view, especially the context of military family.Despite 'American Sniper' not being impartial, this is a type of movie in which everyone from various countries with different cultural backgrounds can witness disparities in poverty, lifestyle, and humanity. If you are a peacenik, you will discover the necessities of war. If you are the member of military, you ought to experience the intensity and agony of your brethren whose devotion and patriotism are realistically depicted. And for a family member of the military, the priority conflicts between your family and the country will move you because it is a well-directed, well-staged, and well-acted film.",9,15,31,28 January 2015
Man of Steel," Awe'S'ome
","Coming back from an advance screening while feeling energized with a huge number of audiences till midnight. I have come to a conclusion that it is very worth watching after a long queue as it transcends my expectation in many ways. The movie unleashes the potent side of Superman dynamically by capitalizing locations, origin of the protagonist, and the relationship with enemies. The highlight of the movie is undeniably the battle scenes. They are marvelously captured and well-performed by a group of the endeavored cast.Of course, great amount of efforts are contributed by fervent and conscientious Visual effects department that manage to depict the prowess of the man of steel. An impeccable camera angle is also a key to the success of the film that even makes exposition scenes look so connected and interesting. However, no matter what kind of movie you watch, there is always at least one weakness you discover on your eye. Most of them end up being personal, subjective and imperceptible. I personally spot that the power of villains is inconsistent and imbalanced as they miss a few opportunities of gaining a full control of the Superman by not exercising their authority in a timely fashion. As if the director fails to find a better way to bail significant characters out. Despite the aforementioned downsides, it is a must-see movie for all the fans out there who want to experience riding on the Superman's back to see different continents in at a break neck pace. As the story gets often deeply involved with science and internal conflicts around characters, paying an extra attention would help you comprehend and follow the story flow.",9,34,62,14 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," I just had good days of the future and the past
","I am impressed with every aspect of this film. The plot is interesting and easy to comprehend because of the well-crafted exposition along with fabulous visuals.What blows me away is the way the future and the past timely move back and forth without making me perplexed, which successfully emphasizes the title, 'Days of Future Past.' The circumstances and different styles of environments from the future and the past are well-connected. The endeavored efforts of mutants trying to turn over a new leaf to stave off sacrifices for the bright future is a sight to behold.You won't definitely regret watching it even if you are a die-hard fan of X-Men series. The intensifying story and feisty characters will raise your interest and spirit about the X-Men film series.",10,1,3,24 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," DreamWorks Animation surpasses the boundary of computer-animated films beyond the standard
","As a former animator who once used to be quite familiar with principles of animation, complex technical tools in 3D software, and the determination for what it takes to be a great digital artist just got awestruck by an awesome sequel, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' that was thoroughly created over the last 4 years. The Hiccup and Toothless aren't the only ones that grew up dramatically as the first sight of dazzling island of Berk amazes me in a neck-breaking pace. The pristine stream that rolls beneath the ragged hills filled with authentic houses where vikings and dragons frolic together look so real that I can not visualize the strenuous process of creating a beautiful scenery within a boundary of the computer animation. Every element is packed with details, such as wild environments, costumes, and uncanny textures on various shaped dragons. Not to mention the frosty dragon aka Alpha, that feels much gigantic and overwhelming than the Godzilla will never be forgotten.Moving on to the animation part. The grown-up hiccup and his gang showcases what they are capable of by maneuvering their dragons swiftly and sometimes, botching mischievously. The humorous part comes from Astrid, voiced by America Ferrera (Known for Ugly Betty) where she impersonates Hiccup's habits and articulation. It goes without saying that the amount of time and efforts spent for animators on acting in front of the mirror to scrutinize facial expressions is presented through my eyes. That applies to other scenes where Hiccup tries to persuade Drago and his dad, Stoick to steer clear of the war as well as the most emotional scene where an absent- minded Toothless awakening and getting reunited with Hiccup who almost turns his back on his partner because of an unintended attack of Toothless that ends Stoick's life. There are more to praise about in terms of the cast, character developments, and most importantly, the touching plot that moves so many audiences to tears. The newly developed animation and lighting softwares by DreamWorks that make this distinguished along with a lot of talented artists is what I am so proud of. This film has motivated me to re-challenge to join the team that produces spectacular and feisty animation like this one someday.",10,3,9,29 June 2014
Gone Girl," The epitome of how hard it is to tolerate the infidelity
","If someone recommends you to watch a two-hour and a half thriller movie about an ordinary guy seeking his missing wife in a suburb neighborhood, would you be interested in watching? Most audiences may question about greatness of the story, wife's motives or most likely, the level of acting. Yes, the acting goes through the roof as the entire audience were really into it throughout that length to find out whereabouts of the 'Gone Girl', Rosamund Pike who plays Amy, a famous author whose husband is Nick, played by Ben Affleck. As impressive as the guise of cast, the plot development also lives up to the hype by introducing main characters from the outset with deliberate flashbacks of how the relationship between Amy and Nick builds up. This is where a special aptitude of Rosamund for her acting is fully discovered as Amy begins to disclose Nick's wrongdoing from the past, which turns him into an audacious liar and cheater.A huge shutout to the director, David Finch who led the amazing cast and the talented film crew, especially the editing department for nailing on Amy's conniving scenes where she sets up all the uncanny incidents, such as the basement with full of shards of glass in order to frame his husband as well as a pretense of friendship with a nosy neighbor to retain sympathy from surrounding. The calm narrations of Rosamund Pike based on her inner emotions and diary effectively adds potent depth to several critical moments.To talk about other cast, Carrie Coon, who plays Nick's younger sister manages to be very natural at her role as she is in the limelight whenever she chastises her cheeky brother. Neil Patrick Harris shows off his elegance and professionalism, which proves why he is capable of playing all kinds of characters in various genres. There are a few goofs and overly-done sequences that can be spotted. However, they subliminally get overshadowed by Rosamund Pike's presence which unleashes an all-out prowess to pull the wool over everyone's eyes to keep her reputation as a famous author and the marital status. Ben Affleck also does his part by being a nifty two-faced man who is forced to feint his love to live off Amy's fame and fortune. What they do in the movie evidently make them either a psychopath or sociopath.And now, last but not least, I think this contains important lessons that a lot of couples can take cue from. When it comes to moving to a new place, it requires careful thoughts and researches in order not to regret because there is always a chance that it may exacerbate the relationship while making adjustments to changes. It would be essential to consider each other's situation and come to an agreement instead of solely sticking to one's advantage.",8,0,7,27 November 2014
Django Unchained," Recalling the history of racial segregation with an awesome cast
","Back in high school, I remember reading a book called 'Of Mice and Men,' written by a Novel Prize-winning author, John Steinbeck in English class. The story takes place in the great economic depression period where the majority of people were unable to meet the minimum standard of living. How can I relate this novel to 'Django Unchained?' Both show a cruel background of segregation that African American experienced as well as the history of prejudices and racism.The movie takes place in 2 years before Civil war transpires, 1885. So it might be hard for young generation to understand some of the articulations, but they are still comprehensive and well written. There are vibrant and nerve-wrecking battle scenes where you find a protagonist being on thin ice a lot. The music is well composed and used in a timely fashion.Django who is not afraid to show anything to appeal his bravery and arrogance towards enemies is top-notch. Jamie Foxx goes beyond his limit by suavely executing a role of such an uneducated slave. Christoph Waltz does his part by unleashing his prowess and people skill. His character, Dr. King Schultz is the one who does most of talking while also speaking fluent German. The way he connives shows that words can be sharper than the swords.Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Calvin Candie, a notorious owner of the 'Candyland' which is a luxurious house fraught with slaves who merely exist to serve him proves that he can harness any type of roles flawlessly. What a royal antagonist he is. Of course, they are not the only contributors that provide an excellence and realism to the movie. An amazing acting done by a group of cameos is what make this movie believable. From the emotion to the behavior, it sublimely evokes the surreal situation from the year 1885. As this movie contains a number of restricted languages and bloody actions, it might not be suitable for those who may easily feel offended or terrified. However, it ain't like any other movies that are just packed with full of meaningless fighting scenes. It is about recapturing and embracing remorseful history that may be still recurring somewhere in the world.",9,1,4,10 January 2013
Frozen," Disney is not Frozen, but melting its bud for a revival
","Anyone who grew up, including myself watching classic Disney movies in 80's - 90's may currently have a tendency to doubt about the recent 3D animated movies by thinking that any of them won't be as good as ones that have kept our precious childhood perennial in the golden age of 2D animations. Whether that is totally subjective or not, the fact is all these cost-effective and time-saving computer generated works are still being created by the same crews that admire the old classic Disney movies. And if not all, some of the new artists are the ones that have inherited Walt's will. The 'Frozen' is a great example for why Disney is continuously being recognized as one of the top animation companies in the world. After watching the film, it makes me realize that no companies compose better theme songs that harmonize both the characters and the plot than the Disney. A huge round of applause goes to Visual Effects department and animators for creating such a beautiful kingdom filled with pristine ice and feisty motions by capitalizing high-end technology. What takes me by surprise is how Disney is capable of making us giggle in a timely fashion with an eccentric and yet, a simple sense of humor. Especially the snowman, Olaf, almost steal everyone's thunder by being naturally dopey and naive. But, without the well-developed and emotional relationship between an unearthly beauty of the sorceress, Elsa, and a considerate and sympathetic sister, Anna, the movie would lose Disney's utmost strength which is the storytelling that magically imbues many. Go ahead and freeze yourself in the greatest winter adventure.",10,2,10,19 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man's amazing prowess is as solid as his webs
","Whether you have watched previous Spider-Man movies or not, there are tons of potential and spectacular elements where you won't be able to see in Marvel counterparts in this film.What easily makes me say such a bias statement? The director and the team know how to deliver fantastic and thrilling camera angles to showcase flexible, fast-paced, and detailed web techniques that Spider- Man used when going through oodles of hazardous obstacles to protect citizens in New York while naturally executing chores and roles as an ordinary guy. If that does not live up to your expectations, get ready to giggle at some of the jokes along with mischievous antics.The super-villain, the blue-neon bodied nerd, Electro, is an electrifying and unique character to be seen. Jamie Foxx does his part as an actor and villain for the first time. The one-on-one battle that involves elemental moves and scientific tactics is the highlight of the movie. Although the plot get vaguely wrapped around between Electro and the Oscorp, it is still interesting to watch the character development. So what takes 2 stars away from me? It would be the complicated bonds between a young couple, Peter and Gwen, who just can't make up their mind by being hesitant, especially in the middle of the movie. I mean, it is normal for any couples to experience erratic emotions, but the whole romance definitely can be succinct to intensify other aspects.Despite a number of downsides, I would still strongly recommend this to anyone who is itching to watch a different type of feisty film. Because no movies can offer such a sticky, nifty, and vigorous action like 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2.' Yes, it is as good as the first one, or like others say, it is better.",8,23,38,13 May 2014
Mama," Every moment counts
","Making a decision about whether to watch a horror movie or not takes a lot of thoughts compared to other genres. Mostly because the level of getting the fear is different on individuals. Some may find the Final Destination series scarier than the Seed of Chucky due to the common car accidents that they can relate to in real life. Or it could be the other way around if someone is hypochondriac enough to imagine a doll moving itself.The 'Mama' contains a plethora of exhilarating and nerve-wrecking moments that easily make audiences petrified for 108 minutes. There are extraordinary conflicts revolve around every character as the story carries to the cliffhanger. The acting isn't the best, but the chemistry among the cast works well, especially Megan and Isabelle who execute difficult roles of brainwashed nieces who are capable of bouncing off the wall as four-legged animals and going back to acting like innocent children whose favorite foods are moths and moldy cherries. A round of applause goes to Jessica Chastain whose memorable performance that requires a dramatic transformation to play the role of Annabel that evolves from an insolent girl with no interest in looking after girls into a caring and loving woman. And Mama, I don't want to go too far with her role because it will turn into a spoiler, but let me just say 'Bravo.'By looking at the critics and reviews so far, it does not seem highly positive as a few hardcore horror movie fans have given some crucial feedback about the realism, originality, and how the movie is kinda predictable. But despite those facts, I have never seen a movie that dissipates so much intensity and nervousness on the cusp and still manages to reach the climax. It is really worth watching it.",8,0,1,31 January 2013
Sinister," 3 packs: Simple, Sad, and Severe. This is an original horror movie.
","When it comes to scary movies, the themes are usually divided into categories of kidnapping, serial-murders by obnoxious and cruel antagonist,and a series of accidental scenes. Surprisingly, 'Sinister' has all of those and guides us into the epitome of the original horror film. What I love about this movie is it is easy to grasp the story as it consists of a few characters and less intricate mystery to be solved. I often find myself not understanding the concept due to complexity of the origin of the cause in which a large number of people get involved in incoherent flashback that go back and forth.The story starts with a reckless and fearless writer who is known for writing a suspense novel that cliché the title of New York times best-sellers move to the hunted house with his family in order to get references and ideas for his new novel. Impressively, every character execute their roles, especially Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance, a married couple with two children, show natural and vivacious emotion with a clear tone. The editing is neither overly done nor cluttered as I don't recall any disturbing moments. The intriguing part is how the director, Scott Derrickson tries to engage us using 8 mm film projector by showing how it can be used in both real and imaginative world. You will understand what I mean by watching the movie. There are a lot of positive aspects that I want to mention, but I would rather not write them and let you experience the same feeling that arouses chunks of curiosity about the freaky and mysterious creature. You will not regret your decision for choosing to watch 'Sinister' and be prepare to be petrified.",9,6,10,17 October 2012
Rio," A great example of why using references is effective and necessary
","Having known Blue Sky Studios since the Ice Age Series, I have anticipated that 'Rio', directed by Carlos Saldanha, native Brazilian who implements his childhood and real-life experiences while adopting lots of detailed references to bring non-stop squawking birds to life in order to convey an emotional and comical story would not disappoint me. The plot is simple and intriguing. It is about a domesticated and flightless macaw, Blu raised by Linda who found Blu in the middle of street after being left behind by smugglers tries to stop his species from getting extinguished by mating with the only female of his kind, Jewel while going through all sorts of obstacles. Oh and yes, we get to see a bird that can not fly. What amazes me is how computer-animated birds move around so naturally by flapping and chirping while behaving like a human being. A great work by voice acting cast. Everyone executes the role really well! For example, the notorious bird, Nizel voiced by Jemaine Clement truly sounded fearful. Of course, it wouldn't be there without the stringent and painstaking job done by talented artists who actually video-tape all types of birds doing various movements and examine them every detail frame by frame thoroughly.As a graphic artist, I know how challenging it can be to create a realistic and high-poly specimen due to its complexity of set-up for flexible controllers and a wide range of facial expressions. I really admire them for every element. The landscape of Rio de Janeiro (The second largest capital city in Brazil) is spectacular. It makes me feel like I am actually in the city. Fall in love with tropical trees lined up in front of shiny beach and not to mention the imposing statue of Cristo Redentor. All the colorful and magnificent visuals are a proof that computer software has transcended what it couldn't do a few years ago.The true advantage of Animation is creativity. You can literally do anything using your broad imagination, especially when it comes to a fighting scene. The birds vs monkey battle is one of the epic battles I have ever seen. While jolly and wild monkeys somehow pretends to be Kong Fu experts and tries to scratch and shear feathers, Birds fight back using their sharp beaks to knock them out. Have to give an extra credit to the music team. They deliver cheerful and harmonious Samba theme songs 'Hot Wings' and 'Real in Rio' that pump up the atmosphere of the wild city filled with a herd of birds twitching hips and flapping wings. As this movie unleash an internal conflict of Blu who chooses to leave his long-term friend/owner, Linda to his hometown with Jewel is indeed emotional. Like in any other children movies, happiness always follows after sadness as it seems like Zoologist, Dr.Barbosa and Linda, falls over heel in love with each other. And seeing an orphan boy standing between them in the end, we get a brief idea of Rio 2 that is coming in 2014. I can not wait for the next adventure.",10,0,0,23 November 2012
Les Misérables," An unnecessary long movie that could have been succinct
","In terms of genre, I am not a much of musical fan but enjoy a number of prominent films, such as 'The Sound of music', 'Chicago', and 'Mamma Mia!' that consist of a well-connected interwoven between a intriguing story and endeavored combination of dancing and singing by cast who sweat themselves to master painstaking moves with sore throats. That kind of element is what I always expect when it comes to a musical film. For 'Les Misérables,' I do appreciate its bold attempt for the live performance, which means every character in the movie sings without lip-sync. The entire sequences including narrations were carried with continuous singing and individual repertoire. Imagine how hard it must be for them to convert written scripts into composed lyrics? It is undeniably remarkable efforts. Just the efforts though, the result was rather dull and exaggerated. Sadly, while every cast shows a dynamic stage presence, they often wither periodically during the 158 minutes. One of the reasons is it is loaded with an excessive amount of solo performances that degrad a few crucial dialgoues. For example, when Policeman, Javert encounters an escaped prisoner, Jean whom he has not seen for 8 years looks rather comical as seriousness is taken away by an off-timing and over-performed stage. Another reason would be the length of an individual performance with obscure narrations. I want to condemn whoever is in charge of to showcase elongated scenes with constant close-up shots with no vibrant movements that make me yawn. It is just too repetitive to embrace the emotions and the messages in a positive way. With all the biased negative aspects though, I have to admit that the colorful and traditional art of costumes and environments for 19th-century in France is beautifully depicted. The make-up artist's forte to express different types of characters brighten up the casting choice, especially the wicked Thénardier couple. It is pity that the directing rust potential and hard works of the film crews. The conscientious editing and scripting is needed to neglect negative elementsOr perhaps, I am an impassive person who is preoccupied with a mind of vibrant action films and creativity with no tolerance. For this reason, even it does not hurt to see the amazingly talented presentation, I would not recommend this movie to those who aren't patient enough to endure a character-driven story that is made up of mere lyrics.",5,3,6,27 January 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Turning a foreign novel into a Hollywood film succeeds
","The trailer of Edge of Tomorrow, starring the well-known actor and the actress whose career is quite remote from a combat movie fiercely facing uncanny-looking enemies on muddy soil under a barrage of explosions looks indeed cliché and unoriginal to me. However, the fact is this screenplay is actually based on the military science fiction light novel, written by a Japanese author, Hiroshi Sakurazaka. And the movie takes me by surprise with a unique sense of humor and stunning visuals.Having said that, adapting a successful novel into a screenplay does not always guarantee the efficacy either. A careful observation and nifty editing skill to keep the originality is a must. Also, when it comes to foreign novels, compulsory changes need to be made so that a wide range of audiences can embrace the contents without misunderstanding. Surprisingly, the crew is able to not only westernize it well but also make the film effectively succinct. Emily Blunt's role as Rita Vrataski, the chief of the Special Forces pans out as her usual toughness and charismatic demeanor is shown professionally despite this being her first heroine as a warrior. Watching her wielding the gigantic Tomahawk is quite impressive. Tom Cruise as usual, stands out by playing the protagonist with various emotions. And the stage of becoming from a coward major with no battling experiences to a reckless and competent solider is neither over-the-top nor under-performed. One thing that disappoints me is not being able to see the details of the mimics, the robotic creatures that resemble octopus-looking aliens with a chain of metallic arms that slice or throw human forces out. It is hard to identify what they are really capable of due to the fast- paced battle scenes. But that really does not matter because the story keeps getting interesting as it moves forward. As this film contains a series of iteration, it may look confusing for some people. However, I can't not think of any other counterparts that explain the theory of the time loop better than this one. I also highly recommend everyone to check out the manga/comic book version of 'Edge of Tomorrow', which is called 'All You Need Is Kill.' There are no spoilers but fresh looks with a different style to enjoy.",8,1,3,26 July 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Lack of detail leads to two different opinions pronto
","As an avid fan of fantasy genre, I am fond of a fierce one-on-one combat, fighting neck and neck to the hilt. Not to mention the massive and fast-paced brawl that consists of jumbled armies scuffling with their spearheads leading the way. Thus I give this final film of the 'Hobbit' trilogy, seven out of ten for captivating and scrambling sequences. However, the score might get reversed by those who are very passionate and keen about Tolkien's LOTR and Hobbit because even I could tell that this movie seems rushed by subliminally negating and compressing all the important events and elements that could have emblazoned the wonderful trilogy that has potential to lure people to buy the Blu-ray of LOTR series in order to complete the whole adventure.It is truly a no-brainer since almost most contexts happen within a specific vicinity along with the duplicated CG armies in the widespread field. The highlight of the movie is surprisingly the emotional love tale between an elf and a dwarf which has its moment to make a lot of female audiences move. Sadly, the number of the characters seem redundant as only a few of them get a spotlight through ample cut scenes, which make them look somewhat underperformed.As the outset kicks off strong with pep and whooshes to the nicely crafted battle scenes that are capable of keeping the audience entertained from various immersive angles and feisty actions that happen on thin ice as both actors and CG creatures are in unison, everyone will find out why the title of this movie is indeed 'The Battle of the Five Armies,' Although, it is kind of hard to see how every soldier gets knocked out due to a constant camera moving left and right without enough close-ups. Other than that, it is worth watching in 3D and heed when it gets down to the wire.",7,1,3,4 January 2015
Prometheus," A sloppy Sci-Fi movie with stunning visual effects
","Who is truly responsible for human life on earth? Did our ancestors leave hidden messages that last over millennium for us somewhere in the universe? Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott who is famous for 'Alien', one of the most successful Sci-Fi movies that make him who he is now is a type of movie that has great potential to solve all those prolonged and mysterious questions we have been asking ourselves. However, as many of you already know this movie fails logically by ignoring basic science while there are some people who actually enjoy this movie regardless of a number of flaws. I am really surprised to see the gross of this movie compared to a lot of negative reviews. Like every other movie, the score does not matter but your eyes. Depends on how you view the movie, it can be good or bad. Anyway, I write down my thoughts that include biased opinions. Here are things that rarely make sense or should be revised more thoroughly.*Mass spoilers*1. The archaeological evidences such as murals found in a deep cave on Earth become vaguely irrelevant to their purpose of space travel. In a word, they are nothing but fillers to make the movie look like Sci- Fi as they don't try to adopt any of them during their investigation. 2. The part where they say human being was created by engineers who live in the remote areas of the universe without mentioning any detailed proofs or religions perplexed me. I know it can be controversial if preaching gets involved, but I think it is way better than having them say 'That is what We are going to find out.' 3. One of the main characters, David who gets introduced as a soulless robot with high IQ reveals sympathy and secret affection to a female protagonist, Elizabeth who loses her partner, Peter because of David's envy. Do they know what 'Soulless' means? I don't think so.4. Two geologists, Fifield and Millburn get lost despite having the most advanced tracking device that detects by bleeping and flashing in a wide range area from the entrance to the exit with the support of crews monitoring them in the vessel. They could have thought of the other way of getting lost like having their tracking device turned off by some unknown external interference. 5. When Elizabeth tries to return to the vessel with a mysterious head carrying in the regular zipper bag and mighty storm almost blew her away out of the sight part was one of the most shady scenes. I mean it takes place in 2094..could they have come up with more advanced way to keep such a precious thing? Like quickly sending it to the vessel through an electronic transferring system without having to actually carrying it with you like we do nowadays? Or at least she could have hooked the bag to her belt or something. Is it impossible to do that while being able to build the imposing spaceship equipped with highly advanced technology systems?6. The fact that trillion-dollar project paid by government in search of the origin of human life consists of the most well-built spaceship on Earth that carries less than hundred crews and a very few infantries..actually zero infantry with no powerful robots or machines except flame and razor guns exploring the place where no human have been looked so sloppy and unprepared. Again, it is 2094 for heave sake and all they brought in the spaceship that is big enough to overshadow a village were fancy Cafeteria, gyms, surgical and navigation room? And as there were hardly any battle scenes, I think putting some fighting scenes that involve robots confronting 7-foot-tall aliens would have at least left us some strong impressions. The entire sequence was just one-sided to overpowered Aliens. 7. Last but not least, Elizabeth being gestating by her infected partner, Peter which leads to giving a birth of baby Alien was quite clueless thing to solve. Because Peter becomes extremely pale and cruel-looking while getting his eye color changed into red, and somehow ends up generating a totally different-looking and long-headed creature that looks almost identical to the one that we are familiar with. What is the true relationship between them? Left us puzzled. Aside from all the aforementioned negative elements , my 3-stars comes from some pros of the movie. First, the realistic cyborg performance by Michael Fassbender who shows fantastic robotic expressions that nobody can imitate along with the mechanical movements. He is a robot in the movie after all.Second of all, visual effects is beyond the standard quality in terms of creatures and environments. By watching this movie, I can vividly and easily imagine what the future spaceships would really look like and how leather chairs and wooden desks are going be replaced by the glowing aluminum furniture. They sure know how to depict the futuristic design.Lastly, the ending. Overall, I am a bit disappointed in character development and the plot, but a distant whisper from Ridley Scott whirs through my ears and tells us that 'Prometheus 2' which recently got announced will come back in a much better shape in order to make it up for true Sci-Fi movie fans and the rest who are left with an ambiguous mystery.",3,3,5,28 December 2012
Monsters University," Monsters University pleasantly defines its title with a great story
","With Animation industries overproducing computer-animated films for either sequels or prequels, expectations from critiques and longtime cartoon lovers who grew up with classic Disney movies are pretty high. For this reason, It has been a while since I get to be surrounded by parents who like to bring their kids to let them enjoy bright and comical scenes. After coming to the theater with low excitement, not only does this movie exceed my expectation but it also proves that Pixar is not a sort of company that tries to take audience's wherewithal by making a mediocre prequel based on the reputation of an original one. As usual, Pixar consistently unleashes intriguing, unique, and appealing characters with flexible movements and simplified traits that attract a wide range of audiences. Especially when it comes to presenting different breeds of monsters with extraordinary looks and abilities, followed by an absolute storytelling skill that moves everyone's emotion. As the setting takes place in the old days before Mike and Sullivan get to work together in Monsters, inc., you get to find out how they meet and grow their friendship. The story consists of both internal and external conflicts that college students can unanimously relate to. Pixar does an amazing job on capitalizing as much college-related elements as possible to emphasize the importance of corroborations, personal identity, and working hard to achieve your goal. There are also tons of humors that make you laugh periodically. In a nutshell, this is a sincere and endeavored film that sends us various messages to help us progress in many different ways. I strongly recommend this to all the students out there who are struggling with their school life. It is such an inspirational movie and Pixar still rocks!",10,62,86,25 June 2013
Godzilla," Poor Godzilla
","Writing a negative review requires a wide range of perspectives and careful observations in order to avoid misunderstandings of an individual opinion as well as biases. This time, I have come straight here without going through a rough draft to let all of you know that one of the highly anticipated monster movies of the year has bummed me out. 1. The scientific explanations of reactors and the military strategies that include undersized troops towards Godzilla and winged creatures are all over the place as they are poorly edited and scripted along with repetitive helicopter scenes. The music is not in sync too.2. There are hardly any connections in terms of emotions and character developments other than the Joe and Sandra's separation scene. Due to the disheveled editing and the mediocre acting, not only is it hard to feel sympathies from main characters, but roles of a few characters also seem redundant. That is the main reason why Godzilla get constantly overshadowed for the first half of the film.3. The last but not least, the battle scenes. Despite experiencing a few dynamic shots of the well-modeled Godzilla with detailed textures that is vividly and realistically crafted by high-end software, it is still disappointing as I am not able to fully enjoy its gigantic presence. The fighting scenes aren't continuous, intense, and long enough due to the poor editing and excessive narration as well as bad camera angles that fail to capture everything that Godzilla has to show. Obviously, the movie is supposed to be about the origin of Godzilla so I should not expect an array of intense actions and explosions, but other than Godzilla's breathtaking flamethrower, the trailer gives you everything you need to see without making you bored. I was really expecting to be in awe and hear some applause from the audience, but instead I am flustered by woe after hearing yawning and cackling.",2,5,10,21 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," Do you want to experience exciting time travel? Watch this.
","Before I write this review, I want to apologize for being doubtful about this movie after watching the trailer thinking 'Oh this is another one of those movies where well-known cast boast their presence with stunning visual effects and abysmal plot.' when it is based on the novel that got numerous receptions and awards. The Cloud Atlas is about various people from different centuries experience incidents that simultaneously and magically get connected through a series of cut scenes. The most amazing thing about this movie is the way they edited to help us catch up the multidimensional scenes. Chronologically, it contains 6 different stories that take us from the remote South Pacific in 19th century to a further post-apocalyptic future, the importance of editing and various roles from multicultural characters is blatantly crucial. This movie can be considered as gambling because of a giant blockbuster cast, the complicated theme that often perplexes audiences. Fortunately, the directors and crews manage to nail it.The number of characters appear in the movie make me deeply think how challenging it must be for everyone to execute different roles to fit their assigned characters. The most memorable character for me is Sonmi-451 played by Doona Bae, the Korean actress whose native language is neither Spanish nor English which are used in this film. Sonmi-451 is basically a genetically engineered clone that is designed to forcefully serve at restaurant owned by the notorious organization called 'Papa song'(Gotta love the name!)in 2144 Seoul, South Korea.As much as I love imagining the future, being able to experience the futuristic environment that consists of majestic skyscrapers that are connected by the transparent bridges where spiffy hybrid cars zipping around is really impressive. One drawback is the lack of originality because it reminds me of 'Tron legacy' and the street of Midgar in Final Fantasy 7 in terms of looks and the fact that there are destitute citizens that include drug addicts, prostitutes, and bohemians who are under control of an autocrat. No movies motivate me to write this much. There are still many things I would like to add but I better end it here before this review puts you into sleep. And last but not least, please let me share a few tips to those who are planning to watch this. 1. Try to pay close attention to the very beginning of the movie. The more you concentrate in the beginning, the easier for you to understand the entire plot.2. Since each actor/actress in this movie is in charge of various roles, it will be difficult to figure it out everyone's identity. If you want to feel how much efforts they put in makeup, I suggest you to know the roles for each character ahead before watching it. The funny thing is even if you do, it will still be extremely hard to tell who they are. 3. This method might not work on others as there are different stories that often propel each other from time to time, try to grasp the flow of the movie by feeling instead of trying to scrutinizing each story by connecting them piece by piece. Enjoy the movie.",9,5,13,29 October 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Never judge the movie based on its trailer
","'Do not judge a book by its cover.' is often the common idiom that suits to possibly many underrated films out there, including 'Kingsman: The Secret Service.' There has not been any sacrament of myself planning to watch this movie because of a dull and cliché trailer that gives off an impression of the cheesy action movie with a ghost of hidden excitement. It definitely resembles to an obscure and mediocre Hollywood goof, solely based on the trailer.However, I ended up watching it after coincidentally getting involved into the plethora of great reviews and positive opinions about this film that have littered the media and my surrounding. And I am glad I did. Almost everything about this film stands out among a lot of its counterpart. The introductory starts strong off by unleashing bits and pieces of prowess and personality of the private organization, Kingsman in the most entertaining way. And as it carries on, things get more intense with more character development and a series of predicament that leads to the breathtaking climax after a great amount of well-written shenanigans that transpire in different places which makes the cast twice look cool and bona fide. Although, I wish the director had them articulate little slower or clearer to neutralize the accent to make it easier for others to comprehend. By watching a whole movie, each cut scene that I think of it as an underwhelming performance or over-the-top in the trailer surprisingly turns into an awesome sequence. It does not squander a minute to fully describe the protagonist who puts all of its energy into improving himself while fervently vying for the one and only Kingsman title with several others under the Kingman's unerring guidance as well as using all the skills he has obtained during the span to fight against the ominous and wicked pair that tries to get a grip on everyone in the world with manipulative SIN cards that can be inserted to mankind. There is no such thing as 'Too much' or 'Too little' in the name of Kingsman. The moderate amount of characters, dialogues, and battle scenes are timely introduced and shortly edited. And what every character says is critical and relevant to the plot and those words speaks for its identity. The same thing goes to the battle scene. It effectively capitalizes on a shaky and fast-paced camera technique as well as focusing on significant parts where nifty artifice and brutality are vividly depicted. The massive scrum of entire nation beating each other up has more depth to it because as the outset gradually builds up, the origin of the outbreak gets disclosed, thus gives you another reason to watch it.In a nutshell, the atmosphere of this film reminds me of the mitigated, but funnier version of 'Kill Bill' sequel where the meaning of death is quite redundant. Obviously, the level of blood spattering and cruelty is different, but sharing one similarity would be the main character focusing on its nemesis as the deadly number of enemies and unexpected twists ensue. What truly differentiates the 'Kingsman' in a good way from the 'Kill Bill' would be types of weapons with a variety of uncanny attributes and the level of humor in which most action genre can rarely utilize.",9,3,11,25 February 2015
