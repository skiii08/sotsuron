Gremlins," Can't Believe It Took Me This Long To Watch!
","A perfect mix of everything I love in movies! 80's, Christmas, Animals, and horror. Also Kate's story about her dad dressing up as Santa Claus and dying in the chimney was the most hilariously dark thing I have seen in a movie in a while.",8,0,1,3 January 2018
Train to Busan," Zombie Revival
","Train to Busan was a treat. A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.",8,174,194,1 August 2017
The Lost City of Z," Epic
","This movie was an Epic spanning the life of Percy Fawcett an intelligent, unwavering explorer from Great Britain from his early years to the end of his life with his 3 trips to 'The Amazonia'. The cinematography was truly amazing.The breath taking setting of the Amazon River and the jungle was a great canvas for James Gray and Darius Khondjo. It really did have some of the most memorable shots that I have ever seen.",7,1,2,7 August 2017
Snowden," Leaks
",Pretty decent movie. Somehow missed this one the last few years but figured I would give it a try when I saw it on HBO.It's interesting seeing Snowden's background. It was also really creepy to see the example of the technology that the NSA was using to spy on American's and those abroad. I had previously watched Citizenfour so I had known about the meeting in Hong Kong and about the leak of information.. However I will say he definitely was glamorized and made to look like the victim in this movie. It was made to be seen from his side.,6,1,3,5 February 2018
