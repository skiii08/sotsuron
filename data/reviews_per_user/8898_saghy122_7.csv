The Mask," It made me read the comics
","The Mask is a character you will never forget, and Jim Carrey was perfect for the role. It's simply one of the best movies based on comic books, I don't understand why did it get such a low score. It's also one of the best comedies of the 90s, you just can't go wrong with it.",8,8,8,2 May 2019
The Big Lebowski," You need to see the world through the Dude's eyes
","To enjoy this film you need to have a little bit of that hippie mentality. The people who doesn't get why this movie is great are the ones who lacks that. The Dude is a simple person with simple needs and he's just fine the way he is. His life is not about money, or chasing the american dream, to get a family, an expensive car, or to be that successful man in the suit. And it's all cool man. He has his own code of living. He should be a life coach imo, because he has nothing, but still has everything he needs. Especially that rug, that tied the room together...",10,3,5,11 May 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Best movie of the franchise
","I wish we could erase Disney's disgraceful new trilogy and replace it with spin-offs like this. Rogue One is a literal war drama and the prequel to Episode IV. It's more serious than ever, darker then ever and this should have been the direction for all current Star Wars projects. I was blown by how great it was. The actors were amazing, the story was thrilling, the visuals left me speechless. It's a joke that The Force Awakens is on a higher score than this. Rogue One is superior in every way.",9,15,20,13 May 2019
Terminator Salvation," Ridiculously Underrated
","I saw every Terminator movie and while Judgement Day is obviously number one, Salvation is a strong second on my list. Yes, I agree, Christian Bale as John Connor was a miscast. But the story, the acting, and everything else was so good, that I just didn't care. The movie is also very well done visually, I don't know what more people want. And I was actually glad, that Arnold himself wasn't in the movie. Don't get me wrong I like him a lot. But Terminator can be good without him, and this movie was the proof. The CGI Arnold T800 was actually scary, and that was all the Arnold this film needed. I'm sad that Cameron decided to ignore this masterpiece, and that so many people seem to hate it.",8,2,3,23 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Lovely, but full of plot holes.
","As others said, the time travel part just stinks. I still enjoyed it, I laughed on the jokes, there were moments where I nearly cried, and others that made me clap with all along the audience. But overall the who whole story is quite an illogical mess. There's the saying 'they bit more than they can chew'. This is exactly what happened, they tried to fill all their previous movies into one and it could actually work, if they just fixed the time travel part. But they didn't, and I left the theatre with full of unanswered questions. Too bad, because there were so many good ideas, emotions, and great acting.",6,17,40,26 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," How could critics give such a high score to this garbage? We can't trust reviews anymore.
","Dumb writing with full of plot holes. The moment when Leia started flying in outer space I was about to stand up and leave the cinema. And how could they not tell us who Snoke was? Where did he come from? Did the Emperor know about him? If he did why didn't he kill him (rule of two)? Who trained him? How did he become the 'supreme leader'? Puppet Yoda in 2017 was painful to watch, this is not the 70's anymore and not even Muppet Show. They even fixed him later with CGI in The Phantom Manace. Rey should have teamed up with Kylo so the next movie could have avoid to be a total disaster. Fin should have died a meaningful death, guess Diesney wants to sell his action figures for a longer time. Even the animation series are better than this movie.",1,3,5,24 December 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Brainless, stupid
","Sometimes I felt like I'm watching cutscenes from a first person shooter. Problem is, I played FPS games with better story. There are parts where I was like, 'wow, this is going to end up pretty bad very soon'. Well, John Wick seemed to ignore these signs, which makes him the world's dumbest assassin. He makes amateur mistakes without reason, he might do them on purpose, maybe he hates himself and he enjoys suffering subconciously. Or maybe the writers were simply terrible. After the hype train I expected the John Wick movies to be better than most vengeance films. Well, they are actually worse. It's killing, shooting, fighting all the way through, without any meaningful parts. If there's anything they are worth watching for are the visuals, which are absolutely stunning and very professionally made, sometimes comic book-like.",5,2,3,25 May 2019
