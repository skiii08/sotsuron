Raiders of the Lost Ark," Something Truly Special.
","The best adventure movie of all time and still looks great today, this one will be remembered for decades to come.",10,1,2,6 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Perfect conclusion to a great saga
","Although it's not perfect and probably the weakest of the trilogy, but by no means is it bad. This is an extremely enjoyable sequel which brings the arcs to a brilliant close. Highly recommend.",9,0,2,26 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," One of the superhero movies ever
","This movie is just straight fan service in my opinion, it's a fantastic payoff to the 11 years of the MCU. I think it's probably one of the best endings we could have gotten. But, there are many flaws, like the CGI. It has very good effects but it has way to much. About half of the movie is on a green screen. And I'm not exaggerating, it's definitely the most effects heavy movie in the MCU. That's just my opinion though. The acting is actually a lot better than I thought it would be and that sounds quite bad, but I was really impressed with some of the performances. Particularly from Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner. A lot more depth compared to previous movies. RDJ is great as usual but I still think his best performance is in Iron Man (2008), doesn't mean it's disappointing, just in my opinion is outshines by other strong performances. I think the length of the movie is actually good as it's never really boring or slow. I think it's probably the second best superhero movie this year, because I think Joker is amazing. But it's still a very good movie but if I was to be honest, probably a little over-hyped, I think it's because it's a fan service movie and I don't consider myself an 'MCU fanboy', but that view can very much change depending on the viewer. But yeh, really good.",8,2,4,16 October 2019
Joker," One of the greatest movies of all time
","I didn't think when I walked into that screening I would be experiencing one of the greatest movies of the 21st century so far. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. The cinematography is beautiful and Todd Phillips's direction is great as well. This movie will be remembered for years and is on par with the greats like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. It's definitely worth the watch. No movie is perfect, sure it has flaws, but they didn't bother me at all when watching, please don't miss this movie.",10,1,1,6 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great return for the franchise
","I thought this was a great return to form after the prequels which were rather disappointing, I think there are some very good things about the new upcoming trilogy, I think Kylo Ren is a very good villain as it's a change from Darth Vader and I think he written incredibly well. All together: very impressed",9,3,20,29 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best movies of all time
","Definitely the strongest of the original trilogy and a thrilling movie from start to finish. Everything about this movie is perfect and I actually can't think of any flaws, such a satisfying sequel to an excellent original.",10,0,0,26 October 2019
