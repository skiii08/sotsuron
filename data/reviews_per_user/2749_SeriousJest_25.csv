The King's Speech," Very well-done & entertaining for a film about a stuttering early 19th-century royal
","Even having dated a speech therapist for a while, I was not extremely excited about watching what I thought would be stuffy Oscar bait about an early-20th-century British royal stutterer. The film was a little stuffy, it was definitely (succesful) Oscar bait, and it was about a stammering duke and his petulant speech therapist (who was nowhere near as hot as the one I dated). However, it was extremely well-acted, well-written, well-filmedand just overall well-done. This movie will hold your attention and teach you some history you may not already know. It is very-much worth the 2 hours to watch, although the subject matter doesn't exactly make it a Must Seeunless you're a 20th-century-British-history buff.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",6,0,2,9 August 2013
Black Swan," Cast slams home another solid Aronofsky film about achievement at great personal cost
","Aronofsky's protagonists are often masters of their crafts who accomplish incredible feats at great cost (I wonder if he is projecting his own feelings into his movies). Accordingly, the success of his projects depend heavily on the performance of the lead. In this case, Portman is amazing. She loses herself in her role like her character, Nina, loses herself in hers. But what is often underrated in films like this is the importance of the supporting cast, because they, in essence, play reflections of the central character's personality, motivations, inspirations, and, ultimately, madness. Thus, Kunis is seductively enchanting as Nina's wild, dark, and sexual side. Cassel nails (no pun intended) Nina's insecurity and unrealistic self-expectations. Barbara Hershey drives home Nina's arrested development, but also her innocence and rational side. Winona Ryder convincingly embodies Nina's greatest aspirationsand simultaneously, her greatest fears.I am not much into ballet (although I appreciate the beauty and grace of those extraordinarily talented women), but this film certainly kept me interested, entertained, and on the edge of my seat. Everyone should see this movie at some point, as it is brilliant. However, it's probably a one-time view, unless you're a ballet enthusiast, or you need to watch it again to figure some things out.",8,1,2,29 January 2012
Changeling," Filmmaking Crosses Over Into Activism
","The film is set mostly in the 1920s, but the hokiness of some of its scenes (although, according to IMDb, 'Virtually every event depicted in the film appears as cited in legal documents, with dialog often taken verbatim from court transcripts') and its sappy score are straight out of the 1990s. However, all of that is overcome by tremendous acting performances, especially from Jolie (but not Eddie Alderson, who was not convincing as Sanford Clark), as well as by the incredible story, which is mostly true.I can't believe that this could happen to somebody. This is yet another frightening example of the dangers inherent in handing over unchecked power to any law enforcement organization. If we do not pay attention to history, we are doomed to repeat it.Additionally, this story reminds me of the value of today's technology and social media. While many complain about how much easier it is to invade someone's privacy, it is also a lot easier to expose corruption. Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Oscar Grant...these cases are not a new trend developing amongst police departments. This kind of rampant corruption and abuse of authority has existed for long before anyone can remember. But now we finally have the tools to expose them.And it's not just the police. As an attorney, I have personally stopped a mental health professional from wrongfully committing a person to a mental health institution over what basically amounted to a petty verbal argument between the doctor and the patient.Respect to Straczynski for getting this movie made. This is where filmmaking crosses over into activism. If someone just told you the facts of this case, you might struggle to fathom how this would play out in actuality...how many people would have to screw up, be complicit, or just flat out do nothing to perpetuate this evil...and just how many people would have to decide to do the right thing, even at risk to their own career, financial interests, or even personal safety, in order to unf*ck this mess. This movie very effectively portrays how this unfortunate situation could very plausibly go down...and while there are many more checks and balances today to help prevent some of the previous injustices from happening again, perhaps some who would previously dismiss all police corruption and mental health abuse as wild conspiracy theories might have their minds changed just a little bit by this film.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",7,0,0,31 March 2016
Requiem for a Dream," Hooks You from the Beginning
","This film will hook you from the beginning. Its creative camera work, beautiful score, interesting characters, entertaining dialogue, and powerful actors will mesmerize you. Your eyes will be glued to the screen as you await each next fix scene. By the time you realize that this movie is profound and emotionally draining, it will be too late. You'll be an Aronofsky junkie. By the end, you'll be very glad you saw it, and you'll wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen itbut you may not ever want to put yourself through it again. Masterfully done.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",8,0,1,30 September 2013
Sucker Punch," An intelligent film with a blockbuster feel
","It's important that you understand from the outset that this film is not about dragons, machine guns, katanas, mechs, demons, or zombie Nazis. Instead, it is first and foremost about a young woman's quest to return home from a terrible, cruel place, and overcoming terrible situations through will, introspection, and the power of the mind. This could have been a much darker movie, focusing on the insane asylum, and a bunch of crazy, disheveled, medicated chicks trying to escape...but Snyder and Shibuya found a much more imaginative and entertaining way to tell their story. As I said above, the movie isn't about dragons, machine guns, katanas, mechs, demons, or zombie Nazis...but if you can work those things into it, why wouldn't you? Why not infuse the flick with martial arts, bombs, a high-class-whorehouse theme, awesome special effects and camera work, and a cool soundtrack? Why not transform the girls into sexy, confident, dressed up ass-kickers?I can see how the brilliance of this film can be lost on some viewers. If you go in expecting a blockbuster action flick, you may focus more on the great audio/visual aesthetics, and not pay attention to the little nuances and references in the script that are so critical to really appreciating the movie's intelligence.I will concede, however, that the PG-13 rating, a few cliché lines, and the casting choices for the patients gave this movie an intended-for- teenage-girls feel at times. Also, character development is thin, except for Browning's character. According to IMDb, Amanda Seyfried, Emma Stone, and Angelina Jolie were attached to this movie at some point. Too bad they didn't end up in this movie, because I feel that those three would have added credibility, veteran experience, and individual character beyond their roles.Still, I was pretty impressed with Browning, who capably harnessed passion and non-verbal cues to convey the internal struggle that is so central to this film--I was completely captivated by her (and not just because she's extremely hot), but I didn't even realize until later that she didn't speak a line until about 20 minutes into the film, despite clearly being the centerpiece of all of those important, telling opening scenes. To that end, Gerard Plunkett was a very capable evil man of few words. Also, Scott Glenn was awesome in his David Carradine-like role of the Wise Man. The clear standout in this film, though, was Oscar Isaac. From low-budget, fast-talking hustler to ruthless, angry pimp, this guy was everything you could have wanted out of Blue Jones.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",8,3,5,2 April 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Instant Classic for Western aficionados
","This is a very solid film, with a compelling plot and solid cast, featuring two of the most notoriously ill-tempered actors in the business. Who will be the bigger jerk? Watch it and find out! Also, Foster brings the same leashed intensity that inspired Mark Wahlberg to give up some of his own pay in order to recruit Foster for Lone Survivor. Foster is one of my favorite supporting actors.You can enjoy this movie as a straightforward classic action Western, or you can delve deeper into the psychological underpinnings, which are spread throughout the movie and which culminate in an ending that can either anger you or inspire a subsequent deep discussion with others who have seen the film.For Western aficionados, this flick is an instant classic and Must See. For the rest of us, you could live with missing this one, but once you start watching it, you'll be hooked.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",6,0,0,6 November 2014
The Longest Yard," Not a good movie...but it's a football movie!
","Don't get it twisted. I'm not saying that this is a good movie. It's not especially creative, and the dialogue is mediocre. But it's a football movie, and I'm a sucker for football. I'm so happy football season is back. Go Giants! Go Hurricanes! Go Check Out My WebCam Newton (my fantasy team)! As far as I'm concerned, you have to try really hard to make an unwatchable football movie. Hell, even Little Giants held my attention.You'll get a few chuckles out of this one, but not many actual LOLs. More importantly, though, you'll see some cool football plays executed by Michael Irvin (who delivered a surprisingly-good acting performance), Nelly (who is actually an awesome athlete; I've seen him hang with pros in MTV Rock 'n Jock face-offs), Bill Goldberg, Terry Crews, Bill Romanowski, Steve Austin, and Brian Bosworth, with motivating background music, and ESPN 'Swami' Chris Berman commentating. Given the amount of sports personalities and notable actors in this movie, it was underwhelming, and it's nowhere near as good as The Waterboy. Still, if this movie's on, it will hold your attention. Go Mean Machine!",5,0,1,6 September 2012
Gravity," Well Done for What it is
","This film is about 2 things, as I see it: space-station missions and survival. I think the movie accomplished an interesting story in both respects. As to the latter, the film did a good job of establishing a desperate pace, in which: every second counts; there is little rest for the weary, and Murphy's Law is in full effect; and no one is going to save you but yourself, so you better nut up or shut upfor good. Space is a perfect setting for these themes, as the movie effectively conveyed the isolation of space, the importance of rigorous training so ingrained that certain actions become involuntary, and the sheer wonder of modern technology. These aspects of the film, along with its breathtaking scenery and its compelling acting (by the way, props to Bullock for her hard work on that rocking 49-year-old body!), almost make it a Must See; but overall, my reaction to a friend who tells me that he hasn't seen this flick will probably be more like 'It's worth it if you ever do, and see it in 3-D, if you can' than 'You really need to see that movie.'

Lone Survivor," Really Does These Heroes Justice
","When I was still on active duty in the Marine Corps, a situation involving a recon team, an isolated mountaintop, a targeted Afghani warlord, and a couple of innocent goatherders was posed to us as the perfect ethical dilemma. A room full of officers wrestled with the theoretical frying pan and fireself-preservation (or, more importantly, the safety of their Marines) vs. morality. I knew then that I had to read Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10. I was not disappointed. I couldn't put that book down, and I recommended it to anyone who would listen.I've said this before many times, and I'll say it again: I love sports and movies, but my heroes aren't athletes or actors. I was fortunate enough to serve this great Country alongside my heroes. When I heard that this movie was being made, I couldn't wait to see what a team of talented filmmakers dedicated to bringing proper glory to the brave men of Operation Red Wings could do with this amazing story.Again, I was not disappointed. As a pure action flick, this film is top-notch. But it's more than that. It's a glimpse at what some patriotic, determined men and women do for other Americans (and, more importantly, for each other), in far off lands, under uncomfortable conditions, for a mediocre paycheck and little recognition.It took some effort for me not to get choked up during this film. Afterwards, my girlfriend marveled, 'It's amazing how much the human body can take.' I agreed, and added, 'Even moreso, the human mind.' Make this the next film you watch, especially if you need to get motivated to do anything remotely tough.What would you do in the situation involving the goat herders? I always say that if the first time you consider an ethical scenario is the moment that you're facing it, you're much more likely to compromise your moral code.",9,1,8,12 January 2014
World War Z," Pitt's fast-zombie blockbuster was good, but a little underwhelming.
","Anybody that knows me knows that I love zombie moviesand my favorite type of zombie is the fast zombie. I also have a great deal of respect for Pitt as an actor. So this movie was all set up to be a big winner in my book. It wasn't badbut it was a bit underwhelming. Like I said, I like fast, adrenaline-charged zombies, as in 28 Days Later. But these zombies were too fast. They looked more like locusts. Also, this story is really about humanity's fight against the Zombie pandemic, rather than about one family's struggle to survive it, so I didn't feel very invested in the protagonist's survival. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but I just feel that I would enjoy the book more (although I haven't read it), because the story is more of a cerebral chess match or puzzle than the action blockbuster that the film's producers tried to create.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",6,1,5,25 June 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," Hoky, corny, and preachy at times, but worth watching for novelty and pop-culture value
","Despite this movie's significant hokiness, its many corny moments, and its not-so-subtle agenda regarding certain political issues (I don't like being preached to rather than reasoned with), the big-budget simulation of major world cities overtaken by different natural disasters and a deliciously-ironic moment involving border security make the film worth watching for its pop-culture value. Additionally, Gyllenhaal, Rossum, and Glenn Plummer bring charisma to their characters that transcends the script and makes you care about what happens to them a little more.For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",5,0,2,16 August 2013
Hotel Rwanda," Really Hits the Heart
","I put off seeing this film for the longest time because I knew it would strike a chordmake me angrykick me right in the heart. And it delivered.As a Marine who served in Iraq, I'd have no problem being deployed to stop atrocities like this, even if there's 'nothing in it' for the U.S., in terms of financial gain or resources. I'd like to think many Americans would feel the same way, as long as these policies were applied consistently.It makes me angry that these events happened. It saddens me that the West didn't do more earlier. Nick Nolte really nailed his monologue about how the West views Africans.I'm also impressed with Rusesabagina (as portrayed in this film, anyway I haven't researched how much of the story is true). I'd like to think that I could react with the courage and strategic intelligence that he displayed in such a crisis.Finally, no better actor could have been cast for this role than Cheadle. He brings such a fire to every one of his performances.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",8,1,1,10 November 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Perhaps the most boring spy flick I've ever watched
","It's not that the movie was poorly done. It was Oscar bait, so it had a solid cast, with plenty of opportunities for Oldman to deliver strong lines. The script was intelligent, the camera work was good, the scenery was done well, and a great deal of effort was obviously put into making this movie believable and accurate. But it was just...boring. I think this is the most boring spy flick I've ever watched. You really have to pay attention to appreciate the intricacies and twists in this film, and I really had trouble staying engaged. I actually fell asleep twice and had to restart from the last boring scene that I remembered. By the end, I didn't care who the mole was.﻿ Maybe this is yet another case in which the novel was much better.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",4,4,8,25 June 2013
The Way Back," Truly inspiring
","Throughout my life, I have constantly tested myself: martial arts; street fights; pledging Kappa Alpha Psi; earning my Eagle, Globe, and Anchor in the Marines; deploying to Iraq; Crossfit; Tough Mudder, Spartan Race, GoRuck Challengethe list goes on and onyet any time I even start thinking that I'm slightly a bad-ass, I am quickly humbled by something amazing that another human being has accomplished through sheer determination. This film's Plot Summary says it all.Whenever any life event gets so tough that I want to quit, I tell myself to just take one more stepyou can always take one more stepno one and nothing can make you quit but yourself. I'd like to think that I could survive what the subjects of this film did, but I'm not 100% sure. I'd fight to the last breath, but sometimes it's the right combination of attributes, skills, and luck that allow you to survive something like this. I am truly in awe of what those people survived.Hopefully, this film will inspire you, too. Hopefully, it will shame you out of using the words 'I can't' when you're really saying 'I'm quitting because this is too uncomfortable.' Hopefully, you will convince at least one friend to watch this movie, so that he or she can be inspired, too.This film also illustrates the power of community. All of your differences seem less important when you're put through the fire. You may still irritate each other and fight, but some of the strongest bonds are formed through the endurance of overwhelmingly-difficult situations together.This movie should also raise your appreciation for the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States. It highlights the extent of the damage that the Axis did to so many people during World War II.Finally, a bit about leadership: it is an inexact science, for which experience is invaluable. If you are an inexperienced leader, the best thing you can do to limit the mistakes that you will inevitably make is to learn from the mistakes of others. Read books by leaders you admire. There are some very important takeaways about leadership in this film. One of them is that sometimes you can be wrong, and your group may overrule you, but it doesn't mean that they don't trust you. Too often, leaders become too concerned with defending their decisions, rather than recognizing when they were wrong and learning from their own mistakes.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",8,0,1,8 October 2013
Capote," Oscar bait: Great performances, but I prefer In Cold Blood
","This film is Oscar bait. You may marvel at Hoffman's range in playing a high-pitched, effeminate, whiny, selfish prick who follows around a couple of murderers to lay the groundwork for the boom of tragedy porn culminating in the next century's Casey Anthony trial (for a keen take on that trial as a tragedy porn poster child–no pun intended–check out Episode 8 of The Newsroom). Undoubtedly, Hoffman played the hell out of the role. He masterfully presented a talented, visionary writer with a need to make his mark, perhaps driven by a need for redemption from his traumatic childhood, who encounters in these young killers the other ending of the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book for kids like himand who is fascinated, obsessed, and consumed by this Bizarro version of himself. Unfortunately, that's about as interesting as the story gets on the Capote side. I would have rather read that in a footnote than watched a whole movie about this man. If you want to see a good movie about the murderers themselves, including what drove them to commit the acts, and what followed, watch In Cold Blood, based on Capote's actual book. rather than a movie about the man's writing of a good book. There are a couple of very good scenes by the end, and Collins's performance is terrific, but again, they are all scenes that were also well done in In Cold Blood. I would rather have seen a remake of that than sit through this plodding trip on the meta bandwagon.",4,3,6,23 August 2012
Léon: The Professional," The action scenes aren't as good as I remembered them being 15+ years ago, but still a solid movie, and Natalie Portman was amazing
","This is one of those movies that isn't as good as you remember it being 15+ years ago. Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years. Therefore, I'd say that this flick is still worth the time to watch it if it's on, but it's no longer a must-see, now that we have True Grit.",6,3,8,11 February 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Acting is great, storyline is okay, film is too often hokey.
","As we discussed in Episode 23, Part 1, of the podcast (www.livemancave.com), we love the Spiderman character, and Garfield not only does him justice, but he also presents a unique and charismatic version of Peter Parker that is even more interesting than when he dons the mask. Emma Stone brings The Girlfriend Experience, making Gwen Stacy endearing in her own right, not just because of how much the hero cares for her. Martin Sheen and Sally Field not only make you care about Uncle Ben and Aunt May, but they show you aspects of Spiderman that Garfield can't by himself. Denis Leary really manages to walk that fine line between pompous jerk and loyal protector right into the viewer's heart. In short, the acting is phenomenal.Unfortunately, the storyline is nothing special, and the movie is too often unnecessarily hokey (Really? Is it that easy to break into a high-security lab with genetically unstable spiders?), which conflicts with the film's more gritty tone. This film feels more like a background setup for sequel, which I have yet to see, but which I'm hoping will take the franchise to the next level, like Captain America: The Winter Soldier did for its franchise.",6,0,4,12 April 2016
City of God," Watch this and then try to complain about your 'first-world problems.'
","I kept hearing that this movie was good, but I never got around to watching it. Having glanced at its cover before, I was expecting something differentmore of a sappy romantic tale. Instead, I discovered one of most poignant, suspenseful, exciting, and action-packed tales of a place that I've only heard stories about. It catapulted me through a wide range of emotions. Watch this and then try to complain about your 'first-world problems.' The City of God is shockingly poor and frighteningly dangerous, yet culturally rich and unexpectedly beautiful.Meirelles and Lund manage to convey a stark realism through a cast made up largely of actors from Rio favelas who had never acted before, but who stepped up to the task in an amazing way with some intense coaching. The film even features some takes which were not scripted, as well as real coverage from true events. The music masterfully complemented the mood of each scene, while staying true to the beauty of Brazil. The camera work was top-notch (especially for 2002), both in César Charlone's skillful employment of the equipment and in the scenery that he captured. Daniel Rezende, the film editor, presented Charlone's vision at a wonderful intersection of deliberate and thrilling, ensuring that the viewer's attention stayed captive throughout.This flick is so good, I wanted to watch it again immediately after the credits rolled the first time around. You will be hooked from the moment the chicken starts running for its life. Make this film the next one you watch.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",10,0,1,2 July 2014
Garden State," Braff delivers the Jersey experience without being too Jersey-centric; Portman delivers the Girlfriend Experience
","This film is about Braff's character, Large, but it is a reflection of Portman's character, Sam. Sam is beautiful, unique, witty, funny, and fun. She is also quirky, talks a mile a minute, and wears her flaws like a fur coatLarge can't figure out whether she is openly insecure or incredibly self-confident. But he is overwhelmed by howalive she is. She excites himand she excites the viewer. Portman really brought the Girlfriend Experience (look it up at livemancave.wordpress.com) in this flick, and it really strikes a chord with me, because Sam's aforementioned characteristics are what attracted me so strongly to my current girlfriend.As I said, though, this movie is about Large. He is perpetually numb, floating through life without a defined purpose, and he doesn't even understand what happiness is. He is in a profession and in a city that reward superficiality, self-centeredness over community, and wearing a metaphorical war mask to cover one's vulnerable emotions. His sudden trip home reminds him that you don't have to make a ton of money or be in an exotic place to find happinessthe happiest moments come unexpectedly when you're in great company. Happiness lies in self acceptance and appreciating the presentmaking the most of who and where you are, and who you are with, right now. I believe that most of us have learned or re-learned this lesson the hard way, or have yet to learn the lessonthat's why I believe that most of you will relate to this film, even if you don't necessarily relate to Large.As I also said earlier, this movie is a reflection of Sam. Like her, it is unique, witty, funny, and funyou often wish you could step through the TV screen and hang out with some of these strange-but-interesting people, even if you don't do drugs (and I don't). It is also quirky, dark, and deep. Living in the moment is a constant theme of this film, as it puts a microscope on 4 days that potentially changed a young man's life. Taking control of your life is another theme, as it cautions the viewer about how something as seemingly-trivial as a quarter-inch piece of plastic can determine the majority of your life, if you let it.While the movie is titled 'Garden State,' and it is filmed in New Jersey, it doesn't feature landmarks or many aspects that are uniquely Jersey (according to IMDb, the site of the swimming pool scene was chosen for its view of the Manhattan skyline, but fog on the day of filming obscured the view). Having grown up in Jersey, I would have liked to have seen the Garden State Parkway or Turnpike featured at least once, but I guess the flick as is makes it more relatable to people from other states. This movie is not necessarily about coming home to Jersey, it's about coming home.Honestly, though, I've always said this to people: what makes New Jersey a great place to live is not landmarks, a grand list of things to do, or a good tax situation; instead, it is the people. For the most part, the people are genuine. They speak their mind, and although they may have a rough exterior, loyalty is a common trait; they can rag on their friends mercilessly, but don't you dare or you might find yourself in a fistfight. I felt that this flick did a good job of representing that.And the movie's director seemed to really understand that, as, also according to IMDb, the film was based partly on Braff's own childhood in New Jersey (he attended Columbia High School in Maplewood), as well as his days as a struggling actor in Los Angeles before the success of Scrubs. He also hand-picked the songs for the soundtrack. In effect, Braff kind of bared his soul to the world through this flick, and I think that if you like him or Portman, you should set aside time to watch it at some point. My respect for Braff has definitely increased after seeing it (and I already liked him as a comedic actor before).For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",7,0,0,22 August 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," This dark thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat, but beware, it doesn't pull any punches!
","I had the benefit of watching this film without knowing what it was about, so I won't tip you off beyond the synopsis above...but I will strongly recommend that you see this movie at some point. Some parts of the film are just pretty good and interesting...the rest of the film is downright awesome. Beware, it doesn't pull many punches, and can be pretty brutal; but you will probably be on the edge of your seat throughout, in a good way. Rapace very competently portrayed the weird, strong anti-heroine, which was key because so much of this film relies on what's going on behind her steely, expressionless gaze...her performance lives in the eyes...she really should've shaved those pits, though...seeing her hairy underarms was one of the most disturbing parts of the movie for me. Still, this is one of the best girl-power films I've ever watched. I'm putting on my Susan B. Anthony button as I type this. I'm going to have to set some time aside in the future and watch the American version so I can see what it did differently...but I'm going to need a while to recover from the little bits of innocence that died inside me during this film.",8,0,2,20 January 2012
Once Upon a Time in America," A solid gangster flick, but I hated the main character
","This is a high-quality gangster flick, with a good story, interesting characters, and an outstanding cast. It was cool to see Jennifer Connelly shine so brightly, even at a young age, and in her first feature film role. The makeup artists were also impressive. In aging De Niro 30 years, they made him look pretty similar to his appearance now, almost 30 years later! The movie was extremely long, but there weren't many boring moments. While I initially thought that more of the film should have been cut, I later learned from its IMDb trivia page that:(1) Leone was contracted to deliver a 2-hours-and-45-minutes-long movie.(2) Upon completion of filming, the movie ran 8-10 hours.(3) Leone and editor Nino Baragli originally cut it down to 6 hours, and planned to release two 3-hour films.(4) The producers forced Leone to cut it down to 3 hours and 49 minutes, leaving 45 minutes that he considered essential on the cutting room floor, including: further explanation of the mob/labor relationship, Noodles (De Niro) meeting Carol (Weld) in 1968, and a good deal of footage featuring Noodles's relationship with Eve (Fluegel).(5) The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in its original running time of 3 hours and 49 minutes.(6) The Ladd Company heavily edited the American release, against Leone's wishes, down to 2 hours and 24 minutes. This version scrapped the flashback structure Leone used, and instead arranged all the scenes in chronological order. Most of the major cuts were in the childhood scenes, making the 1933 scenes the most prominent part of the movie. The conclusion was also altered.(7) A few days before the film's premier in 1984, Williams found out the 2-hour version would be shown in theaters. He was heard to have said that no one would understand the movie in the shortened version.(8) The 2-hour version flopped in the U.S., and many American critics, who knew of Leone's original cut, attacked the short version viciously; some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas (some of which run over 5 hours), saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. The movie was shut out of the Oscars, with no nominations.(9) When the 3-hour-and-49-minute version was released on video and DVD, the film ultimately found commercial and critical success.(10) According to Woods, a critic dubbed the movie's 2-hour theatrical version the worst of 1984; years later that same critic watched the 3- hour-and-49-minute version and called it the best of the 1980s.Based on the foregoing, I believe the studio should have let Leone put out two 3-hour films, or at least it should have added the additional 45 minutes that Leone wanted (and then split the movie into two). The script contains many complex relationships and sub-plots, which developed over the course of half of a century, naturally begging an unreasonably long run timeÂ…even after 4 hours, some significant relationships, characters, and sub-plots still needed more development. At first, I thought that maybe the answer would have been to eliminate those complexities altogether, instead of partly depicting them, but the widespread disdain of the 2-hour version suggests that the movie is much worse without them. Therefore, I think that the best answer would have been to embrace the complexity and give Leone the time that he needed to best develop this film.I also would have liked to see the film explore more of the differences between Jewish and Italian mobsters. Other than a few camera shots of Jewish food, Yiddish expressions, the Star of David, and Hasidic Jews walking around New York, these characters could have been written as Italian, with no difference.This movie is an 8 in pure quality, and I respect its 'it is what it is' depiction of its protagonists, but I found De Niro's character so morally despicable that I had some trouble staying engaged. I was also a bit disappointed to learn of several historical inaccuracies in this film, according to its goofs page on IMDb.",6,5,10,6 February 2012
Zombieland," One of the best 'fast zombie' & Harrelson flicks I've seen
","I love zombie movies...especially 'fast zombie' movies. I also love Harrelson. This flick is one of the best of both of those categories.Be forewarned: this movie is sometimes silly and a bit of a farce. It won't go out of its way to explain the intricacies of how the zombie apocalypse began, beyond a quick one-liner. There are also a few 'yeah right' moments. You might find yourself thinking that, with a little more thought, this film could have been even more awesome.But, in the end, none of that matters...at least not for our purposes. This film is awesome for its entertainment value, rather than for an accurate depiction of how people would react in a zombie apocalypse. If you want to see more of the latter, check out The Walking Dead. However, if you want to see a great cast kick some zombie ass in creative ways and throw hilarious quips at each other, along with some cool camera shots, an original use of Rules for surviving the zombie apocalypse, and a theatrical-money-shot ending, buy--don't just rent-- this movie...you're going to watch it multiple times.",9,0,2,19 June 2012
Inception," A carefully constructed maze...genius.
","Not since The Matrix has a blockbuster blown audiences' minds like this film. The plot, storyline, dialogue, cast, special effects, score/soundtrack, and cinematography are nothing short of amazing. This is the movie in which Gordon-Levitt went from promising young actor to bona fide star; his spinning hallway fight scene was truly awesome, and he did it himself (not a stuntman). Page went from cute and clever girl to confident, intelligent, and sexy young lady. DiCaprio was truly outstanding, as usual. Tom Hardy was smooth, precise, and imposinghe could be the next Bond; can't wait to see him play Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Watanabe exuded confidence as a corporate general who practiced the art of war by a strict code of discipline and honor. Cillian Murphy convincingly wore years of rejection from his father on his face. And Marion Cotillard was a passionate, desperate, angry, scary, vulnerable, loving, confused, helpless, and pretty human wraith all at the same time. Well done.I rated it a Theater movie because I went to see it in the theater twice. It's poetic that the recurring theme throughout this movie is mazes & puzzlesand this movie is one big puzzle itselfit's a puzzle that the characters must navigate, but also one that the viewer must solve in order to fully understand. After watching the film once, I was dumbfounded by what I had just seenit was so creative, so different, so complex, that I wasn't sure if it all made sense, but I loved the ride. The second time through, I tried to solve the puzzle, but it seemed as if some pieces still weren't fitting right. At that point, it seemed to me that Nolan simply had not closed some loops. I started to feel that maybe Matt Stone and Trey Parker were right when they created that South Park episode suggesting that this movie was not as smart as it pretended to beI thought that maybe the extremely intelligent puzzle posed by the film was really just a paradox, like Penrose stairs, created to distract the viewers for a finite amount of time while the producers took their money and left them dazzled by great special effects and an all-star cast (sound familiar?). But, like many a good puzzle, you walk away from it for a while, come back to it, and the answer you were looking for was right there, in plain sight. By the third time I watched this movie, I was satisfied that Nolan had not cut across the lines to solve his own carefully constructed mazeno, this maze was a masterpieceone of my favorite all-time movies ever.",10,1,16,20 November 2011
The Purge," A pop culture icon, despite its shortcomings
","From a strictly artistic standpoint, this is not a great movie. Some of the scenes are hokey, and the character development lacks enough depth to inspire your investment in the protagonists. However, its plot is pretty unique, the socioeconomic conversations it inspires could go on for days, and, frankly, it's a pop culture icon (as we discussed in Episode 19 of the podcast, and as further detailed in IMDb's The Purge trivia page, this film has inspired a few major horror maze/experience productions). Hawke manages to transcend the script with his usual intensity, and it's pretty different to see Headey in such a morally upright and vulnerable role.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",7,0,2,4 July 2016
A Walk to Remember," Mandy Moore shines, but the scripted dialogue doesn't do the story/plot justice.
","I know, I know, this movie doesn't even belong anywhere near the ManCave page...but I have OCD, and it forced me to watch it...you don't even want to know the insane details. Anyway, the film was just as corny as I thought it would be, but I was expecting it, so I wasn't too horrified. Luckily, I watched it on my laptop while Jeremy Lin was dropping 38 on the Lakers on the big-screen TV.Actually, the plot and story were pretty good...but they were ruined by cheesy dialogue, over-acting, and a few musical numbers that only a teenage girl could love. While I didn't enjoy the songs, I have to admit that Moore is very talented. If anything, this movie served to showcase how good of an actress she is, as she managed to deliver weakly-written lines with a natural, confident demeanor that captured my attention and made me forget a few times that this movie sucked...but then one of the other cast members would ham it up and I'd remember again very quickly. Coyote also did a decent job with the lines he was given. Hannah's part was bland, and she didn't stand out much at all. And, oh yeah, I guess they were still doing the token Black guy thing in 2002--Al Thompson had on his best tap shoes.One more thing: I forgot how ridiculous portable CD players looked, until I saw West's character wearing one around his shoulder like a purse. Thank God for the digital audio player.More reviews & a kickazz podcast at www.livemancave.com!",4,0,1,11 February 2012
