Requiem for a Dream," Rat Tat Tat
","The genius of this movie is that he didn't come at you right away.  The gimmick-laden camerawork is something to marvel at, yes, as is the nails-on-chalkboard score by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, but the real beauty of 'Requiem For A Dream' is the pacing.  Many people had commented to me before I saw this film that it would easily usurp movies like 'Trainspotting' and 'Leaving Las Vegas' as the ultimate commentary on addiction.  That it would rock me and that it'd stay with me, that I'd feel sick and re-invigorated at the same time after viewing.  I was more than willing to believe them going into the theatre, but for the first half-hour, a little voice in the back of my head whispered,
'Where is it?'The first act consists of nothing remarkably vicious.  We are introduced to the four principles, we get to know their drugs, their inter-relationships, etc.  We see blink-and-you'll-miss-it cuts one on top of the other, which do, to some degree, warp your mind a little, but nothing on the level of a 'Midnight Express' moment. Aronofsky is obviously a fan and a student of good movies.  He knows the rules, and is smart to not indulge himself by breaking them when he makes his own movies.  It would be easy to attack an audience with ideas, but in this, only his second feature, he really only lets the characters' actions be the attack *until* the last fifteen minutes, when he puts down his restraint and declares absolute war.At times, the last act of 'Requiem for a Dream' feels like the cinematic equivalent of a tommy gun, blasting you down before you have a chance to get up.  Seeing it, it often resembles the film montage showed during Alex's rehabilitation in 'A Clockwork Orange'.  Colorful, compelling, and original, the entire film as a whole will stay with you for a very, very long time, even if you don't think so for the first half-hour.  The director unleashes an assault on your opinions about addiction and may very well make you question the very fabric of your own sanity the next time you pick up a cigarette or cup of coffee.

Léon: The Professional," Got Milk?
","In 'Léon', the title character (who is a professional 'cleaner', or hitman) wears his trademark beanie hat and small circular sunglasses whenever on the job to hide his immediate identity:  he goes to necessary lengths not to be recognized.  In a way, the adornment of this combo is the dividing point between himself and his work.  Léon needs that.  A clear barrier to seperate the two sides of his life.  And when he's working, no one is better.  In the first action sequence, director Luc Besson shows us the full set piece of how our hero behaves during office hours: methodical, precise, deadly.  He moves like Batman, somehow navigating through the building unseen and well enough to off all the bad guys without even breaking a sweat.  It's Besson's exclamation point saying, 'This is how good he can be!'.In the aftermath, when the hat and the glasses are taken off, Léon becomes the average Joe.  Walking along the streets of modern New York with a Chaplin waddle, he leads a lonely but simple existence:  water his plant, do his situps, and drink his milk.  He doesn't need anything else.  The plant is his companion, the situps his release, the milk his indulgence.  This Order Of Things shows a childlike contentment.  As long as he does things right, he's not a bad person.Meanwhile, down three doors lives Mathilda (young young young Natalie Portman), the waifish daughter of a drug middleman.  With a bully sister, a prostitute step-mother, an abusive father, and a cheery little brother whom she looks after, she, save for her brother, has little to look forward to. When a crooked D.E.A. officer (Gary Oldman - more electric in this movie than he's ever been) slaughters her family over a drug dispute while she's at the store, she has no choice but to intrude on the life of the Man At The End Of The Hall, Léon.  It means her life.Extremely relunctant, he eventually agrees to take Mathilda under his wing and train her to 'clean'.  Their relationship quickly blossoms like a giant magnolia, with him providing shelter, and her providing a little life in his life.Mixing his French influences with New York sensibility, Luc Besson OUTDOES himself.  The entire film foreshadows something else, and the incredibly well-scripted emotional growth shown by the two main characters is all the greater foreshadow to how much the wonderfully unwired Gary Oldman character needs to be punished for his madness.  This movie flawlessly blends the best of both worlds:  it is at once both a movie guys would love and a movie girls would love.  It's the unisex action film.Among the ten best films of the 1990s, definitely Luc Besson's best movie, and dare I say, one of the best love stories ever made.Five stars.",Null,0,1,5 July 2000
Good Will Hunting," The Real Best Picture of 1997
","While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was:  a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood.  Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsgård, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching.",Null,143,178,18 June 2000
Mulholland Drive," 'And Getting Stranger ...'
","David Lynch's predilection for elusive storytelling still has the potential to be mighty frustrating, but ten years after Twin Peaks, it may be wise just to sit back and enjoy the ride.  Adhering to the same sort of non-linear script structure he has all but trademarked, Lynch spends two hours and twenty-six minutes unraveling Mulholland Drive, a dense film that is mostly a brilliant noir, with various bits of meaningless bulls*** peppered throughout.  All of it, though, is frequently nothing short of enthralling, with Lynch's pure ability as an interesting filmmaker taking precedence over virtually everything else.  Normally with a mystery, it's difficult to go into detail about the plotline for fear of giving things away.  In Mulholland Drive's case however, it seems the only way to even relate the most basic events of the story is to describe them as a conjunction of scenes starring Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring, and Justin Theroux that only make sense upon hindsight.  It is a dazzling, self-assured jigsaw puzzle of a movie, a continual mindbender that appears to take great satisfaction in its own slithering ambiguity, confident of where it's eventually going.  Much has been made of how Mulholland Drive was salvaged from the ashes of an aborted ABC television pilot and restructured into a feature.  Obviously, David Lynch had planned to stay with these characters and situations for a while longer than he eventually did, it's fascinating how it achieves the sort of slow-creep plot twist that is best suited for the long-term medium of T.V.  In the end, it can be assumed that the writer/director has accomplished in a few hours what he was going to try to accomplish in multiple years of episodes.  Demanding and rewarding, Mulholland Drive is sure to be one of the best films of 2001.",Null,0,0,24 October 2001
Mulholland Drive," The Best Movie of the Year
","What is a film's responsibility if not to make us feel something?  Whether we laugh, cry, or get angry, movies are the inert roller coasters of our cultures, functioning best when hearts begin to beat faster, for whatever reason.  After having made an extremely opaque film in 1997 ('Lost Highway'), only to be followed by an extremely simple film in 1999 ('The Straight Story'), David Lynch returns in 2001, happy balance in hand, with 'Mulholland Drive', a film that manages to play to every one of his strengths, again and again and again.  At once both a scathing expose and a gushing love letter to the machine of Hollywood, Lynch unfurls a dark, choppy ocean of contempt, lust, fame, and hope with the precision of a brilliant magician, withholding his hand until the viewer is ready to find it.  There are concrete, logical explanations to be found in all of the fog and mist, but unlike the other L.A.-set noir of 2001 ('Memento'), the pay-off isn't in the twist ending, but rather in the body of the film itself.  This is a two-hour plus Thanksgiving dinner for film fans, full of the sort of rich, sensual imagery that only the medium of film can offer. In the hazy walls of the movie, it may not be absolutely clear at all times who is who and what is what, but what is clear with 'Mulholland Drive' is that in a year's worth of new releases, it extracts emotions from its audience so strong, there can be no question as to which performs it's basic task with the greatest aptitude.  Hilltop, Lynch's magnum opus succeeds on every cinematic level, meeting all the necessary hallmarks to qualify as the best movie of the year.",Null,0,0,3 December 2001
Annie Hall," Definitely Not Ostentacious To Call It The Best
","Woody Allen's odd structuring of his first serious comedy-- subtitles, animation, fourth-wall devesation, proved that even at his most traditional, the heart of a neurotic rebel still shines through.Many have called this the seminal romantic comedy of the 100+ year history of movies.  Blending old and new archetypes, it insists on never exhibiting a dull moment in the relationship of Alvy and Annie, always leaning towards quirky sequences and Vaudeville-like setups to deliver the entertainment over traditional plot arcs.  The fact that 'Annie Hall' used an original framing device of a murder mystery allows the movie to get away with a great deal.  Plus, it helps that it beat out 'Star Wars' to win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards in 1977.  If you're reading these comments as a means of recommendation, please do know that from a very conservative filmgoer's POV, 'Annie Hall' is the real thing:  it won't waste your time.  It's funny, touching, heartfelt, and wonderfully executed.  Woody Allen at his most Woody Allen, it stands in the top 10 funniest movies ever made and in the pantheon of Great Films.'Maybe a snow shovel?'HA!****",Null,1,2,9 January 2001
