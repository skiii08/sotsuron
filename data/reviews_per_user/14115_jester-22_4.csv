Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Once again, the critics are wrong (This movie rocks!).
","This movie satisfies completely.  I stood in line for a whole day to get 12:01 AM tickets.It was one of the best choices I ever made.I wasn't too worried from the early reviews I had read.  I have observed over the last few years that the only type of movie that critics like are boring, overlong costume-dramas.  When was the last time a comedy got a good review?  In the end, the public is the only critic that matters.This movie was pure Star Wars right from the beginning.  The movie begins with fifteen minutes of pure action, pure Star Wars, pure Lucas.  This movie proves that you don't need lots of sex, profanity and gratitous violence to please audiences these days.  This movie is a simple (but not dumb), good-versus-evil (no grey-areas), adventure movie.  The audience was VERY into this movie, and when the end credits started rolling, the audience roared a long, satisfied cheer.Never mind that some critics complain that it wasn't 'deep' enough, this is a kids movie (that everyone will enjoy), this is not a critic's movie. Some people also complain that 'The Force' wasn't explained enough in the movie, don't worry, your worries will be laid to rest in Episodes II and III.So, will this movie make more money than 'Titanic'?Let's hope so.It would be refreshing to see a simple, fun, moral adventure flick beat the overly-long, overrated, bloated sex-drama that is Titanic.Let's sum up this review.  Stop what you are doing, go see The Phantom Menace right now!  I am going to see this movie at least five more times, now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get in line for my second viewing of this great, great movie.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Dumb and Dumber," One of the best comedies ever made!
","This movie is destined to become a comedy classic.  Even though it has been out for a few years now, my friends and I still regard it as one of our favorites.  One good thing about this movie is that it never gets boring; I own the video and I still laugh every time I watch it (which is quite often) .This movie has no serious parts, no cheesy romantic moments or attempts to draw tears.  This is a straight in-your-face silly comedy that starts on the jokes at the beginning and doesn't stop till the very end.  You will have to watch this movie more than once because you will be laughing so hard that you will miss some of the more subtle jokes.Rent this movie!",Null,0,2,20 January 1999
Titanic," CHICK-FLICK ALERT!!!
","For those of you unfamiliar with the term chick-flick.  A chick-flick is one of those movies that appeals to bored housewives, pre-teen girls, and (professional) movie critics. You have all seen at least some of a chick-flick.  Be it the Victorian-England costume drama, the Shakespere movie, or pretty much anything starring Maryl Streep.Titanic is a major-leage chick flick.I saw this movie (once) and have to say that, while the special effects of the last 45 minutes were really cool, the rest of the movie was typical chick flick.  It was a bad story, combined with bad acting, bad dialog, bad script-writing, and a really bad theme song (if I hear that Celine Dion song one more time I'm gonna freakin' rip my hair out) .Now some people are gonna say to me 'Oh yeah, how do you explain the box-office records?'.  Well, have you ever seen the theater line for Titanic?  99% of the patronage is young girls who keep pictures of Leonardo DiCrappio in their purses and have seen Titanic 25 times each.  If you can get a pretty-boy lead coupled with a stupid, simple, tragic romance and an annoying theme song, any movie can be a blockbuster.If you are a normal guy, you probably won't like this movie.  But if chick-flicks are your favorite, enjoy.",Null,3,4,20 January 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," OK as a movie, poor adaptation of the novel.
","I can't figure out why the name Bram Stoker was included in the title of this movie.  Because, apart from characters and a few key plot points, this movie bears little resemblance to Bram Stoker's classic novel.This movie is, altogether, an OK movie.  The plot is interesting at times, with some incredible eye-popping visuals (especially the final half-hour).  Although, I felt that the romance between Dracula and Mina Harker (Rider's character) was unnecessary, and just made a feeble attempt to play on the audience's emotions.  But, the first few minutes of the movie, which tells about Dracula before he became a vampire,  were very well-done (although not a part of the novel).If you are looking for a faithful adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel, you'll just have to hope somebody makes one someday.  But if you are looking for an interesting new twist on the Dracula tale, grab this movie next time you go to the video store.",5,1,2,16 January 1999
