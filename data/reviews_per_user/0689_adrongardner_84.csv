The Avengers," The TransVengers
","You've already seen the Avengers and that's OK. You've seen it in every other Marvel movie yet released. You've definitely seen the finale, and even the McGuffin, because they took it straight from the first Transformers movie. The Avengers is great fun, but it's fading from memory faster than who won last season's American Idol. While fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased, I think his victory with the Avengers is a double edged sword. He carefully corrals the thicket of big names here, but in the process we're stuck with a laundry list of cliché scenes, a very weak villain, dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie. One can't shake the feeling, no matter whose names appear as writers, the Avengers smacks of committee construction. Excluding Sam Jackson, most of what is here is by the numbers. There are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it. In this respect, think this movie is a polar opposite of Ang Lee's HULK. A film that was painfully boring, but also full of human touches - it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before we're shuttled to the MIchael Bay Transformers action scenes we've seen a thousand times by this point. But is it bad? Heck no. The Avengers is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less. There are no motivations for anything in the film other than to recycle everything that's already been done and play it safe to please an audience. Yes, you've seen the Avengers already, but that's OK.B-",7,4,11,14 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," If Christopher Nolan decided to make a bad film on purpose this is it
","Blade Runner 2049 is the slowest, most beautiful train wreck I've seen in years. The sound design and cinematography are just masterful with a story so pompous and boring it might have fallen out of missing pieces of Battlefield Earth. Dennis Villeneuve's movie certainly looks and sounds the part, but it's trying to play someone else's music that was mostly an accident to begin with. This is a deliberate, austere film where nearly every single scene goes on for about 10 minutes longer than it needs to. People walk slowly ALL THE TIME for no reason. And yet at nearly three hours running length, Blade Runner 2049 manages to tell us nothing at all. Despite the narrative lapses - and the original had similar story problems itself - this aural and visual odyssey absolutely immerses you in a world. Yet interiors are over-lit and the production design is occasionally lifeless. When the credits roll and you walk out of the theater, there's an odd feeling when you don't see giant fluorescent Kana signs and endless streams of rain. At some subconscious level, Roger Deakins and all those Katkana signs own you lock stock and barrel. The film is so visually correct and so audibly satisfying, you'd swear Christopher Nolan had a hand in it all and decided to make a terrible and goofy mystery almost as dare or a joke.Know what you are getting yourself into when you buy a ticket to Blade Runner 2049. The movie goes from stunning feast to laughable drivel in a moments notice, time and time again - for three hours. It's best seen - perhaps ONLY seen - on IMAX and I'll probably never watch it again, but should you pay the price and take the ride? I'd say: yes.",6,1,4,15 October 2017
Black Swan," Tight Club
","Every girl wants to be a ballerina. Yeesh. This is the female version of The Wrestler, another Darren Aronofsky story arc of love, hate and masochistic self destruction. Yawn.Just as they hand out 3D glasses to watch Avatar, Zoloft should be mandatory for every Aronofsky screening. It's a downer, but knowing that from the get-go, there's little to interest besides the sex scene. The acting is good, but Mila Kunis is the real gem here. I said it after Closer and I still believe it today - Natalie Portman is not much of an actress. She peaked with The Professional. She has a cute face, but carries no dramatic weight. Isn't that what we have Sandra Bullock for?Here would be a twist for Aronofsky, recast the Natalie Portman role with Mickey Rourke. Now we got something interesting going.'First rule of Ballerina Club IS, you do not talk about Ballerina Club!'",5,4,10,7 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Improved round, but there's a better boxer
","Guy Ritchie's first go around with Sherlock Holmes felt a lot more like 'Snatch 2' with pigs, slow mo punching and dank leaky interiors, but here he has genuinely improved. Despite the bore inducing overdose of patented Ritchie camera shutter ramping and slow motion, this is actually sorta kinda qualified to be a Sherlock story. Modeled hazily on The Final Problem, there's more mental gymnastics with Moriarity and less British pit boxing. Nice recovery Guy.What bothers me the most here, is the inclusion of too many guns blazing scenes - a near contractual requirement for any director working with 80s fossil, producer Joel Silver. John McTiernan joked about just this point working with Silver when making Arnie's Predator. His solution, or Flip Off to Silver, was having Bill Duke fire the 'Painless' mini-gun surrounded by the other commandos dumping lead into the jungle - and hitting nothing. In Die Hard he had the terrorists do the same thing shooting glass. But that is another story. No, I have nothing against guns, but Sherlock is not an action hero, he is a heroine addicted supercomputer and he wins the day with his mind and eye, not running from mortars.Overall it is money well spent if you want to escape. Though the movie is so dense with quick cutting for more than two hours I don't really remember anything from the first half of the film at all. While Downy Jr. enjoys playing our dear detective and Jude Law perfectly at home as Watson, in the meantime Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have done better with their interpretations on BBC's Sherlock. How about that? Guy Ritchie beaten out by a TV show. You don't even need slow motion to see the knockout blow from those two show how it's done.It is nice to see Noomi Rapace in there. Hooray for life after Dragons and Tattoos.",7,0,0,9 January 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Welcome Home
","I'm a tough customer when it comes to westerns. I grew up watching the likes of westerns as diverse as Tall in the Saddle, The Searchers, The Sheepman, Shane, and of course my all- time favorite, Rio Bravo. I like the old style westerns. Unforgiven never truly sold me. The other Eastwood spaghetti jobs were good for what they were, but still not what I would call good westerns. Dances with Wolves was a yawner. The Aussie set movies of Snowy River and Quigly Down Under were refreshing. Tombstone and the Young Guns, though cheesy as hell, get a pass for effort. More recently, I did enjoy Open Range.So here is the remake. Thanks to the wonderfully drawn characters, both in the script and on the screen, 3:10 to Yuma scores high in my book. The landscape is there and so is the tone. The characters seem to really exist in the frame of their world and not in 'a western.' Some of the Eastwood movies are chock full of people who just seem to know they are caricatures of a western. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale are completely believable, sympathetic and fascinating in their polar opposite roles. I loved to see both of them on the screen. Their faces, body language and voices really feel right here. The only weakness i can point out when pressed, is probably Ben Foster's Charlie Prince. Foster just doesn't seem right here. Both in the movie and among his co-stars, he seems a bit out-gunned, so to speak.Overall, this remake does a good job. It is in fact, a better movie than the Glen Ford original. One wonderful thing about this film that has nothing to do with the film-making is the landscape. When I saw this film, I was doing an internship in Orange County, California and languishing in the daily traffic of Los Angeles and Orange County. Being a New Mexico native, it was really wonderful to see Santa Fe on the screen. The filmmakers did justice to the wonderful terrain of my home state.",8,1,2,7 October 2007
Skyfall," Bored. James Bored.
","The reviews flowed in. Best reviewed Bond movie ever. Biggest overseas opening ever for a Bond movie. That just proves a good point: consensus doesn't prove anything. I was the kid who stayed glued to the TV on all the old TBS Bond movie marathons during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've read a good deal of the source material books from Ian Flemming. But I have no fanatical attachment to either. On the contrary, I just happen to enjoy the simple escapist window Bond opens to an audience for a few hours. Yep, I even liked Moonraker. I always preferred George Lazenby's 'strait Bond' over all the other guys. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is by far my favorite movie of the series. 'You Only Live Twice' would be a distant second place. Daniel Craig isn't a bad Bond at all and he's definitely a product of the 'Jason Bourne' generation of action movies of stoic heroes where the Brosnan productions often veered into the Roger Moore fantasy camp - which I actually didn't mind. So the cold and stale touch of Skyfall actually compliments his character, but it can't save the movie from the doldrums it 'falls' into from time to time. Javier Bardem was good, but I think Moriarity in BBCs Sherlock was more of a threat to London than this guy.Plain and simple, Skyfall was pretty dry and the narrative was a jumbled mess of pacing. There were undoubtedly great ideas, but none of them were well capitalized on. The pieces never really fit together. It's as if the three writers agreed the movie would star Daniel Craig, then went their separate ways and wrote three different movies then tied them together with string before filming. Even Hollywood fix master editor Stuart Baird didn't tighten this one up very well. There was a lot of shifting in seats and not a laugh to be heard in the theater I sat in.Money Penny, M, Q and the Aston are here to signify that Jason Bourne is finally dead and Bond we all remember has returned. Maybe, but this coming from a book worm with a long attention span: this Bond was boring.",6,7,16,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Deus Ex War Machina
","You have been diagnosed with Iron Man 3. Symptoms may include:The Oily Discharge, The Trapped Under Something Heavy, The Friend in The Hospital, The Token Black Sidekick, The Trapped Under Something Heavy Again, The Trapped Under Something Heavy For The Third And Fourth Times, The Buddy Flick, The Double Cross, The Identity Crisis, The Panic Attack, The Rocky Relationship, The President in Danger, The Villain Monologue(s), The Glorified Extra, The Evil War Veteran, The Trapped Under Something Underwater, The Henchman, The I Can't Quite Reach You, The Falling, The Annoying Little Aryan Boy, The Christmas Movie, The Wisecrack, The Ex Girlfriend, The Product Placement, The Happy Ending and The Trapped Under Something Heavy With Fire.Either every scene was written by a totally different person or they filmed six months of an Iron Man TV show and spliced 23 episodes down to two hours. Two hours of people getting trapped under something heavy.Aside from the absolutely hilarious and priceless Ben Kingsley and the inventive Robert Downey Jr., this is the biggest stinky floater of a train wreck script made since Batman and Robin. I'd blame Shane Black, but the best thing he was ever a part of was McTiernan's Predator, and they killed his character off quickly in that jungle. Marvel Comics is working as hard as they can to run their properties into the ground faster than they can reboot them.",1,76,153,3 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of lost cinema
","The Greatest adventure movie of all time?Its very possible. This folks is how its all done. Humor, drama, action. Its all here.I think Raiders of the Lost arc is not only a wonderful piece of entertainment, the movie is also a showcase for what is wrong with many modern movies. Including those from both Spielberg and George Lucas.Raiders is a movie that takes off running and never stops. The hocus-pocus story is high- cheese, yet we never question it for a second. The action set pieces are all good without coming off as overly deliberate or choreographed. It is not until the end are there really any effects to speak of, and this is where Raiders shines. The movie is driven almost completely by the great story and Harrison Ford's immortal portrayal of Henry 'Indiana' Jones Jr. Later Spielberg and Lucas efforts, most notably the Star Wars Prequels and even Minority Report, are boondoggled with all sorts of visual computer wizardry, but the people and the story are both thinner than paper. Though for a half hour or so it proved to be an amazing theatrical ride, even Saving Private Ryan was plagued by a generic story, generic characters and a director all too obsessed with tanks and Thompson machine guns than the thoughts of the men carrying them.Raiders of the Lost Arc is old fashioned film-making full of dirt and grit. The sequels all were entertaining but none so convincing as the first. The acting, directing, editing, writing and of course, the amazing John Williams score meld to perfection. Indeed, this is how movies should be made. In the action genre, I don't think any other movie of its era, or even since, came come close other than Die Hard. More than 25 years later, Raiders of the Lost Arc has lost none of its shine. This is a movie filmmakers should study carefully, even the ones who made it. They haven't made much as solid as this since. Raiders of the Lost Arc is one of my favorite movies and probably one of the best movies that will ever be made.",10,1,2,13 March 2008
Minority Report," What a waste...of time, of money, of talent...of time...
","A good idea poorly executed:  Plain and Simple.  As far as staying true to the spirit of Philip K. Dick's writings and themes, I won't criticize what isn't in the film, only what is.In Minority Report Speilberg gives a few overt nods to another film about a future society that tries to eliminate crime, Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' (the eye pieces, the drunk in the hallway) But this film has neither the impact or the depth of the Kubrick film.  Tom Cruise plays the same character he always does....Tom Cruise.  The film suffers from many things; its too long, too much plot, lots of redundant dialogue, a camera that won't stay still when it should, predictable plotting.  My BIGGEST gripe is that the script includes too many scenes of people explaining things: its excruciating.  Janusz Kaminski proves again he is masterful with texture but has no idea how to frame a SINGLE memorable image.  And we, of course, have the obligatory happy Spielberg ending. 
I like long movies, I could watch Lawrence of Arabia and the Seven Samurai all day or ten hours of the Decalogue forever.  When a movie is longer than two and a half hours I will be paying close attention.  This movie was a waste of my time. I should have walked out after the first hour, I could have found something else to do in that time that was more entertaining.",1,2,5,22 June 2002
Gravity," Gravity Sucks
","'You've gotta be kidding me!'You can say that again Sandra Bullock.Pop quiz hot shot, Sandra Bullock is driving another bus and you can pretty much guess the results. Welcome to Space camp.Despite what you may think, Gravity is a surprisingly conventional popcorn thriller. I'll read you the summary. Which cliché's will we use? Eeenie, meenie mineee, mo... Gravity is the story of an astronaut who doesn't follow orders. The story of how crashing the simulator 100% of the time will still get you onto a space shuttle. The sexist story of how a woman is rescued by a man. The story of an astronaut who 'hates space.' The study of how everything apparently occupies the exact same orbit above the Earth, which is utterly ludicrous. The story of another Hollywood movie where people run away from fire balls down a hallway. The study of how in space, there is no sound except for that of the orchestrated musical score. The story of monster's closet dead body scares. The story of how you don't need to orient the spacecraft on reentry to avoid vaporizing: they apparently just fly themselves even when the circuit boards are on fire. Space junk alright.Yeah I'm going to be one of those people. I don't understand why they couldn't have made a movie about a smarter woman who has the drive and cunning to survive. I guess dumb and luck is more interesting, than smart and driven. Gravity gets a 5/10 simply for the mighty filmmaking craft in the first half hour. After that, they ran out of money and we end up not with great space effects. No, it's back to three guys off screen rocking the camera around and endless rebirth symbolism that is anything but subtle.There's a great tale in this material, but you would find it in the true story of the legendary cosmonaut Vladamir Komarov. His story won't offer the convenient ending you get in Gravity, but you do get a story of somebody fighting to survive in the most inhospitable place we know. But not here. Just like in real life, Gravity sucks.",5,8,17,7 October 2013
Inglourious Basterds," This one ain't DeathProof
","Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.I saw Pulp Fiction at 14 years old, and I saw it 6 times in the theater. I have an original Reservoir Dogs poster and I think Jackie Brown is a timeless achievement and Quentin Tarantino's best movie. Kill Bill was a huge mess, but it was entertaining.I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is boredom. The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up. This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC. He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.",1,107,220,21 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Clone Wars
","This is the biggest fan fiction job ever pulled off. And sometimes it works. I mean, if you're OK for constant self-aware fan jokes and CG people, then this is your movie. Rogue One is wish fulfillment that will carry it for a few weekends at the box office, but will fade more or less as quickly as any of the prequel movies. And let's just say it, if you're going to do a cheezo prequel for Star Wars, this is all you need really. But does it work as it's own movie? Not really. It might as well have been a two hour episode of the Clone Wars TV show. Aside from the non-stop call outs, the trove of interesting characters and fantastic actors portraying them, are mostly forgotten very quickly in the second half of the movie. We get the perfunctory space and land battle but little else. Wen Jiang and Donnie Yen as the Star Wars Zatoichi were crying for more screen time and I hope someday they get their own deserved movie. While the computer generated actors feel really bad to me, and I cringed every single time they came up on screen, KS the Droid really works. In fact, his physical performance and effervescent humor carry large portions of the film when the actors are going through the motions. I'm glad if you enjoyed what amounted to two hours of wish fulfillment and curtain calls. But Rogue One was also a missed opportunity for a true Star Wars Gaiden, a side story of it's own.",6,4,9,16 December 2016
World War Z," World War .zzzzzzzzzzzz...
","World War Z is a movie that jumps around every 15 minutes to make sure you're not bored. But I was. This was a snoozer. The movie is completely harmless, totally illogical but at least just when the wife and kids annoy the crap out of you, the filmmakers handily shuttle them off to a place you won't see them again. There's a feeling a good deal of stuff went under the editing knife, but it may have been for the greater good because there's not much here.There are a couple places of genuine entertainment, but the most interesting characters are gone in a blink.Really I'm wasting too much time. Just when you think the movie is getting started, it's over. Brand Pitt announces 'This isn't the end.' But yeah it is, because the credits started rolling. World War Z is a movie that will pass some time, but there's no downside to never seeing it.",6,19,40,21 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Game of Drones
","Here we go again: Storytelling 101 - show your audience, don't TELL them.The Hunger Games is a painful exercise in incessant exposition. For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary. You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious 'Rules of the Game' so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80- minute movie nearly an hour longer. Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game. Once you get over the novelty of kids killing kids - which seems to be no novelty at all if you watch the news - there isn't much here to go on.Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with. You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death. On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything. Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit. The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived. At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man. But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script. This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.Don't tell me I should read the book, because I'll just tell you to watch a movie like Hanna, instead.",5,4,6,18 August 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Wars Episode VII: Khan Air
","Pop quiz hotshot, what do you do when threatened by a genetically engineered madman who is nearly indestructible and who will stop at nothing to rescue his people?You call Spock and get the answer.This isn't anything other than Die Hard in space with a never ending series of camera whip pans and lens flare. J.J. Abrahms is totally bored with this stuff. It doesn't matter that he's not a Star Trek fan, but he doesn't give two sh**s for a single character in the movie. You don't have to be a Wrath of Khan fan to see what is wrong here. In that movie the plot is simple. Kirk was revealed in the opening simulation to take short cuts, but in the end, his best friend - and later his son - paid the price for his recklessness. Kirk had to learnthere were no easy ways out. Only hard truths and impossible sacrifices. There was a justice to the arc of Kirk. Into Darkness is just a Kanye West style sample remix. It's boomy, but ain't music. Now when anybody dies in the Star Trek sequels, there's no excuse for them stealing more blood from all those torpedo tube people to keep them alive.Thank you, writers of Transformers, Damon Lindelof and that short guy who creates all those TV shows that go nowhere.",6,2,12,17 May 2013
Public Enemies," Blair Witch Gangsters
","This is what happens when a talented person mistakes an instrument for a tool.Cinéma vérité is back, at least for this director. Michael Mann began his career as a documentary filmmaker. He graduated to film with the excellent Thief with James Caan and then Manhunter. More recently, I think he peaked and maybe topped his other works with The Insider from 1999. In some ways, with Public Enemies, his sensibilities may have come full circle. Using the CineAlta after flirting with Viper film stream camera in Miami Vice and Collateral, allows Mann to film an inordinate amount of shots in more diverse conditions. He can do, hand-held shots to his hearts content, he can do many more setups and no longer does he need to stop to change film mags. He can shoot in any lighting conditions, or so he convinces himself. He is now shooting total documentary style. He smashes the camera right into the cheeks of his actors. Can't you feel it? It's ultra real man. The characters are all well done, though it is hard to tell sometimes with the camera bouncing around like a ping pong ball. Depp is good as Dillinger, while Bale fares a little on the weak side with Purvis. Out of all the characters, I would think Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead was the most authentic and interesting. He reminds me of my uncle Sonny, now passed but who was a bounty hunter and federal marshal. He was from the same area of north Texas/southern Oklahoma like the real Winstead. Lang's body language and manor are beyond authentic. He is dead on.The film takes us places we've already been and shows us things we've already seen a million times before. The close calls Dillinger makes through the film are bright spots, but not nearly enough in a story that seems all too familiar. But again, Michael Mann was really trying to give us a documentary.The problem is, Public Enemies is not a documentary. Though it was filmed in a faux- guerilla style with a digital hand-held half the time. There were no digital hand-held cameras in the 1930s, and the effect just pulls you right out of the movie. So again, this is no documentary, as there are actors and sets. There are props and special effects and computer generated blood. There are huge historical liberties taken with the script. And I have rarely seen any documentary where they barrage the viewer with 2 and a half hours of hand-held camera work. In fact, most documentary filmmakers are careful to show you things in a very direct and succinct way. The audio sounded like it was recorded in a shoebox. The film score appears as if there is another movie playing in the background. And aside from being aesthetically uninteresting, problematic with motion work, having inconsistent color tones, and images which over-sharpened in post processing, the Cinealta camera has given Michael Mann the ability to shoot anything he likes at the moment. And this is the biggest of all the film's problems. Shaking the camera is not representative of reality. All those old cars and fancy hats don't do the trick. The film does not feel realistic, it feels as if there is a real lack of vision. Limitations in any medium are what focuses your abilities to create. Adversity breeds creativity, what you are left with after this process, is called vision. The lack of restraints in shooting method have left this film feeling haphazard and unfocused. In short, I liked this film a lot more the last time I saw it when it was called Heat.Also based somewhat on real characters and events, Heat was an epic film. And though overlong, tells an all too familiar story of these bank robbers and their dance with fate. It is still a beautiful work and shows no lack of vision.Public Enemies is by no means a bad film. And technically since it was not shot on film, it can't be called one maybe. Like George Lucas and his techno toy Star Wars prequels, I think Public Enemies is a technical exercise from a person more interested in working with a new tool, rather than making music with a new instrument.",6,6,12,4 July 2009
Cloverfield," Wow. That one sucked.
","Yeah it has been awhile since we've had a good monster movie. Going into this one, I wanted to be free of spoilers, early reviews, or theories on the marketing campaign. So I went in with some general interest and hope. I'm even a bona-fide JJ Abrahms fan, I love LOST, nonsense conspiracies and all. Well, with this in mind, I saw Cloverfield. And I'm quite certain, the movie was absolute trash. Here's why.Did I get scared? Nope. Not once. Not from the slim glimpses of the monster. Not from the little Starship Troopers creatures. Not from any of the sounds.Did I laugh? YES. There are some good one liners from our humble camera man.The shocks were few and weak. The part when the girl who was bit eventually spattered was good, but muted and did little to liven any tension. I just never felt any excitement or adrenaline. Was the movie well made? No. The monster was generic looking and I think the word Generic fits most of the descriptions of the film itself. Its all just 'meh.' Nothing more.The story was lame. Basically from what I remember, they cooked up some saved by the bell love story about some twenty-something trapped in a mega buck high-rise apartment overlooking central park. Who cares about these rich kids and their little parties? I'm sorry, but in a city like New York, there are a billion more harrowing stories to tell than a bunch of 90210 kids and their love triangle dramas.OK on this hand-held camcorder business, I'm going on record on writing how stupid it is. I don't think you can effectively tell a feature length story visually or otherwise with the frame bouncing around like crazy for most of the time. This just doesn't work. Instead of creating anticipation or mystery, all I do is get mad from motion sickness and the fact I have nothing to focus on as an audience member. There is no thread for me to latch on to. This is simple and it is by design, I understand that. The other side of this is the filmmakers are, in fact, providing little for the audience in the first place. Its a very cheap way to make a film, which this film clearly was.There just isn't much here to watch folks, both literally or figuratively. The 1 hour 20 minute or so running time is a good reflection of this though the movie felt like it was a 3 hour marathon of nonsense. I've never been a group mentality person, but it says something when the majority audience in the theater screams, 'SUCKED!' when the credits hit. Cloverfield is a movie that should have stayed true to its roots on how it was made and gone direct to video. My advice to the writers? Kill off all the kids early, let the aliens film the rest. This one was a dud. And seeing the splash in the ocean at the end, I'm sure there will be sequels on the way. Perhaps the end is near, after all. God have mercy on us all.",3,15,30,21 January 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Slow footed but well acted
","Well of course it's literate - it's a John le Carré book. Where the book moved at the rate one associates with planet formation in the solar system, the movie manages to speed things up. That is, ever so slightly.While the movie goes it's own way in rejecting much back-story, the editing mimics a degree of the time shifting style of the book. Yet transitions are poorly placed and you wonder if you merely fell asleep and missed a bit, which is possible, than witnessed brilliant editing. The story simply isn't all that engrossing. Smiley is brought in and assembles a team to look for a mole in the 'circus.'Thats about it. Few surprises and the plot, while edgy in the 1970s, now has been done over a few times even by reality in the form of Aldrich Ames. The cloak and dagger bits are few and far between, though action is appropriately brutal and well timed. The second half is far better than the first.Performance wise, the cast is peerless. To name a few, Firth, Hardy, Oldman and Mr Holmes himself, Benedict Cumberbatch give every ounce of credibility you need for serious jobs like this. Yet, there's still something missing. While this takes a vote above disappointments like Breach or The Good Shepherd, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy feels like a dusty old overcoat. Sneakers from 1992 was more comic, less authentic, but more interesting and a better spy movie.Good, not great. Saved by the acting and worth a rent.",7,3,4,29 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," 65mm can also amplify mediocrity
","Spoiler Alert: Size of the film negative does not adversely result in better movies!! Plenty of trash was made on 65mm over the years and Hateful Eight is now one of those.I got the joke pretty quickly. We are watching one of Tarantino-world's western shows. But instead of twenty minutes of tight plotting, it goes on for three hours. Hey look it's bad TV! But we used HUGE cameras this time!!!! And the 'twist' ain't there. There isn't one folks. You sort of figuratively lean in for three hours waiting for the final denouement but there isn't one. Forget 'racial' context or social commentary. There isn't any. Don't give QT that much credit. Saying Hateful Eight is a commentary on the Civil War is like saying Transformers is a comment on the Civil War. This thing is a complete mess in many ways and if it was merely 90 minutes, there COULD be a movie to almost laugh off. But no, there's nothing here. All they do is beat the living sh** out of Jennifer Jason Leigh for three hours and then the credits roll. The real twist is, QT got you to pay for it. Not falling for that one again...",5,6,20,9 January 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Surprisingly good
","The Adventures of Tintin is an excellent apology for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Spielberg lives up all his serialized, globe trotting, treasure hunting, pirate chasing fantasies he flooded into The Goonies and The Last Crusade. As the property sat on the shelf for so many years, it's pretty easy to see very strong parallels particularly in Last Crusade, but this is a superior work.Animation has come a long ways from Polar Express, but the characters still look as if their heads are too big. It's still not quite right but not too distracting.I'm keeping this one short because you're better off not taking my word for this and just seeing it yourself. The last third lacks the intrigue and adventure of the earlier parts of the story. Either from budget reasons or deadlines, Tintin seems to settle into too many clichés toward the end to put a quick finish on the story rather than actually flesh out something more in line with the careful characterizations of what came before. Minus one point for the big headed Daniel Craig character and minus two points for the flat and cliché finish.7/10Bring on the next one!",8,1,2,7 January 2013
Closer," Its OK
","I write this review on the sole basis of the movie. I have not seen the play, I don't want to see the play, I don't like plays. There I said it.Closer is a movie that as a whole has a good message and a lot to say, but when looked at from scene to scene, little adds up. Before I tear into this one, I will focus on the positive.Again, I did get the message and I could relate to what the film had to say. On that basis I have to give Closer a positive recommendation. The acting is decent all around, but any dramatic believability the film carries is due primarily to Clive Owen. He plays the honest character and also gives a more honest performance. Jude Law is good, but he seems stuck to the rhythmic stage dialog. Owen does more with his lines than anyone else. Natalie Portman is cutesy, but, and I mean this, she isn't a very good actress. Julia Roberts struggles to convince not only with her lines, but playing a photographer, you need to at least know how to hold a camera convincingly. How hard is that to learn? The movie's massive fallibility is in its stage roots. Closer is not very cinematic and because of that, not very convincing. There is too much 'play' between the actors with their wordy rhythmic exchanges. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT! Again this comes from my distaste for the stage, and I have even more distaste for filmed plays. In the end, Closer succeeds in holding your interest thanks to some good humor and the ever honest Clive Owen.",6,1,1,6 January 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Disposable and the decline of the movie theater
","This is in the running for best of the recent Marvel movies. That's not saying much. But give Disney credit. They finally figured out how to make money off all the Marvel properties - target the 7-year-old kid. I think If I was 7 years old, I would totally be into it. But the fact is, I'm not seven anymore. I've seen enough large machines falling out of skies and exploding. I've seen enough people firing redundant waves of machine gun bullets and not hitting anything. I've seen enough double cross plots explained in the first 5 minutes. I've seen enough of all of these things for good. All these movies are exactly the same. They are filmed quick and dirty just like sit-com TV shows with the perfunctory special effects we have all seen before. Low and behold, Winter Solider is actually directed by TV directors too. Sure Winter Solider is sorta making money, but it's a far cry of what movies consistently made 10 and 15 years ago. On the whole, the movie industry is evaporating and movies like this are the reason, Cyborg bad guy? Evil white suit running the show? Car wrecks? Slow motion? This is all seemingly off topic, but stuff like this movie aren't even worth writing a review for. What do you talk about really? Acting, plot or cinematography? Come on. I've seen this movie at least 10 times a year for the past 30 years, there will always be youngsters out there to see it for the first time, and good for them but for the rest of us all the good stuff is now on HBO, FX and AMC. It's a sad decline of the cinema experience, but I have a better time in front of my 65 inch TV and blu ray player at home.If you really need to get out of the house and turn off, well this movie will do it. But I don't remember anything in there I saw other than all the explosions and gunfire we've seen millions of times before -literally. I guess you could do worse, but pay for McDonalds and don't expect real food.",3,10,21,6 April 2014
Barry Lyndon," Opulent, Articulate, Masterwork
","Simply put, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the most impeccable piece of film I have ever seen. There is an incredible sense of depth and care to every image in the film.  The quality of the imagery is absolutely perfect.  Kubrick also goes to great length to convey the dry nature of the world Redmond Barry roams.  To paraphrase Ferris Bueller, 'Everything is very cold and very beautiful.'  I have heard many people call this film BORING.  That comment just means they have a short attention span.  This isn't a movie for the 'Fast and the Furious' crowd. The characters are interesting and dynamic. The problem is, the world these characters inhibit isn't dynamic. It's static and Redmond tries and tries to fit in.  No matter what he tries, his fallacies draw out conflict in one form or another. The saddest of these is in the death of Redmond's son and the fall out with his wife and step-son.Barry Lyndon works on so many levels; technically, photographically, dramatically, and ultimately Artistically.  Even more amazing is how Kubrick turned a wordy busy novel into a quiet, powerful drama. This work is a reflection of the master status Kubrick deserves. A photographer who is obsessed with perfection in his images. And a filmmaker who is obsessed with cinema.  For me, Barry Lyndon is an unforgettable work of art.",10,1,2,11 February 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Wholly Original
","Full Metal Jacket is unlike any war film that preceded it. Kubrick's minimalistic visual style proves effective. The writing and acting in the early boot camp scenes are so well done, for me this alone qualifies the film for greatness. Ermy's Sergent Hartman is so terrifying and funny, you simply cannot and will not forget his lines or the expressions on his face.The violence in the film are also very impressionistic. No matter how many war films you may have seen before this. The first time you see Full Metal Jacket, the death of Pvt. Pyle is shocking. You feel when Doc J and 8 Ball get hit. The impact of the violence is honest and true.The structure of the film is very unusual. And this is welcome. The movie does not arc like a traditional war film, or traditional film of any kind for that matter. There is no 3 part structure, instead there is boot camp and combat. Before 'Nam and during 'Nam. The scenes that work as asides, like the lament for 'handjob' and the hooker scene adds nice diversion and humor to the stark There is no showy, 'look at me' camera shaking. The steady cam work is clean and when there is some shake, its very subtle. All too often lately in war movies, the directors have gone wild with over-cranking and wild hand-held camera shake. The tracking scenes of Ermy in the early scenes are so powerful simply because its not about the movement of the camera, but the performance of the actor.Full Metal Jacket is not about Vietnam per se. It is not just about war per se. It is not Platoon and it is not Saving Private Ryan. This is a good thing, because as good as those movies are in their own ways, Full Metal Jacket is better. This is not a film about war, or battle scenes, it is a film about people. It feels both real and surreal. The quiet death of Cowboy holds power precisely because there is no overpowering score or heroic framing to push the emotion to us. We feel for cowboy because he felt like a friend, not simply a character in a war movie that has his turn to die. While people constantly assail Stanley Kubrick for being cold in his approach to humanity, I think these critics have only their self to blame. His films and characters always have emotions on the screen. The Kubrick stare alone justifies my point. If you don't find emotion in a Kubrick film, then the place the emotion is lacking is in you.At the end, Joker's resolution is not that he has lived and learned. He has not come to warn us of his tale. Instead, Joker marches with his fellow Marines free of fear and content with simply being alive. If you cannot watch Full Metal Jacket and feel something, then maybe Titanic is a film for you.",9,0,0,9 April 2006
Predator," This one holds water
","Twenty years on, and several sequels later, Predator without a doubt, is not only the best in the series, but still a great, inventive and incredibly suspenseful movie.Much of the commando team proves memorable, notably Jesse Ventura as Blaine and fantastic Carl Weathers as Dillon. In the lead, Schwarzenegger as 'Dutch' is classic Arnold. Here he seems completely at ease in his character with good dashes of humor, 'What's the matter Dillon? CIA got you pushing too many pencils?' This is probably my favorite role for Arnie.The story here is simple but effective, the filmmakers settling on a 'less is more' strategy in almost every category. A special forces team on a central American jungle mission are tracked and killed by an alien hunter. While some of the scenes are lacking not due to dating, or technological constraints - surprisingly the elementary special effects still do the job - but more obviously budget constraints. The guerilla camp raid action scene feels a bit limited in this respect and I think budget had a lot to do with it. The sequence is also probably in line with other slam bang type 80s action movies also.Other flaws and smudges? I think there are some idiotic death scenes in the movie belying the intelligence portrayed by members of Dutch's group. Sonny Landhams last stand with his big knife is stupid, even though you just hear it. Authenticity is also a question with so many recent movies going mega realistic on military tactics. I just hate seeing so many people shooting automatic rifles from the hip. Put that gun to your shoulder soldier.The music score is fantastic, and memorable. The predator is judiciously revealed, a tactic that definitely adds to the suspense factor of the movie. McTiernan's pre Die Hard direction is awfully good. He keeps everything at a simmer and when its time, the movie goes to full boil.The script's subtlety comes to the fore with a great final showdown with the wonderfully menacing Predator. Dutch uses the cunning of a hunter, and largely, his own two hands and not guns to win the battle. This is a rare thing in modern action movies. On the subject of sequels, I am a fan of Predator 2, but anything that followed, including the new AvP Requiem was trash. The only stand out criticism, in Predator 2 and AvP R being a clear escalation on the part of the filmmakers in the gore department, and the others, the overwrought special effects. I'm not squeamish or against good computer effects, but I think the real strength of the first movie has nothing to do with blood or bombs, it is that there were strong characters and in the gore and effects department, less was indeed more. Its not hard to find why all the sequels of Predator were such failures. That and most of them were just crappy movies.",9,1,2,27 December 2007
The Aviator," Excellent
","The Aviator is quite a film. On one hand it is a biopic about an influential figure and a comment on a time and place in America. On the other hand, The Aviator is a visceral adventure and a cautionary tale of the madness obsession can bring.I don't know how people will accept this movie. Many may be off put by the story. Well it isn't a happy story but don't fault the film. Scorsese's technical prowess has come full circle into the digital realm.The editing is tight and the story flows well even over its 2.5+ hours. We know all the characters and why we are being introduced to them. There are few players that are merely set dressing.While the arc of the story isn't new to anybody who knows what happened to Howard Hughes, we are kept in suspense; especially during the Senate hearings. But there is one scene that is simply stunning in The Aviator. The XF-11 sequence is absolutely amazing. It was raw and frightening. Exciting and beautiful to watch. I would give this film a 10 for that sequence alone, It is simply a masterful blend of photography, acting, special and digital effects, and especially editing. I love spectacle in movies and for me, recommending The Aviator on the basis of the XF-11 sequence would be the same as somebody recommending Ben Hur because of the Chariot Race.The Aviator is an exciting film. It is a frightening tale about America and about madness. Above all, The Aviator is superb entertainment.",8,4,12,26 December 2004
Oblivion," Cliché Fantastic
","Like James Cameron may have said about Avatar, Oblivion is every single sic-fi movie you've already seen and it's pretty good - in fact much better than the Smurfy farce Avatar ended up being. There's plenty of Kosinki's TRON Legacy in here. Count in Matrix, the Death Star from Star Wars, HAL from 2001 and the robots from The Black Hole. Basically anything you can think of. But I still somehow liked the heck out of this movie. I don't even like Tom Cruise and I liked the heck out of this movie. It's so genuinely nerdy, it's genuine. Those Drones are actually the star of the show I think. The sound design for their menacing R2D2 speech is pretty scary stuff.I don't know what to tell you about Oblivion other than I saw it twice and I may see it again. It contributes nothing to the genre, but for some reason, I just enjoy the movie. That's really what movies are about and something I can't say about Avatar - with or without the glasses.",7,0,6,25 April 2013
Watchmen," Large order of Snyder, hold the Apocaloctopus
","It walks and talks like Watchmen, but somehow this is not WatchmenLook I'm no defender of Zack Snyder - I'm not sure if he's ever made a good movie at all. But as a distant fan of the original story, against all complaints and bias I really wanted this movie to succeed.It doesn't.There are a lot of arguments to be made, the biggest is naturally - Can Watchmen even translate to a movie? The question goes unanswered. If there is a good Watcmen movie to be made, this absolutely is NOT it.A person could sit down with a checklist as Snyder's Watcmen unfolds and click off all the things from the original story that should be in this movie. Well low and behold, just about everything is in there, of course omitting the Apocalyptic Octopus. Believe it or not, I didn't even mind about the ending, but somehow, it's all pantomime and with the exception of two unquestionably fantastic performances, the end product is utterly soulless and thoroughly vapid.It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong because the cast is almost there. I really have to applaud most of the players, particularly Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Unfortunately Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson aren't up to snuff and I never bought into their characters. Top it off that they are saddled with a laughably terrible sex scene - sure it's 'in the book' - but seemingly feels recycled from Snyder's 300 with crappier music.If I was some great Captain Hindsight, I could point out everything Snyder did wrong. But I can't do it. Just like the graphic novel, this all reads great on paper, but what's on screen is just unbelievably boring and forgettable. Alan Moore created a real allegorical page turner with Watchmen, but on screen, this is just a snoozer. Is it terrible? No, but there's really no downside to not watching it.",5,2,4,11 May 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," The Day the Matrix Stood Stupid
","After first seeing Revolutions on a midnight opening show a decade back in 2003, I fired it up on a streaming service to see how it has aged. I remember being really disappointed the first time I saw the movie. But not as disappointed as I was after seeing Reloaded. While the second movie in the trilogy was a borefest let down I'll never forget, Revolutions packs the bigger surprise. Watching this a second time after a decade, boy was I blown away, I was tired and I didn't even remember what movie I had started watching once it was all over.It's awful. Reoladed is merely bad. Mediocre to the point of obsolescence. But this is offensively awful. Revolutions isn't even interesting enough to make me sick, to paraphrase Cher from The Witches of Eastwick. I'd go so far to say Revolutions is also unfortunately and massively influential. Everything wrong with all recent action movies you can trace to this train wreck. Endless BAD computer graphics? They're all here. Revolutions wasn't the first movie to assault the viewer with so much nonsense computer fakery, but it definitely did it on the largest scale. In the CGI fights, NEO and Smith posses the human likeness of a Stretch Armstrong doll. Don't blame the technology because in 2003, there weren't any excuses. Worst part of Man of Steel, Transformers and Avengers? You know the skyscraper tear-down fist fights. Yeah they took it all from Revolutions and it was just as boring.Avatar mechs? Yeah they stole those from here. Which stole them from an endless line of comic books. And yeah, they're boring. Jesus symbology. Yawn. So bad. I never laughed so hard seeing so much lead expended from firearms and only one or two bullets ever hitting anybody. You know I'm a huge John Woo fan but Yun-Fat is a much better marksman than all the pseudo firearm Jedis in this stinker.If there is any movie with worse dialog this side of Troll 2, than Revolutions, it hasn't been made yet. The writing is among the worst - or best - examples of Deus Ex Machina. Nothing is motivated from action or character. Stuff in the movie happens just because. There is truly about 10 minutes of actual movie here. Watching Revolutions I could not stop thinking about the all too obvious Futurama parody, 'The Day the Earth Stood Stupid.' Fry finishes the episode victorious by locking the squid-like brains away in a 'A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.'Fry's explanation is the best description of this terrible train wreck of a production you'll ever find. Battleship Earth has nothing on this",1,1,2,12 December 2013
The Revenant," 'it's real but it's not interesting'
","You will hear a lot about how difficult the filmmaking process (though it was not shot on film, but digital) was in The Revenant. You will hear a lot about the length the actors, director and crew went to make things real. But to quote Jack Nicholson quote Stanley Kubrick:'Jack, it's real but it's not interesting.'There's a lot of good work from every member of the cast and crew of the show here. I commend them all on their fine work. But I did not identify with anybody except Arthur Redcloud's Hikuc, and even then, his appearance is all too brief. This movie would be easier to review if there was more wrong with it, but I cannot offer some academic or faux intellectual retort. My personal criticism is just that, personal. And my personal opinion was I simply did not feel invested in any of the characters in the movie or what they went through. Instead of a journey, surviving to the predictable end feels like a slog. And when it was all over. I really didn't feel anything for anybody. Maybe it's just me. I'll accept that.Iñnaritu is a master of despair, but he isn't a dramatist and Revenant hasn't advanced his craft.If you are interested in films about the trials of survival or snowy mindscapes, try 'Touching the Void.' The tonally similar, and far more contrived, 'The Gray' is another one I would rather watch. I just found myself far more invested in watching Liam Neeson face off with a wolf than Leo sleep in a horse carcass.",6,2,5,8 January 2016
Knowing," Yawning
","Since I found the movie boring, I will keep this one short.Knowing is an attempt, to replicate 2001: A Space Odyssey's literal explanation for God. And like all the other movies that attempted this after 2001, Knowing fails miserably by actually providing a literal explanation for God. Leave this turkey on a dusty shelf along with its brethren of Contact and The Fountain. Nicholas Cage's acting is the least of this film's laughable qualities, in fact, I'd say he may be the best aspect of the film. Yes, i can't believe i wrote that either.Though I admire his earlier works, even I Robot, Knowing is Proyas' weakest, most literal, dumbest film. The first half hour was interesting. That's it. After that, Knowning was Boring. Garbage.",5,2,5,6 July 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Mixed Bag
","I went into T3 not knowing what to expect.  I came away not knowing what to think.  The movie is entertaining, let that be said.  The action never lets up except maybe at the end, where it could have used more punch.  In contrast to some reviews I actually liked the storyline, it just felt like it could have gone on a little longer.Arnold is as charismatic as ever, even with the low amount of dialogue.  I was a bit disappointed the lengths the filmmakers went to poke fun at T-800. I wished he could have been a bit closer to the meaner Terminator from the first movie in contrast to the 'softer' one from T2.  There are many laughs in the film and this is welcome.  The first movie was more of a B horror flick and T2 more sci-fi.  T3 falls somewhere in between the previous two in nearly all areas.The special effects were very good.  The final iteration Arnold goes through in the end is magnificent.  I wished it could have lasted longer. 
With the Matrix Reloaded we had a film that was simply too much.  It also had a story that was so convoluted I really gave up on caring what happens to the characters.  T3 is the opposite in nearly all areas.  It needed more of everything except a few less corny lines.In the end I am now wishing for T4 and an all out battle.  I hope it comes because like the previous two movies, T3 leaves the audience hanging wondering what is going to happen.",7,0,0,3 July 2003
American Beauty," The answer to the question nobody asked
","Despite a few good chuckles there isn't much else I liked about this one.  I felt the movie came off like some early mid 80's tv movie.  I didn't relate to anything the movie had to say and there was at least two other movies in the last 16 months dealing with guys going to work and insulting, blackmailing, or assaulting their bosses.  Both Fight Club and Office Space were far better at it.While I do not criticise too much on the interpetive aspect of the movie, I will just say that I really didn't enjoy this one at all. Depending on what scene I was watching I couldn't decide whether I was watching a porno, a saturday night live skit, USA up all night, MTV's undressed, Ordinary People, or more porno.Onetime watching this turkey was both once enough and once too many.",1,3,7,10 February 2001
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Merely sufficient
","Plain and simple, without Lisbeth Salander, the book would be on the bottom shelf next to the $.99 value bin at Wal-Mart. The writing is sloppy, sensationalist and the story largely predictable, on top of that at least 200 pages of fluff. Even Lisbeth Salander, an abused hacker, bike riding, 88 pound ass-kicking badass is the product of massive lonely male goth fantasy. One gets the feeling Larsson stole the heroine from Peter Høeg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and then punked her out. Agatha Christie has at least a dozen books better than these.So having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity. Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.Also WTF? with the James Bond intro? Wrong movie Fincher...Is Daniel Craigvrequiring this in his contracts now?",6,19,32,23 December 2011
Collateral," Masterpiece? No, but very good.
","Collateral works much like Mann's 'Heat' but on a much smaller scale, which is both bad and good as 'Heat' sometimes sprawled a bit too wide for its own good at times. The story of a taxi driver held hostage for a hit-man to do a nightly shift of killing is very inventive and Mann's stylistics make good use of the LA locale.Like 'Heat,' Collateral works like an episode of Miami Vice with lots of cops and robbers and pastel neon lights. Ambiance is the key here with acting that works for sure. The heavy use of DV has both its ups and downs. The digital texture works when there is enough light on the subject and good white balance correction like the Jazz club hit and the Asian dance club toward the end. Some of the night scenes DO NOT work with an abundance of ISO noise and pixelation. The interlacing of video is obvious and very distracting in one scene in particular, when Cruise trips on the chair in the Law high rise.The pace of the film works for the most part with a few small dry spots. In the end, I thin Collateral works very very well on the typical Michael Mann levels of entertainment. And though I completely disagree calling this film a Masterpiece, as some have suggested, I think Collateral is a very well made and entertaining character drama that in the end lacks a larger dramatic weight felt from Mann's earlier works.",8,0,3,27 December 2005
Aliens," 'Why don't you put her in charge?!'
","Aliens is James Cameron's best movie. At least the theatrical cut. While I have soft spots for Terminator and T2, I like the Abyss more than most, Aliens is the best movie he will ever make. The Extended edition isn't really worse per say, but there is a distinct lack of suspense and mystery by the time we arrive at Hadleys Hope. Not only is this James Cameron's best movie, this could be one of the greatest, if not top tier, of all action science fiction movies ever done. Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, the cast of Marines and even Lance Henrikson have so much personality to carry the story which actually doesn't amount to much. You don't care and you don't have to because the people, not necessarily the Aliens, really do carry this one. Even with some kind of low budget and an apparently antagonistic film crew could stop this from being awesome. I know there's some admirable things for the first movie. Stylistically, Alien still holds up. While it may not be a cucumber sand which, Alien still does not hold a candle to its sequel. Aliens is suspenseful, supremely constructed kinetic entertainment that never leaves you bored. There really isn't an Alien franchise. There's just Aliens and the other movies. Game over man.",10,1,1,4 January 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Slaughterhouse X-Five: or How to save us all from Disney's trash
","Logan has come unstuck in time and he's out to set right what Brett Ratner put very, very wrong. I hope Disney never acquires all the Marvel properties, because if they do, good stories like this will never see the light of day. All Disney Marvel movies consist of pantomime passing as action and flying fortress defense contract builders posing as villains. There are no people in Disney Marvel movies, only rubber suits and cardboard cut-outs.The Avengers was just Transformers. Thor was boring. I can't even recall Captain America and Iron Man 3 was probably the worst movie made in the last ten years. Sony isn't guiltless. Sure these new Spiderman movies are boring and soulless, but Disney is taking the Brett Ratner blow torch approach to everything they touch. The house of the Mouse cares only to serve up toy licensing on the cheap, employing shoddy stories, bad actors and TV directors. Days of Futures Past on the other hand is a pro job. It's made with a degree of dramatic vision, written well and acted impeccably from a true ensemble.The first twenty minutes in Days of Future Past are a little clunky. There's so much story to put into motion, the script almost can't handle it. Soon enough, we meet Quicksliver and it's a lark from there on out. While everybody does pretty good, it's Michael Fassbender and the utterly peerless James McAvoy who anchor this film from start to finish. Sure it's a great story, but much like the last go-around, these two titans carry this film part and parcel to the very end. And boy is there an quadrilateral equine whopper at the end.You simply cannot, and I wager will not, ever see this caliber of acting from any Disney Marvel property ever. Comic books were never truly about monsters, flying fortresses, bulletstorms or magic. In fact the best were always allegory. Marvel never had the big names like Batman and Superman, but they had super heroes, mutants or titans struggling with the same basic things we all do: loss, responsibility, love and doubt. I'm glad to see the team behind Days of Future Past realized that underneath all the rubber suits, even a mutant can be human.",9,1,1,23 May 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Short review
","I jumped to see this as a fan of Edgar Wright's other films. It's a sort of hit and miss, but worth the money overall. If you don't like the title, you'll probably hate the movieThe film is funny, good looking and pretty entertaining. Michael Cera is getting tiresome in the same old deadpan-single guy-lonely nerd role. I can't decide if Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good in the movie or, like Scott, we all just love her hipster, goth, punk hair. Kieran Culkin is the best actor in the movie as the gay-stalker roomie.Despite being inundated by the special effects sequences - it's about 15 minutes too long - a pittance of character development, and the lack of some real heart, this is a good one. For the older crowd, Scott's battles are a reminder of a life you probably didn't want to remember and the best piece of ridiculous nonsense you'll see.I'd pay to see it for the Vegan Police alone.",8,3,23,14 August 2010
Die Hard 2," 'That's what I said about my last cholesterol test'
","Die Hard is and will always be the best of the series. A movie so well executed, the sequels and imitators will always be just that.Die Hard 2 is on the whole, a very well made action fare. Renny Harlin does a decent job tying elements of the first film's style into this one. Oliver Wood does a great job of keeping the film's imagery in line with Jan de Bont's coverage from part 1. Willis is good, if not as believable. The ejection scene is a nice scene. The gunplay is furious, but not as focused. Fred Thompson adds a good deal of credibility, as he always seems to do, whether its a jack Ryan film, or Law and Order.I think the weaknesses are many here. De Souza's script is chock full of corny dialog, not to mention an endless fluffy of F-Bombs. John McClaine now seems to be less a regular guy having a bad day, than SUPERCOP! He, nor the other cast of characters have the charm of the first films ensemble. Dennis Franz is the new A-Hole, and frankly annoying as can be. And the vililans? No Hans here folks, but they serve their purpose.While initially, I felt Die Hard with a Vengeance was an improvement over this, on reflection now years later, though that film has much better acting and writing, it doesn't have the pure entertainment value of this movie.Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a by-the-numbers sequel from the early 1990s, but it is still an above average action film. This is purely a popcorn and hot dog job you can sit around and enjoy with friends by picking apart the crappy one liners, and still having a good time.",7,0,1,5 August 2007
No Country for Old Men," No Country for Action FIlms
","I don't know if this was the best film of 2007, but it was gimmick-less, thoughtful and absolutely satisfying one. Much of the hits this film seems to take almost completely center on the ending. More than anything, I think that is an audience flaw, not one in the film or the original source material, namely the novel.No Country for Old Men is a story about many things. The story can be dissected in numerous, and even possibly profound ways. But as any good novelist will do with things such as 'context' and 'setting,' and even 'language,' as Cormac McCarthy has done, this is all by design of course. Yes I am being sarcastic. But the point is, the story is what it is. The point isn't the tired cliché of chasing down a bundle of money, its about people. In this case, people who came home from the Vietnam war and in some fashion, brought the war home with them. The story is also, as the title implies, about as Dylan would say, how the times 'they are a changing.'So there ends the analytical session. The Coen's have really found a story made from the ground up for no other filmmakers than themselves. The caper story, qwirky characters and dialog recall just about every Coen Brother's movie in recent memory. Hell, there is even more than a touch of Blood Simple in there.So If the direction is great, and the characters are there, what about the actors? Well Tommy Lee Jones is as good as he always is playing some old coot from way out yonder. Josh Brolin is convincing in every way possible. But it is Spaniard Javier Bardem that elevates what is just another Coen Caper to Art. Bardem's performance is absolutely unapologetic as the oxygen bottle carrying killer. I don't think there is a single criminal or killer since Arnie in 1984s Terminator, that has this much power and persona.So this ending. Well I think most modern movie goers have been trained like dogs. They like a big bang at the end, and in my mind the movie delivered it. But the story was never about killers or money to begin with, it was about people and how times moves on, even if people don't. I don't think any shoot out, or handshake could do the movie any more justice than how it ended. Anything else would have been a damned cheat.No Country for Old Men is a story about the desert. It's a story about greed. It's a story about killing. It's a story about people.Heck, No Country for Old Men is about so many things, it is a movie that gives the audience something to do both during the movie and long after the credits roll---to think! How 'bout that.Now there is something you simply cannot make up. I dare you to even try.",8,1,4,16 February 2008
District 9," Nothing new here, but District 9 is entertaining
","28 Days Later + Aliens + Robocop = District 9Above all the hype on how 'smart' the film is, forget it, its just basically a buddy chase film.That is the best I can do and completely avoid spoilers. The violence and of course some other elements of the film clearly harken back to Paul Verhoeven's Robocop, the movie was also equally influenced by the list I started the review with.Every one of those movies was good entertainment. So, wisely the filmmakers stole from good source material.District 9 largely succeeds at being what the abominable Cloverfield wished it could be: one heck of a B movie. Where Cloverfield's premise lost steam quickly after the opening scenes, District 9 changes gears every 20 minutes into almost a completely different movie to keep the pot boiling. The shaky camera stuff has been done to death but thankfully it isn't too overbearing here. Surprisingly, there are some good stabs at humor too.The special effects are OK, but with the DV shutter drag, we never get a good look half the time. The film feels low budget with really only one or two actors on screen at any given time. And don't get me started on numerous plot holes gaping bigger than that alien ship. Above the endless splattering bodies, crotchety aliens and mockumentary talking heads, when District 9 was over, I really just didn't feel anything. Other weak spots were the commando 'villain' was very caricature baddie and out of place in the pseudo-reality of the other characters. The social message on the faux Apartheid is there but a bit thin and there really isn't much here we already haven't seen before, but I still enjoyed the ride. I liked it.",7,3,10,14 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fun, as far as watching a train wreck can be
","The last go around in Unexpected Journey, many liberties were taken. Yet, with all the extra characters and walking about in the woods, it somewhat felt passingly like the book. This 'sequel' of sorts is a big, boated thing that shares only names with the novel namesake and none of the spirit. In common with the first film, Bilbo seems to have an awfully small role. The manufactured elf Tauriel soaks up more lines and screen time than Martin Freeman. It continues... Where Unexpected Journey was mostly loafing about for three hours, we're nearly pummeled into submission on the way to lonely mountain this year. The music score never lets you absorb a moment quietly. Every single camera or character movement is backed up by incessant audio cues. There are sub-plots of sub-plots. There is a love triangle and double crosses. There are lots of decapitations for a PG-13 movie. There are a lot of forced and unnecessary connections to the Jackson LOTR movies. The editing is often a blurry mess of nonsense, but to be honest I was never all that bored. Without Bennedict Cumberbach, the whole show could have been a lot worse than it is. So it isn't a great film, but it is a decent action movie. Albeit one that could shed an hour or more of fat. Overall, Desolation has even less in common with the book than the first film. But movies are movies and books are books. So Desolation of Smaug is an absolutely awful adaptation of The Hobbit, but it is also generally an entertaining movie. This may be as good as it gets. When the dragon is gone, I'm assuming in the next movie, we will be barraged by a lot of shots of CGI armies numbering in the thousands throwing spears, arrows and swords. I was bored of that before Peter Jackson did it ten years ago.",6,7,14,16 December 2013
Batman Begins," New Beginning
","As a longtime fan of the Batman comic I am always glad to hear a new Batman movie. The amazing thing about the Batman character over most other super heroes is that Batman has NO powers. He is just a guy, a rich guy yes, but not super human in any respect. Unlike Superman or most other titans, this guy can be killed and won't come back from the dead, of course the comic brings in new writers and they start another story line parallel for the character.Which is what Batman Begins is all about, a new take.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton Batman film. Batman Returns is a good movie, but it didn't work as good and wasn't as much fun as the first film. The Joel Schumacher films pretty much turned it into a ride at Universal Studios Orlando. Batman and Robin was a sad deprecation of a once great character. Bruce Wayne and Batman had only a small cameo in a movie that seemingly tried to fit every Batman villain in the past 30 years into some part.Thank you David Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Essentially they have turned Batman into a Michael Mann film. Batman Begins is the story about a man who has a tough job to do in a dirty place. He isn't a machine and doesn't live in a video game. We know why he does what he does. For the first time since the first Spiderman, we get an action movie that tells us why the character is in action. The insert scenes of flashbacks of Bruce with his father go a long way in adding up our main character.Thanks to a beautiful, forceful score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard the brood of Gotham and the force of the Batman character come to life in a big way.All the actors in the movie play their necessary parts and because they are all so distinguished, we never question if they are even necessary to the plot, frankly we don't care. All the actors are so good we want to see them on screen and just hang out. It is the same feeling I got when I was a kid watching Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, John Wayne and Walter Brennan sit in a jail and sing just to pass the time in Rio Bravo. Good work by all involved.Comparisons to the elder Batty film of 1989 will come up. Which one is better? Not sure, I think Nicholson was so dang good as Joker for me its a hard call to see anybody reprising that role. Overall I think both films compliment each other.Just as legends in history can be told and retold with pieces of the story changing every time, comic book stories that are so well grounded like Batman can be retold.The band may be different, but the song remains the same.",9,7,10,16 June 2005
Twilight," Goofy
","I saw this on a dare when it came out.I had a friend who said I - as a dude - would not have the guts to not only pay for the ticket, but also sit through this movie without a girl with me. Challenges are like ants to the soles of my shoes. I came, I saw, I sat to the end.So yes I won, but at what cost?Well it's 90 mins I could have contributed something to society with that I'll never get back, however as Bella knows, we make our choices in life and that is that. Twilight is about as awkward and goofy a production as anything I've ever seen. Kristin Stewart, this gen's Jennifer Love Hewitt, loves shaking her head around before and after every line of dialog. I was shaking my head before and after every line of her dialog too. Robert Pattison I believe to have actual talent behind all that white powder on his face, but he phoned in his lines here. Or at least it was on purpose for us to believe he was faking it all along. I'm not sure how interesting it could be really. Twilight is essentially a story about a bad relationship.Ah I'm giving it far to much credit already. in the end it's completely harmless. There's no mystery why the core story is so attractive for those seeking romantic escapism. You know, Twilight is so bad and so trashy you sort of feel sorry for it.That's how bad relationships start.",1,8,11,15 May 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Greedy as a dwarf and Pete's Dragon: Or How Bilbo Disappeared Without a Ring
","Making a film from a book comes down not to 'intent,' but spirit. We can debate an author's 'intent' for ages, but spirit is something more universally agreed upon. While the Lord of the Rings was a massive literary undertaking, the Hobbit was a small story about a small guy out to get some gold and slay a dragon. While the Lord of the Rings movies made notable changes, they kept the sprawling and epic spirit of the original books. With the Hobbit, in the battle to live up to, upstage and match Lord of the Rings, it has lost the small and relatively simple underpinnings of why it is so enduring and accessible.First off, while technically it is an accomplished work, it's no masterpiece of storytelling. We don't know, learn or watch anything insightful about who Bilbo Baggins is. The movie largely depends on the prejudices we have from the Lord of the Rings movies. But even after reading all the books and seeing all the other movies, I kept wondering, who is this Bilbo guy? A lot of people may already know the books, myself included, but despite Martin Freeman's competent take on the character, he was largely invisible in the story, even without the ring.Unless it has to do with the larger mythology at work from a number of other works by J.R.R Tolkien, there's just about three chapters worth of story from the actual Hobbit book here. I'm not on a quest of how 'faithful' Peter Jackson was or wasn't to the original book, per say. Tolkien went back and tinkered George Lucas style innumerably with the Hobbit after Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit people read today differs in some key areas from the one readers first took up in 1937.What I am saying is, frankly, there really isn't a whole lot going on for three hours. Shire, quest, bad guys, running, elves, Gollum, running, bad guys. Mountain.That's the entire movie. It could very well be the other three LOTR movies in summary also. The action is well done, but mostly unmotivated. When things bog, I can almost hear Peter Jackson pressing the Goblin button. 'Ah the audience must be shifting after 15 minutes of exposition by these old guys, time to throw in some battle scenes.' I think if you simply accept this is just the first in a serialized story, and you're OK with the idea that this is just a prelude piece of mixed quality, then the Hobbit is worth the money. But as a standalone film, it fails in as much as we've already seen this movie done by the same people a few years ago.If you saw Fellowship of the Ring, you have already seen this movie. It almost feels like a remake. The helicopter shots could have been recycled as well as the filming locations and set piece placements. I know it's the same universe but man, there's a real lifelessness to the whole thing. The actors are all excellent, but it's the writing and production that seem awfully stale. There's a feeling, much like George Lucas in the prequels, Peter Jackson is a little more fascinated with his toys in this than the story. I'm sure there was a lot of things in this movie for many people to enjoy, but I just couldn't shake the feeling this, like that last Harry Potter movie, is a pure money grab. Throwing in the mythological expansions, I can accept maybe two movies from this core story. Three? No. That's just pure dwarfish greed. Or perhaps Pete's inner Dragon.ABOUT HFR 48 FPS:I'm amazed it ever got all that much press. This is nothing new. They've been over cranking movie shutters for more than 100 years. In some scenes the effect is similar to a Charlie Chaplain movie. In others, it is indeed reminiscent of an old BBC Dr. Who episode. The higher frame rate however does give a FAR better 3D presentation. The 24 FPS 3D is pretty much a waste of money and is a dark murky affair with the glasses on. The real problem is the 3D effect is so pronounced and clear, the actors are even more separated from the background and other computer characters which basically looks like people talking in front of a green screen. The camera moves are a little jerky with the higher frame rate and future uses of HFR would be advised to use softer lighting pallets, and smoother, slower whip pans as there is no longer the blur frames to smooth out the movement visually. Other than that, I think it's largely a manufactured controversy to sap more money from your wallet. HFR is the best way to see the movie, there are indeed problems, but it's not that big a deal.",6,11,29,16 December 2012
Gone Girl," Presumed Fatal Bound Innocent Attraction.
","The book was terrible and the movie is just as bad.How such a blatant and amateurish rip from Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent and even a dash of Agatha Christie's Endless Night ever found an audience, is beyond me. Look even if the story is drivel and the plot is a giant gaping hole of 'no F****ng way!' the real problem with this heap is the actors. I never believed for one second Pike and Affleck. Not only do they lack any chemistry dramatically, I'm wondering if Fincher ever bothered to do second takes. Every freaking scene in this 'thriller' plays so flat. The movie looks flat, it is acted flat and even when you're laughing at how plot holes make the Death Star look like Science Fact, you're falling asleep. So yes, it's trash. It's a massive rip off of a genuinely good mystery/legal boiler novel. But yeah, I just didn't believe any of it. Fincher was on auto pilot. Pike was annoying and Affleck looks like a CGI puppet for two and a half hours. Even if you're fascinated by what drives infidelity, this movie has nothing real to say on the subject other than women are plotting, bloodletting liars and men are philandering victims. There's far better trash out there to eat two hours and some popcorn than this steamer. Gone girl should stay gone.Fincher gave up years ago. After four consecutive duds, I'm not touching anything with his name on it again.",3,2,4,25 December 2015
Django Unchained," Waltz Unchained. Django Unseen
","I applaud Tarantino's drive to write movies only for his actors. In comparison to David Fincher and Christopher Nolan who use the actor as a prop to the plot, Tarantino's every word is to serve the actor first and foremost. Often, it pays off such in the case of Jackie Brown. It can also backfire, however. Inglorious Basterds was simply a Mamet-esque demo reel to the point of being painfully boring. While Django Unchained is a big improvement on Basterds, its pleasures don't exactly come free of charge.Django is a recycling and reworking of the Basterds formula into pre Civil War Texas. Instead of a band of forgettable commandos claiming Nazi souls, we are gifted Chris Waltz and Jamie Foxx claiming bounty poster heads. Waltz is virtuoso and while Foxx is good, he's strictly a supporting role. You never really identify with Django and it's mostly in Tarantino's lap for that. The social aspects will undoubtedly offend with a tiring use of the N- Word and violence that tests any decency, but if you take any of this seriously, the joke is on you.The whipping scenes and table talk violence are all carried over as is the feeling the editor was out to lunch and Tarantino took the print right to the distributor. There's at least twenty or thirty minutes to trim out here that would easily make this good movie into a great one. Also, Tarantino's Aussie cameo is the worst acting performance in a film since Eli Roth's gag inducing turn in Basterds. And Jonah Hill, really? REALLY?All that being said, it's good stuff for the most part. By this point, the violence has been done to death so to speak and I wonder why he bothers anymore with it. Other than QT and one or two other useless cameos, performances are all solid. Sam Jackson really putting a signature stamp on a character that would be tricky, if not impossible to do right in any other hands.It's worth seeing just to laugh your Blazing Saddle butt off for the holes in the hoods scene.",7,3,10,30 December 2012
Drive," A 'Mann' Driven
","Here's the deal.Drive is an unapologetic riff of pretty much every loner crime revenge story ever made and total line descendant of Michael Mann's Thief from 1980, . So much so, that thanks to the bubbly soundtrack, it seems they might as well have filmed it in 1980 too. Drive is a small-time crime story told with great restraint on characterizations and great explosiveness when it comes to violence. As far as modern influences go, Drive is a sort of crazy hybrid of Paul Verhoeven's Spetters and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight (Sydney) throw in the last few Cronenberg movies while you're at it. While I don't quite understand the negativity so many haters seem to have for Drive, I understand why some people could be so frustrated by it. Drive is told with Nicolas Winding Refn's European eye for detail and tone. Drive is the definition of character study with a heavy emphasis on STUDY. There is very little quick cutting between camera setups and absolutely zero sitcom-esque axial cut dialog scenes. It is the antithesis of the way most American movies are made. We have been conditioned as a society to watch boxes of talking heads broken up with pointless jabber and largely bloodless violence. Now how you interpret Drive's way to tell a story is largely a question of style and sensibility. Drive is not for every taste and probably not something you'll be in the mood to watch 24/7, but it is very well done when you have the time to invest in it. While it breaks no new ground - and if you think it does, you must have been born yesterday - Drive is a really immersive odyssey of moments and music. It's essentially the cruise through LA crime movie Michael Mann tried to make with the Hit-Man centered Collateral. Drive is better.",8,3,5,11 May 2012
The Hurt Locker," Yeah right
","This is a tough one. How do I review this movie? Is it an action flick? Is it a war flick? Or is the Hurt Locker a social comment on the Iraq experience?While some will claim the movie is all three of those things, I personally don't know the answer and after watching the Hurt Locker I'm quite sure neither does director Kathryn Bigelow.The Hurt Locker is a movie full of all the right intentions, a lot of competent actors, and many many camera setups. But there is not one powerful scene, not one notable performance and not a single memorable image for all its two hours of run time.We follow a group of U.S. Soldiers, but it feels like they are the only group in all of Baghdad. Intentional or budgetary restraints? We roam the anarchic streets of Baghdad (which, credit to the filmmakers, actually feels like a real Arab country. And after seeing the movie, I learned they went all the way to Jordan. Bravo, as the setting actually feels authentic.) We disarm a lot of bombs and enter many uncertain doorways. While the movie aims to be exciting, I just couldn't 'suspend disbelief' when the director is trying so hard to be realistic by shaking the camera so much. And why can't a troupe of former British SAS officers handle a handful of insurgents in an empty cinder block shed. I call shenanigans.OK I understand the idea of dramatic license, but there is no way a former SAS sharpshooter is going to miss a shot, die from a window sniper half a mile away and an American G.I. will save the day taking over on the guy's Barrett .50 cal.. I'm not putting anybody down here, but I would bet most people with some sort of know will be with me in saying 'Yeah Right.' This scene is a poster child for the movie at large - like most of the movie, makes little sense and very little is rooted in any sort of reality. But the camera shakes so its oh so real! Quite frankly I laughed my butt off in the sequence.Dude, she made Point Break...POINT BREAK! How could you expect any different? If you haven't figured it out by this point, Kathryn Bigelow isn't going into the books as one of the greats. From what I read, the crew shot endless setups to get a 'documentary feel.' Well as a documentary photographer I can tell you, to document something, you only really need one camera. The rest depends on vision. Something Kathryn Bigelow doesn't have.The script is laughable, the characters forgettable, and the direction completely platitudinous, the only Hurt Locker is the seat you're stuck in until this turkey plays itself out.",5,197,345,11 January 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Green Goblin is all hairspray
","Heavy handed, transparent, boring and redundant. This is the state of every single super hero movie released in the last few years. Somehow, the Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to up the ante in every department. I don't even remember what I saw after two and a half hours. This movie is more heavy handed, more transparent and more boring than just about any I can think of. A fan only of the first Raimi job, these Webb movies in particular, are utterly soulless. Garfield isn't bad, but he's not that interesting. It could be because he's not on screen doing a whole lot other than spilling his faux emotional state of mind all the time, or that he's just not a good actor. I can't decide.Jamie Foxx is good but Green Goblin is just abominable, just awful. I'm going to end it there, there's nothing left to tell.",5,10,22,1 May 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Vapid But Not Totally Forgettable
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is Oscar bait. But whatever awards may or may not come, it is a film with a clever premise but absent an engaging story. It is a good film with a few great moments and characters. However it is not a great film. This is going to be the first David Fincher movie I will not buy for my personal collection.Benjamin Button is a bit Titanic and a bit more Forrest Gump as if it were made by Jean Pierre Jeunet. Naturally David Fincher, a Jeunet contemporary and associate, would typically be the best thing for this type of film. Zemeckis was probably a bit too, happy-go-lucky with Forrest Gump, also written by Button scribe Eric Roth, who seems to love overwriting multi- character historical epics. And while the stories are vastly different, there are a multitude of similarities in tone and execution to Jeunet's 'A Very Long Engagement.' And like that film, Button suffers from the same issues of pacing, redundancy. Also, both films try, often without success to be too clever and end up being much too boring.One facet of the story that deserves notice above others, are the supporting characters. Sure Pitt and Blanchet are decent. But they are hardly the main attraction. Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's mother and Jared Harris as the tug boat skipper are clear standouts and deserve recognition for their work.Benjamin Button is most enjoyable in the first section, when Button is an old man. His early years are by far the most involving and pay-off the gimmicky premise the best. I don't want to reveal too much of the story, because it is one worth seeing in general. Unfortunately the second half of the film fares, by design, more predictably and far less involving. Many attempts at drama such as Benajmin's time with his father fell a bit flat and the humming bird metaphor felt weak and contrived.I would say my most obvious reaction to this film was that Fincher simply did not seemed very interested in these characters, nothing to invest in their emotions. There are numerous scenes that are filmed very artfully, but never felt more than filling time and empty space. Fincher's camera, and thus his eye, are far more interested in Button when he was young and at his most curious. The later years of love and loss, are endlessly bland and procedural and an ending that seemed more at home in an episode of ER than in an epic love story. The truth is the film had probably ended about 20 minutes earlier and by that time, everyone involved had overstayed their welcome. So no I would never buy Benjamin Button for my Blu-Ray player. I have been following Fincher ever since Alien3. I found his twisted visual sense to be enjoyable to the last drop. Seven and Fight Club are wondrous in their trickery and The Game and Zodiac are moralistic troves down dark alleys of the mind. Even Panic Room is one of my favorite thrillers because it was full of life and unexpected turns. But with Benjamin button, Fincher has strayed from his flock. We feel every turn before we get there, because of the premise, we know the way to the end and its not much interesting when we get there. Sure its a sad story, but it isn't a very interesting one. And no matter how well the film is made, there is a feeling of disappointment one cannot ignore. There is really no reason to watch this more than once. If you wish to see a deliberate story of love lost and a life unattainable, I point you to Kubrick's timeless Barry Lyndon. One last thing is on the technical side. Being a photographer, there are some points I will pick at. This is the second time Fincher has used the Viper digital camera system. The film is purposely desaturated, but just like with Zodiac, the digital capture just cannot capture light in a truly luminous manor. Almost every image just looks flat, devoid of snap. And just like Zodiac and some pieces of the Viper-filmed Miami Vice, the images tend to be a tad soft, probably because the Viper cannot resolve the same level of detail of film---yet anyway. So props to Claudio Miranda for his craft, but the equipment still has a ways to go.",6,3,6,25 December 2008
Transformers," Just like Old Times
","I saw this in Orange on a digital screen on one of the early screenings and kept going back.OK I'm 27 and long ago boxed up my transformers from childhood. But I had to see this movie. If you're like me, you remember Optimus Prime, the hero of heroes. Since Star Wars has come and gone, there are few articles of childhood left to see again on the big screen. Transformers is one of those toy marketing schemes that actually made interesting characters, and of course, sold a lot of toys.I am highly skeptical of Michael Bay. Not only does he make crappy movies, but he has to destroy a nice car in the middle of it all. But here, I give the guy a pass.I like to see my home state on the silver screen too. They filmed the 'Qatar' scenes in Alamogordo, New Mexico. So about this movie...I was entranced from beginning to end. The dialog was sometimes a little to rapid fire and nervous, poor megan fox had almost nothing to do, some characters were out of place and plotting weird, but in the end, the film is a winner.The effects really do sell the film in every scene. Bumble Bee, Optimus, all of them are extremely well 'acted' by the talented computer animators. There needs to be some kind of acting award besides special effects for this thing.Yeah, megatron comes up out of nowhere. Lots of the plot make little sense, but hey I sat down and watched some old episodes on Youtube and found that i couldn't even follow what the hell was going on in the cartoon. I would say in the movie, they made an improvement with plotting.The Decepticons are effectively menacing, especially when Barricade confronts Sam on the hood of a car. That one was actually pretty startling. I've had nightmares as a kid being chased by giant killer robots and yeah, this one got a little close. Enough of my freudian fears.This movie delivered, it was superbly entertaining and very very well done. I don't quite acquit Michael bay for Pearl Harbor or destroying the Ferrari 355 in The ROCK, but here, he gets a pass. Can't wait for the multi disc DVD. Bring on the sequels.",8,4,6,29 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force does not belong to you
","Return of the Jedi was the very first movie I saw in a theater and while starting at the (at that time) end may have not been the best start, what is really? Every Star Wars movie can be somebody's first Star Wars movie. Since very little was accomplished in The Force Awakens other than introducing a few new characters, The Last Jedi proves itself in numerous ways to be the actual sequel to Return of the Jedi. Since release, I have seen The Last Jedi five times. It gets better with every viewing. Characters feel better fleshed out, ideas are significantly bigger and deeper than anything in The Force Awakens or the Prequels and there's a far bigger personal stamp on the film from the director than anything since Empire for me. It wasn't a big surprise to see the 'blow back' from some people who didn't like the film as it wouldn't be a true Star Wars film without fan reprisals against a Star Wars film. If you think the Last Jedi, the Prequels or Return of the Jedi ruined your childhood - because in 40 years I've heard all of that, go make your own movie. That's exactly how Star Wars came about in the first place. Star Wars may live in your imagination, but it doesn't belong to you. And if you can't cope with the reality on film after 34 years of waiting I have nothing for you. Nothing made me happier than Rian Johnson trashing J.J. Abrams hollow mysteries, copy-cat characters and dead end narratives he made a career doing since Alias, Lost, Star Trek and Super 8 all the way into the Force Awakens (which is a dead in the water remake), in favor of something more original and nuanced. If you don't like it, you should just go make your own movies. That's exactly what George Lucas did when he realized HIS Flash Gordon couldn't be made - he went off and made Star Wars instead. In his own words:
'I realized that Flash Gordon is like anything you do that is established,' he says. 'That is, you start out being faithful to the original material, but eventually it gets in the way of the creativity. I realized that Flash Gordon wasn't the movie I wanted to do; if I had done it, I would've had to have Ming the Merciless in it-and I didn't want to have Ming the Merciless. I decided at that point to do something more original. I knew I could do something totally new. I wanted to take ancient mythological motifs and update them-I wanted to have something totally free and fun, the way I remembered space fantasy.'

Guardians of the Galaxy," Better than most, but could have been better
","Marvel is their own worst enemy. Any ideas in this movie that were good, and there were more than most of thee Marvel movies, they don't get any credit for them. All claps go to James Gunn, his actors and his Chewbacca/Han Solo destroying duo of Rocket and Groot. Yes I said it. Give those two their own movie already.I've seriously lost count how many times we have seen this battle fortress ending in a movie, let alone Marvel movies. Yes yet another movie with a flying fortress air ship battle lifted from Return of the Jedi. Look Jedi was the first movie I ever saw. It is burned into my head when I saw it more than 30 years ago and it made this type of action finale what it is today and at this point, there is no reason to do it again. But Marvel keeps digging it up. I don't even give two clasps about Thanos this or Ronan that gobbledygook garbage. That stuff is clearly pushed into the script in heavy portions by the Marvel heads when Gunn was clearly onto something all by himself. There are many many other ways to end a movie without that freaking clichÃ©, but I guess the CG for this stuff is prefab. Despite all these misgivings, the movie does succeed.The ridiculous Ronan seems lifted directly from Animal House's Neidermeyer, the movie really lacks any sense of suspense but the exchanges of the Guardians anchor the movie with Mo- Town and 70s pop muzak. Somewhere in there is a better movie without air fortress battles and 'there's to many of them' quotes lifted from Star Wars, but you'll laugh enough to pay for the ticket.",7,0,4,4 August 2014
The Dark Knight," Fire in the Knight
","Gotham city has seen better days.The Joker's terror campaign has both the public, and even its criminals living in fear. One day, Alfred relates a story of his early days in Burma, to a ponderous Bruce Wane. He tells Mr. Wayne how he and his men began to hunt a jewel thief who was on a killing rampage in the jungle. A man who actually threw the jewels he stole away, because this was just a man 'who wanted to watch the world burn.'Bruce asks Alfred how did they catch him?'We burnt the jungle down.'The opening images of Batman announces this theme of fire, with the Bat signal simmering among blue flames. Gotham has indeed seen better days. And the opening of the film announces, better days are not coming soon. As the joker announces, 'people will die tonight, I'm a man of my worrrrd.' Oh yes, the jungle is going to burn down, by one hand or the next.In the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan clearly strove to do justice to the Batman character and the world he inhabits to degrees and depths of character rarely seen before in a 'comic book' movie. He has delivered a true epic. Though he still hasn't a clue how to film fight scenes and also dances a fine line of too much story and too many characters. There was obviously more than enough material here for two movies. However, I am very happy things worked out as they did. The movie is a triumph of vision both in the new realization of the joker, and in the practical manifestation of the Two-Face character. Aaron Eckhart is sufficiently pretty and viscous as Harvey Dent. Heath Ledger is hilariously creepy, yet I feel both probably deserved a little more screen time. Again, Nolan was juggling a high wire act with all these characters and themes, but yes again, I feel he was almost without fault in doing so. Both of these characters will be remembered. With the Joker, Jack Nicholson's turn in 1989s Batman was menacing and funny. A bravura performance for sure. But I think there was a touch of nostalgia, and tongue in cheek humor in how he played the role to keep him from being frightening. Heath Ledger, on the other hand has succeeded in bringing a more truthful version of the Joker's homicidal rage from the comic to the screen. Ledger's Joker is funny, but not 'haha' funny. There are no hand buzzers or whoopie cushions here. He's really something to behold on screen and I feel both Batman movies' portrayals can live side by side in their interpretations for some time to come. Famously modeled in some way after Michael Mann's 'Heat,' with Gotham city as the protagonist, the Dark Knight is a chase film of double crosses and revenge killings. It widens the narrative scope of the Batman Begins story-line and confronts the realities of one man's mission and principals to make right, what was once very wrong. This is a film, a true epic film, that engages Batman in a grand struggle against evil, some of which is his own making. Much like in Nolan's 'The Prestige,' the idea of 'getting your hands dirty' reminds us of the type of world that created Batman in the first place; a dark world of shadows and shades of gray. The Dark Knight is a poem of nobility and justice; a story about the futility and illusions of control. This is a story of the struggle between two sides of the same coin. One man who wants to burn the jungle down and another who will burn the jungle down to stop him. In the concluding soliloquy Batman says, 'people deserve something better than the truth.' I couldn't agree more. America too has seen better days and this Batman is wondrous pure fiction at the right time. It's a venture down the obscured paths of humanity about a Knight among the darkness. You bet this is better than the truth. This stuff is why we go to the movies in the first place.",10,7,15,18 July 2008
Avatar," You could do worse
","Hailed as a 'game changer' for movies going forward, this really just feels like a Disney movie helmed by the guy who did Aliens. And that is what we get.Pocohontas in 3D. That is what Avatar is. There isn't much else to be gleamed here. Sure the film is a near apology of the militaristic and weaponry worship James Cameron peppered his other films with. But at the end of the day, it's still just Pocahontas.Don't get me wrong. There are one or two wow scenes, and they are not dependent on 3D. But it really feels like Cameron wrote the final battle, then worked backward to make sure all his pay-offs fit just right. Kinda thin folks. And though it does keep you going to the credits, I won't be paying to see it again and this is in no way a 'game changer.'As for the benefits of 3D? By this point I've seen half a dozen movies in 3D theatrically in the last couple years and Avatar has not changed what I felt about the experience. With some exception, after about 15 minutes, the sensation of 3D wears off. Your eyes adjust and you are still left with a somewhat lumbering two and a half hour movie. Also, in 3D, the imagery is soft and in 90% of the movie, it contributes nothing. But hey, its worth it just so you can say you saw it in 3D right?Not bad, not great. James Cameron definitely takes to his characters a lot more than George Lucas does, but like the new Star Wars, it seems the toys, not the story are what his films are about now.",6,0,3,22 January 2010
Reservoir Dogs," Nice but not that nice
","Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the 'Comode' soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant. The violence is effective, but not quite affecting. I wanted more cuts, more sets, more plot. Dogs could easily be transplanted to a stage and many times that's where it feels we are watching it, which to me isn't a good thing.On the whole its a great first film of course. If we only view films in the context of the time they were released, ET and Star Wars would never be surpassed in their brilliance, thankfully that is not the case. Dogs is good, but not as Brilliant as Empire magazine and other Dogs zealots would have you believe. My advice? Show the robbery in silence from a black and white security cam at the VERY end with the credits rolling and you have a better movie. I like it, I really do, but its not a Rashomon or Rio Bravo. Reservoir Dogs is a nice Point Blank. Nicely entertaining, convincingly executed and completely ineffectual.",7,1,3,7 December 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Strange Love
","Like other Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is interesting but also a bit of a strange film. Perhaps that is being too definite or even unkind. Most of Stanley Kubrick's films are simply unlike any other. So yes, Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. There are some very bizarre, moments in the movie, but this is precisely what makes it work the way it does. Whatever faults the work may posses, and these too may be debatable, the movie is a memorable and complete work of originality.Eyes Wide Shut is a classically constructed work that is both very simple but also complex and full of depth. It is mysterious, sexy and also quite funny. While the leads Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman aren't particularly sharp, there are some great performances in the varied cast, mostly from the side characters that pop in from time to time. Rade Serbedzija and Allen Cumming are two of the many standouts.If you're familiar with the Arthur Schnitzler original novella, you'll find the core story to be very faithful. Without laying out a lengthy synopsis, which this complex film would require, it is safe to say this is essentially a fantasy film. Schnitzler's story confronted the fantasies, temptations and occasional ambiguities of marriage. More to the point, as a plot point in the film eludes to, the notion of fidelity.The story unfolds in a series of small vignettes, all revolving around the notion of sexual attraction and the fantasy of such. It is never truly made clear of what parts we are seeing could be true, or what could be essentially a fantasy. As the final lines of the book and the movie lay out to us, Some things are real and others are just fantasy. It is a very clever and rich way for a story to unfold. Well that's the idea anyway.Examining the film's strengths and weaknesses, you may find, there really is no way to find any solid faults. In execution, much like Full Metal Jacket, the movie has an uneven pace of plotting. While Barry Lyndon's deliberate method of story-telling was highly appropriate. The Shining's slow but steady pace also had its advantages. Here in Eyes Wide Shut, I feel the main flaw is the movie could move much faster.Some individual scenes play out absolutely flat, most of these being the scenes between Cruise and Kidman. But even as they can feel flat, these scenes can also be seen as highlighting the monotony of their married life. But pacing wise, they just don't work. On the other hand, the pace and plotting are far more engaging than the similar, but abominable 'Mulholland Drive' from David Lynch. There are moments of great depth and visual power in this film. I don't see how more original a film can be made in fact. Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is fearless in examining the timeless issue of fidelity. When is fantasy good? When is it dangerous? What conversations with your significant other are better left unsaid? These questions are handled in a much more mature and profound way than the occasional schlock nonsense of a Woody Allen relationship film where people complain for an hour and a half. While Eyes Wide Shut is flawed in some ways, it is also a wonderful and memorable trip worth taking if you have an open mind and aren't expecting Sleepless in Seattle. Uneven but interesting and completely original.",8,2,4,19 January 2009
Thor," Thunder? More smoke and mirrors
","Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.",5,26,48,13 September 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Let me explain this....Spoilers SO BEWARE!
","I am hard pressed to think of another movie that is more exposition than story.(For the uninformed, Exposition is the term in movie land for the part of the script that outlines the plot to the audience.)It feels like every ten minutes that someone comes along and gives some sort of speech to explain the plot.  Exposition should be the smallest part of the story, yet in RELOADED it is the movie.  Yes, Yes I'm sure most of what went on will tie into part 3 but the problem is that this has to be a movie unto itself, not just a piece of tape connecting the first and third movies.  The only real story happens in the last twenty minutes. Too boot, with Neo's new powers you never feel any sense of danger toward the characters since he can just resurrect them.Another problem is the scene with the Architect.  In UNIX, everything is made as small as possible, since there are so many parts to the operating system - compact simplicity. For a computer, the Architect gives explanations that are far too long winded.  He speaks like a New York lawyer or more like Yoda on Demorol than a computer, I don't buy it (Unless he and Councillor Hamann are in cahoots, they have similar philosophies and look alike).Tired action. The action scenes left much to be desired.  Unlike the first movie that utilized a complex rig of high-speed cameras to deal with bullet time, RELOADED instead opts for all CG actor shots.  I can accept it for the HULK but here, I don't buy it.  It looks fake, and its not interesting anymore.  The camera work in the fighting scenes was poor in the sense that you never feel the urgency of the action - you never feel a part of it. To put insult to injury, all the big action pieces were on the trailer.  To clear up the myth that there is something new that will be like bullet time was to the first movie.  There isn't anything new to me.Good stuff? Trinity has an awesome scene with Persephone - real big laugh.  We needed more characters like Persephone.  The second movie in a trilogy is where you get to know characters, not where you introduce them all.  Morpheus has an awesome scene where he takes down the 'Twins' truck with a samurai sword.  And Agent Smith has become more interesting than any of the good guys, 'Me, Me, Me'In the end I will need to wait awhile and cool of, before I see it again.  I had high hopes for this one.  I was a victim of the incessant media buzz and promotion that builds up a movie to a level it can never attain.My advice is to avoid all the buzz and see this with a clear mind.  I saw this with a group of 6 people and we all seemed to agree the movie was full of problems.  I don't hate this movie but I certainly didn't enjoy it very much.  I feel bad about it too, because I remember how much I loved the first movie.",1,0,0,15 May 2003
Die Hard," One heck of a ride
","Die Hard is one heck of a movie. When I first saw it 14 years ago, some time after it had hit video and HBO, my eyes had been opened to a new type of film. I had seen so called action movies before, but nothing held my attention as Die Hard did. The violence was shocking and at the same time, exhilarating. Only years later would I see the effect the movie had on John Woo and his references to Die Hard in both The Killer and Hard Boiled. The villains were clearly bad, but there was a good deal of charisma they carried along with some welcome humor. The bad guys in many 1980s action flicks all tended to be some evil grinning villain happy to scream, shoot and rape their way to nirvana. In Die Hard, Hans and his GQ group of terrorist/thieves shoot when necessary and have enough human quality to make them believable and entertaining. I had only known Bruce Willis from watching his great turn as David Addison in the TV show Moonlighting. He was witty, smart, and funny. I didn't know Willis could expand until I saw Die Hard. Yes he carries a quiet presence in The Sixth Sense, but I still think he does his most entertaining work in the original Die Hard. He is strong, but funny. Angry but not ranting as the cop from New York. It is a performance full of confidence and fun.The construction of the film is fantastic. Michael Kamen's music score is memorable, Jan de Bont's great lighting give the film a signature look to complement director John McTiernan's skilled use of the camera. The sets are all well made and play their part, as the Nakatomi building is indeed a character along with the other supporting players.The sequel 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' was not much but blood and bombs. The bad guys were all mean, ugly, grinning paper cut-outs. There were some memorable pieces to Die Hard with a Vengeance, but they all lack the qualities that made the original so good. You can't just throw in a bunch of bullets and call it a Die Hard movie, that much is sure.The action scenes are fantastic and much emulated. The gun play is messy, loud, and exciting. Again, the level of violence was unlike anything I had seen in 1991, (Yes it came out in 1987, but I was only 7 years old). The sight of a terrorist's legs bursting into chunks becomes a common one as John mows down his opposition. I love the scene where Willis drops the chair rigged with C4. 'They're using artillery on us!' 'No you idiot its not the police....Its him.' Fantastic. The jump from the roof with the fire hose is another classic moment filmed perfectly in slow motion.As I watch Die Hard today in 2005, one can see continuity errors abound. Plot points don't quite add up, and one begins to wonder how this movie could ever be remade, now that every guest on the 30th floor would have a cell phone to call the cops.I love watching Die Hard. It is a movie made with a skill from a group of incredibly skilled people. Now days as its been 'Die Hard on a this or Die Hard on a that' this level of originality is hard to come by in action movies. Why watch any knock off when the original is just as entertaining as it was in 1987. **** 10/10",10,1,2,12 January 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This ain't David Lean people, this is Transformers
","Michael Bay has finally found what was missing in all his other movies. He had the explosions. He had the military guys. He had the hugging and kissing shots of perfect looking people with the sun flare behind them.But now he has giant robots shooting freaking laser beams at each other. His vision is complete.Now I've read reviews and some of the criticisms are valid and others are just out of the park garbage. Its a miracle a movie series has been made of what was essentially a string of toy commercials. And I dare you to fire up an old episode of the series and tell me if any of what happens on screen makes any sense at all. Also, by simply buying a ticket to a movie called 'transformers' you are preventing yourself from making any dramatic criticisms of this type of movie. It's like saying a roller-coaster is too bumpy. This isn't opera people. Revenge of the Fallen isn't art. This is a mega-budget B movie pornography of computer generated robot war. And its damn good at it too.Was the story more thought out in the first movie? Yep. Does it run too long? Absolutely. Are some of the stereotypes out of place? Probably.But Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was loud, vicious fun, very entertaining and I will be happy to line up and see it again.",7,2,6,24 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," Of Derrick's and Godfathers
","OK, lets get this out of the way. I liked There Will Be Blood. It has a solid cast, great setting and great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, but is he ever anything other than great? So yeah, the first third is quite astonishing. But then it drops from astonishing to a slow simmer, and finally to a 'well time to get my jacket, I think this one is almost over.' There Will Be Blood is striking at times, old-fashioned at others. But for much of the film, i believe it is also a bit one note. Also, PT Anderson and DP Robert Elswitt need a better focus puller, either that or this digital projection i saw is out of calibration, it just seemed like there was a lot of missed focus.There Will Be Blood is a lot like The Godfather Part 2. For some people, that is all they need to hear. For some reason, many people think Godfather 2 is vastly superior to the original. I am not in that group of people. How can you possible think Godfather 2 is better than part 1? I mean really now? Back to my point...So Godfather 2 is about the corruption of Michael Corleone. The film begins, and it isn't too long before we notice Michael is quite shrewd, in fact, he is corrupt. Save for the wonderful flashbacks, mostly of De NIro and Bruno Kirby, we watch for 3 hours on how corrupt Michael Corleone is, until the final image and find we are either bored to tears thinking 'Ok I get it, he is corrupt.' Or as some others think 'Oh my this is a profound study of corruption and power! What a masterpiece!'Riiiiiight.Well the same applies here in There Will Be Blood. The film begins and we are shown a hard- working business man and then all too quickly we find, he is not just hard working, he is greedy. For nearly three hours we see greed in one form or another. In the final scene we lean back and think one of two things. 'Ok I get it, he was greedy.' Or, as many critics or viewers may think, 'My god what a wonderful study on the depths of human greed!'Riiiiiight.Well much like Godfather 2 or Natural Born Killers, after a few minutes we get the point and then for another three hours, it just goes in circles until somebody is beat to a pulp and the credits roll.Call that whatever you like, but brilliant isn't it.I'm finished.",7,2,11,16 February 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," All you need is Keiji
","Edge of Tomorrow is a terrible title. But it is an awesome movie. I'm one of those jaded moviegoers who has seen everything in nearly 40 years. I even read the original Sakurazaka novella and was expecting a horror show. I don't even like Tom Cruise, but darn it, I honest to goodness enjoyed the heck out of this movie. Is it flawed? Of course it is! The opening premise is shaky. I just can't side with Hollywood replacing Japanese characters with bankable names like Cruise and Cage should be Keiji and played by a Japanese actor. But I'm going to let this stuff pass. Emily Blunt was tough as nails - and that's been a hard sell for Hollywood. Tough women - Linda Hamilton tough - haven't been handled well by the studios and that's not saying the women aren't out there. Blunt pulls off the famous red warrior with ease. I'll even say it - Cruise does a good job, however, I still cringe when proper story and characters are buried in favor of the same old faces.And then there's that ending ripped right from Pacific Rim. We know it's coming. Even when i finished the novella, I knew it would never fly in Hollywood. That and it's quite a bit more complicated. Or maybe Liman filmed it all but the test audiences hated it. There's no telling. But I still enjoyed the ride.Basically: Slaughterhouse Five + Groundhog Day + Pacific Rim + Elysium = Edge of Tomorrow. The movie is - literally - about ten movies you have already seen 1000 times. And it is awesome.",8,1,2,8 June 2014
Inception," Give him the kick
","Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet. The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you til it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10",8,12,23,18 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," No gray little cells were used in the making of this story
","Kenneth Branagh somehow got away with murder here because as both star and director, he drains the life from the vibrant Belgian Hercule Poirot and an infamous case that can't seem to have enough remakes. This one is enough. I have no idea what Branagh was thinking. The movie is poorly made, full of ridiculously phony CGI backgrounds, terrible acting - this cannot be understood - and an ever-present blanket of boredom. No tension, no intrigue and no depth to character. If you want to watch this instead of properly read the original story, there are no less than four or five choices ranging from superb to passable. This is one to pass, to forget and ultimately to avoid at all costs. David Suchet and Branagh were both Shakespearian trained and I always thought Branagh got a free pass in most of the Shakespeare productions he gained notoriety for. Suchet, in contrast, has always disappeared into his parts unlike Branagh who seems to only talk louder and only worked to amplified himself. This movie proves that point. Branagh plays Poirot, indeed the whole thing for a joke - and that is a great disservice to rich material such as this.",4,2,3,14 October 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Been there done that, but fun nonetheless
","This is basically the comedy version of 'From Hell.' Sherlock Holmes it ain't. However, Downey Jr. does a good job despite being a GQ take on Arthur Conan Doyle's creation.In this vision, Sherlock doesn't use Heroine, he is instead a muscle bound boxer. He doesn't play the violin to annoy Watson, instead playing one like a ukulele for captured flies.Watson feels more sidekick than ever, but Jude Law makes the most of it. Rachel McAdams is all window dressing, but almost completely forgettable.Not many surprises and so not much to write about other than this isn't much of a thinker, but a good time. Though it isn't much in the end, Sherlock Holmes is by far the best thing Guy Ritchie has done. Pigs, slo-motion boxing, yep its a Guy Ritchie film, but again, better than he has done before.",7,1,4,26 December 2009
Arrival," All Good Things...
","Very well made overall and I went in completely unspoiled. The language stuff was highly fascinating because it felt really new and like a genuine exploration of some powerful questions.However.This thing has gotta be looked at for being one of the all-time rip offs. By the middle when it became obvious what narrative convention they were using, I actually shouted out 'She's Desomond!' in the theater. If you have seen Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'All Good Things...' or its sister episode of Lost 'The Constant,' you've already seen this movie. Great performances and pretty solid if you haven't watched science fiction television the past 20 years, but my god, it's a rip off.",6,5,10,7 December 2016
Prometheus," Ripley's Believe it or Not (mostly not)
","More is definitely less. There's an old maxim in creative writing. Never TELL your audience - SHOW them. That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too. Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant. On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares. Ridley is much better than this. In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon. Despite how hard the movie tells the audience twe are watching is an Alien 'prequel,' (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive connection to Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3. Those films were at best, riveting. At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring. I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce. From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves in the unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films. One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets. Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in. Then there's the other half. A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags. Oh but there are mysteries. Why do they keep taking the helmets off? Why bother having them at all? Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty 'leftover?' That's just the short end of it. How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans? Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST. He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too? Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had. That last 'reveal' was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.But it's not all bad. Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her. Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end. Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money. I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.Where did humans come from? I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving. It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from. She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked. Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask. Now we know Ripley, now we know.",1,28,53,8 June 2012
Vanilla Sky," Better off getting teeth pulled
","Tom Cruise is at his best here (which sadly means he is horrible) in this painfully watchable film.  Could this be the worst acted movie of the year? Yes.  Could it be Cameron Crowe still doesn't know how to direct a movie? Yes.  Could you find a more silly movie out there this year? No. What we have here is a sorry remake of a better film.  It goes from being The Game, to Phantom of the Opera, to Total Recall and despite that ambitious combination, it can't pull it off.  The structure is quite laughable, the film could have ended any way and there would be nothing to contradict the finale.  Before he jumps at the end, I wondered when the Klingons would begin landing.  Any film that requires fifteen minutes (FIFTEEN!) to explain itself at the end is a waste of my time.  Fight Club did it in a minute, The Others did it in a minute, The Usual Suspects did it in a minute, The Sixth Sense did it in a minute.  Hell in Empire Strikes Back they didn't waste fifteen minutes on why Darth Vader is Luke's pop.  Why then does VANILLA SKY need fifteen minutes to lay out the logic of the story?  Now theres the really mystery.  They would have been better off with an ambiguous ending, explaining the whole thing merely cheapens   most of the film to 'HA! IT WAS ALL FAKE!' status and they can't even pull that off like Usual Suspects did. One good thing:  Great shots of the 250 GTO at the beginning, it looks magnificent in that dark blue.",1,0,4,9 June 2002
The Wolverine," If it bleeds, we can kill it
","This is better than the last go around, but not without a truck load of missed opportunities to do something much better than this. The Wolverine took me to a nice return trip to Japan without the bad airline food and turbulence sitting in coach for 14 hours, but I wished they would have had more for me to do when I got there. Rila Fukushima was a master stroke in casting but damn near wasted with lots of useless dialog and Tao Okamoto doesn't really have much to do. But along with Pacific Rim's Rinko Kikuchi, I'm glad these great actresses from Nihon are getting the play they deserve. It would be nice if they had more to do than pull upright chop sticks from the soba. Like the actors, rich Japanese references were all tossed as background noise and not put to much use in what is essentially a chase movie. Even with the Jean Grey angle, there was a better story in here someplace. Essentially, the filmmakers hinted at it but never pursued better ideas in any seriousness. The themes in The Wolverine lead to many interesting questions which would have made a more powerful movie. 'How does one kill one who cannot die?' or 'Is immortality actually another form of death?' It would have been nice to see a Marvel movie actually try and develop a character for once instead of two more hours of Hulk-Smash scenes. Oh yeah and the Viper villain was just trash. She fell out of Power Rangers or something. Totally out of tone with the rest of the movie.Yes, it could have all been better. But I'll say this, it was a heck of a lot better than the last go around. I'll take that kind of progress over none at all.",7,0,3,28 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bitchy Resting Face: The Movie
","Everybody is Grumpy Cat in this movie. Except without the ensuing laughs. If Lego Movie was about how Everything is Awesome, Dawn of Justice was about how in life, Everything is Awful.Nothing in the $250 Million and two and a half hours of 'movie' moves anything. It's a preposterous act of stasis and inconsequence. The movie was not so much directed as flushed directly to theaters from a mulch of half digested junk food. You can imagine every scene was stitched together with Metallica's Nothing Else Matters playing on loop for the editor's iPod.The acting is terrible, the writing was terrible and most of all the movie was just boring. There's a lot of people talking about how awesome Wonder Woman was, but that's simply not true. Everybody is bad in this. Gal Gadot did just as bad with her few terrible lines. She was just much more interesting to watch do a bad job than everybody else doing a bad job or maybe because for three seconds, she sort of smiles and we all bask in that small ray of joy.I mean, nothing works in this thing. The whole concept is flawed. Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne are the exact same archetype of rich orphans but instead of drawing contrasts, Zach Snyder just lays on the redundancy thick. I'm not even mad really, just sad. By the end, I too had caught the bitchy resting face infecting every other character in the movie. There are probably other things I could say but it's hard to write something more insightful when nothing in the movie mattered at all.",1,19,37,26 March 2016
Blade Runner," Thinner than a runner on a Blade
","Yeah I like Blade Runner. In fact for years, it was one of my top 5 favorite films. And yeah, I still like it. There's flying cars, Rachel...And then there's all that fog.But after all these years, i do see there are holes here and there, and most obviously, the story is thinner than paper.Make no mistake, the cinematography, the atmosphere, the sheer cinematics of it all are still powerful. Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more.I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that.My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with. I love the film when I see it, but I don't think about it all when I'm not watching it. The only thing left is a fog.",8,2,9,24 December 2007
Casino Royale," Winning hand, but not quiet a full house
","Every Bond series is a product of the times. Daniel Craig is the harder reality above the almost 'in-joke' techie nature of the last few movies. I like the film and for the most part they are very good bringing together something fresh, as far as Bond movies go, but not quite anything fresher than Daniel Craig's face.Horray for dumping corny lines and nice to see Felix back in it. The action scenes were pretty good, though some a little too drawn out. The Airport scene in the movie is almost complete dropped from memory until I read some other reviews recounting the plot. It needed some trimming. There were only two other problems I had in the otherwise enjoyable outing.First, I think they pushed the love story a little too hard. Yes, they are trying to peel the layers off Bond to soften him up a bit, but the dialog was simply better off in another movie. This subplot could have been trimmed a bit also.The only other thing I noticed in the film, was dialog. Or the complete lack of it from Daniel Craig. He does a lot of blue-eyed staring into the lens, but talks very little. Most of the scenes involve other members of the cast talking up a storm, while we hear little from Bond himself. Perhaps that is the tone they were going for, but I know this Craig guy can act, I want to hear him speak.Other than that, I hope they keep up this line of style which is more Jason Bourne than, Inspector Gadget.",7,1,3,20 November 2006
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Let's cut the cuss, one cussing good movie
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of those films that just makes you smile. Newspaper man Mr. Fox is out to feed his family. Not because he is hungry but simply because he is a wild animal. Wes Anderson's Roald Dahl adaptation is joyous, charming and out right hilarious. There really isn't anything out there to compete with it for your dollars right now.I made it my mission in elementary school to read every one of Roald Dahl's books. Having read Fantastic Mr. Fox twenty some years ago, I still had a fuzzy idea of the story. The film follows the original quite well. Anderson has expanded the narrative in ways that not only fit his style, but the added character dimensions fit the story perfectly.The stop-motion animation is a great way for a story like this to be shared with an audience. Computer animation gets better and better every year, but Fantastic Mr. Fox shows there is life left in the hand made process still.George Cloony has a mischievous luster in the title role opposite Meryl Streep's quiet confidence of his wife. While Bill Murray's Badger and Willem Dafoe's Weasel turn in well honed supporting voices, it is Wallace Wolodarsky's Opossum Kylie who steals the show. I laughed at nearly every one of his lines.After several half measures and missteps since Royal Tenenbaums (itself a movie that was either obnoxious or brilliant) Wes Anderson has directed something truly great. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cuss of a good time. When the credits goes down to 'Let Her Dance' from the Bobby Fuller Four all I can do is smile.",9,3,6,7 December 2009
Moonrise Kingdom," Half cheek mooning
","I can pinpoint the moment when I jumped off the bandwagon as a Wes Anderson fanboy. It was when Steve asked his camera kid to check the light toward the end of the movie. The kid pulls out his Minolta incident meter quickly...cue snobbish laughter from Wes Anderson.'Oh man, only 5 people out of 100 will get this joke. That is why I'm so funny.' I got the joke Wes. It just wasn't all that funny. I carry a Minolta incident meter. I know what it means to push two stops. Hardy freaking har. This is tongue in cheek but only half cheek.It really began in Tenenbaums. Where the entire movie was an endless exercise not in absurdity itself, but in the obnoxious abandon to which we are beat over the head with the absurdity. 'It's so absurd! Can't you see how absurd this is?!?! That's why I'm so funny!' Tenenbaums had more than a passing redemption in the overall execution and strength of cast, but as we turn the page back to Moonrise Kingdom, I cannot say the same.Bill Murray is here to punch the clock again in his typical Wes Anderson stoic retiree. Murray was far more persuasive in Rushmore - as was the level of absurdity - mainly because Max was surrounded by people who didn't want to put up with his absurdity. But, like the weaker ends of his catalog, Moonrise Kingdom is a celebration of the obnoxious child. The one Wes Anderson can't let go of. A half hour or so in after the (SPOILERS) the dog was shot, it took me a week to finish the movie. Everey ten minutes, I found myself distracted and left the TV to do something else. I've seen it twice now and found the premise to be interesting, but absolutely zero value in the way of payoff or resolution. {Sigh} To quote Mr. Fox, it was a cussing waste of my time.Fantastic Mr. Fox, along with Rushmore, is brilliant and proof positive there are venues more appropriate for Anerson's vision and character than others. Venues where we accept the absurdity immediately and get on with absorbing the characters and the story. But not here under the Moonrise. No sir. I had my fill of the full tilt Anderson after Tenenbaums. By the time Life Aquatic and Darjeeling dropped, it was downright obnoxious and painfully dull.I don't think Wes should stop making movies. I don't think Wes should change the way he makes his movies. I don't think Wes Anderson should make movies that will only please people like me. What I want is a Wes Anderson movie where awkward is merely a scene - not an entire film and the character a human, not an in joke for him and Roman Coppola.The career dagger would be if the title of his next film was actually 'Shaggy Dog Story.' He doesn't realize we got the joke right away, nobody told him. So he's up there on stage for two hours telling it over and over, louder and louder. I can hear his thoughts, 'Ah, they don't get it, let me try again...'",5,4,7,20 October 2012
Casino," Shiny, but not without a few nicks
","In 1990, Martin Scorsese unleashed Nicholas Pileggi's hard boiled docu book to the cinema. After viewing it for the first time, I knew than and I am still confident today in 2009, Goodfellas is one of the finest motion pictures that will ever be made, let alone the best gangster movie of them all.Having read the Pileggi book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised how well the writer and director translated the source material. Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly 'arty.'So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting. There is a good 45 minutes of human drama about humans we don't give a shi*t about.But the good in Casino is so good, we forget about the thin characterizations. We forget its too long, we forget, at least a little, Sharon Stone is the only miscast part. Sure its got a few spots, but this one is still pretty bright to watch, even nearly 15 years on. You have to hand it to Scorsese. Even his crappy movies are damned good.",8,1,2,31 July 2009
Jackie Brown," 'I'm serious as a heart attack...'
","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's best film. There is not a single note wrong here from beginning to end. Dogs was a rough start, Pulp was a crowd pleaser, but with Jackie Brown, there are characters who are more than pawns in a game of 'Guess what movie I ripped off...' The awesome cast is firing on all cylinders to give the movie a real backbone. Surprisingly only Robert De Niro's presence comes off out of place in his nearly wordless role. The film works better on more levels than any other Tarantino. Why? Three main reasons;He is working from a completely realized story from Elmore Leonard. Tarantino has never shown himself to be much with a singular story over 2 hours, Leonard's Rum Punch gave him a solid foundation to work from.He is free of gimmicks dealing in black and white suits, glossy guns or samurai swords. There are almost no way to quantify his filmic references here, but they are all completely in sync with the story and characterizations, not for flamboyance. The story and characters rule here. What little violence there is in Jackie Brown, it actually has power and doesn't feel gleeful like in Pulp or Kill Bill.Most importantly...He is hopelessly in love with almost every character in this film and it feels as if he KNOWS each of these people. The personal touches for each of the players here are well done by the actors, but Tarantino simply worships them with his words, his camera and his soundtrack. This film could easily be called 'Reverence.'More than 10 years on, Jackie Brown feels fresher and far more mature than a re-watch of his other films, which by comparison come off as wind up toys or forced. On the other hand, Jackie Brown is a true love song to Pam Grier, the 70s and Blaxploitation and movies in general.But above all that, Jackie Brown is solid and just a damn good movie on any level. I doubt he'll ever make one as good. Few people could.",10,0,3,23 August 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before...
","SPOILER FREE (mostly)Cabin in the Woods is a movie who's success depends largely on how much you pretend the core joke is funny. For me, It was funny as in smirk funny, but not really LOL funny. For some people, this will be a riot. For others, a stale shaggy dog story. I'm a little in the middle.On the surface this is In the Mouth of Madness meets Army of Darkness. I don't think it's as threatening a premise as the former or as charming as the latter, but it does burn 90 minutes with some occasionally creative touches. Maybe this is more Evil Dead meets Buffy. Is it SAW meets Blade? Or is it Event Horizon meets Big Brother? All of the above. That's the whole point. The 'monster's ball' of mayhem sequence is probably the most riotous fun of Cabin in the Woods, but the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up. The ending especially is pretty flat. The rest of the film builds so much to it and it feels like Goddard and Whedon forgot that in referencing so much other material, they really need to write something good of their own. The whole thing feels as disposable as a Big Mac container. There was a better last 2 or 3 minutes instead of what/who they threw up there before the credits roll. Or they ran out of money, which is a possibility.You could do worse, but I've already heard this joke a few times and it was better told and more entertaining when Kevin Williamson called it Scream.",6,1,3,28 September 2012
Spectre," Bond 24 alternate title: Contractual Obligations
","The villain in Spectre will be played by Sam Mendes a director I have sort of despised from anything he's ever done. Sure Skyfall was boring, but by the end, you realize Spectre might as well be porridge.Spectre is the most lifeless action film I have ever seen and it also manages to be a bad Bond film too. If you can find me a sleepier car chase or shoot out, I'll buy you a coke. And that opening song? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!Somewhere in this movie there is a genuinely worthwhile story of loss and revenge on the part of Bond connecting to casino Royale, but all is wasted. Spectre cares not about entertainment or character development. Spectre doesn't even care about product placement or Aston Martins. To be honest, I don't even know why Spectre exists. From start to finish, the movie is a song continually out of tune and contemptuous of its audience.Daniel Craig has some mileage left in him and even after all these movies, I really believe Bond has something to say about the world and the current time he exists in. Hopefully the next go-around is more thoughtful. I'm beside myself how omniscient and invisible everything turned out. Sam Mendes, perhaps apply as a director for an episode of Grey's Anatomy where your 'talents' are of more use.",5,5,10,23 January 2016
Contact," White Noise
","Before I review this film, I am going to say this. If you haven't seen this film - don't. Track down Disney's 80s made-for-cable 'Flight of the Navigator' and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night. But if you must... Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it. In many ways Contact is a concept film - a 'what if' statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. 'What if' somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? 'What if' the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? 'What if' we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong. Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father- daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey. This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie. Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the writing than engaging into the story. Yes it is one of those movies. The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight. The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a 'are you kidding me?' laugh-out-loud 'alien' beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues. The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some.",4,2,6,4 January 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Spock goes crazy, you may too
","The first movie had a pretty good story. The second movie was a pretty good ride. The third movie is pretty good as far as junk food for your eyes go but it is utter nonsense.I'll be honest. It's so long and demanding, I felt 10 years older when I left the theater. The acting was abominable. There is no story telling here. Michael Bay has no idea how to tell a story. Half the time, I couldn't figure out what was shooting who. Where did John Malkovich go? I don't understand why Megatron was still alive. Does Dino have Italian family on Cybertron? I don't know why humans were helping the Decepticons. I lost count of how many booty shots of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley were jammed into the lens. I think it is the most violent movie I have ever seen - unapologetically violent - bordering on hateful. And My head hurt about an hour in.But somehow, I enjoyed it. Oh and, coming from a person laughed at Avatar's (and every movie since) 3D, the 3D here is genuinely impressive.You'll forget most of it ten minutes after you leave. It is mean spirited and makes no sense at all. Yet, if you are looking to escape - there are few better places to find it than here.",7,1,4,2 July 2011
The Social Network," David Mamet's Animal House
","The Social Network is a boring movie about annoying people who'd impress with intellect but not with intelligence and it is set in a land where everything is brown. Why? Well because it is. That's cool...right?In real life, Facebook is boring. It is the social pornography millions are addicted to where everybody posts pictures of all the parties they go to and beefcake or women they meet, but it's not a scene you can actually hook up on for real -- so strange. It is something I'll never understand. IMDb.com is cool. Who doesn't want to rate movies? But Facebook? Grow fake crops? Add friends? But no beer? Lame. The Social Network is a dry, talky and lifeless odyssey about why we should care. Well, not really. A Lifetime TV movie in all but name, The Social Network chronicles the rise of the Facebook phenomenon and eccentricity of Mark Zuckerbeg, but it doesn't succeed in making the topic interesting. This is Real Genius but minus any actual dramatic investment or humor. David FIncher uses a deft deadpan touch and Trent Reznor funk to jazz it up, but the problem is, this is a movie about people making a website. 'I INVENTED FACEBOOK!' 'NO WAY MAN, I INVENTED FACEBOOK!'Yeah they do that for two hours. Oh the humanity. Puleeeez.Just as a story of becoming a millionaire is no longer an interesting topic, being wowed by how many millions of hits facebook gets is weaksauce. How is this interesting? The Social Network is simply not grand or impressive enough for me to be wowed by a bunch of hoodie geeks fighting over vaporware. But at least it does echo the millions of dorks (yeah that means all of you FB junkies) fighting over who is being friended or defriended in cyberspace by people they hardly, if ever talk to. It's true. The lower the stakes, the harder they fight. Even if that is the whole point, at the end of the day, it's still boring. There is only so much you can do to dress up a turd.",3,4,9,23 January 2011
Goodfellas," 'Vinney don't put too many onions in the sauce'
","After sitting down and re watching the heavyweights of the Scorsese library, a few things can be said. Taxi Driver is overrated. Raging Bull is humble and beautiful, but frankly, boring. And Goodfellas? It holds up like the pyramids. In 2010 the movie is just as powerful, just as mesmerizing and just as shocking as the first time I saw it in 1994. Few films hold their power after so many years and so many repeated viewings. But this film does and then some.I don't think there's ever been a movie with an opening so shocking and absorbing. Something goes bump in the night and a lonely drive down an empty road transitions into a bloody nightmare. From here on out, you're hooked like a crack junkie.Scorsese is firing on all cylinders here. Where many of his films have touched greatness in one form or another, he never before, nor since, reached the perfection of Goodfellas. Like Paulie slicing the garlic with a razor blade, so too are each of the story's ingredients added. Every performance, every camera move, every edit is perfect. They all mix for a true masterpiece. There is not one onion too many in this sauce. To call this a gangster film, is to do it injustice. Goodfellas is more than that. The Godfather is like Shakespeare. That's cool. But Goodfellas is simply Biblical and in a class of its own.There is a powerful sense of vision at work here. Goodfellas is one of the best edited, best acted, best directed, best photographed and most entertaining films you will ever see.",10,1,4,16 January 2011
