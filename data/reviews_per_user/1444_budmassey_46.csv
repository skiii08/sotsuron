50 First Dates," 50 First Dates is on the small shelf.
","First, let's forget about the facile comparison between this movie and Groundhog Day. Anything with Bill Murray in it is just to annoying to be taken seriously. Second, this is nothing like Groundhog Day, anyway. It's much better. And don't for an instant listen to the idiots who are comparing this movie to Memento, still the most overrated, vapid, pointless, gimmicky, dull, worthless movie ever to be hyped into the public psyche. But I digress.Drew Barrymore is undoubtedly the most adorable woman in movies today. She's beautiful, bubbly, child-like and yet sexy. In short, she's perfect. If Meg Ryan is getting too old to do all the Meg Ryan movies, no worries. Drew is there, ready, willing and able to become America's cinema darling. And she's cuter than Meg.But what about Sandler? Isn't he a crude, obnoxious, fart-joking, hooligan who isn't as funny as the thinks he is? See, you're still thinking about the OLD Adam Sandler. This is the new Adam. He's funny, sensitive, vulnerable, and yes, adorable. In short, he's matured as an actor, making the pairing of Adam and Drew the best romantic comedy pairing since the aforementioned Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.The story is fairly simple. Drew has a problem with her short term memory, and Adam loves her but has to convince her to fall in love with him all over again every day. But the story isn't in the telling, it's in the watching. Drew and Adam flutter around each other like butterflies, dazzling in the sun, as the delicate journey from being strangers to becoming lovers is repainted every day. And yes, there are fart-jokes and vomit-gags enough to make any Sandler fan happy.One thing that makes this movie so enjoyable is the amazing soundtrack. I can put the DVD on and simply listen while I surf, and the music alone is delightful. But what really makes the movie is the way it starts where you would expect it to, a typical Sandler movie, and then floats beautifully higher and higher into the realm of cinema gold. It isn't until about midway through the movie that you realize you've got more on your hands than you expected, and by the end of the movie, if you aren't crying you should ask for a refund on that therapy you've been taking, because you haven't learned to express your emotions at all.Maybe half a dozen times a year I find a movie that enters the list of my favorites, and I can pull them off the shelf and love them all over again for years to come. I keep those DVD's on a separate shelf from the rest of my collection. It's a small shelf, in a different room from the rest of my collection. 50 First Dates is on the small shelf.",10,14,23,19 June 2004
Casablanca," Can a movie be PERFECT?
","Little can be said about this masterpiece that has not been said. Every superlative applies. The people involved in the making of Casablanca were convinced they were making just another movie meant to inspire patriotism in an America teetering on the brink of war. Indeed, in many ways, this is precisely how the movie was planned. But somewhere between then and now, Casablanca emerged as the most iconic movie of all time. The story takes place shortly before America's entry into WWII. Casablanca, while unoccupied, was controlled by Vichy and was a dangerous place for enemies of the Reich. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a café where everyone comes, and where shady transactions are conducted by the French Resistance. Rick maintains a delicate neutrality, with duplicitous cooperation from the local police captain, Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Then the Czechoslovakian resistance leader arrives with a woman in tow, but not just any woman. She is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), his wife, although we discover she had a passionate affair in Paris with Rick some time ago. The rest of the story revolves around what Orson Welles called a McGuffin – the letters of transit. That no such papers could have existed is immaterial. The McGuffin helps the central characters discover their true nature and make decisions that will change them forever. But the story is in the experience of it. As you are drawn into Casablanca, its intrigue, love, betrayal and redemption, you are transformed by it utterly. Long before postmodern deconstructionism made it de rigueur to send up treasured metaphors only to bring them crashing down, Casablanca wove them into a story that fills you with nostalgia only experienced in the collective memory of our culture, as if each event happened directly to you. Embarrassingly rich with talent, the film's gravitational center is the bristling energy that radiates from Bogart and Bergman. They are luminous beings whose monochromatic images will haunt your memory forever. Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo, like his portrayal of Jerry Durrance the same year in Now, Voyager, in a lesser movie would have been legendary. The fact that Casablanca engulfs him, as well as Claude Raines, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, is a yardstick against which Casablanca must be measured. The cast of Casablanca, in fact, is its true treasure. Humphrey Bogart appears in his first romantic lead, yet maintains the toughness and cynicism of the thug image Hollywood manufactured for him. His shell of cynicism notwithstanding, Bogart's character reveals himself to be a wounded, vulnerable man, consumed by bitterness and regret. Yet he manages, from within despair, to reinhabit his former self, rising to an epic heroism which, the film suggests, is within each of us. Bergman's astonishing beauty illuminates her character. Who could gaze into those vast, glistening eyes and not be moved? Although, apropos of the time, she is portrayed as a possession to be won or lost, she transcends that image with each glance. Her immense beauty is an almost desperate counterpoint to the struggles taking place before her. Paul Henreid has been roundly criticized for not being the thespian equal of his costars. But he plays his role perfectly as the self-righteous prig who represents Ilsa's tragic alternative to the man she truly loves. Had he been otherwise, Ilsa's choice would have been easy and the story would not have worked. Henreid, like every aspect of this masterpiece, is an archetype without which the story could not take place. The second tier actors were equally amazing. Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre were stars in their own rights. In fact, Veidt was the highest paid actor in the film. They are delightfully complex, and yet necessarily abstract, providing still more archetypes around which to anchor the story. Rains, as the servile Vichy toady, provides delicious moments of comic irony. Much has also been made of the repressed homosexual overtones of Renault's relationship with Rick, and Rick's relationship with Sam. Whether intentional or not, this aspect merely deepens the humanity of the characters. Even the supporting cast was extraordinary, many of them actual refugees from Europe, lending the story an aching realism. The famous 'Battle of the Anthems' scene plays so real because the extras were truly moved by it, each recalling his own real-life exodus from the war. If director Michael Curtiz was not a peer with contemporary auteur directors, his signature is nonetheless present in Casablanca's taut, scintillating structure. The numerous screenwriters each provided something unique. Even the cinematography was inspired, masterfully playing with images of captivity and conflict produced by shadows precisely placed for effect. In the end, everything flows seamlessly, the very definition of synergy. It would be criminal, though, after considering the details of perhaps the greatest film of all time, not to come back to the personal, visceral experience of it. No matter how many times I watch Casablanca, it never fails to move me. Far from diminishing over time, the full experience matures and deepens with each viewing. I still hold my breath as each iconic moment unfolds. I still gasp when I look into Ilsa's eyes the first time. But the true measure of Casablanca is the enduring respect it garners from film buffs the world over. Delicately dancing around the easy epic of World War II, the film shows us instead how great events can conspire to make even the most reprobate existence monumental.This is, in my mind, the closest thing to cinematic perfection we are ever likely to see. Unfortunately, the rich cultural references will seem somewhat abstruse for viewers not familiar with history leaving the full appreciation of Casablanca beyond reach. But if you are equipped with both a brain and a heart, this movie will move you and thrill you like few can.",10,0,0,6 July 2001
Star Trek," Quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history.
","It would not be an overstatement to say that this is quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history. After decades of derivative and diminished sequels and spin-offs, J.J. Abrams has managed to re-imagine the venerable classic in a way that is both true to the original and at the same time completely original. At the same time, he has rebooted the franchise in a way that will silence all the canon critics and created an independent and fresh future for years to come. Don't believe me? The sequel is already announced.The problem with all the previous sequels was that they became increasingly diluted by budget constraints and cramped creativity as compared to their peers. With an estimated budget of $150 million, this sequel was anointed as the heir apparent to the franchise, and succeeded brilliantly.Abrams could have approached this project with the cautious reverence it deserves, except that it deserved more, and Abrams knew it. We are given the obligatory historical references, and they are immensely satisfying, but they are also shrewdly seductive, as they lead us down the path of complacency. But from the beginning you get a sense that something isn't right, and you begin to wonder, 'is he blowing it here?' These deviations accelerate and, before long, reach a point of no return. Now you're on the edge of your chair, where you belong, and you wonder how he's going to make it all right again. He doesn't.Instead, we are shown a radically and irretrievably altered world where everything we thought we knew is swept away and replaced with a pristine tabula rasa. At last, Star Trek takes us, with glee and innocence, where no man has gone before. I would not have thought it possible, but this sequel is at once imbued with everything we liked best about the original series, and deviously enhanced by new possibilities, new capabilities, and a stunning Universe to once again explore anew.There is time travel invoked, but, for once, it is not used as a Cosmic Mulligan. There is no do-over. A Romulan ship from the future arrives from a black hole to wreak revenge for a destroyed world, seeking to destroy other worlds in its path. The Enterprise and her intrepid crew, displaying all the humor, courage, and heroism for which we have come to love them, set out to save what is left of the Federation. If that doesn't make you want to see the movie, nothing will.As a professor, I deal with people of all ages, all walks of life. Everyone I have spoken to raves about this film like none other that I can recall. As for me, I left the theatre with a feeling that maybe F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong when he said 'There are no second acts in American life.' That may have been true in Fitzgerald's time, but Star Trek, in all its revisionist glory, stands as proof that we live in a time when even the most tattered among us can reinvent ourselves with verve and purpose. Is this not the greatest gift that cinema has to offer?",10,8,21,9 May 2009
Memento," A monumentally over-rated wankfest.
","After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a 'serious' movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety. Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene. He is the most typecast actor around, and he could phone in a performance with more mystery and finesse. Still without Guy and Joe, formidable talents in better vehicles, this film would be desolate. Oh, there's lots of little black and white vignettes, and the story is told backwards which has been universally acclaimed as genius, but which, at least for me, smacks of artifice and cliché.Look beyond the gimmickry, and you have a film that aches for a purpose, a theme, a message. What it has instead is a sort of Michael Mann vapidity that even throws in the car and the suit. Holy Don Johnson, Batman.I cannot begin to tell you how over-rated this movie is. It is a favorite of ersatz intellectuals who want to prove their smarts and congratulate themsevles by 'figuring out' this empty, pointless wankfest of a monumentally overrated movie.",1,53,102,5 September 2001
Star Trek Into Darkness," Stunningly, startlingly brilliant.
","The Star Trek franchise has been mined for decades practically to depletion. And while little would be gained from endlessly resuscitating the canon version, it seemed nevertheless a courageous, almost dangerous act to so completely reboot a body of work that has worked through ten movies and six series and wipe the slate clean as Abrams did with this film's predecessor. For a true Star Trek fan, it was a hard pill to swallow at first, but only at first.J.J. Abrams' courage gave us almost everything we love most about Star Trek, with the inevitable exception of those things we could not have – the original cast. The characters remain in place, gamely reimagined at the beginning of their careers, rather than, as we eventually came to know them, at the end. Of course, it would have been easy to expect a new and improved telling of the canon, complete with new and improved visual effects. Instead, we got a stunning opportunity to see our beloved comrades explore new adventures without the necessity, or tedium, of a simple retelling.In this sequel, however, Abrams constructs delicately, almost lovingly, a story where familiar elements are unavoidable, but one where they are weaved into a thoroughly satisfying and viscerally thrilling path to endless years of new delight for Trekkers everywhere.The cast are learning to occupy their roles, with one notable exception. Zachary Quinto is positively delightful as Spock, a role he clearly shows the ability to wear comfortably and expand in surprising new directions. Simon Pegg is Scotty on Steroids – funnier, crankier, and vastly more entertaining. Perhaps most impressive is Karl Urban as McCoy. He is spot on perfect, almost disturbingly so, portraying McCoy just was we would have expected, while at the same time compensating for some of the thespian shortcomings of DeForest Kelly.The glaring disappointment is Chris Pine as Kirk. Pine lacks even a hint of the powerful machismo of William Shatner, depending instead on simple unwarranted bravado. He comes across less as a hero and more of a simple jerk, and his wanton womanizing is less romantic than simply debauched. It is perhaps ironic that Shatner, long lambasted for his acting, ends up being the most difficult actor to replace convincingly.To be fair, a fully satisfying replacement was probably not possible, as Shatner, for all his limitations, has, after decades of accretion, evolved into a once in a lifetime commodity. Still, it is difficult not to see Pine as miscast. But then, who? Channing Tatum? Chris Hemsworth? Most likely unavailable, so we have Pine.The story is pure gold, pure Star Trek. It draws upon familiar themes and characters and casts them in brilliant directions. At times, this film seems almost a tribute to the legacy Abrams seemed to be totally rejecting in the prequel. Stunningly, startlingly brilliant and persuasive evidence that Abrams is the only man with whom fans can entrust, not only our beloved Star Trek, but, it turns out, the other crown jewel of Sci-Fi fandom – Star Wars, the new episode of which Abrams will also direct.I wondered during the movie whether those less familiar with the Star Trek canon would appreciate the many subtle inside jokes and references. To be sure, there were many that were not so subtle, but it seems obvious that people who are relatively uninitiated with get less out of the movie than hard core fans.I'm not even going to discuss the plot details. Suffice it to say that nobody should leave the theatre disappointed, no matter what they were expecting. As for me, I left feeling as though all my years of devotion to Star Trek were fully rewarded, and renewed by this, one of the most magnificent achievements in the series' nearly half a century of delighting fans of all ages.",10,4,12,21 May 2013
Public Enemies," Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does.
","First of all, we must address the critical issue here. Johnny Depp is the best actor currently working. This places upon him the awesome responsibility of building a body of work while he is in his prime that will be worthy of him as a legacy. It is that standard against which Depp's work, including Public Enemies, must be measured. Even in those lofty terms, Public Enemy is successful, but hardly a triumph.I should also admit that I am a notorious Michael Mann hater. Sure, I liked The Aviator, but probably more despite Mann's touch than because of it. His envisioning of Will Graham, the central character of Thomas Harris's Manhunter, as an ersatz Miami Vice cool cat was criminal, and in the decades since he's really done little to redeem himself.Public Enemies is, of course, set in post-depression Indiana, where John Dillinger was an unlikely folk hero. His grave at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis is regularly visited, as evidenced by the stacks of coins that are always resting on his stone. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger, perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the movie, reels with charisma befitting the legend, without becoming corny like Warren Beatty's Clyde Barrow.Depp's scenes with Oscar winning leading lady Marion Cotillard smolder with a sexuality which the eccentric characters Depp often plays rarely give him the opportunity to portray, but which he does searingly. Throughout the movie, Depp is almost constantly on screen, and his presence is always electric and incendiary.The rest of the cast is superb. Christian Bale, looking a little wan in this movie, is beautifully wooden as Melvin Purvis, reminding me a bit of Kevin Costner as Elliott Ness in The Untouchables. Speaking of The Untouchables, Billy Drago's portrayal of Frank Nitti in The Untouchables was much more powerful than Bill Camp's version here, but then Drago's character was more central to the story in The Untouchables.Billy Crudup, fresh off his turn as the all powerful Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, is almost unrecognizable as J. Edgar Hoover. He manages to capture the ambition and determination of Hoover, while avoiding the clichés associated with him, particularly with regard to Dillinger.It's wonderful to see Giovanni Ribisi in a major picture again, and it looks like we'll be seeing more of him in the near future. Likewise Stephen Dorff and Lili Taylor. In fact, one has to give Mann credit for assembling such a great cast, although credit for this probably goes to the amazing work of Avy Kaufman and Bonnie Timmermann, both of whom are among the most sought after casting professionals in Hollywood.And now to the movie. Although the story plays out pretty predictably, as any such movie must, at times it reels and lurches like a music video, complete with period soundtrack. Little could be presented about this story that isn't already known, so, instead, we get touchstones decorated with details most likely imagined, albeit convincingly.Technically speaking, the movie is put together nicely, and why not? Master cinematographer Dante Spinotti and his HD cameras illuminate every scene in scintillating detail. Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack is equally thrilling, if for no other reason than its authenticity.Now you might be asking, at this point, with all the talent assembled here, what went wrong, because, as you might imagine I have been leading up to, something did go wrong. Well, it's the script. Cowritten by Mann, along with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman, it just doesn't happen.With Mann and Bennett, I'm not surprised; neither has shown himself to be a particularly capable writer as such. But Biderman gave us Primal Fear and Copycat, so I expected more. Essentially, however, the story ends up dramatically inert and more than a little uneven. As I mentioned, it 'reads' like a music video, desperately lacking narrative foundation and structure. The central characters, most of them epic in real life, lack depth, and little is done to capture the dramatic tension inherent in their collisions.I'll be honest. I went to see this movie for one reason – because Johnny Depp is in it. When Mann works with marquee talent, it usually works. Take Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, but then, how could you go wrong with that much talent? With Public Enemies, despite all the assembled brilliance, what you end up with is essentially a wind-up story left to unwind on its own, which it does predictably and without much of a payoff. Definitely worth a watch, and Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does.",8,2,4,5 July 2009
Billy Elliot," British cinema once again has a lesson for Hollywood.
","I always enjoy reading the comments other folks leave for movies like this one.  Usually, I'm left pondering whether the odd dismissive comments that demonstrate their author's ignorance are amusing or tragic.  'This is a movie about a boy who wants to dance, and his father doesn't want him to.' Really?  And Casablanca is about a night club, The Maltese Falcon was about a bird, and Rosebud was a sled.  Have we really numbed our minds to such a sorry state?Billy Elliott is about how even the most improbable dreams can flourish, and even in a world where not even survival can be taken for granted.  It affirms the power of the human spirit and explores the generational chasms that can exist within families, and forces us to confront stereotypes of working class values, frustrated aspirations, and even homophobia.  Through it all, Billy Elliott is an uplifting story of the triumph of a young boy's will over staggering obstacles.  It is an exquisite delicacy in a heap of fodder, and if you've spoiled your appetite by gorging on garbage then shame on you.Julie Walters was my pick for Best Supporting Actress, but Americans don't like actors, they like stars.  Jamie Bell's performance was far better than that of Haley Joel Osment, nothing against Haley, who was magnificent, but since the good parts weren't all underlined for us, most Americans will miss the rich lodes of gold in a film like Billy, preferring to pan for nuggets in a torrent of trash. The soundtrack was brilliant, and there are some dance scenes that are overflowing with complex and beautiful symbolism.  There's also fun, pathos, despair and hope.  And above all, there is the glorious ascent of the human spirit.  British cinema once again has a lesson for Hollywood.",10,0,0,10 August 2001
The Natural," Book Schmook! The Movie is VASTLY superior!
","As a writer, I am often compelled to read the books on which my favorite movies are based. Since its original release, I have loved The Natural as one of my favorite movies of all time, but it was only recently that I read Bernard Malamud's novel on which the movie was based. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was.Malamud was a great writer, and was best known for winning a Pulitzer and the National Book award for The Fixer. His award winning work usually dealt with themes closer to his own heart, and Malamud didn't seem to 'get' baseball in this book. Either that, or he had some axe to grind about baseball, and wanted us to hate it and all the people involved in it. The Natural was Malamud's first novel and, as such, it suffers from shallow, simplistic characters, a muddy, at times almost unintelligible plot, and poorly attenuated subplots that almost seem like afterthoughts or clumsy devices slathered on to shore up weak story objectives. He does, however, have a historical understanding of baseball, and most of the events related to baseball in this story are composites of everything from the Black Sox to Babe Ruth to Christie Matheson and a string of other legends.The main character, Roy Hobbs, is almost certainly based on the real life character Eddie Waitkus, and Malamud does little to imbue him with likable traits that would deepen him as a literary character. He even throws in a little Joe Jackson to compromise the character even further. The fact that he is called 'Roy' is an obvious allusion to Sir Thomas Malory's 15th century opus 'Le Morte D'Arthur.' (Recall that 'roi' is French for 'king.') Why Malamud chose this story as a model is a mystery, since although he goes to great lengths to reinforce the Aurthurian connection (the baseball team is called the 'Knights', the bat, 'Wonderboy' is obviously 'Excalibur'), he creates little of the Arthurian heroism in Roy Hobbes, or, for that matter, the sport of baseball as an allegory for the jousting of Chivalric heroes. The character of The Whammer, played in the movie beautifully, if all too briefly, by Joe Don Baker, is more Ruth than Ruth, but he's gone in a flash, leaving yet another heroic void in the original story. And the women in The Natural are shallow, conniving and cheap and I have never been able to understand Malamud's literary allusions with regard to Morgan LeFave and Guinnevere, the women in Arthur's life. The Bad Guys in the book are ALL Bad, everyone else is mostly neutral, and there isn't any real good, or anything uplifting or affirming or positive in the whole thing.Thank god for the movie. Barry Levinson's direction is gilded and glowing, and the whole film has a luminous aura that seems magical and enchanted and, compared to the wooden novel from which it came, a satisfying recast of the Arthurian legend. The screenplay was done by Roger Towne, who recently gave us The Recruit, and the changes he made to the story make all the difference in the world; less literary, perhaps, but more beautiful and elegant and not nearly so cynical and pessimistic. Compared to the Levinson/Johnson magic, the novel is almost amateurish, and recalls Ayn Rand's facile characters and stories, didactic and pedantic, and almost completely obscuring the Arthurian magic that Levinson coaxes from the story.Once, when I had the chance to mention personally to Mark Johnson how beautiful The Natural was, he responded with a sincere modesty that fit the innocent tone of the movie, and he even gave me a keepsake from the film that I have to this day as a reminder of just how amazing an achievement this movie was, coming from so flawed a novel.This was the first movie in which I loved Redford. He was older and deeper as an actor, and this was the beginning of his real golden age. Glenn Close was delightfully virginal and beautiful as a character almost completely created by the screenwriter, not the novelist. Kim Basinger is gorgeous and dangerous as the femme fatal, a portrayal that she would echo in her Oscar winning turn in L.A. Confidential.Randy Newman's brilliant score was recycled a dozen times in subsequent movies, but none captured the beauty and nostalgia of The Natural. There are only a handful of movies so magnificently driven by their score, and The Natural remains Newman's best and most satisfying work.In short, this is the best baseball movie ever. Whereas Malamud wanted to show baseball as jaundiced and commercial, Towne's screenplay shows us the baseball we loved as kids, and more. Malamud's dark and wholly unsatisfying ending is also rewritten, and if you find the final scene a little sweet, ask yourself if you really wanted to see the dismal finale that Malamud supplied.",10,61,80,21 January 2004
Dead Poets Society," A stunning and historically significant work of art.
","I've actually seen complaints about this film that point out that it is not very funny. Oddly enough, the film isn't a comedy, so I'm surprised anyone would expect it to be funny. Dead Poets Society is a graceful and elegant melodrama centered around the coming of age of young prep school boys through the discovery of the souls of dead poets in their classic works.Robin Williams injects much needed levity with bits that absolutely must have been ad-libbed as only he could. The Marlon Brando and John Wayne impressions are simply side-splitting. But it is in his dramatic moments you see that Williams range is far wider than the comedic fare for which he is known. In fact, it is those moments of cunning insight and biting wit that few actors can create where Williams' finest work lies. There is no shortage of such moments here.This is not the typical kids acting like idiots in school lame groaner that most high school films are. It is intelligent and insightful, woven around disparate young men dangerously involved in the discovery of self. And dangerous it is, as discovery often reveals hidden conflict.Robert Sean Leonard is simply stunning. His conflicted portrayal of a boy whose father's expectations are not aligned with his own dreams culminates in one of the most unforgettable scenes in the genre. Ethan Hawke is beautifully brittle as a young boy about to enter his own maturity.If you don't have tears in your eyes at the final scene, you should be forbidden by law ever to watch another movie in your life. So many people live lives of quiet desperation, and if you ever had a teacher, or ever were that teacher, who encouraged young minds to seize the day, this is a film you will always treasure for the towering accomplishment it is. Director Peter Weir litters the scenery with insider jokes and symbols present in all his films, and if you don't know them or get them, you won't miss a thing. His body of work is nonetheless historically significant, and this could be the jewel in his crown.",10,0,1,26 November 2003
Brokeback Mountain," The hallmarks of greatness.
","The hallmarks of greatness are scattered through Brokeback Mountain. Directed with exquisite beauty by Ang Lee, the only director out there with a soul these days, BBM is a lilting surfeit of beauty of an aching, melancholy kind. Of course, Lee could coax beauty from unexposed film stock, but fortunately, he had a bit more to work with here.Writing credits are impeccable. Anne Proulx has proved time and again that she deserves her place among such masters of the short story as Joyce Carol Oates. When BBM first appeared in The New Yorker, the literati were quick to embrace it. Add to that the brilliant screen writing of Larry McMurtry, and you've got story pretty well nailed.From an acting perspective, aren't we all tired of signature performances that could have been phoned in by actors who make a living playing themselves? Heath Ledger delivers a stunning performance not only in its own right, but particularly in comparison to the diversity of work he has rendered thus far. For an Austrailian actor previously known for pin-up boy roles to capture with such intensity and ferocity, not to mention accuracy, the wild and rough nature of the American cowboy defines acting.But most defining was the fact that, had the part of Jack been a female role, Jake Gyllenhaal would have been nominated for a leading role instead of a supporting role. Even Hollywood was not prepared to deal with a gay love story of such power and import, and the concept of two male leads was too much for even the MPAA to process. That, in fact, is the very definition of art, to push boundaries and redefine concepts.The fact that BBM became so instantly iconic, whether for better or worse, is proof positive of its historical and artistic importance. Let me put it this way. A friend once asked me why I decided to get a piercing, and I said to separate that part of my life before I had it from the part after. Hollywood will henceforth be likewise divided; that part before Brokeback Mountain, and what came after.",10,38,46,9 March 2006
L.A. Confidential," Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.
","Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.  Chock-a-block full of marquee talent, the story that starts off slow and escalates in a frightening spiral.Set in the early 1950's, a supposed golden age of American history.  World War II was a memory, and the Korean War was behind us.  There was nothing on the horizon but prosperity and peace.  Los Angeles sat on the verge of becoming the city it was destined to be, and is no more, and everything was right with the world.If it were only true.  A corrupt police force is almost indistinguishable from the organized criminals they oppose.  To make it even more apropos, one of L.A.'s finest is an advisor to a Dragnetish show and has quite a side business selling news scoops to a loathsome gossip columnist delightfully played by Danny DeVito.Kevin Spacey is the most consistent actor in the business, and his performance doesn't disappoint.  James Cromwell and David Strathairn are similarly sharp.  But the real gems are Guy Pearce, trying desperately to shed his Priscilla, Queen of the Desert past as the oh so anal Lt. Exley, and Russell Crowe, whose star potential was just being recognized by American audiences.  His brooding Bud White is the stuff of cinema legends, which Crowe will surely become.  Then there is Kim Basinger, who won a well-deserved Oscar.  She plays a hooker with astonishing elegance and grace, hallmarks of all Basinger's roles.  The stars don't produce as much chemistry between as around one another.  They seem to smolder with private fires that burn slightly out of reach of one another.  But it's still hot!",10,1,2,5 July 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," A life support system for its special effects. Yawn.
","I really liked Stargate, so I had to give this one a shot, and I have to admit that Roland Emmerich delivers eye candy by the boatload. But I have several problems with the movie. First, it is encumbent upon a writer to lure us into his premise by careful and deliberate steps designed to persuade us to suspend our disbelief. Emmerich has a speech regarding global climate changes being delivered in India, and as we step outside, the changes have already materialized. Is that a setup? Man, that is weak! Then we hear all about how disrupting the Atlantic Ocean currents could cause serious problems, and then we cut to disasters in Los Angeles and Tokyo. Now as far as I know, neither of those cities have frontage on the Atlantic Ocean.Well, I could go on, because the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese, but the point is that a lot more work should have been done on getting the science right. As if that weren't enough, the whole story degenerates into two lame plot lines; estranged family brought back together by catastrophe, and boy meets girl. Now that would be fine if the main story line were strong enough not to get stuck in the mud, but it isn't, and it does.In the end, Day After ends up being a life support system for its special effects. Yawn.",Null,2,5,20 October 2004
Crash," A pretentious little montage of contrived melodramas.
","How this pretentious little montage of contrived melodramas ever pulled off a Best Picture Oscar is positively beyond me, particularly considering the infinitely superior films there were to choose from. Credit, or perhaps blame, must be given to writer Paul Haggis, who also wrote Million Dollar Baby, and from whom we might have expected more. Instead, Haggis reaches into a bag of vapid tricks honed through decades of writing pap for the small screen and assembles what is basically an excruciatingly long episode of one of his dreary television soap operas. This is clearly a writer's indulgence; mental masturbation without a shred of human insight.The performances are game, and not even Robert Altman could have assembled a more impressive pile of talent to pump something into nothing. In the end, Crash has all the subtlety of an Oliver Stone movie, which is to say, none. Thank you Mr. Haggis for this facile diatribe that inartfully delivers nothing more than the painfully obvious; prejudice is bad.",3,8,15,8 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Movie History!!
","How could Luke have known?  On his home planet, he wished for adventure, now he has it.  His father turns out to be a dark lord at the right hand of the Emperor of the Galaxy, and an epic galactic battle has been staged for the sole purpose of convincing him to deliver the most awesome force in the Universe into the hands of evil.Luke learns that the Empire could have crushed the Rebellion at any time, and that all that has happened has been to seduce him to the Dark Side. The struggle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor is the finest scene ever committed to film.Epic, heroic on a Homeric scale, and a hell of a good time.  Must be seen on a big screen with popcorn.  After almost three decades, nothing else even comes close.",10,0,0,27 July 2000
Shutter Island," A psychological drama grotesquely masquerading as a big budget thriller.
","I'm not particularly fond of Leo DiCaprio as an actor, although he is steadily developing into what may one day become greatness. But director Martin Scorsese has been great for so long he is worth seeing just on principle. And of course the previews were enticing. The movie itself was, however, entirely inert.Once the anemic premise of Shutter Island unravels, which beings almost immediately and progresses with alarming rapidity, all you have left is a tedious and numbingly long dénouement that has been done before, only better. This movie has been likened to the work of M. Night Shayamalan, and the comparison is every bit the insult it was intended to be, as Shayamalan, unlike Scorsese, is known for crafting movies so pretentious, so insubstantial, and so dependent on their own hype. With Shayamalan it would have been expected. For Scorsese, I have to admit I was a bit shocked.There were protracted financial and artistic complications that delayed the release of Shutter Island. The real tragedy, however, is that they couldn't prevent it altogether. The lurid score is almost mockingly overwrought. The endless and intentionally distracting flashbacks are tawdry and ineffective. Shutter Island is beautifully filmed, and its stars render creditable performances, but it is all for naught, as the film drowns on the ferry before its stars ever reach the island.I am convinced that if Scorsese had been truer to Dennis Lehane's novel, rather than supplanting it almost entirely with Laeta Kalogridis' completely incongruous screenplay, there might have been something worthwhile. Shutter Island is a psychological drama grotesquely masquerading as a big budget thriller. If you want to see how it should be done, try Identity instead.",1,13,28,20 February 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Dazzlingly successful in portraying the cutthroat fashion empire.
","It may be unfair to say this, but this would have been a much less entertaining movie without the marvelous Meryl Streep. Actually, one could say that of any movie she is in, as she so completely overwhelms most of what Hollywood has to throw at her. The same is true here, with the exception of Stanley Tucci, whose counterpoint to Streep is so effective it was repeated almost immediately in Julie and Julia. It's no secret that Streep's character is based on Anna Wintour, the tyrannical editor of Vogue, but Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly really reminds me very little of Wintour, a credit to Streep's ability to create effective characters even within the persona of someone as well-known and contemporary as Wintour.The cast of the film is tremendously uneven. Streep and Tucci are the stalwart cornerstones, without whose truly inspired performances the film would disintegrate tragically into banality. Anne Hathaway, good as usual though still a lightweight compared to Streep and Tucci, is the nominal star of the film, but she is more often than not a foil for the dynamic duo. Emily Blunt, as a devoted fashionista, nevertheless looks a bit odd from time to time, including her first appearance in the film criticizing Hathaway's conservative attire while she herself sports a sort of post-apocalyptic Goth Judy Jetson garb. She seems strangely underutilized and stretched a bit thin at the same time here, but she is delightful nonetheless.Then there are the boyfriends. Adrian Grenier is definitely fighting above his weight class, and it doesn't work. He does a creditable job of moving dialog along with Hathaway, but he has to work too hard to appear interesting, and fails miserably. As for Simon Baker's Christian Thompson, aside from the fact that he's a bit self-obsessed, there seems to be no reason why Andy would not choose him, handsome, suave, successful, well-connected, over the scruffy, dreary and ultimately insecure character presented by Grenier. Despite all its shortcomings, however, the film is dazzlingly successful in portraying the cutthroat fashion empire presided over by the ruthless, Cruella DeVil-ish editor of 'Runway' magazine. Some people put on music for background noise. I put on a movie. This movie has been my background noise dozens of times, and I still love having it on. I savor every word, every gesture from the truly magical Meryl Streep as, in my opinion, the greatest Bitch of all time.The soundtrack is wonderful, and one can enjoy this movie simply by listening to it. There are plenty of delicious surprises too, like the minor appearance of Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, who just happens to be the richest (her net worth exceeds the rest of the cast combined, even if you throw in Anna Wintour) and most successful supermodel of all time, as Serena, a work-friend of Emily Blunt's character.In the end, I'm not sure why, but I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it twice in a row and have done more than once. You may not become that attached to The Devil Wears Prada, but it should definitely be worth the investment of at least one serious watch.",10,1,3,23 June 2011
Notting Hill," Grant and Roberts Sparkle!
","I'm not a fan of either Hugh Grant or Julia Roberts.  So why did I watch this film in the first place?  I guess I'm always looking for the best in everyone.  What a surprise. I was not disappointed.  Hugh Grant's jittery, bumbling charm has never been more endearing.  The vulnerability Grant infuses into his character is definitely his best quality, and it's perfectly understandable that he might decline the opportunity to date a megastar actress out of trepidation.Julia Roberts' legions of fans will not be let down by her character.  It's dead-on Julia.  But those who are not among her fans will be slowly but surely won over by the honesty and directness of the character.  I don't care what your testosterone quotient is, there won't be a dry eye in the house when she almost whispers, nervous smile masking the hurt, that she's 'just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.'The story is by the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary, so it's a sure bet from the start.  But Grant and Roberts take what might have been a slightly weak treatment and make it sparkle.
I get so sick of everyone who pooh-pooh's a happy ending because it's somehow so unbelievable that things ever work out right.  Instead we demand tear jerker disappointment at every turn and end up with Kevin Costner drowning like a sacrificial lamb at the end of Message in a Bottle to satisfy our lust for tragedy.  I love it when things work out well in my life, and sometimes I like to see films about things working out.  If a bookstore owner in London can actually end up with the top actress in Hollywood, then maybe I'll get that promotion, or that beautiful new associate might actually talk to me.  Is that so bad?",Null,38,49,4 May 2001
Watchmen," My favorite movie ever?
","For over 25 years now, I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen, I may have to reconsider.First, I'm glad I went to see the movie alone. I've heard so many comments focused on a blue dick, or the length of the movie, or some other such nonsense, that I'm sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no, that's not Javier Bardem. Yes, the movie is long; nearly three hours. But, unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic, at the end of this movie I wasn't asking for those three hours of my life back. And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal.Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic, deconstructionist and revisionist, laden with allegory and allusion. Consider, for example, the character Ozymandias. I'm wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here's the full quote;And on the pedestal these words appear -- 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.'Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view, and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.Then there is Dr. Manhattan, named, of course, for the Manhattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God, and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often, and one thinks of Oppenheimer's citation of the Bhagavad-Gita, in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says, 'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.'In an expository scene in the second act, Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical, since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction, Alan Lightman's almost unbearably beautiful Einstein's Dreams, and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways, allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives, intellectually at least, and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach's refusal to compromise, which makes him a doomed fugitive, to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias, who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed, calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well, that's for you to decide.From a purely entertainment perspective, Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art, and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn't suffer from Hollywood's apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman, since he's a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor, such as irony, without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.And the music, oh, the music. If you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, you will surely miss some of the impact, but don't worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe, which couldn't even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.I LOL'd, I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed. It hasn't.",10,1320,1696,8 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," I really can't find anything noteworthy in this movie.
","The more I tried to avoid seeing this movie, the more I heard people telling me how I simply must not miss it. I guess eventually I'll learn not to listen to those people.Little Miss Sunshine is a totally contrived, infantile effort in hack writing that would barely have passed Screen writing 101. An Oscar? You've got to be kidding me. Sure, Alan Arkin was good, but he doesn't drive the story forward, as a supporting actor should. Well, actually, there is no story, so Arkin could scarcely have been expected to make a silk purse of a sow's ear.And the little girl? Well, she was mediocre at best, and really not any better than typical sitcom fare.I really can't find anything noteworthy in this movie, except for the fact that absolutely nothing about it was noteworthy.",1,15,30,7 March 2007
Spider-Man," In a galaxy of would-be superheroes, Spider-Man is the shining star!
","Spider-Man has accomplished the impossible.  It has managed to rise above the crushing weight of its own hype and actually deliver more than promised.Big screen adaptations rarely mine a fraction of the potential of comic book heroes.  Superman was wooden, hopelessly saccharine and lighter than air. Batman was overshadowed by his villians, which may have been the point, but we were left with a thin two-dimensional costume-character and a series of poorly cast portrayals.  Even Unbreakable was a plotless and forgettable story that was built around its cast instead of the other way around. X-Men was closer, but was weighed down by its sheer number of characters.Enter Spiderman.  Go ahead.  You know you want to say it.  It's AMAZING! Let's start from the infrastructure.  Rosemary Harris (Blow Dry), was virtually unknown despite her long distinguished career in movies, television and the theatre, where she was nominated for a Best Actress Tony (she lost to her daughter).  She is perfect as Aunt May, conveying a interior strength and complexity that coexists gracefully with her soft-spoken exterior.  Add in J. K. Simmons, whom we have all loved to hate for years as the unctuous Vern Shillinger on HBO's Oz, but may be better known as Dr. Emil Skoda on television's Law and Order.  Again, he was exactly the way I pictured J. Jonah Jameson. Randy 'The Macho Man' Poffo as Bonesaw McGraw, Larry Joshua [uncredited] (Cop Rock, For Love of the Game) as the unscrupulous fight promoter, and even Cliff Robertson as the ill-fated Uncle Ben, all add to the remarkable synergy that never misses a beat.Now the first string.  The sheer genius of selecting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best way possible to provide an axis for all the other talent to revolve around.  He is far and away the best young actor out there, and his understated yet always larger than life presence completely occupies the superhero persona. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko much have been chanelling Maguire forty years ago when they created Spiderman.  He is vulnerable, not in the hapless and ultimately hollow Clark Kent way, nor in the damaged and empty Bruce Wayne manner, but in a human and sympathetic way that allows us to empathize and identify with him unlike any other comic book to silver screen alter ego.The chemistry between Maguire and Kisrten Dunst is breathtaking, and the beauty of their star-crossed romance is tragic in the best literary sense, carried off to perfection under the surprisingly mature performances of Dunst and Maguire.Willem Dafoe is the ultimate comic book villian.  He is diabolical, and wears his thinly-vieled alter ego as transparently as a mist.  He is unrepentant and remorseless as all true villians must be.  Dafoe is one of the many casting coups that make this masterpiece work.Sam Raimi, who has had his greatest success as a producer, directs Spider-Man with the skill of a maestro, and delivers an instant classic that works frame to frame from beginning to end in seamless perfection.It was worth all the anticipation, worthy of all the hype, and satisfying in every way.  Absolute perfection.  My Spider Sense is already tingling for the sequel.",10,0,0,4 May 2002
54," Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.
","Studio 54 was the center of a universe that revolved around sex, drugs, and a pantheon of ephemeral pop culture gods who presided over a world of decadence and music.  Long before the neanderthal 'disco sucks' mob convinced the world to stop dancing, every possible indulgence was explored, and then surpassed, in clubs like this one across the country. Well, if there had been clubs like this, but there was only one 54.The story mirrors the lunatic time warp within great dance clubs.  There was a cast of characters, you kind of knew them, and you knew some of the details of their lives outside the club, but make no mistake, the real world took place under the seductive lights, and everything else was just backstage preparation.You might say that the myriad subplots that ran through 54 were not adequately explored by the movie, but that would be naive.  Nobody at the club really knew Warhol, Jagger, Grace Kelly, Capote, or any of the luminaries, famous or not, who inhabited the club like ghosts.  We drank from their lives from dusk till dawn and hibernated in the so-called real world until the stars came out at night.Mike Meyers is beyond fabulous as the complex and tragic Steve Rubell.  If Ryan Phillippe is no Oscar winner, you might recall that the real busboys weren't usually National Merit Scholars either.  They were beautiful, and that was all that mattered.The giddy yet tragic abandon of the Disco Days has never been captured so perfectly.  Everyone knew it couldn't last, but we all stuck it out to see who could make it till last call.  An era as beautiful and optimistic as the hippies and flower children of the 1960's drowned under the weight of the resentment of those who couldn't make it past the velvet rope.This movie is the absolute best of its genre, and unflinchingly reveals the darkness that lay under the glittering veneer of 54.  If you weren't there, you won't understand.  If you were, there is no better way to remember. Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.",9,20,29,17 May 2001
The Fast and the Furious," As predictable as an atomic oscillation frequency.
","This is a formula movie, and the result is as predictable as an atomic oscillation frequency, but hey, it works!  Basically, there's these really cool street racer dudes who may or may not be involved in stealing electronic equipment by using souped up Honda Civics to hijack trucks.  In their spare time, they street race for pink slips in highly modified hot rods.  Did I just hear a Beach Boys tune?Well, there's a newcomer to the group, and the bad boys don't know if he can be trusted.  To make matters worse, he falls for the gang leader's sister. Wait a minute!  What if he had to decide where his loyalties lay?  Wouldn't that be cool?  Oh yes, and there's a really mean guy who doesn't like the new guy, and makes it a point to find out if he has a deep dark secret. Wow, I wonder where that story might go!Vin Diesel is terrific as the gang leader.  His star power and charisma are much too big for this tawdry little epic.  And just between us, he's not very well cast as the stoic bad guy.  There's more depth there than that, and this film, and his previous films, have yet to mine it.  I think he has the potential to fill the void left by the aging of such heavyweights as Sylvester Stalone and Bruce Willis, neither of whom, you may remember, were exactly Laurence Olivier in the beginning, but who became fine actors with time.  Similarly, Diesel has yet to find his stride, but I'm betting it'll be huge!",Null,0,1,16 July 2001

Maybe that's because it brings out the child in all of us, thanks in no small part to Rob Reiner's virtuoso direction.Robin Wright, as Buttercup, and Cary Elwes, as her true love Westley, were at the beginning of their careers here, but their performances are flawless. The entire cast, many of them marquee stars in their own right, delivers unforgettable performances, but Mandy Patinkin is the standout.  His line 'Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

Seabiscuit," Deliciously nostalgic and, because of the sweeping arc of the story, necessarily episodic.
","Deliciously nostalgic and, because of the sweeping arc of the story, necessarily episodic, Seabiscuit is a hopeful remembrance of a nearly hopeless time.  Set in the Great Depression, Seabiscuit weaves an almost magical tale of how a horse, thought to be worthless, found its true worth, and in so doing, inspired the men around him to do the same.It is no coincidence that the movie bears a striking similarity in theme, mode and tone to The Natural.  The scores of both movies were done by the incomparable Randy Newman.  There's even a specific composition that appears in its entirety in both movies.  It would be easy to draw the extended comparison that The Natural, with its baseball team called The Knights, was really a retelling of the  Arthurian legend, complete with a magical 'sword', and so is Seabiscuit.  Why not?  The knights in this movie ride on mighty steeds and bear their colors like armor.  They even joust once in a while on the tracks, so this really is a tale of knights and knaves, of horses and armor, and of triumph in the face of failure.Tobey Maguire is quite simply the finest actor of his age, a Stradivarius among rented band instruments with a tone that can only be coaxed out by the finest maestro. Who better to play this instrument than Gary Ross?  He directed and wrote Maquire's beautiful performance in Pleasantville, and also gave us Tom Hanks in Big, directed of course by Penny Marshall, the most underestimated director in Hollywood.Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges deliver beautiful standout performances, and we expect nothing less of them.  Cooper has become one of the best character actors in the business.  Also present is perhaps Cooper's only peer in the realm of character acting, William H. Macy, who, coincidentally, also worked with Maguire and Ross in Pleasantville.  Paging Six Degrees.
In the end, this movie isn't quite the movie that either The Natural or Pleasantville is, but it is nuanced and inspiring and gives us a fine chance to see Maguire work.",Null,0,0,20 December 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," No writer in western history has built a more satisfying legend of heroism,
","Nothing I can say about this film will do it justice. Forget that it's in Mandarin, you will anyway after a few minutes of watching. Much has been made of the fact that the lead actors were not native speakers of Mandarin, but the fact that they learned their dialog and were able to emote within the tightly confining inflective structure of the language speaks to the amount of skill, effort, and dedication that went into making this masterpiece. And yes, the main characters can fly, so it isn't exactly cinema verite', but we accept far more from movies that do far less to convince us to do so. What CTHD is is a stunning, epic telling of a beautiful Chinese fable that rivals any in Western culture.Try to remember the first time you heard about King Arthur and Camelot; it's chivalry and gallantry, the characters larger than life. Recall the epic and tragic story arcs of heroes whose literary personas evolved from the greatest traditions of Western culture. CTHD has all of that and more. For Camelot fans, there's even a magical sword. When it is stolen by a mystical warrior of dazzling skill, the quest for its return leads us through a story that contrasts the formal beauty of feudal China with its danger and brutality.The majesty of this film comes from Taiwanese director Ang Lee's masterfully controlled and yet lavish treatment. Lee is decidedly Taiwanese in his approach, which, for those who have missed the last half century or so of history, means that it will weave Eastern and Western sensibilities into a truly global worldview. It is a tragedy that Lee went on to direct the dismally disappointing Hulk, an overblown effects-laden stinker. It is best we forget that and remember him for this quintessential and epic creation. The ethereal fight scenes have been compared to The Matrix, but that is a huge disservice to CTHD. Even Matrix, with is wheezing spiral into itself pales by comparison against the rapturous beauty of Lee's masterpiece. The ending takes a bit of thought to embrace, and a knowledge of the Asian theme of heroism through sacrifice is essential to understanding it. If you know anything about China in the twentieth century, you will know that all individual glory must end in sacrifice to larger goals. The final scene, delicate as a flower yet as powerful as any warrior, uses this ethic to beautifully meld the seemingly disparate story lines into a glorious and tragic, in the literary sense, climax that will leave those willing to invest the thought to grasp it utterly breathless. No writer in western history has built a more satisfying legend of heroism, nobility and spiritualism. CTHD launched a series of cheap imitations, including the sadly inferior Hero and House of Flying Daggers, which are both excellent films in their own right, but practically a television movie of the week remake when judged against the rhapsodic beauty and majesty of CTHD.",10,12,20,19 February 2001
2012," At least the popcorn was good.
","In case you haven't heard, '2012' is about the end of the world. Actually, that's the entire plot, so maybe this should be considered a spoiler.Estimates are that this movie cost about $260 million to make. I guess a quarter-billion dollars just doesn't buy what it used to. It's roughly twice what Roland Emmerich squandered on 'The Day After Tomorrow,' which is apropos, I suppose, since '2012', believe it or not, is every bit of twice as bad as 'Day After.' I'm not even sure where to start, but writing is always a good launching point. '2012' is a careening, convoluted cacophony of practically every possible disaster movie cliché. We have the usual ticking clock, a common literary device, arbitrarily accelerated when the writer/director felt a need to heighten the tension. We have flat, transparent characters who end up being little more than placeholders around which to construct the endless, tiresome special effects. And, of course, we have the special effects, so shamelessly and randomly contrived as to render the destruction of the world tedious. I ended up wishing the world would hurry up and end already, but no, there had to be yet another, and another, and another, plot twist; inartfully conceived, predictably staged, and completely inert.The cast fared no better. John Cusak is one of my favorite actors, but he had no character to portray. Do we really need another hack writer, failed husband derelict trying to remain relevant in the lives of his children vis-a-vis mommy's new, rich husband? The kids were just two-dimensional cutout characters - mere props in the CGI scenery. Danny Glover, a passable character actor, was completely out of his depth as The Last President of the United States. Even George Bush seemed competent and intelligent by comparison. Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson - all fine actors, were lost within characters lacking even a hint of humanity or depth.The only thing this movie has going for it, although obviously not what Emmerich intended, is that it is pathetically funny. We laughed till our sides hurt as we called out each and every plot device before they were hauled out with all the subtlety of a train wreck and the unfailing predictability of an atomic clock. What's worse, each new twist was more ridiculous than the last until, as we roared with laughter, the entire Earth itself was conveniently shifted at the exact moment and extent necessary to start another cycle of completely absurd events.'2012' is epically bad, monumentally stupid, and cataclysmically boring.

Across the Universe," It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work.
","Every time I saw a preview of this movie, I literally held my breath. That's how high my expectations were. After all, it's a movie about Beatles music. How could it go wrong? Let me tell you how.I had posted a short and scathing review after my first viewing of the film, but decided to give it another chance, based on the number of people who recommended it to me. Now, instead of having wasted two hours of my life on this tedious, pretentious montage, I've wasted four, and I think Julie owes me, anyone else who watched Across the Universe, and particularly the Beatles, an apology.I have to admit I'm not a huge Julie Taymor fan, and although Frieda was interesting, it worked marginally only to the extent that it relied heavily on the visual imagery of not only Frieda Kahlo, but also Diego Rivera. Nevertheless, it did follow that, if Taymor could mine those subjects successfully, she might have success with the greatest popular musical catalog of all time.She didn't.What she did do is force together, almost randomly, and often brutally, fully thirty-three Beatles tunes into a steaming dung heap of self-indulgence and pretension. I've seen drunken karaoke singers do better, and actually, I like the plot at karaoke night better than the flimsy story used to string this mess together. The love story ostensibly supported by so mercilessly torturing these musical masterpieces is touching enough, except that neither of the romantic leads, nor any of the other characters in the movie for that matter, is in any way even remotely likable. They are just as self-indulgent and pretentious as one must presume Taymor to be, based on her preposterously bombastic directorial style.What's worse, Taymor seems not to understand at all any of the zeitgeist of the sixties, although she did witness it firsthand, albeit from the insular vantage point of a privileged upbringing, which is patently obvious in how she casts her central characters as devoid of any obligation to do anything other than indulge themselves. Instead, she apparently views the most turbulent period in modern history as a string of sentimental clichés, and the people who populated that era as two dimensional cardboard cutouts with only a passing resemblance to actual, multi-faceted human beings. I love how easy it is to pretend to be a revolutionary when you're away at school on mommy and daddy's dime. Now that's real life.The movie itself is absolutely devoid of structure or substance, oftentimes breaking into song almost for lack of anything better to do. The music, to be sure, is sublime, and almost any visual accompaniment would benefit from it, but it should be the other way around. The visuals and the story should add something to the soundtrack, not rely upon it utterly. Oh, and Julie darling, for the record, the Beatles don't need pretentious directors conceptualizing meaning in their music. The greatest songwriting team in history already has that covered, sweetie. This movie is an absolute and complete mess. I kept expecting Simon Cowell to chime in from his perch center stage that the singers, other than the rare and magnificent appearances of the likes of Joe Cocker and Bono, who must not have had anything better to do, were 'simply dreadful' as Mr. Cowell is so fond of saying. Indeed, most of the singers would not have lasted past the first round on American Idol, and some even used (over-used) pitch machines to ameliorate the tone of their voices. How lame is that? As someone who remembers the Beatles not simply as nostalgia, but as something that was integral to my youth, as someone who reveres John Lennon and his contribution to music, peace and love, I have to imagine that none of the Beatles, particularly John, would be pleased with this silly, shallow and trivial music video. I also have to object to the comparison of this disaster to Moulin Rouge. It's like comparing hamburger to filet mignon. One is a ground up mess. The other is perfection. One is a postmodern masterpiece. One is derivative, flaccid and unredeemably bad. I think we know which is which here.And what was with the Jimi Hendrix/Janis Joplin characters? Are we supposed to accept that as artistic license or character compositing? It was just silly, and, frankly, cheap, like the video clips of Walter Cronkite and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work. This movie has no cool of its own, and in the end, it was painfully, embarrassingly bad and should be a period at the end of the sentence that has been Ms. Taymor's run as a feature film director.",1,3,9,9 February 2008
Moulin Rouge!," This is the best musical since My Fair Lady!
","This is the best musical since My Fair Lady!  In the pop culture tradition of the best postmodern fiction, it is endlessly self-referential, and delightfully merges just about every cultural reference imaginable with each of their antecedents.  Madonna and Monroe are unified in a psuedo-drag number that objectifies every drag queen who ever did the same to the originals.  And oh, those songs!  From the Material Girl to the Rocket Man, and everything in between, with totally acceptable performances by all involved.  If you love good music, you'll love some of the best all over again as you see it in a context you never imagined.Ewan McGregor is absolutely enchanting as the young writer attempting to break into the Paris arts circle that inhabits the Moulin Rouge.  He infuses his character with warmth and sincerity that makes him by far the most endearing character on film in recent memory, and in a world not gone mad, would all but guarantee him the Oscar this year.  In a surprise trick casting, we have Nicole Kidman as an ambitious whore who compensates for meager talent by her willingness to enter a sham relationship in exchange for fame and fortune.  Where does she find her inspiration?  She reaches somewhere inside and finds something to make it work, and work it does in far and away her best role since she was again surprisingly cast as a scheming conniving bitch in Malice.  They just keep coming out of the blue.There isn't a single cast member who isn't stellar, and the pace and density of the production, although at times a little trying, is an embarrassment of riches.  Watch for John Leguizamo's touching speech about love as the unloved Toulouse Lautrec.  He should be getting much bigger and better roles, and maybe this will open some doors.Although a must own on the eventual DVD, this is also a big-screen experience that cannot be missed.  It is everything a great musical should be, and everything all great musicals have been, all rolled into one.  An absolute treasure.",Null,0,0,16 July 2001
Million Dollar Baby," You don't have a video library if you don't own this one, and you haven't been to the movies if you haven't seen it.
","Where do I begin? OK, how about this. Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman. Hillary Swank. Read that list again. Repeat it aloud like you were learning a list of holy sacraments for catechism. These aren't actors. These are national treasures. Consider yourself lucky to be able to see any one of them in a movie. To have a movie with the three of them in starring roles, that's not luck, that's manna from heaven. Eastwood, Freeman. These are stars well established in the firmament, and either could elevate even the most prosaic of films into something magical. But this is no prosaic film. It's magic is overwhelming.But take note. A new star shines throughout this movie, even in the brilliant light of the infallible Eastwood and Freeman, and I am at a loss to begin to describe her magnificence. Radiant. Beautiful. Brilliant. Let me know when you get the idea, so I can go on. Hillary is stunning, breathtaking. Her subtle and nuanced performance is beyond description. She's a white trash would be fighter, too old to train and it doesn't matter anyway 'cause Eastwood 'don't train girls.' But she saves tips and scrapes plates and buys a speed bag, and well, why not? And suddenly, she's a contender.And just when we thought this was going to be another Schlocky Rocky ain't it touching 'cause the underdog wins piece of crap movie, we are reminded oh so powerfully that this is, after all, a Clint Eastwood movie. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood all won Oscars, as did the film itself for Best Picture. But that only beings to suggest how unbelievably spectacular this film really is.The film's third act the stuff of cinema history. It will be remembered among the greatest achievements Hollywood has produced; and will rightfully call the likes of The Godfather, Rocky, and Raging Bull peers. You don't have a video library if you don't own this one, and you haven't been to the movies if you haven't seen it.",10,3,6,15 July 2005
Rudy," Inspirational in a way that only a sports movie can be.
","If you have ever struggled to achieve an impossible goal, dreamed of the almost unattainable, and then attained it, this is your movie. Sports movies are easy, because there's the built in conflict and triumph of athletic competition. But sometimes a film rises above the genre. Based on a true story, Rudy is among the best of such films, and completes the holy trinity of sports movies; Baseball - The Natural, Basketball - Hooisers, and Football - Rudy. (If you don't have them go immediately to your local video store and buy them. I'll wait here till you get back.)Sean Astin's determination and sincerity are moving. He's five feet nothing, but he actually makes the team for Notre Dame football, in a time when that meant something. Rising through staggering odds, and crushing setbacks, including the death of his best friend, working in a steel mill, a detour to junior college, and the selective admissions process at Notre Dame, he dreams the impossible dream, and then lives it. There are brilliant supporting actors; Ned Beatty as Rudy's dad, Jon Favreau as his mentor, Robert Prosky as the priest who helps him find his way, and Charles Dutton as the grounds keeper who opens doors for him, literally. The references to actual Notre Dame football give the story its foundation. But Sean Astin, never before or after better, or nearly as good, gives the performance of his young life.All sports movies are a bit predictable, and they're usually designed to put a lump in your throat, and of course they only appeal to 49% of the population (sorry), but Rudy is inspirational in a way that only a sports movie can be. It was a bit unsettling seeing Father Karras as Ara Parseghian, I kept expecting his eyes to turn yellow or something. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone who's having a crisis of faith from the obstacles that stand between us and our goals, large and small.",10,3,3,28 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!
","Brendan Fraser is the only thing wrong with this movie.  He still hasn't learned to act, but someone at least learned how to handle him.  Give him short and simple lines and let the action support him.  Fraser would do well to emulate another top box office non-actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger and learn to make light of himself.  Think True Lies.  Has Arnold ever been better?Everything else is fantastic.  This film is infinitely better than The Mummy.  There is more story, more drama, more action, more special effects, more of everything.  This time out, evil Archaeologists stage a battle between Imhotep (Vosloo) and the Scorpion King (The Rock) to gain control over the armies of Annubis. Along the way, we get deeper into the story of Anck-su-Namun and Imhotep. A new story line develops that ties Fraser and his new wife, Evie (Rachel Weisz), closer to the ill-fated couple than they could have imagined.  John Hannah, who returns as Evie's hapless brother, and Freddie Boath as her and Fraser's son, add comic relief galore.  Arnold Vosloo is once again fabulous, and I'd love to see him get more good roles.  Patricia Velazquez returns as the other half of the star-crossed lovers, Anck-su-Namun.The movie succeeds at tying the two stories together, and using the first film to raise the stakes.  The much touted Scorpion King role is a bit of a letdown, but the spinoff is already being filmed, without, unfortunately the majority of this cast.  I always thought that The Mummy might have been as good as the Indiana Jones films if Fraser could act.  This movie deals with that problem, and earns its place as a peer with the Indiana Jones trilogy in movie history.  It does everything well.  Even the credits are the best I've ever seen, and the ending song is tasty.A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!",5,0,0,5 May 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A towering achievement cinematic ally, biographically, and historically.
","With this film Russell Crowe dispels any doubt that his Oscar for Gladiator was deserved. Had Crowe not alienated the entire Hollywood community with his sullen and belligerent manner in the months leading up to voting, he would have won the Best Actor statue for a second time. And while this is a tragedy of Crowe's own doing, it does not eclipse the satisfaction of Ron Howard finally getting his statue for Best Director. This is a true story that is sometimes a little taxing to watch, and the dizzying contrast between high and low is something that is only poorly attempted by the likes of contemporaries such as Vanilla Sky.Speaking of contrast, naysayers who panned Russell as wooden and two-dimensional in Gladiator will have to eat those words as he renders this complex turn that is filled with both vulnerability and hubris, elation and pathos, genius and madness. After all, that's why they call it acting, which Crowe has more than proved he can do.There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and the only danger is that Crowe has peaked too high too soon, a'la, say Richard Dreyfuss, or, *gasp* Anna Paquin (Hollywood's most underrated young beauty) and even *double gasp*, Tatum O'Neal, and although nobody can accuse Crowe of being an overnight success, performances like this one make us hope he isn't spent any time soon.The first half of the movie is lyrically beautiful, in which Crowe ascends the throne of the mathematics intelligentsia, meeting his exquisite wife, played beautifully and as a full peer to Crowe by Jennifer Connelly who won a well-deserved Oscar. The second half is, without spoiling it for you, the best suspense you will see since The Sixth Sense. In the end, it wraps up nicely with a bow, and to those whose reviews pretentiously claimed to find the story unbelievable, I can only add, this being a true story, that fact is always stranger than fiction.Much is left out of Nash's back story, like, among many other things, that he had pronounced homosexual tendencies, and we are never quite given any satisfactory explanation for his descent into madness. Nevertheless, A Beautiful Mind is a towering achievement cinematically, biographically, and historically.",10,0,2,29 December 2001
Love Actually," I love 'Love Actually.'
","'Love Actually' is a film of exquisitely delicate emotions blended with just the right touches of humor to keep it from becoming maudlin. Everyone in the film appears to be an emotional train wreck waiting to happen. They dangle precariously at the end of their respective ropes over chasms of heartache. But what is so rewardingly beautiful is that each survives through different kinds of strength, inspiring viewers to find within their own strength in facing similar disasters.The incidental entwining with the Christmas season lends the many disparate stories a sort of framework that supports their almost imperceptible weight. Writer/Director Richard Curtis, true to form, constructs a brilliant and complex work that in the hands of lesser directors might have come off as diffused and ineffective, but in his hands comes together with astonishing elegance and power.Craig Armstrong's score is so beautifully subtle and yet powerful that it weaves with the delicacy of silk and the strength of steel throughout the film, masterfully setting its tone and unifying the diverse subplots into a seamless whole. The additional music is cunningly selected to provide counterpoint to Armstrong's score while at the same time complementing it perfectly.The cast is beyond compare, superb to the last detail. I can't even imagine where to begin singling anyone out, so I won't try. Suffice it to say that, in typical British style, the entire ensemble shines as a whole without any one cast member overshadowing another, no mean feat when the credits read like a Who's Who of what I would call 'serious cinema.' There are so many moments to treasure that, once again, I will not even attempt to single any out. You simply must experience them for yourself, which I recommend without reservation. This is yet another of those incidentally Christmas-themed movies that I watch without fail every holiday season. I could continue spewing superlatives, but I think you get the idea. I love 'Love Actually.'",10,1,3,17 June 2011
Inception," Reel in your expectations and enjoy the movie.
","It is rumored that Christopher Nolan took eight years to complete this story, his first original work in over a decade. Perhaps he just needed a little more time.It doesn't surprise me that Nolan, the guilty party behind Memento, would come up with a movie where gratuitously Byzantine convolution is served up instead of anything resembling story. What does surprise me is that Nolan manages, eventually, to steer this vehicle to a reasonably satisfying conclusion. And it is for the sake of the marginally effective dénouement alone that I am willing to forgive a movie for having a blatantly video game structure, complete with levels and avatars and an artificially aggressive ticking clock to manufacture urgency.I suppose one could carp about the fact that Ellen Page as Ariadne goes from badly dressed student to the Yoda of shared dreaming quite literally in the blink of an eye, but that would be complaining about the table service when the restaurant is on fire. Perhaps the biggest failing of the writing in Inception is that all the characters are forced to deliver lengthy, tedious expository dialogue to explain what just happened, what is currently happening, or what is about to happen. Without giving too much away, this probably explains why, in the second act, Nolan has the wrong character delivering a speech. Basically, there are the main characters in a dream and then there are projections created by the characters. In one scene, a key plot element is explained by a projection, who would have no knowledge of the element, instead of the character, who is there to introduce it. It's an amateurish blunder that shows what happens when bad writers get in over their heads.This basic story itself was done decades ago with far more finesse and wit in everything from Dreamscape to American Werewolf in London. In fact, the whole plot, if you can call it that, is as convincingly fresh as yesterday's dry toast. It's The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, who then get hijacked by Total Recall while Memento and Dark City stand back and laugh on the sidelines. It's as if Nolan wanted to outdo all of them by forcing them into a single mashed up meta-story.So why watch this movie? I guess it all comes down to this – the movie, quite simply, is fun to watch. Lots of fun.What Nolan lacks as a writer, and the list is long, he more than makes up for as a director. Inception is taut and energetic from start to finish. Even though the characters are ridiculously flat, they move effortlessly through Nolan's heightened reality. Inception may not be the best story literarily, but Nolan's way of telling it cinematically is superb.In short, the story revolves around a team of people, scientist, spies, we're never really sure, who have perfected a way of entering other people's dreams. Once inside, they use the warped reality of dreams to extract secrets from the dreamer.Apparently there are numerous rules regarding dream intervention. Violating them leads to dire consequences. Mercifully, the old saw that if you die in a dream you die in real life is not true here. It just wakes you up. Usually.But along comes the mission to use the dream to implant an idea in the dreamer – Inception. Apparently this is difficult, but, of course, it must be done. Fortunately, it seems that the whole world is up on the dream-jacking process, and experts abound. It's even so commonplace that ordinary citizens go to seminars on how to fight back in their dreams, making them formidable foes in dreamland. So a new team is assembled and the game, as in video game, is on, and on, and on.Suffice it to say that, in typical Nolan fashion, the story revolves around itself until it generates a tasty little paradox, within which the (almost) redeeming moments of the film reside. Ersatz intellectuals are already asking the central question of the film as proof of their depth, a sort of 'Who is John Galt?' meta-meme. Unfortunately, Ayn Rand was such a pedantic, didactic writer I ended up not caring who John Galt was. In similar fashion, after Nolan has drummed away at his central issue for so long it grew tedious, I walked away from this movie not caring about the answer to 'The Question.'I'd say, reel in your expectations a tad, then go see the movie and have fun.",5,5,12,23 July 2010
Raging Bull," The knockout blow of a lifetime
","The stunning combination of Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro delivers the knockout blow of a lifetime.  After two decades, the film's greatness endures.Filmed in brooding black and white, but with devilishly clever color clips, Raging Bull is the perfect film noir.  DeNiro, whose effect on the film reaches everything from writing to lighting, is the greatest film actor of all time, and this is his greatest hour.  He brings an odd humanity to the most inhumane of all sports.  He is vulnerable, yet stoic, confident, yet deeply self-doubting.  He epitomizes the frailty of even the strongest among us.  A most deserved Oscar can only begin to pay tribute to DeNiro, who collaborated in a rewrite to make the unctuous LaMotta more sympathetic, and then portrayed him with such sympathy and insight that we are constantly reminded that even the most unlikeable of people are still people.Spanning 23 years, at once managing to be epic and intimate, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is perfect in every way.  Cinematogaphy rivaled only by the likes of Orson Welles or Francis Ford Coppola, who later directed DeNiro in the Godfather trilogy, a score both tragic and majestic, and oh the acting. Even Joe Pesci contributes an Oscar-worthy career performance as the brother of Jake LaMotta (DeNiro).The fact that such films as Shawshank Redemption, Memento, Saving Private Ryan, L.A. Confidential, The Matrix, and Das Boot, all superb films in their own right, and It's a Wonderful Life and Toy Story 2, lightweight fodder at best, are ranked in this site higher than Raging Bull is ludicrous.  Even the finest among them pale by comparison, and when they are two decades old, will be far less remembered, revered, and imitated, than this powerful, and perhaps most important, giant of the modern era.If I could only have ten DVD's for the rest of my life, this would have to be one of them.",10,1,1,18 June 2001
The Dark Knight Rises," For Pete's sake, Chris - enough already.
","All right. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan is a great director. Few people can put a story on the screen like Nolan does. But the problem is that he's a terrible writer. How many more times does he have to absolutely assassinate a perfectly good story idea or character franchise with his amateurish, ham-handed writing before he and everyone else realizes this? First, he always sets clocks in motion. Really? Is that all you've got? A real writer can create a sense of urgency based on time constraints without introducing an actual clock, especially one that is strapped onto a device that seems to have no other need of a clock than to display its imminent intent to blow everything to kingdom come.Then of course, there's character development, or the lack of it. Batman is conflicted as to whether he should be Batman or not. Bane is conflicted by, oh, let's say puppy love. Catwoman is conflicted by whether or not she really wants to be bad. I mean, I know this whole franchise is based on a comic book, but with a price tag of a quarter of a billion dollars to make, does it have to play like one? Come on, Chris. Hire a writer.Basically, this is a movie that consists of lots of scenes of people either fighting, or walking aggressively toward a fight, with the central characters standing still like a Greek chorus of narrators long enough to tell the story, rather than participate in it, by presenting long, boring diatribes and monologues like a bunch of kids breathlessly setting forth a cowboys and Indians scenario before they run around whooping and shooting, only to repeat, in this case for three tedious, exasperating hours.I love superhero movies when they are able, like all good science fiction, to transcend their admittedly contrived premises by presenting witty and profound issues in clever and unique ways without hammering you over the head or numbing your brain with endless sequences of violence and destruction. Once again, Chris, you have failed in the former by wallowing in the latter.",2,61,131,24 July 2012
Blade Runner," A dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations.
","This is, quite simply, the best Sci-Fi movie ever made, and one of the finest movies of any genre. Recently a Final Cut was issued on DVD. It restores some scenes that were taken out before to the film's detriment, but suffers also from a softening of one of the greatest lines in history. (When Roy Batty meets Dr. Tyrell, he confronts his maker with the line 'I want more life, f**ker.' This version (and others) softens the line to 'I want more life, father.' indicating the relationship between Roy and Tyrell. I liked it better the other way.)The story is fraught with allegory, laden with existentialism. If you try to take it too literally, you will be missing the point. It will be hard to digest the themes if you are not familiar with the writings of Descartes, Foucualt, Kierkegaard, or Nietzsche, which probably precludes the vast majority of viewers from fully appreciating the film.Blade Runner is based on the short story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, written by the legendary Philip K. Dick, whose visionary plot-twisting epics include Total Recall (I Can Dream That For You Wholesale) and Minority Report, which was, sadly, defiled by being made into a Tom Cruise vehicle. Dick would have rolled over in his grave, since he loathed Hollywood for exactly such reasons. So why was this movie made? So a generation of lesser films would have a vast and bleak vision to imitate in countless rip-offs, take-offs, and send-ups. But none ever approach the stark and visionary brilliance of Blade Runner.Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, basically, an Android Hunter. A band of marauding androids, called Replicants, have violated Earth law by coming on-world. The year is 2019, and Earth is a post-apocalyptic nightmare cloaked in a perpetual drizzle and darkness. Ford is charged with hunting down the Replicants and destroying them.Now, there's too much to lay out here, but the Replicants have been preprogrammed by their makers to live only a short time. This prevents them from getting delusions of grandeur. Here is where you lose most casual observers. The Replicants represent Man, and his yearning for immortality is manifested in the angst these creatures feel at their impending doom. Why do we die? Why were we born in the first place? What is the meaning of our lives and our relationship with our creator?Now imagine that you had the chance to ask God these very things. This is exactly what happens when the lead Replicant, Roy, played by Rutger Hauer in his absolutely finest hour, meets Tyrell, the man who invented Replicants. Let's just say the meeting goes less than swimmingly, and the rage Roy feels afterward is the essence of the human struggle with the meaning and futility of life. In perfect human form, Roy literally dispenses with God and continues to search for meaning to his arbitrarily limited life.Harrison Ford famously disliked working in this film and with Ridley Scott, whose relentless demand for perfection frustrated Ford. Ford was apparently also dissatisfied with his character, whom he saw as weak. In fact, Deckert is, despite Ford's disdain for playing him, a subtle and nuanced character, fiercely conflicted, who shoots women in the back, drinks too much, and falls in love with his quarry, all the while stalking beings who only want what he wants, to live.The women in the movie are all breathtaking in their own way. Darryl Hannah is the exotic beauty, a Replicant designed, as her dossier explains, as a pleasure model. In a great example of attention to detail, her character, Pris, has an incept date of February 14, which is what one would expect for a pleasure model. Zora, played by Joanna Cassidy, is described as 'beauty and the beast' since she is a trained killer. This duality is reflected in her dossier as well, since she is a Gemini, the perfect sign for duality. I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are endless such gems in the details.The film, with all its allusions, climaxes in the final confrontation between Deckert and Batty. It is confessional, elegiac and powerful. Batty faces his end clutching a white dove, a touch added by Rutger Hauer himself, in much the same way we consider our own souls as we face death, and if by now you haven't fully realized the ultimate allusion of the film, recall that Batty his a nail piercing his hand.The ultimate question to consider is whether Deckert himself is a Replicant, but you cannot fully weigh that question unless you watch the movie multiple times, and even then you will have to make a judgment call. It would not be characteristic of Dick to reveal any definitive answer to that question, so your answer will have to come from you as you consider your own ideas of life, existence, mortality and immortality, God, and destiny. Goodness. How could we ask more of a movie?Ridley Scott's direction melds in a miraculous synergy with Vangelis' superb, minimalist score. The result is a thought-provoking classic that raises, but doesn't quite answer, the most elemental questions of existence in a dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations. If you've never seen this movie, watch the original theatrical release with the extended footage. The commentary makes the story easier to follow, and since Dick will mess your mind like a master, most first time viewers need the commentary. (Indeed, it was added post-production, because Scott feared most viewers wouldn't understand the plot. He was right.)If you're familiar with Blade Runner, then watch the Director's Cut, or the newer Final Cut. The Sam Spade commentary is gone, and what is left is a desolate but magnificent voyage into the very best that Sci-Fi has to offer.",10,3,6,18 September 2003
Identity," Film noir so deliciously old-school it should have been filmed in black and white.
","Identity is a stylish and toney film noir so deliciously old-school it should have been filmed in black and white.  Some of the comments I have seen regarding this film indicate that most viewers didn't get it.  That's understandable since it wasn't rolled out like a red carpet or spoon fed like most other movies.  This movie was infinitely more imaginative and entertaining than the vapid and dreary poser film 'Memento' that so many here enjoyed for some reason that still escapes me.  It succeeds where Memento fails, and delivers substance and style where Memento relies on device and contrivance.John Cusack contributes immeasurably to this film, as he does to everything he does, but this is decidedly an ensemble piece. Despite comments elsewhere that indicate a lack of understanding of literary craft, the non-linear delivery is classic noir and takes full advantage of a genre that lesser films have tried to mine without out success. Take your copy of Memento to a used disc store and see if they'll buy it back.  Use the proceeds to buy Identity and your DVD collection will be vastly improved.",10,2,4,29 September 2003
X2: X-Men United," A typical mid-series sequel that accomplishes everything it should.
","I admit it. I was waiting at the theatre when it opened to see this one. The first episode was refreshing, powerful and deeply symbolic.  A bad guy who was a Holocaust survivor, a telepathic scientist denied the use of his body, and so on.  What I liked best about it was that instead of 'mutant' you could substitute 'black', 'gay', 'jew' or any number of traits, visible or not, which make unwilling superheroes of anyone who deals with the prejudice such traits engender.I wasn't disappointed.  This episode accomplishes exactly what it must.  It deepens old characters, introduces new ones, and creates enough loose ends to get us excited about the finale.  Remember The Empire Strikes Back? Surely the weakest of the Star Wars trilogy, but entirely successful in its objectives.  From the first scene, in which a tattooed, teleporting, devil-tailed, psalm-chanting, German-accented Nightcrawler (Allan Cumming, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion) make his stunning entrance, X2 works on every level. In the spirit of the Lord of the Ring mid-sequel, not a second is wasted explaining why Magneto (Ian McKellen, Gods and Monsters) is locked up in a plastic prison, or why mutants are split into two camps with equally brilliant and powerful leaders, one fighting for equal rights and the other for Mutant Power.But before we get all enraptured by the flash, and you will, take time to consider the subtle brilliance of this film.  It cannot be mere coincidence that Magneto is imprisoned in a plastic prison that recalls the underground cell of another evil genius, Hannibal Lechtor?  Why not?  Check the cast. Brian Cox, here as the twisted human ex-Army commander Stryker, was the first to portray Dr. Lechtor back in Michael Mann's ham-handed Manhunter, long before Sir Anthony even read the script for Silence of the Lambs.  And if X2 lacks the grace and warmth of Sam Raimi's masterpiece, Spider-Man, it makes up for it in irony and insight. The beauty of all superheroes, and the source of their authenticity, is their vulerability.  For all their superpowers, X-Men are most appealing when they are human and flawed.  Wolverine's ( Hugh Jackman, Kate and Leopold) tormented longing to know his past, and the dangerous passion he feels for Dr. Jean Grey strike a pleasing balance to his rough and gritty exterior.  Nightcrawler's invasion of the White House, scored by the powerful strains of Mozart's 'Requiem', contrasts beautifully to his vulnerable self-mutilation and Psalm-chanting.OK, so I really liked the face-off between Wolverine and Stryker's lacky Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), but it is the gentler moments, and I can't even tell you about them without ruining the movie for you, that make this movie work. But you need some teasers, so here goes.One of the main characters dies, I think.  Maybe not.  We'll have to wait for the finale to be sure.  Magneto is more complex than you might have imagined, and together with Mystique, he is bad to the bone.  One character, looking uncannily like Brad Dourif from the Exorcist III, renders a great performance without ever saying a word.  Someone will leave the Xavier camp for Magneto's side.  You can never go home.  And, just to make sure you see it ASAP, The Cyclops/Wolverine/Dr. Grey triangle will be resolved once and for all.I can't wait for the third episode.",Null,0,0,3 May 2003
The Matrix," More fun than summer vacation.
","I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.Granted, it is a great story.  Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great.  But oh what a concept.  Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures.  But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.The fight scenes are spectacular.  Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it.  Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side.  And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted.  His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving.  I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy.  'There is no spoon.' I still get chills.  I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak.  I think that story line could have used a little work.  Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.All in all, you absolutely must own this movie.  It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation.",9,1,2,5 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.
","Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, 'Droids' for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.",10,226,315,25 April 2005
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," I don't hate this movie, but I hate how it is diminished by relying on marquee names instead of talent.
","To call Tom Cruise and 'actor' is generous at best.  He appears in movies, and because he is pretty, people watch. He doesn't have enough talent to occupy minor character roles, and if he weren't so pretty, we would never have heard his name.  But he is, and here he is, without enough horsepower to drive Ann Rice's seminal character, Lestat.But, as bad as Cruise is, he is Olivier compared to Pitt, the other megastar pretty boy non-actor.  Pitt can't act his way out of a paper bag, and frankly, if you watch the plastic bag scene in American Beauty, you'll see a bag doing a better job at acting than Pitt will ever do.Neil Jordan decided to downplay the homosexual aspect of Rice's decadent vampires.  Given the meager talent of the two leads, there isn't much left. Cruise and Pitt preen and pose through endless costume scenes and the obligatory vampire touchstones like fangs and blood, and it is mediocre beyond belief.Thank god for Kirsten Dunst.  She is spectacular as Claudia, the young vampire denied the chance to grow up physically, but who becomes more wise and mature than any human adult.  Without her, there would be nothing but air.  Even Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas are cardboard cutouts propped up in the scenery compared to her.Ann Rice has publicly said she approved of this presentation of her immensely popular book, but one can't help but wonder if she wasn't a bit disappointed, if the truth were told.  I don't hate this movie, but I hate how it is diminished by relying on marquee names instead of talent.",3,21,52,5 December 2003
Gladiator," Are you not entertained?
","From the opening moments of Gladiator, and till the last, it is clear that you are being treated to Oscar® quality entertainment. Ridley Scott, who directed one of my all-time favorites, Blade Runner, almost never misses. But few directors can ever hope to hit the mark so cleanly and convincingly as Scott does with Gladiator. Gladiator is magnificent, thrilling, moving, epic, heroic and a dozen other things so conspicuously absent in so many movies and so abundantly present here.Russell Crowe was born to play this role, and he occupies the character with epic vigor and a presence that has a tendency to overpower a scene. It is, of course, true that Crowe's ego made him nearly impossible to work with, and he is said to have proclaimed during filming that he was the greatest actor in the world. There are, in fact, moments in the film where it would be difficult to argue with him. Still, he has subtle moments as well. There is a scene, late in the movie. Maximus is near the end of an epic struggle and all the contentious forces of Rome are whirling around him. He is asked by Lucilla, the emperor's sister, with whom he apparently had an affair years ago, if all that had happened made her seem different. Crowe replies, with stunning understatement, 'You laughed more.' I knew in that moment that Crowe had won the Oscar®, and deservedly so. The story is, quite simply, largely fabrication, though to some extent based on fact. It is true that Commodus was the only Roman emperor to fight in the Coliseum, although his battle with Maximus, as well as its magnificent conclusion, is entirely fictionalized. In fact, Maximus Decimus Meridius is a completely fictitious character perhaps composited by screenwriter David Franzoni and director Ridley Scott, who clearly gave themselves full literary license to rewrite the relatively common story of Commodus into something breathtakingly memorable.Hollywood has been in the movie business a long time. There are many great movies, but few are great on the scale of Gladiator. Every aspect of Gladiator comes together so spectacularly that any shortcomings it may have are easily overlooked. Scott's inspired direction, Hans Zimmer's thrilling score, supplemented by Lisa Gerrard's stirring vocals; all conspire magically to contribute to Gladiator's success. John Mathieson's cinematography, which Scott relied on in Robin Hood and Hannibal as well, is painterly and dark, perfectly matched to the story and characters. There are movies of the genre, towering achievements in cinema from decades past, held in higher regard than Gladiator, but in many ways even they are not Gladiator's equal. Gladiator is not only a peer to the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur, but, ultimately, their superior. And for the curious, or the skeptical, I would put the Battle of Carthage scene up against the Chariot Race scene any day. Perhaps it isn't as disturbingly, agonizingly long, but the heroism and courage played out in the Carthage scene is without equal. A few of the common problems with epic films are necessarily present. Some of the characters are not fully developed, which, given the story arc, is common in epic films which are based on events rather than subtle characterizations. As for historical inaccuracies, much cited in derision of the film, I don't think Scott is presently seeking an endowed chair in History at any major university, so if he took a few liberties with a well-known story to heighten the drama, I can only reply with a quote from the main character; 'Are you not entertained?' The lore surrounding Gladiator is definitely fascinating. Oliver Reed, who died during principle filming, had to be recreated digitally in some scenes. Despite the difficulty of this effort, it was less expensive than refilming Reed's scenes and many of the cast insisted that Reed remain a part of the film. Richard Harris is rumored to have refused to learn rewrites, complicating his scenes early in the film. In both cases, their immense contributions to the film make it all worthwhile. Scott's signature touches, a washed-out color palette, the ubiquitous slow motion splattering of blood, and, most notably his tendency to magnify characters by using tight close-ups against backgrounds compressed by the application of telephoto lenses, may have been a bit overdone, but the combined effect heightens the action, the drama and the characters and somehow imbues them with a sense of history fitting the story.In short, Gladiator may be the best sandals and swords epic ever, and a worthy heir to the mantle handed down from its predecessors. Russell Crowe is glorious as the brooding and relentless gladiator bent on revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is electric as the devious and ambitious Commodus, and without a doubt should have received the Best Supporting Actor nod. With Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, sadly both now deceased, added for flavor, this is as great an epic as any. So many reviewers want to dislike movies that are popular, as if it proves that they are gifted with an appreciation of fine cinema that escapes lesser moviegoers. I say nonsense. The reason everyone thinks this movie is great is because it is great. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's just plain fun. Grab some popcorn and prepare to be entertained.",10,0,0,19 February 2001
Contact," A brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment.
","Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the 'truths' imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests. Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious. Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.",10,3,7,29 April 2001
The Great Gatsby," Seductively entertaining and visually magnificent.
","Watching this film requires a few concessions.First, you must imagine the elegantly beautiful 1974 classic version does not exist. Trust me. It's painful otherwise, and I will avoid any reference or comparison for that reason. Second, you must also imagine that, notwithstanding Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the setting is not the Roaring Twenties but, rather, some over amped time warp netherworld where Jay-Z and Beyonce' get to be avant garde again because they're rather incongruously and anachronistically foisted on a film in which they really have no place.If you make it that far, you're almost ready to watch The Great Gatsby 2013. Now brace yourself for Baz Lurhrmann's jarring postmodern deconstructivism that was thrilling a decade ago in Moulin Rouge, but has become by now almost as grotesque as Julie Taymor's murderous affront to Beatle music – Across the Universe.Thus prepared, you can now enjoy what is undeniably an entertaining, if uninspiring, film.Tobey Maquire, of whom I am usually a fan, is somewhat flaccid as Nick Carroway, despite the fact that the story depends utterly upon him to drive it forward. He does, however, bring a decidedly literary dimension to the film by framing the main story within his own attempt at recovery. Joel Edgerton is a perfectly delightful Tom Buchanan. He embodies all the machismo brutishness with which Fitzgerald envisioned the character. He also has enough personal charisma to help anchor the otherwise riotous staging. And, of course, there is DiCaprio as Gatsby. I didn't hate him, although I was predisposed to, but I wanted to love this movie, and Leo was one of the main reasons I couldn't.As far as casting, however, the jewel of this film is the deliriously sensuous and beautiful Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. She makes it easy to believe that Daisy broke hearts with just a smile back in Louisville and inspired Gatsby to bring the world to her dock for her sake.This film mines Fitzgerald's novel for more complex themes than predecessors have explored. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Ironically, it also strips all the novel's major themes of any subtlety whatsoever and reduces them to stage settings for an unrelenting onslaught of elaborate music videos.But if I reel in my disappointment for a moment, I can only conclude that this is a well-made movie that is seductively entertaining and visually magnificent. Maybe it isn't fair to expect more.",Null,1,5,11 May 2013
The Birds," Nature's Delicate Balance Disturbed.
","The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best known, if not best loved, films. It tells the tale of a small northern California town inexplicably besieged by birds. Or does it? To say so is like saying that The Maltese Falcon is about a statue of a bird.Any literary connection between this film and the Daphne DuMaurier short story is purely accidental. Hitch kept nothing more than the title, and the rest is Evan Hunter's creation. Hunter, part of Hitch's machine, created what became a perfect vehicle for Hitch's vocabulary that had, by this time, become almost cliché.There is the domineering mother, the dutiful son, the salacious blonde, and the slow, gentle descent into terror that only Hitch could weave from these threads. But as with any great story, which this is, one must look deeper to see the true meaning.Consider this. Only when Melanie Daniels arrives in Bodega Bay do the birds begin their attacks, which is to say that her arrival somehow spoils the balance in Bodega Bay. In what way, you might ask. Well, one can't help but notice that Mitch Brenner sees Melanie as someone he might be interested in, even to the point of neglecting his clinging and needy mother. Surely Melanie disturbs the stalemate between Mitch and his former lover, the long-suffering school teacher Annie Hayworth. And, with her big city ways, she is in general a disquieting influence on the town.Nature too maintains a delicate balance that can easily be thrown off balance, just as Bodega Bay is thrown off balance when Melanie breezes in with her convertible, her mink coat, and that pathetic little Edith Head green suit that she wears day after day as the movie progresses. In fact, the first bird attack is on Melanie herself, and for a time the attacks center around her.Once unleashed, however, the force of nature spreads throughout the town. Hitch himself said the central theme of The Birds is Man's unworthiness to have dominion over Nature. As the movie progresses, he reverses that condition, giving Nature dominion over Man. In fact, the small birdcage of lovebirds foreshadows a later scene in which the Brenner home has become a sort of cage with the birds imprisoning the Brenners inside.Having made this point, Hitch seemed to have nowhere to go. The original ending had Mitch, Melanie and crew eventually speeding away in her sexy convertible. The ending Hitch filmed instead was far more memorable, because it is another stalemate, leaving the viewer to wonder what might ultimately happen.This film has aged remarkably well. Having not relied on special effects, which date films so badly, it loses nothing over time. The true genius of The Birds is its slow and almost inevitable slide into a terror that doesn't seem far fetched at all, unlike the preposterous premises for most modern suspense films. Of course, another delight is the powerful cast. Jessica Tandy, Susanne Pleshette, and Rod Taylor are flawless, as is Hitch's masterful touch.Highly recommended.",10,2,3,18 September 2006
