Requiem for a Dream," The Most Over rated Art House Flick of 2000
","I had high hopes for this one.  I loved Aronofsky's debut, Pi.  I would consider it among the ten most original films ever made.  So, I went into this movie expecting a lot.  Maybe it was my own fault.  So I didn't like it.  No big deal.  Then everyone and their film school professor latches on to the film and is calling it one of the greatest films ever made.  What a load of bs!  Aronofsky just rehashes all of the camera techniques that made Pi so enjoyable to watch.  Sure, they were original in Pi and I love that movie, BUT if I wanted to see Pi again then I would have watched my DVD. And the story is ridiculous! SPOILER ALERT!  There's a drug shortage in New York!  A drug shortage!  How on Earth could their ever be a drug shortage in New York!  This comes a little past mid-way into the film and completely derails any kind of credibility the filmmakers were trying to establish. If you enjoyed those after-school, don't do drugs television programs, then you'll enjoy this one.  It will be the wildest one you've ever seen. However, when all is said and done, that's just what it is... an after school special.",2,33,63,5 November 2001
