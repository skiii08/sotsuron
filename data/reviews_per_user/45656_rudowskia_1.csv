The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Good enough, to make me want to see it again.
","I noticed that the rating for this movie is less then 5 stars. I was very surprised because I thought it was very good. Of course there was some bad parts in it, like having her constant nightmare in the beginning of the movie instead of the honeymoon like in the book and the dream was different, I didn't really like that. Also I thought the first 45mins of the movie were poorly done, I didn't like the acting or the lines, I was very disappointed. But it wasn't THAT BAD, I really enjoyed the birthing scene because it was exactly the way I imaged it while reading the book. Also I really loved the way they incorporated Jacob breaking away from the pack.",7,4,10,22 November 2011
