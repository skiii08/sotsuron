Marie Antoinette," Horribly Boring
","YAWN.....This is the first movie I did not mind having to get up and use the restroom in the middle of because I missed nothing.I went into the theater excited about a beautiful period in history, I was prepared for historical mistakes, dialog issues, and costume irregularities.. all things I can overlook just to escape into someones idea of history. I did enjoy the beauty of the movie...BUT COME ON.. enough still life shoots of food.I wished there was some character development and some dialog. I understand trying to be edgy and contemporary,but that is exactly what it was... trying to be edgy.Don't waste your money",1,3,9,28 October 2006
