Vertigo," The Greatest Movie Of All Time
","In my opinion, Vertigo is absolutely the best.  Few movies can compare to this work of genius, and mere words of praise alone cannot do justice. Alfred Hitchcock has truly created a classic cinematic work of art that needs to be experienced to be believed.This movie deals with the theme of obsession.  The story involves an acrophobic detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) who is hired by a friend to investigate on his mysterious wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). After John rescues her from a suicidal leap into the bay of the Golden Gate bridge, he finds himself becoming obsessed with her.  Further plot entanglements ensues, resulting in one of the most fascinating and chilling mystery stories ever told.  The 'Master of Suspense' certainly lived up to his nickname.  Vertigo also contained some of the best acting I have ever seen.  There is so much intense psychological agitation between Stewart and Novak.  Both actors are simply amazing in portraying their characters with very complex feelings for each other.  The beautiful Kim Novak had a dual role, and gave the best performance in the movie.  Novak is so haunting, melancholy, and full of mystery because she gave an intelligent and subtle performance.  In certain moments of the movie, her characters are truly heartwrenching.The movie is completed and perfected by the score of the legendary Bernard Herrmann.  I cannot stress enough on how important his music is to the emotional impact of Vertigo.  The scores range from uneasy agitation to sumptuously romantic with a haunting, dark foreboding tone to it.  Vertigo simply won't be the same without Herrmann's music.  The crafty use of exuberant colors as symbolic representations throughout the movie is also very clever.Vertigo is a film so passionate, the whole experience blows my senses away and lingered in my mind for a long time.  I have watched it again and again only to find myself becoming mesmerized all over again in a world of obsession.  Vertigo is most definitely Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement ever.",10,2,5,21 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yipeee! Erm, yeah right.
","I felt compelled to write a review for The Phantom Menace, the dark horse of the Star Wars saga. Nowadays, it seems that either you love it or hate it. Personally I had a great time watching it, me being this huge Star Wars fan who loves nothing more than being transported into another world far, far away. The venerable Qui-Gon Jinn is well played by Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor is an inspired - or make that great - choice to play Obi-Wan Kenobi. As usual, Ian MacDiarmid gave us an exciting, subdued performance that underlies his sinister nature.Okay, so the movie may does not have the same wit and energy as the original trilogy, nor its more intimate settings, due to the expanded sets and gargantuan CGI environments. Nevertheless, its still a fun ride, and we get some early ideas on how the Empire may got its foothold in a form of Darth Sidious aka the Emperor.However some things still bugs me. There are glaring, sinful flaws that George Lucas somehow put in the film without even realising it. Anakin Skywalker was played terribly! Whether that problem is caused by either Jake Llyod's poor acting or Lucas' poor directing, we will never, ever know. The young Jedi-to-be managed to be emotionless throughout the movie, and when he does show some emotion we were instead given the god-awful line 'Yipeee!' I don't know how I managed not to vomit in the theatre years ago ... its much worse than Luke's whiny voice when he complains about getting power converters at Toshi station. The scene when Anakin tells Padme about beautiful angels was just wooden and laughable too.Another problem is Jar-Jar Binks, but not because of his appearance and his silly accent, because he is actually quite cool. But I sincerely believe that he is a character that tries desperately to be funny, a sort of a wink-wink-nudge-nudge appeal to the kiddies, so his jokes often fell flat because there's nothing spontaneous about his situation. No wonder many fans ended up hating him.I watched this film with wide-eyed wonder, as much as I did when I first saw the original three many years ago. Thus I enjoyed it thoroughly, but that experience is somewhat marred by a couple of bad choices from Lucas himself.",8,0,1,24 April 2002
12 Monkeys," One clever movie
","Quite an impressive work by Terry Gilliam, and that's a nice change after all the mind-twisting numbness of Brazil.12 Monkeys has a brilliantly constructed plot about the destruction of mankind by a virus, but I won't go into the plot details here. Bruce Willis gave one of the best performances in his life, but I don't agree with the majority of people about Brad Pitt's acting. He is quite distracting and a bit exaggerated, but obviously he's having a time of his life playing a nutty character.The best moment is when the character is in the theatre, feeling a sense of deja vu, that he is somewhat re-living a phase of his memory. That scene became genuinely creepy when Hitchcock's Vertigo is playing in the background.For those of you who struggled with Brazil (watched it several times already) 12 Monkeys is more fun and comprehensible, but by no means I'm suggesting that the movie itself is simple-minded. If there is any criticism, I'll say that the ending is just isn't satisfying enough. After all the twists and thrill, one would expect an equally, if not more, startling ending. But it ended in a way like someone has walked around in a circle.Highly recommended viewing!",9,1,1,24 December 2002
The Others," It's not often that a movie gets it right
","This is an elegant haunted house movie in its purest, most classic form. It relies solely on atmosphere, creepy music and sense of foreboding, without ever resorting to those cheap and overused 'jolts' that pops up from the side of the frame to scare us. The script is well-written and in certain cases it makes you think. I recommend watching this movie without any preconceptions of any kind, otherwise it might ruin the experience and surprises.I must point out that after reading several of the critics' reviews, I cannot understand those who claim that the movie is too slow. Why? Have they been so desensitized by movies with big explosions and CGI graphics that they cannot envelope themselves in a movie's atmosphere without a guiding hand? The comparison of this movie with The Sixth Sense is well deserved, and this I believe says a lot about its quality. Every frame and moment are filled with a thick atmosphere that never lets up, and the answer always seems out of reach until the very end. Interesting and hard questions are also being raised about our perceptions of the supernatural as well as religion, and the movie handled these issues very well with overlaying subtleness. I have to say that the movie is also nicely cast, the two kids are great and convincing without any hint of cliched sentimentalism about them. Nicole Kidman did a good job, she got better throughout the movie and in one scene looked positively ravishing.After seeing several of those special effects-laden haunted house flicks such as the remakes of the Haunting and House on the Haunted Hill, I was so sure that nobody understands how to do this particular genre justice anymore, and that we'll just have to resort to its teen-lite version such as Scream. Well thankfully The Others proved that with the right approach and thought, substance and style always go well hand-in-hand. If you enjoyed rewarding and intelligent thrillers like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is for you.",10,3,4,10 June 2002
Ed Wood," A Fun And Endearing Movie To Watch
","Great story, endearing characters, and hilarious tacky moments shines brilliantly upon this movie from the beginning until the end.  While I don't have a clue about the true real-life story of Edward D. Wood Jr, one thing I know for sure is that I'm having heaps of fun.This biopic is basically about Ed Wood himself, the so-called 'Worst Director of All Time' and how he is determined to make it in Hollywood. Although many considered his movies to be awful and regard him as a director with no sense whatsoever about the art of filmmaking, Ed Wood is portrayed as a director of immense passion for storytelling, yet who is so in love with every shot being taken and felt there is no need to take a second one.In Hollywood, Ed Wood has a bunch of strange and colorful associates from Tor Johnson the Swedish Wrestler to Vampira the Night TV Hostess which are all very amusing to watch.  But beneath all this, the movie's strongest and best aspect is about Ed Wood's friendship with the legendary and ailing Bela Lugosi. Herein lies the heart of the movie's storyline; the fact that both are ridiculed by their Hollywood contemporaries yet still recognizing greatness in each other is just endearing.  They helped out each other, and I really felt a pang in my heart when Ed Wood sadly watched the last film reel of Lugosi ever filmed while 'The Swan Lake' plays in the background. Credit is to Martin Landau; he truly deserved those many awards that were heaped upon him for his most AMAZING role as Lugosi.  As for Johnny Depp, he is great for playing Ed Wood with a fresh enthusiasm.Tim Burton is to be commended for his portrayals of all the characters in the movie.  To make us laugh, he clearly pokes fun at them and the whole B-movie culture in the 60's but it's obvious that those portrayals were done with sincere affection.  One of the funniest scenes is when Lugosi were asked for a glass of wine and said 'I don't drink ... wine.'  It was a pleasant surprise for Dracula fans.  Another hilarious scene is when Lugosi gave the performance of his life wrestling a puppet Octopus in a cold lake.Ed Wood is a great movie that pays proper homage to its characters and the culture that they lived in.  It can be enjoyed again and again, and still makes me grin and laugh.  Most definitely one of my favorite films of all time.",10,0,0,16 May 2000
X-Men," Thoroughly Entertaining
","I enjoyed this movie even though my knowledge of the comic book version is very limited.  Usually comic books don't translate well to movies (due to incompetent directing and scriptwriting) but I have to give this one a thumbs up.  They did the right thing to introduce only a few mutants, because there are too many mutant characters in the X-Men comic.  To put them all in the movie would be silly.  With a few central characters, we can focus more on the storyline than mere mutant-plethora eye-candy.  Filmmaking is different from comics, after all.The cast delivered satisfying performances.  Professor X is just spot on and looks like the actual comic character.  Wolverine is very convincing, and Magneto has presence.  The other characters are also played very well, like Jean Grey, and Rogue who is given a sensitive performance.  My only minor quibble is Storm. Halle Berry is very good-looking, but somehow her acting is wooden and is made obvious that she is just play acting.  It's no big deal though.But the real goody comes at the end.  I just LOVE how open-ended the ending was!  It screams out that a sequel is in the making, which made me to look forward as how the story continues ... just like 'Back To The Future' trilogy.  The possibilities of bringing more new mutants are exhilirating.A very well done movie with great casts.",7,0,0,17 August 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Hilarious
","This is definitely one of Stanley Kubrick's finest moment.  I mean, Dr Strangelove is just so funny, even after repeated viewings.  The reason this movie is funny is that essentially, this is a war-drama film, but is being done in an impeccable comedy fashion that downplays the actual dark theme of potential nuclear holocaust.  Each and every characters are a caricature of madness and desperation, and Peter Sellers astounds me with his three different roles.  Every actors here have really done themselves great justice.There are many great moments in this movie.  Try to keep a straight face during the scene when president Dmitri freaked out on president Muffley who tries to calm him down over the phone. The Coke machine/phone booth scene is priceless, as well as Dr Strangelove's bio-hand involuntary 'Heil' salute antics.  I still can't get over the fact that a Colonel kept saying 'prevert' - it was just so funny.  When the bomb exploded at the end (with an unforgettable scene of rodeo-riding a bomb), the audience will realize that they've been had by all the dark humor covering the grim reality of nuclear war.  More magnificent movies like this should really be made.",10,1,1,12 January 2000
Full Metal Jacket," A disappointing and flawed film
","Stanley Kubrick, one of my favorite directors, has made many masterpieces, but this one is really a letdown.  The first half of the movie is great, focusing on the demoralization of the soldiers-in-training that has a tragic ending.  The immensely entertaining Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey) and his barrages of derigatory lines designed to wear out the new recruits adds to the sheer brilliance of the movie's first part.In the second part though, I grew more and more bored.  There weren't enough character development.  I felt nothing for the two soldiers who got slaughtered in an ambush, and at the end when the soldiers shot the girl, as gruesome it may looked, I felt no pain whatsoever.  Also, part two of the movie seemed like a sloppy job on cutting and pasting scenes, and the plot made the soldiers wander around aimlessly.Kubrick may have tried to let the audience feel the no-remorseness and aimlessness that some of the soldiers must have felt in Vietnam war, but this is too cerebral and have left me unengaged emotionally.  Worst of all, the scene where the soldiers were being interviewed by journalists became disgustingly artificial as one by one, the soldiers started to say their one-liners in a perfectly-timed sequence.  The ending where the soldiers march singing the Mickey Mouse Club tune is somewhat a redeeming scene.My advice is, watch the first part of this movie only, turn it off, and watch 'Saving Private Ryan' as the substitute for part two of Full metal Jacket.  I know no one is perfect, it's just that I expected a lot more from Kubrick.",Null,0,1,3 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the CGI
","There's nothing like watching a Star Wars movie for the first time. When the sound of trumpets blaring, and the word 'Episode II' pops out, I was overwhelmed with emotion and I gripped my seat tightly ... but then I thought hold on, the movie hasn't even started yet. But boy, when I walked out from the theatre, I was consumed with an overwhelming desire to buy another ticket and walk right back in. Yes I am a huge Star Wars fan, and with Attack of the Clones, the magic is back once again and I'm loving it.What strikes me about Episode II, is that there are more CGI in it than all the Jurassic Park movies put together. Even the venerable Yoda is no longer a muppet. All of the Clone army is done entirely with computers, even in scenes where there is only one or two of them, which is pretty strange. Can't they just get extras to walk around in suits? So I'm not sure if all this excess CGI is a good thing, but nevertheless Episode II managed to be one of the best Star Wars movie yet, even though I still miss that expressive Yoda puppet from The Empire Strikes Back ... its like casting Miss Piggy as a CGI character - its just not the same.Unlike the previous Phantom Menace, the biggest improvement is that there is finally a good chunk of story to bite into. Now we have the pre-requisite love story of Anakin & Padme, a relationship that's destined to end in tragedy (and twin babies). Its quite nice, but however the actual story on politics is more interesting because its starting to draw parallels to Anakin's fate as the future Jedi terminator. He is portrayed nicely by the newcomer Hayden Christensen, who managed to project his dark emotions and desires very well, and there are several powerful scenes where Anakin showed his early inclinations towards the dark side. In fact, many of the movie's best moments are provided by him. When it comes to the love story however, Anakin & Padme lacked the natural spark & wit that Han Solo and Leia exhibited in the original trilogy. But it is not as bad as some people think, and they do make a cute couple together. The 'romantic' dialogue is as Star-Warish as it can get; sometimes cheesy, sometimes not. But considering their young age and the period of time they live in, its perfectly acceptable and works well for me. Ewan McGregor is great, even better than before. He is becoming more and more like the original Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Alec Guinness, sporting a beard and a cynical attitude to boot. Obi-Wan even has a sense of humor on occasions, and his banters with Anakin are insightful. McGregor remains one of the most inspired casting in the trilogy.Now for once, I can comment on the soundtrack since The Phantom Menace has hardly any - except one - memorable tracks that one can whistle to. Now we get a sweeping, haunting score reminiscent of the original love theme, plus other original tracks and delightful cameos that brings tears to those who grew up on the original movies.But the best thing about Episode II is that it brings us much closer than ever to the third chapter, where many questions and mysteries will finally be answered. How will Anakin turn to Vader? What is the mysterious connection between Darth Sidious and Palpatine? Who exactly is Darth Tyrannus? Imagine, all of this goodies will be revealed in the next one, and the whole saga will finally make sense!!!!! George Lucas has done very well in that department, considering that re-telling a story in backward order is no easy task. Suddenly, 2005 seems like an eternity ... but hey that's exactly how I felt back in 1999. Episode II is definitely worth waiting for, and now I can't begin to imagine what magic Episode III has in store for me (besides what probably be another cheesy title). Well done Lucas!",7,0,0,21 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This movie is a miracle!
","Pure magic. Spectacular. I am a fan of Tolkien's book, and this movie is just miraculous. I've walked into the theatre excited, and 3 hours later I left the theatre feeling even more excited than ever. That has never, EVER happened to me. Man, what just happened???? Who would've thought that a small-time director like Peter Jackson could pull it off successfully? GREAT acting, GREAT sceneries, blah blah blah I can just go on and on. This is the real thing... the stuff that cinema is truly invented for. Spielberg, Lucas, and other Hollywood big-shots should eat their director's chair and hung their heads low in shame, because THIS is how millions of dollars should properly be spent.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
Apocalypse Now," Not As Good As I Thought
","Every once in a while, some war movie is released and some brain-dead film critic said things like 'The best war movie ever'  I'm so sick of it.  I mean, that statement had been applied to countless war movies already. Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, etc, are all garbage.After hearing so many good words about Apocalypse Now, I just had to go and watch it on video.  My conclusion after watching it?  It's an okay film with an amazing cinematography, but is way too overhyped.  Besides, I already watched a better film that also depicts a man's journey towards madness. Werner Herzog's film called 'Aguirre: The Wrath Of God' is a flat-out masterpiece.First of all, no Vietnam war movies ever depict the other side of the story. I mean, directors always make them as though the US had won or something. Nobody dared to make a movie about the enduring humiliation that the US suffered due to the stupidity of global war against communism.  For example, movies like 'Dogma' is clever and challenging because Kevin Smith dares to poke fun out of Catholicism.  But I guess it's easier to cover up and bask in denial in a form of a hot-shot Hollywood director's chair.The greatest war movie ever?  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  No comparison.",5,2,10,17 August 2000
Edward Scissorhands," A Story Told In Beautiful Simplicity
","Edward Scissorhands is really an amazing movie.  The plethora of lush cinematography, beautiful musical score, and great characters are extremely entertaining.  The storyline is simple yet very moving.  I still get misty-eyed at the end, even though I watched it many times already.  The musical scores by the amazing Danny Elfman in Edward Scissorhands are one of his best work.  It is achingly beautiful.  Everytime Tim Burton and Danny Elfman worked together in a movie, magic happens.  Burton's gothic style and Elfman's halloween-like scores always blends perfectly.The story surrounds an unfinished creation named Edward, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp.  The talented actor managed to make Edward a simple being that radiates vulnerability as well as restrained passion suggesting the real, imperfect humanity within.  Edward's intimidating scissorhands and strange black & white physical appearance looked out of place amongst the pastel-colored suburban surroundings.  He is unique; we both laugh and sympathize when we see Edward having a hard time trying to eat a single green pea with his scissorhands, but then we become slack-jawed to see that his expression of artistry in sculpting are effortless, masterful, imaginative, and passionate.The movie ends rather sadly, yet beautifully at the same time.  The tragic incident at the end over Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) is a single act of both unvented frustrations over the injustices done by Jim, as well as to protect Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder), the love of his life.  This shows that although uncompleted, the fearsome scissorhands merely masks our eyes to his feelings, conflicts, and the imperfections of that of a real human being. His body is not completed, but his heart is.",10,138,156,7 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Must be seen to be believed!!!!
","When I went to the theatre with some friends to see Saving Private Ryan, nothing had me prepared for what was about to come.  The opening scene on the beach of Normandy was so graphic and realistic, it was truly a sensory-overload experience.  Throughout the movie, Spielberg lets action to speak for itself, instead of settling for hip dialogues that tries to sound smart.So far, this is the most well-made and greatest war film ever made.  Forget what other people have said about other war movies!!  Saving Private Ryan is the only film where I almost felt pain whenever I see bullets and explosions annihilate the soldiers.  It has succeeded where other war movies have tried unsuccesfully to do: to shock the nerve out of you, and to make the audience fully realize the stark reality of war.Saving Private Ryan doesn't lecture about war.  Instead, the scenes will do it without words.  My friends and I left the cinema feeling so shocked and affected, and that's how I knew that this is the best war movie ever made. We get the message alright, because Spielberg is a true film genius.",Null,0,0,17 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Less intimacy but more action-packed
","What a great movie The Two Towers is, chiefly because it is the exact opposite of its smashing prequel The Fellowship of the Ring, and yet the movie still delivers and much more! My opinion on both movies stands on an equal ground, because these two complement each other. The differences are very apparent, especially on second viewing: it feels less intimate, has much more action sequences, doesn't have the prequel's linear pace and progression, the emergence of an important CGI character, and overall has a much more perilous tone than the last.It is true that much has been left out or changed, even more so than the first movie. But most of the crucial events as well as tone & movement is all there, and that is all that matters to me (this is speaking from a BIG fan of the book who has read many of Tolkien's works and understood much of Middle-Earth's lores).My instinct tells me to put a hold on all opinions until The Return of the King comes out, and then watch all three one after the other in the same day. We'll then realise at how AWESOME the trilogy is and marvel at its unimaginable scope. It is the only way the story can be enjoyed - after all, no die-hard fan of the book stops reading it when it gets to a certain part!Once again well done to Peter Jackson & writers, the stellar casts, and all at Weta workshop for a wonderful movie.",10,0,0,19 January 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Utter crap!
","John Woo proves to us again that once he doesn't have Chow Yun-Fat's deadly charisma at his side to save his ass, he is all hype and no go. We all know by now that John Woo's unabashed over-sentimentalist approach is enough to make some people puke, and this movie is no different. But that's just him, besides he does have an uncanny ability to choreograph graceful gunfights, so I'll leave him at that. The real problem however is that Tom Cruise is only an average actor (see him over-acting in Magnolia). Throughout the movie, I cannot identify his struggles against the 'bad guys' no matter how much I want to, so therefore I fail to see the relevance of this movie. Whatever happened to the good old days when Bruce Willis captured the audience's sympathise in Die Hard? Anyhow being a big-budgeted movie, the stunt sequences just tries TOO hard to impress the audience, but again what does it have to do with anything? Its just eye-candy, and its not THAT great to begin with. So I sat there in the theatre, bored to tears, wishing that I didn't took a chance on this worthless flick.",1,2,4,22 March 2002
The Insider," Way too overrated
","American moviemaking is so deceptive these days.  Get A-list actors, directors, and some decent, serious plot for a film, and you'll get those academy award nominations rolling in.  But great actors don't make a great film.  Story is always, and has always been, number one.I thought this film gives us a slick pacing in its storyline, which is good. But it is emotionally flat throughout the picture.  The biggest problem is the theme itself.  I don't know about the others who thinks this film is a roller-coaster thriller, but almost everyone now knows that smoking is bad for the health.  I felt like I already knew half of the story before I actually walk in to the theatre.I am biased when I saw this movie, I admit.  My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs. Still, I was hoping that the film would provide some plot-twists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys, just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it. True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up - he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck, I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino, but for the first time I did.This movie, being a true story, showed a lot of promise, but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen (and vice versa).  I blame it on the director.  Those who thinks that Wigand is psychologically tormented obviously hasn't seen a Hitchcock film!",4,10,21,14 September 2000
Castle in the Sky," You need a 20 out of 10 ratings to rate Miyazaki's films
","Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",10,217,243,24 July 2000
Army of Darkness," Gory, slapstick fun
","One look at this movie and I understood why it has such a cult following. It's fun to watch!  Bruce Campbell cracked me up with his strings of hilariously macho one-liners, and everything is dark but taken very lightly to provide an amusing entertainment.  Some scenes are gory, but that's part of the fun because it's done in such an obviously silly manner.  For one, try shooting a shotgun over your shoulder while looking at the opposite direction!!!  But the funniest and most rewarding scene has to be the end sequence in the supermarket.  Great movie to watch for those who are tired & stressed out from work, and in dire need of a humorous, but silly, escapism.",10,1,1,29 November 2001
The Deer Hunter," Vietnam flick? I don't think so.
","Face it, all movies about the Vietnam war sucks. When will writers realise that the Vietnam war so much more than having psychologically disturbed soldiers sneaking about in a jungle with facial paints? Might as well watch Rambo. Where are the innocent Vietnamese civilians... have we forgotten how much they suffered as well? When Brando muttered 'The horror, the horror' he must have been talking about the state of Vietnam flicks produced in Hollywood.<ul><li>Contains ending spoiler -</li></ul>So how come The Deer Hunter is still emotionally powerful after all these years? Essentially, this movie is often mistaken as a pure Vietnam war flick, but I found that to be untrue. Emphasis is placed squarely on character development, and here lies the strength of the film; three tragic characters who are forever changed by the war that they were involved in - because the war setting serves as a mere background noise that drives these three close friends to the brink of insanity. At the end of the film, I could only shook my head in pity as the principal characters gathered together around the table, singing the American anthem like a bunch of broken, tattered warriors. War is horrible, but they choose to remain patriotic until the bitter end. The sad irony of life! By doing so, they ask the audience to feel sorry for them as opposed to sentimental sympathy because war is wrong, not just an empty spectacle made for popcorn-munching theatre goers.",9,0,0,22 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," As good as everyone says it to be, and with a GREAT ending
","Finally! After waiting for years the big payoff is here and it couldn't be better. Return of the King is a definitive culmination of a journey and have essentially wrapped the trilogy into one big film.Again I walked out the theatre with a big grin and a feeling of light-footedness, much like after watching the first two. It has great character moments akin of The Fellowship of the Ring, and spectacular battle scenes bigger than The Two Towers. But while TT focused more on the world of Men, this time the Hobbits have taken the centre stage, especially that of Frodo and Sam. Memorable visuals are plentiful like the beacon of Minas Tirith, the sight of Orc armies marching out from Minas Morgul, Trolls beating the drums of war, rampaging Mumakils and more.What else can I say about this movie except to gush more about it? I love the book and the movies, and very grateful to both J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson for their respective talents.Those useless movie reviewers who complained that the ending 'dragged on' for too long are not worth their salt. Its not even long at all! These guys just reek in their over-glorified short-attention span and they have a 'Made in Hollywood' stamped over their foreheads. Since the first two did not have endings, the third film demand proper closure. This film has the dignity to say goodbye to the characters in a proper fashion. After all, when you reach the end of a gigantic NINE hours trilogy, wouldn't YOU want an ending that takes it time to reward its audiences instead of rushing straight into the credits?",10,0,0,19 December 2003
Ran," Grab a bowl of popcorn for this one
","Ran is a great movie, because its a lot of fun in a spectacular way.  Much like the Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, its a great mix of serious filmmaking and entertainment, which means you can just sit down on a couch for more than 2 hours, absorbing all the little details while munching on popcorns. I tell you, this is rare since most movies are either too cerebral (not a bad thing) or too bombastic (sometimes not a bad thing). The battle sequences are very, very nicely done, and the characters are so tragic. Seeing someone like Hidetora falling downhill into a crazed, senile old man has never been so much fun. All sorts of characters appear in a form of double crossers, weaklings, manipulators, fools, honourable warriors, tragic victims, heroes... they're all here. Its easy to get convoluted in its plot, dialogue and visual scenes and say 'oh Ran is about betrayal' or 'Ran speaks on the horror of war.' Look closely, and you'll see that Kurosawa uses the whole film to point out that mankind are foolish and questions our ability to change, even though we are aware of it (Ikiru shares this subtle parallelism on theme). The very last scene with Tsurumaru alone on a cliff is unforgettable.Buy it, hire it, or borrow it, it doesn't matter as long as you get to watch Ran, because it will be a blast.",10,0,2,17 April 2002
Windtalkers," More splatterfest than Friday the 13th
","Let me be harsh here. I ponder what went wrong inside John Woo's head when he made this stinkbomb? Has he finally succumbed to the big dollars of Hollywood, so much that he has the nerve to make movies like M:I2? Although Windtalkers is nowhere as bad, nonetheless its still a shallow exercise in style. I sat down with a couple of friends, and throughout the movie we were bombarded with nothing but the sounds of guns, explosions, and flying corpses. Never once the movie made me feel the destructive power of mankind's stupidity. Even though some war movies depicts a lot of violence, movies like Saving Private Ryan was never gratituous. Windtalkers - or John Woo - is more in love with explosions, slo-mo gunfights and painfully cliched dialogues than its purported subject. At the end, I asked myself 'Where on earth were those noble Navajo Indians???' Like many people, the 'subject' of the story drew me into buying a ticket. On the big screen, the Native Americans have rarely been portrayed correctly (which also can be said to many minorities living in the states). So I thought everyone will finally get to see them being heroic and brave, and Windtalkers does that to an extent, but not nearly enough. Alas their presence and contributions here were so numbed down, and instead we get too much of Nick Cage's character, (whose job here is to sell movie tickets) looking like a madman spraying bullets to no end. Why can't we get Windtalkers starring a real Navajo Indian anyway? The entire movie feels like a false advertisement to me.",1,14,25,15 June 2002
Gladiator," Boring, overrated piece of garbage
","Boring, boring, boring!!!  When this film won Oscar's best picture award, I finally realised that mindless Hollywood entertaiment is all that people want; which made me really sad.  This film is no Oscar material at all - it's just another one of those no-brain Hollywood blockbuster action movies. Russell Crowe did nothing more than using his grunts to win his way to the Oscar statuette.  Gosh, I even remember being bored to the death by this shallow galore.  The colloseum sequences are dry, and Joaquin Phoenix was not threatening enough as a villain.  The characters are as flat as cardboxes and as interesting to watch as looking at the thermometer going up.  When Commodus said to Maximus (gee, Maximus; what an original name) that he ravished his wife repeatedly, it was a point that the audiences should feel anger.  But, instead of me feeling angry towards the bad guy, I let loose with a big, gaping yawn.The victory of Gladiator at the Oscars only shows the current, sorry state of American filmmaking.  Pathetic movies disguised with coating candy, like American Pie, Road Trip, and that Tom Green movie.  Ridley Scott should stick to making his Alien flicks.  So if you want a boring pile of action trash that happens to win Oscars, which it can have Van Damme as it's main lead and it wouldn't matter anyway, go and see Gladiator.(PS: a better alternative would be 'Spartacus' which is a way, way better film - trust me on this)",1,2,13,28 April 2001
Goodfellas," Pretty good, but overrated
","Goodfellas is about a journey of an outsider who makes it good in the world of Italian mafia, and befriends two mobs for the remainder of his career. Much like Forrest Gump, its a story being told largely through one person' point of view. I conclude at the end that although the movie was exteremely enjoyable, its a bit overrated and it did not bear any lasting images in my psyche. There isn't a single aspect that strikes me as memorable or powerful. Thus it irritates me to no end that Goodfellas is constantly being compared to The Godfather, because I couldn't disagree more. What makes The Godfather so good is that its not really about gangsters running a business, but a deep look on family relationships and how their respective roles and personalities contribute to the family's successes and downfall. Goodfellas is only about three men working together, having the time of their lives, and occasionally punching and kicking their way through obstacles before things starts to fall apart at the end - nothing is out of the ordinary. The only message I get from the story is that becoming a gangster gives you power, but you must pay for that power dearly in exchange for absolute loyalty. Problem is, I've heard of this countless of times already.Goodfellas has a great cast (especially Pesci), nicely paced storyline and unfortunately an average soundtrack trying hard to 'capture' the feel of the period. I like it and its really entertaining, but at the same time its an utterly forgettable gangster movie.",7,2,6,22 May 2002
Princess Mononoke," Incredible Beyond Words
","Rarely I go to see a film and left the theatre stunned with such awe.  Many of the audiences even sat silently throughout the end credit with the aura of respect, and it's understandable.  It's breathtakingly beautiful, emotionally complex, and epic in scale.  I mean, this movie is just so absorbing.  Once in a lifetime, I am grateful that someone like Mr. Miyazaki fully awakened my inner child and totally had me absorbed throughout the movie with a world so rich in mythical wonder.  How many animated movies out there can make a fully grown adult fight back tears without any sentimentality?  The characters are all so down-to-earth and realistically portrayed, throw in a plot that is full of heart, and thank goodness for the top-notch dubbing done by top Hollywood actors. I can just go on ranting and raving about this movie until the cows come home.  In my opinion, it's SO good that no other animated films can ever hope to compare with Princess Mononoke.  Bottom word, it is a flawless masterpiece; a pure work of genius that deserves to be seen by many generations to come, both adults and children alike.  So see this film, because it will be one of the best ride to another world anyone could ever experience. I personally guarantee it.",10,0,1,11 July 2000
