The Avengers," A movie that not only lives up to everyone's expectations, but also blew them away. The Avengers is a movie that everybody should see.
","I'm giving no spoilers here since I am wanting to make anybody who hasn't seen this movie to go hit the movie theaters ASAP. Needless to say, The Avengers is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick. MARVEL truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot. They not only did a huge team up movie, but they also created one that was deep, compelling and brilliantly done. Every hero we've seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group, but each one also individually. We see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own. Even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and I for one applaud that. The action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best I've seen in a superhero flick; especially the final battle. Not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action, but its humor is also top notch. I burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and I think you will too when you see them. There is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant. I'm not going to go into more of this movie so I don't dare spoil anything for you all, but it has to be said right now. The Avengers is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 I've ever seen. The story is excellent, the characters are superb, the effects are top notch, there is plenty of funny moments, and everything in this movie is well balanced from beginning to end. If you haven't seen this movie, then do so. It's everything you want in a superhero movie and you can't miss it at all. Get to the theater today and see this movie!",10,5,11,13 May 2012
