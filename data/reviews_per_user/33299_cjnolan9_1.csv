The Avengers," great film
",This movie is super hero cinematic excellence. It has one of the greatest ensemble cast ever assembled. Every actor complimented each other so well and each played their respective roles gracefully. Robert Downey Jr. was funny and portrayed the classic tony stark that he did so well in the previous iron man. He maintained all the cockiness and swagger that he had previously. Mark Ruffalo was a much better Hulk than expected. He did better than Edward Norton's portrayal in the previous film. He was very intellectual and benefited the movie well. Chris Evans was the perfect leader for this heroic crew. He had great one-liners throughout. Hawkeye and Black Widow were both good compliments to the the team also. All around great movie that you can even take the kids to see.,10,2,8,18 March 2013
