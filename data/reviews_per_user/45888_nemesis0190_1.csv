Sucker Punch," NOT degrading for women, MORE than just action
","sucker punch is a great but not perfect movie. it does a lot of things right but has one major mistake, which is that we don't get to know the characters very well. we don't really know anything about their motives and i believe about 30 minutes more movie length to learn more about the girls backgrounds would have made sucker punch an extraordinary piece of art, but maybe this was on purpose, even though i think this would be a mistake - explanation following.most people don't seem to get the message behind the movie. it is not just a 'stupid' clich√© action movie, it criticizes the totally by men designed entertainment world. there has never been some kind of 'lara croft revolution' as strong women/heroines in movies, games etc. are always some kind of hot piece of a** and always our 'babydolls' (which could be the reason for not giving background information) ;) just take a look at the battlefields. nazi zombies? call of duty. orcs and dragons? robot guards? strip club? i don't think i have to give more answers. and who mostly plays those games? men. made by us, for us.i think there was enough talking about the perfect action scenes so in the end all i can say is, that if you didn't get the message the first time, maybe you should watch it again considering what you just read in my review and maybe you will think better of it then.oh and i love the soundtrack.",8,8,15,31 March 2011
