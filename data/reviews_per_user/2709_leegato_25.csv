The Avengers," Epic, But Certainly Not The Best Marvel Film (For Its Time)
","Everything that the Marvel Cinematic Universe was culminating to leads up to this. And it certainly doesn't disappoint. Except story-wise.What made the previous Marvel films compelling was how they managed to write a unique and realistic story that became the primary focus of the films rather than the overused hero-villain structure. Watching Tony Stark grow from arrogant billionaire to humbled hero, torn by war. Watching Bruce Banner suffer with his internal Jekyll-Hyde in a modern society. Watching Thor Odinson learn from Earth and become humbled. And finally seeing Captain America use his sense of duty to the US to cope with his new superhuman powers. The MCU films' most attractive feature, in my opinion, was the storyline.I felt Marvel's The Avengers strayed from the character-driven storyline. The main conflict and growth in the film is getting the heroes to adjust their agendas as a team. But a majority of the film is also dedicated to the action, the one-line jokes, and the special effects spectacles that take up at least a third of the film. With The Avengers, we get a fun movie that diminishes the realistic take on heroes that the previous MCU films employed and puts more emphasis on the comedy and epic spectacle that is the film. There's much less room for the typical character development and storyline that we came to love through the MCU. While it's amazing to see these heroes finally come together on the same screen and work as a beautiful team, the story falls flat to a basic heroes-fight-villain structure.",6,0,1,11 May 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A Masterpiece That Pays Off
","I don't like calling Blade Runner 2049 a sequel. To me, a 'sequel' suggests that it builds off of the story and success of a previous installment. A 'sequel' is something that continues the story of previous core characters. Blade Runner 2049 is not JUST a sequel. It's an expansion, both in the visual sense and the thematic sense.To really sum things up, Blade Runner 2049 is a rare film that manages to capture both the look and the heart of its predecessor, yet remain wholly original and refreshing for a modern audience. The story follows K, a newer-model Replicant who is a Blade Runner for the LAPD. After discovering a jarring secret about the Nexus 08 Replicants (from the original Blade Runner), K is sent out on a journey to track down Officer Deckard, who has been in hiding for 30 years.Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most beautiful films to come out in film history. Every single shot is precisely filmed, positioned, and edited to create the sense of vastness in the world's dystopia. The cinematography beautifully executes the film's colors and shots to establish the different worlds visited in the film. It's a visual tribute to the original's groundbreaking effects, but also manages to break out of the confines of the original and become it's own work of art.What makes Blade Runner 2049 such a compelling addition to the Blade Runner series is that, with this new storyline, it manages to touch on the original's themes of existentialism and the definition of humanity. What does it mean to be human? With a protagonist who is a Replicant AND a Blade Runner, this question is further prodded. The main plot of the film revolves around this question, and takes K on a journey discovering on what he actually is, and what his experiences are supposed to mean to him.Ryan Gosling plays the role of K with beautiful precision and subtlety; the film is supposed to convey how K feels human even when he knows he isn't, and even raises the possibility if he is human. Gosling's nonverbal acting perfectly sums up the complexity of thought that K goes through, and transforms into the character on screen.Do you need to see the original Blade Runner in order to watch this? Yes and no. Blade Runner 2049 stands on its own as a slow burner, sci fi thriller that manages to capture its audience no matter what they've seen before. However, Blade Runner 2049 also expands on the original Blade Runner, taking the original's visual innovations and thematic elements and modernizing them to a new contemporary standard of storytelling. Watching the original Blade Runner will only make you enjoy 2049 even more. 2049 is a rare example of a 'sequel' surpassing its predecessor visually and creatively.",10,4,11,15 November 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Poorly-Paced Heist Film with a Thrilling (And Slightly Redeeming) Third Act
","Set shortly before the events of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, Rogue One tells the iconic, yet never shown, story of how the Rebels got those Death Star plans that led to the station's destruction at the hands of them, ultimately igniting one of the most iconic story arcs in film history.Rogue One is a unique example of a film where the ending was written first, and it became the filmmakers' jobs to write a solid beginning and middle to help ground and justify a conclusion that audiences would be guaranteed to love. Unfortunately, it becomes apparent that this unique obstacle was a challenge for them.The first and second acts are a mess! The film establishes too many characters at once that would eventually form the core Rogue One team to initiate the Death Star heist, and, due to poor pacing, makes the characters' roles and positions in the storyline so ambiguous and convoluted that it becomes difficult to keep track who is who in the film, and who is doing what in the film's storyline. What was the pilot supposed to do? Who was he sent by again? Not enough time is dedicated to clarifying these details in this complex storyline; the lack of decent pacing leaves unanswered questions about our characters, and makes otherwise important characters appear useless to the storyline (Forrest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera, for example).It's only with the third act does everything that was confusing about the first and second acts start to make sense. Having said that, this heist film seems more like a mystery given the audience has to piece together the confusing parts of the first parts to figure out how they make the last part make sense. Maybe, by this time, who cares how they got together? We just want to see the heist! What I love about Rogue One is the fact that it manages to enhance the original Star Wars by providing a compelling storyline; by the end of Rogue One, you feel the sense of urgency that everyone on the Rebel ship in the beginning of Star Wars felt. The Death Stars plans matter, and it was about time we FELT why they mattered. The diverse cast accentuates the sense of 'group effort' it took to extract the Death Star plans.The use of CGI to revive certain characters was distracting and unnecessary. I couldn't tell you what happened during certain scenes because I was distracted by the thoughts I had, mostly deciding whether I was watching a film or a video game unfold on the screen. The CGI is obvious and looks like a simple computer animation; no attention to detail could fix it, in my opinion. It was better to leave certain characters as cameos rather than give them full scenes and dialogue. Definitely the most cringe-worthy part of the film.For the nerds out there, I was blown away by Darth Vader's scenes in the film. Rogue One is finally the film that properly portrays how terrifying Darth Vader is as a villain; he's not just a man, he's a monster.Overall, Rogue One is a film that, from the start, has a fantastic ending. How the film gets to that ending is a bumpy road filled with poor pacing and underestablished characters, but everything falls together with a prewritten conclusion, making Rogue One a decent addition to the Star Wars saga for any film fan.",7,0,0,31 December 2017
Deadpool 2," An Improvement Over The First Deadpool
","I want to say I hold the unpopular opinion that I felt the original Deadpool film wasn't perfect, or very good. I felt it was just a decent superhero film that was exactly how I think a Deadpool film would have gone down, but it didn't do anything more and didn't extend past that. To me, the first Deadpool relied too much on shock factor. Sure, I got some chuckles, but I left the theater watching the original Deadpool slightly disappointed, hoping the humor would be much better. With that said, I left Deadpool 2 feeling much more satisfied with the characterization and humor. In Deadpool 2, shock factor is no longer the primary vehicle that drives the film, making plenty of room to flesh out the film's ultimately clever writing, pacing, and story.Deadpool 2 sees the return of our favorite Merc with a Mouth, who finds himself protecting a young Russell Collins (AKA Firefist) from the time-traveling mutant Cable (portrayed by Josh Brolin). DP2 doesn't need to try hard to be funny, and they pull no punches when it comes to the biting self-referential jokes and pop culture references, whether it comes to dishing on the DC Extended Universe (as a DCEU fan as well, I really appreciated those) or even the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The otherwise formulaic story is substantial enough to drive the plot, and has significantly improved in characterization and writing with strong supporting characters and villains, particularly in fleshing out the relationships Deadpool has with Firefist and Cable. Many of the vulgar and flat-out incredulous jokes are paced perfectly within their respective moments, and happen with respect to the plot, not the other way around (as I felt the first Deadpool sometimes had done). This comedic structure helped give DP2 a more refined direction in story and humor. Cable serves as the perfect contrast to Deadpool; the writers weren't afraid to give him some of his own snarky lines, and Josh Brolin delivers them so seriously and in character that you laugh at his lines as they bounce off of Deadpool. Overall, Deadpool 2 is the most unlikely buddy comedy family film of the year, with enough serious moments to drive the story but far more jokes to not take itself too seriously in the process. With humor adapting to the plot instead of the plot being driven by the humor, DP2 is a refined improvement over its predecessor, and becomes all of the things the first film should have been.",8,1,4,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," UPDATE: A Taika Waititi Film with Thor Characters Slapped On
","Thor: Ragnarok continues Thor's journey since he left in search of the Infinity Stones at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. When a new enemy arrives that threatens Asgard from Ragnarok, the foretold mythological end of everything, Thor must battle his way to save his home.Ultimately, Thor: Ragnarok is an entertaining rock concert of a film, adopting a Guardians of the Galaxy aesthetic, in terms of visuals and humor, but very much keeping it a part of the Thor franchise motif. Its use of an energetic soundtrack, humorous dialogue, and well-directed action sequences makes it an archetypal Marvel film.This movie is saturated with humor. Whether it's Marvel's funniest film is debatable, and whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. But the film banks on humor; there are laugh out loud moments almost every 20 minutes in the film. At times it manages to find its perfect pacing for particular scenes to characterize Thor and the supporting cast, but at other times the humor seems to play as a huge distractor to mask its otherwise basic plot.Don't get me wrong, the plot is fine. No spoilers; Feige was right to say that Ragnarok, indeed, sets up many story elements and important character developments for Infinity War, but it seems to only do the bare minimum with the plot. The key plot points in Ragnarok are presented with a more lighthearted pace, which seems to take away from their impact on the greater MCU. The story's enough to keep Thor's solo adventure going and set things up for the future, but the writing is so focused on creating humorous exchanges and buddy-cop character relationships that it falls short on actually characterizing the supporting characters and villains in a deep way and writing a more clever plot. The plot is just 'good enough.'Aesthetically, Thor: Ragnarok is the most visually stunning Thor film to date. Waititi took great care in crafting his shots and cinematography, which helped immerse his audience into the distinguishable worlds encountered in this film. Props also to the direction of the action sequences, which seemed to capture more of Thor's comic book style than his previous appearances have ever shown.With what she was given, Cate Blanchett does an excellent job as Hela and grounds the film with a formidable and intimidating villain. Tessa Thompson was great as Valkyrie and sets up the character for future films as a powerful Asgardian who arguably surpasses Thor. Jeff Goldblum also brought the Grandmaster's quirkiness and wit to life, playing it with the perfect blend of 'villainy' and humor.Go see Thor: Ragnarok if you want to have a fun time in the theater filled with your favorite characters, laughs, and stunning visuals, but don't expect an intricate story presented to you in an intricate format; just expect a film that manages follow the Marvel formula with exactly the right amount of ingredients. Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is a movie that aims to be more funny than thoughtful, and falls short on what could have been a potentially better story as a result.UPDATE: I'm updating my review to account for how this film had way too much comedy in it. In retrospect, I felt the film played off way too many potentially serious and dramatic moments in the film that could have developed characters more into cheap laughs. It certainly creates the illusion that it's more entertaining because of the laughs it delivers, but it compromises its ability to be compelling and tell a decent story. The plot has several crucial moments that has grand repercussions not only for the world of Thor, but also for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. Thor: Ragnarok could have been really compelling, but Waititi decided to make a buddy-cop comedy film with minimal character development for its supporting cast, retracting the film from any emotion or heart in its crucial moments that can invest its audience in what should have been a thrilling story in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is tonally imbalanced to be funny all the way through, with no serious or dramatic moments to balance out the comedy; even the more serious moments have laughs in them! I'm now lowering my rating to a 5/10.",5,3,9,3 November 2017
Ready Player One," An Entertaining Ode to All Things Pop Culture (With Its Imperfections)
","I'm not familiar with the book, nor have I been a fan of Steven Spielberg's latest stuff; to me, he has become either an Oscar-bait or blockbuster-bait director, depending on which Steven Spielberg you get (This year's 'The Post'?), so there was no reason for me to be excited about Ready Player One, especially with the almost cringe-worthy amounts of CGI and enough action to give me fatigue. And yet, here I am, giving this film a good 7.5-8/10. Ready Player One is a the film for fulfilling any fanboy/fangirl's dreams, riddled with tasteful pop culture references on the backdrop of an otherwise familiar, formulaic plot.With nearly 80-90% of the film taking place in the Oasis, a majority of the film is CGI and takes place literally in a video game; despite this, Spielberg manages to seamlessly blend between reality and virtual, adding character development and depth to its characters and their virtual counterparts. This film could have easily been a CGI mess, and yet it isn't; Spielberg is able to let audiences distinguish between physical and virtual realities, and adds equal amount of heart to each.As a nerd myself who is nearly obsessed with all things pop culture, I was blown away by Ready Player One's precise attention to detail in its pop culture references. From subtle musical cues from Back to the Future (by the franchise's same composer, Alan Silvestri) to deliberate plot devices taking place within an iconic 70s film, audiences will be simultaneously nostalgic and thrilled as they understand the pop culture references and comprehend how they tie into the plot of the storyline. It creates a joyous type of anticipation that doesn't lend the film predictability.By no means is Ready Player One perfect; the script has some of the most cliche lines that sometimes made me cringe. The line that was also used in the trailer about Wade being named by his parents because it sounded like a superhero alter ego still irritates me every time I hear it. The plot is formulaic and even has some plot holes left unexplained; the only thing fortunate about this is that these plot holes aren't anything that the story relies on to maintain its integrity, but still deserve to be questioned.I came in expecting Ready Player One to be all things wrong with Hollywood; banking on CGI, unoriginal references, and relentless and unnecessary action from a director who only seems to embrace Oscar/blockbuster-bait projects. Instead, I came out feeling a joyous nostalgia for a film released that night. Ready Player One is a formulaic movie, yes, but maybe it's formulaic and predictable because it's much like the movies that we've seen growing up, with the same amount of heart and soul.",8,0,3,31 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Why This Is My Favorite Star Wars Film:
","In preparation for the release of the highly-anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I took the opportunity to re-watch the Original Trilogy and refresh my memory. After going through the trilogy, I've decided that Return of the Jedi is my favorite Star Wars film. Why? How could it be? The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece! Here's why: This film brings a spectacular finale to the Star Wars saga as we knew it (It wasn't going to be for another 30 years until we were going to expect any cinematic continuation of this storyline.). To simply put it, this film was a great ending.This film contains the best dialogue in any Star Wars film I've ever seen. The scene I am referring to specifically is the one when Luke surrenders himself to Darth Vader and urges to him, as his son, to try to reach for the light side of the Force that he once possessed. Prior to this scene, all we had known about Vader was that he is the father of Luke and is a former Jedi who turned to the Dark Side of the Force to spread his reign of evil and power over the entire galaxy. That's all we knew so far. This scene captured the tragic character that is Darth Vader. It added depth and so much character history to the man behind the mask in one simple interaction. It spelled out the (dreaded) prequel trilogy backstory of Anakin Skywalker in few words.Should I mention the lightsaber fight? Like Empire Strikes Back, the film's cinematography was beautiful; the contrast of the bright, colored lightsabers to the shadowed, black silhouettes of our heroes and villains always gives me chills of excitement. I'll always remember the moving camera shot that heightened Luke's enraged domination over Vader; that fight was the most intense of the Original Trilogy.I don't understand the hate on the Ewoks; I love them. The point of the story was that the heroes were to befriend the local population of Endor (it could have been any alien species that just so happened to live on that planet) to help them finally defeat the huge organization known as the Empire. Any alien population, so why not make them look like ugly, cute, bipedal shih tzus? I wasn't bothered by Ewoks at all.Overall, Return of the Jedi provided beautiful closure for a saga to be remembered for decades, and perhaps for all of human history.",10,0,0,27 January 2016
Doctor Strange," An Underrated, Groundbreaking Marvel Film
","Yes, this film already has high ratings, but what I mean when I say it's underrated is that whenever I mention this film to any dedicated comic book film fans, they always dismiss it as being a 'weak' and 'typical' superhero film that doesn't deviate from the formula that Marvel has gotten good at establishing and repeating. Doctor Strange is a spiritual and mystical journey of enlightenment for its viewers. It is certainly much more than just a rehash of Iron Man, and here's why.The story tells of a brilliant neurosurgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange, whose excellence is prefaced by his harrowing arrogance. After getting into a car crash that renders his hands unusable for the precision of surgery, Strange exhausts all of his resources to improve his condition. With no hope, he turns to spirituality and healing and discovers the school of the Ancient One, where he humbles up and is introduced to the world of the mystic arts.The film takes great care in establishing Stephen Strange as an arrogant and selfish person. Benedict Cumberbatch, known for his borderline sociopathic and arrogant roles as Sherlock Holmes in BBC's modern adaptation and his villainous roles in other franchises (Khan in Star Trek), is very good at portraying a character who is both unlikable yet sympathetic. I'd argue that Stephen Strange's portrayal in this film is far from Tony Stark's portrayal in Iron Man; the first half of the film shows how much Strange pushes the people who care for him away with little to no empathy, including former lover, Christine Palmer, played by Rachel McAdams. In fact, a significant amount of time is given to developing not only Strange as a character, but also his relationships with the people around him and how they serve as foils to his arrogance and eventual redemption. Of course, there are some characters who fall short of development, including the villainous Kaecilius, a rogue mystic and former student of the Ancient One whose primary motivations to use dark magic are powered by his pain of loss. The film attempts to add more development and background to Kaecilius as a character, but given that Kaecilius is a character that's moreso a reflection of the evil Dormammu, developing him as a character can only go so far as adding the finishing touches to a puppet. With a weak villain, this is definitely one of the weaker points of the film. Other than that, it's the first time in a while that we've seen an origin story like this in this franchise that actually felt independent from The Avengers (Ant-Man's opening made the film seem like an extension of Avengers; the last independent origins story we got that actually felt independent was probably Guardians of the Galaxy), and it's the first time in a while we've received a leading character and supporting characters with this much character development.Doctor Strange also features visually stunning and innovative action sequences inspired by the effects used in Inception, but wholly expanding upon them. The scene that introduces Strange (and the audience) to the world of mysticism is visually groundbreaking, experimental, yet also accessible for audiences as it puts them through a roller coaster whirlwind of abstraction and surrealism. The first major action sequence featuring Strange in New York City features the action scene we dreamed of in Inception that we thought we'd never get, and the final climactic fight in Hong Kong gives a unique opportunity to watch a fight happen in full reversal while it's characters fight in real time. The resolution to the climactic fight is also original and unique; instead of the 'big fight' we're waiting for, Doctor Strange manages to use his wits to avoid a destructive fight and win the battle with Dormammu with clever thinking, adding value to his character not only as a mystical master but also as one of the more clever characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I'm normally not a fan of a film relying too much on comic relief, as I feel it cheapens the quality of the film, but I found the comic relief to be used tastefully in this film to help flesh out character development and provide a balance of entertainment for the film's more serious scenes. Similar to, but not exactly like, Winter Soldier's 'On your left' line, Doctor Strange is riddled with simple single-lines that help develop characters and serve to humble Doctor Strange as he goes through a spiritual awakening.On the surface, Doctor Strange is a visual effects spectacle that tells the story of an arrogant professional turned into an extraordinary and humble superhero, but, as you dig deeper, you'll find that the story is one of the most original Marvel films with a strongly developed (and well acted) lead character and supporting cast. With a clever storyline, uniquely fleshed out characters, and stunning visual effects, Doctor Strange proves to be an excellent addition to the MCU franchise.",8,1,1,14 March 2018
Justice League," A Surprising Ode to the DC Fans
","After the polarizing reception of Batman v Superman (which I personally liked) and outright negative attention of Suicide Squad, I came in to this movie with low expectations. But I was certainly surprised. Justice League feels natural; it has the Zack Snyder visuals with the crisp Joss Whedon editing to maintain the perfect pacing and energy for the comic book spectacle that is this film.Justice League is certainly more lighthearted than its predecessors, but it still maintains a tasteful amount of seriousness to it when needed in the storyline. While Man of Steel and Batman v Superman focused on the realistic societal aspects of a world with superheroes, which I think was one of the strengths of the DC films, this societal realism is not as prevalent in Justice League. This would make sense, given that this is literally a superhero team that's getting together; society is less of a concern when they know it's in danger. Also, having too much emphasis on societal realism has shown to hurt the pacing of the films, as noted in previous examples.Ultimately, the film doesn't feel like it was trying to copy a Marvel formula, and shows DC managed to find the formula that has worked for them. The storyline itself is a basic superhero team versus big baddie and nothing special, but various moments in the story help flesh out the characters and add a fun spin here and there with the skeletal outline to help further develop the relationship between the team members. Nothing in the story feels 'forced.' The writing/dialogue is decent and characterizes our heroes perfectly to create a unique dynamic between each one. Standout performances are Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (as always).This film is by no means perfect and certainly has flaws. The film can be visually tiring with the Zack Snyder brand of special effects and CGI backgrounds, and the fight scenes can be repetitive (not nearly as long as Man of Steel, however). The character development can also sometimes be lacking with the supporting characters, as per Zack Snyder style. More can also certainly have been explored with the main characters, especially with Superman and Aquaman's stories that are all but briefly mentioned and minimally explored. But these flaws only apply to minor aspects of the film's overall arc for the group as a team, and don't impact the enjoyment you'll likely get out of this film.Justice League is, at the end of the day, an ode to the comic book fans. The film is littered with references to the DC Universe that'll make any fan excited, and be sure to watch out for two post credits scenes. It's been a while since I felt this excited and hyped for the future of a franchise (i.e. pre-Avengers Marvel films), and fellow superhero fans are certainly in for a treat for this entertaining thrill ride of a film.7.5/10",7,2,6,15 November 2017
Man of Steel," Balancing Between a Psychological and An Action-Packed Superman UPDATED
","Ever since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy changed the landscape of the superhero film, Man of Steel focuses on being the Batman Begins for a new Superman franchise. It's a Superman film for the modern ages, removing all the cliché flare and majesty that made the Christopher Reeve Superman franchise so successful and iconic (this includes pseudo-reboot Superman Returns). Man of Steel stands out as a unique Superman film in that it primarily focuses on the psychological division between Superman and Clark Kent.Man of Steel draws from modern graphic novel iterations of Superman (see Earth One) to depict a Superman divided between either using his powers and bearing a newfound responsibility as protector of the world, or keeping his powers a secret. Told in a nonlinear format, the film explores Kal-El's childhood as Clark Kent, detailing his social isolation and psychological coping with the development of his powers, as well as being raised to suppress them from the world. The result is an emotional, psychological, and realistic portrayal of Superman in a modern society. Instead of the previous films' themes of 'What would the world be like with a Superman?', this film asks 'How will the world react to a Superman?' When Superman is coerced into revealing himself when General Zod arrives at Earth, what is the right choice? One issue with trying to take on an emotionally-charged script is having Zack Snyder, who, at his best, is a second unit director, take control of the project. Zack Snyder has a cookie cutter approach when it comes to visually depicting a script on film. And with that, he fails to flesh out characters when he needs to. Scenes showing characters from the Daily Planet struggling from the aftermath of the film's climactic fight lack the emotional factor because Zack Snyder didn't take the time to revise the script and flesh out those characters well enough, substituting them with literally close to 40 minutes of unnecessarily long, destructive fight scenes that could have easily been cut down to 10 minutes at most. Man of Steel ends up looking like a film still trying to find its balance between being an emotional and realistic superhero film (a la Batman Begins) or a confusing sci-fi-laden action spectacle (a la The Avengers).The film has some questionable plot points, almost as if they were written by a high school student. Without spoiling (for those who haven't seen the film), there are events in the film that drive the character's motivations that don't seem to add up (i.e. 'the scientist will miraculously figure out to do THIS so that the weird science fiction device can start working' trope). Some of these are minor, one of them is major, in fact, and can polarize critics. But be the judge of that yourself.Overall, Man of Steel tries to find its footing with being the dark, realistic Superman film we've all been waiting for ever since Christopher Nolan started directing Batman films, but stumbles along when it tries to become a comic book spectacle. The result is a film with all the right ingredients that was overcooked.UPDATED REVIEW: After another viewing of Man of Steel, I realized how bored I was for the last third of the film. The fighting was completely incessant and it became a predictable alien action film, evolving out of what was a great superhero film depicted with societal realism. For some reason, Snyder wanted to portray two gods fighting on screen, but we really didn't need to see 40 minutes of it with a subpar plot involving skybeams and portals again. If you cut out the last 40 minutes, you get the same movie. Man of Steel was promising for the first 2/3rds, then the action makes the film go downhill.",5,0,1,15 November 2017
The Revenant," Survival Has No Plot. Just Survival.
","The Revenant takes place before the Civil War and tells the story of frontiersman Hugh Glass, a navigator for a group of American fur trappers. After being betrayed and left for dead, Hugh ventures through the wilderness and endures through the beautiful yet brutal forces of nature to seek his revenge.The direction and cinematography were excellent and were the driving force of the film. From the very beginning, Innaritu pulls you into the harsh world of Midwest Pre-Civil War America. If you're a fan of his camera-work in Birdman, be prepared for more of that. Innaritu's vision captures the right moments and details to gasp in horror and to cringe in pain. The film often cuts to location nature shots; every shot was absolutely beautiful. I felt like I was transported there and taking a beautiful morning hike when I was not being mauled by a bear.Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Hugh Glass as our lead man braving through the winter. It was almost as if the film was an advertisement to convince the Academy to give DiCaprio his Oscar. 'Look at all of this crazy stuff he had to do this for this role! Give it to him!' Jokes aside, DiCaprio performs the part well; his body and facial language were well executed and helped convey the pain and wear his body endures through the harsh winters and dangerous creatures within. I don't believe the performance to be Oscar-worthy compared to his other roles, because, in this film, he mostly acts in pain and suffering throughout. There isn't much in terms of character development and depth; Innaritu explores some of that in his flashbacks, but leaves the details subtle and easily missed.Tom Hardy does an excellent job portraying the antagonist; he feels for his character and, though he is portrayed as a villain, manages to make the audience feel empathetic for him and understand his viewpoint.What surprised me was Will Poulter's emotional performance as Jim Bridger. The emotion he conveys felt natural and tense at the right moments, and his interaction with Tom Hardy brewed some unexpected dynamics between the two in their respective roles.What I found the film lacking in was its story and its pacing. The plot is very straightforward, and the form of the film presents it linearly. We get it, there's tension and Glass wants his revenge. The story has been told countless times in various (and better) forms. At times, the film felt so slow because of its lack of plot. While the length of the film helps accentuate how long Glass endures through the nature, there are a lot of times the film focuses on the atmosphere and intensity of the film rather than the actual plot and pacing.Overall, The Revenant is a survivor and revenge film all in one. With a simple plot, Innaritu is able to focus on Glass' endurance and drive through the beauty and beast of nature.",7,1,3,27 January 2016
Dunkirk," A WWII Story Told In Christopher Nolan Style
","As you scroll through the other reviews for this film on IMDb and see some of the reviews rave and complain, you'll notice the common elements. Acting, story, etc. While my review does not contain spoilers (necessarily), if you want to go in completely blind about how the film portrays the Dunkirk, maybe stop reading.Dunkirk is a World War II film told in Christopher Nolan's signature style of temporal irregularities through his storytelling and editing. We've seen him play around with time in his previous films, most notably Memento, Interstellar, Inception, and, to an extent, even Batman Begins. It's in Christopher Nolan's artistic vision of time that helps him tell his compelling stories. Memento's reverse order of storytelling lets the audience feel what it's like to live with the protagonist's inability to form new memories. Inception's layers of dreams (with different time frames) allows the film to align climaxes at different points of each dream. And the latter is what Dunkirk roughly does.Dunkirk tells the stories of the battle by land, sea, and air, with the events in each setting taking place within a week, a day, and an hour, respectively. Nolan ingeniously crafts these three stories together, weaving their different time frames to align climaxes within the battles and emphasize their individual struggles. The result is a beautiful portrayal that encompasses the entire battle on all three aspects.I see many complain about the lack of character development in this film, and how the characters aren't that memorable; to be honest, I agree. I couldn't even name the characters if I could. But that's the point! Dunkirk is not a story about a single individual, or a particular group of people. It's about a struggle a community faced, and that there were no individual standout heroes in this war, just many who collaborated together. Even though the film is centered on the evacuation of Dunkirk, it emulates the sentiments of the entire war as a whole.Hans Zimmer collaborated with Benjamin Wallfisch on the score for this film, focusing on emulating and modernizing British classical music, most notably Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations. The result is a colorful, wistful score that draws out unique themes for each aspect of the battle and sonically blends them together as the stories weave in and out of each other. Huge fan of Wallfisch's orchestrations that use the strings to swell and evoke an echoic atmosphere for the film.While it may be too late at this point, I highly recommend seeing this film in 70mm or 70mm-IMAX formats. The colors in the film are gorgeous, and watching this film on an analog format emphasizes the vast scope of the war and the colorful vision that Nolan aspired for.",10,1,6,24 October 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Not Perfect But Damn Near
","Wow. I'm having trouble deciding whether I want to give this one 9 or 10 stars, but I know those are my only options for a film of this grand scale. Where do I even begin a review for this film? Let's start with the pacing. The Russo Brothers proved they can handle directing a film with a huge ensemble cast with Captain America: Civil War, and one-upped themselves with Avengers: Infinity War. Despite the film carrying the weight of the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and other Marvel characters of equal importance such as Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, and despite the film having roughly 5 different storylines all happening at the same time, the film handles it quite well and gives each storyline enough screentime with enough spacing. The film does feel long, but, at this point, you don't want it to end!Thanos is by far done justice in this film; it's evident the Russo Brothers prioritized developing Thanos as a character with twisted but understandable philosophical motivations. The film dedicates great care in fleshing him out as a character rather than leaving him as some one-dimensional 'big baddie.' Infinity War also makes Thanos an actual threat, and this was the first Marvel movie for me in which I thought the stakes were at its highest; the characters we've grown to love through this franchise are seen at their most vulnerable against Thanos, and that's emotionally terrifying to watch. Avengers: Infinity War is just as much about the spiritual and emotional journey Thanos goes through searching for the Infinity Stones as it is about the Avengers.With all the darkness that I seem to point out in this film, this film still has the characteristic Marvel quips. It became fan service many times as I'm sure fans imagined how their favorite characters would interact upon meeting each other, and many of these came to life, much to the pleasure of the audience.One of my favorite things about the Russo Brothers' direction is their action. The action sequences are framed excellently and add to the brutality of the Infinity War. I was interested in seeing how they would direct these more cosmic and special effects-laden action sequences, given, within the scope of Marvel, most of their prior action sequences in The Winter Soldier and Civil War were more practical and focused on hand-to-hand combat choreography. That said, they used the superpowered special effects efficiently without any excess. There are countless action sequences I couldn't wait to see happen on screen, and they completely delivered in emotional weight as well as in sheer energy.There are some flaws that I felt were a part of the film. There are several characters that feel underused in the film's plot. Some characters are just there without really adding so much purpose to the film's plot, and are limited to minor plot points or one-line quips at best. The film ends on a cliffhanger and essentially relies on the necessity of a sequel rather than a mere implication of one, but we already knew that going in. Still, even though I knew well in advance that a sequel would be coming, I can't help but feel unsatisfied by the cliffhanger ending and, because I knew there would be a sequel, it made me less emotionally invested in the events in the film because I know there's 'more to come.' Given that all Marvel movies previously ended on a non-cliffhanger note, I admire that this film adds something new to the mix and ends it on such a cliffhanger, but at the same time dislike it for the feeling that it lacks completion in the story. It's like the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the MCU. Certainly the 'climax' of a larger story arc, and in hindsight perhaps the best of the franchise once we see the rest of the story arc.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War retains the Marvel charm and organic humor we've come to love as fans of the MCU, while setting a new standard for our conception of Marvel films with a level of intensity and emotional weight in the storyline. It is Marvel's darkest, most emotional and intense film to date, and you'll enjoy each and every 156 minutes of it and leave the theater wanting (or, in this case, needing) more.9.5/10",10,1,4,27 April 2018
Room," An Innocent Take on A Dark, Multifaceted Story
","DISCLAIMER: This review is an analysis, please keep in mind.The film Room tells the story of 5-year-old Jack and his mother, Joy, told in Jack's perspective. All of his life, Jack has lived in a small world known as 'Room,' which his mother convinces is his reality, and that everything beyond is fantasy. The room is small, fixed with only a bathroom, a small kitchen, a television set, and a skylight. They essentially live in an average bedroom.To the audiences, it becomes apparent that their living situation is much darker than Jack perceives it. Through her sugar-coated stories, Joy explains to Jack why they are in 'Room;' Joy was abducted as a teenager and kept in a security-locked garden shed by a man only known as 'Old Nick.' When Jack becomes old enough, Joy uses him to finally free the two of them from their prison. From there, Jack experiences the outside world for the first time and begins adjusting to his new life beyond 'Room.' What makes Room such a great film is that it places the audience into the world of Jack. It lets the audience experience how Jack comes to know 'Room' as his whole world, and how he processes seeing the real, outside world for the first time. The photography employs hyper-focusing on objects in 'Room' to accentuate Jack's familiarity and never shows the outside world until Jack finally escapes. From there, the direction of the film manages to make the audience feel so acquainted with Room that everything else seems alien for a moment.The film is multiple films at once, which is a good thing. The entire premise of the film touches on Platonic themes explored in the famous The Allegory of the Cave and incorporates those themes into a contemporary issue, making it philosophical. At the same time, the film deals with the emotional drama and friction that occurs not only with Jack, but also with Joy. Joy struggles with trying to teach Jack about the outside world, as well as trying to gain her family's acceptance of Jack, since she is dealing with the fact that Jack is Old Nick's child, while dealing with the media circus surrounding her story. The film details the emotional experiences and side effects that occur when one leaves the world and sees it for the first time again. It's philosophical, psychological, and emotional.Fantastic performance from Brie Larson as Joy; she encapsulates the deep emotional scars that her character carries from Room. She takes on multiple roles as Joy; a strong mother figure for Jack, but also a helpless, adjusting woman to her family. Jacob Tremblay gives an excellent performance as Jack as well; he helps bring the film's innocent perspective to life and provides a great emotional dynamic and contrast to Joy.",7,0,5,11 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Beautiful. Inspiring. Metaphor.
","Those are words that I would use to describe The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I finished this film feeling inspired and connected with life.The film tells the story of Walter Mitty, a lonely, kind introvert who processes negatives for Life Magazine. Walter has a crush on a coworker at Life, Cheryl Melhoff, of whom he regularly daydreams. The film's plot begins when Life Magazine undergoes new management and a transition to online publication. When a photo meant to be the cover for the magazine's final print issue has gone missing, it is up to Walter to discover the locations of the photo and its photographer, reclusive Sean O'Connell, spurring an adventure of a lifetime.What I love about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the visual and symbolic language the film employs. Ben Stiller's direction is appropriate for what the movie is aiming for: his beautiful, perfectly aligned shots give off the indie film vibe and accentuates the details of Walter's life. His daydreams are fantastic yet initially feel real; as his adventure picks up, his real life experiences begin to parallel and seem more like his fantasies. Walter's job at Life serves as the perfect metaphor; as Life transitions to online, Walter begins distancing himself from work (as well as his eHarmony profile) as he pursues his real life.How could so simple a plot be so inspiring? The film focuses more on the themes of the plot rather than the actual plot and, as a result, adds an emotional texture to an otherwise dull storyline. Walter's decision to take the chance and fly to Greenland and search for Sean O'Connell became one of the iconic moments in that film because of how it Stiller directed the scene; the moving camera, the background text that stated Life's motto, the epic indie rock music. Stiller makes his emotional intentions clear and helps the audience experience the world and its potential through the eyes of Walter Mitty.As with any Ben Stiller film, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has its share of humor. If you're a fan of Ben Stiller's humor, great! If not, this movie is STILL fine for you. The film's best qualities do not rely on the delivery of Stiller's unique sense of humor. The chemistry that develops between Stiller and Wiig (Cheryl) could have been better; only some of their relationship seemed to barely begin picking up by the end of the film, but also leaves an open ending to leave the audience feeling hopeful.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a beautiful work of art, a fantasy-reality film that inspires its audiences to, like Walter Mitty, escape their fantasies and to begin living life to the fullest potential. Pretty soon, our dreams become our lives.",8,2,3,7 February 2016
Call Me by Your Name," A Sensual, Coming of Age Awakening
","Call Me By Your Name depicts the blossoming romance between a 17-year-old teen, Elio (Timothy Chalamet) and his father's older research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), against the gorgeous, colorful backdrop of Northern Italy during the 1980s. But it's much more than a simple romantic film about a gay couple; Call Me by Your Name is a sensual film that depicts the universal sexual awakening all adolescents experience when growing up. It's a film that so beautifully captures the intense sensuality of this critical period of our lives, and, in effect, becomes wholly relatable in the most subtle way. The film is also a beautiful coming of age film as Elio struggles with embracing his identity and its stigma, juxtaposed against the older Oliver's hardened experience and slight disillusionment with his own.The film uses its slow burn pacing to build up the relationships and sexual tension between Elio and Oliver, using its incredible screenplay to build an intellectual and emotional connection between them. The smart and deep dialogue between Elio and Oliver beautifully captures their complementary knowledge in music, the arts, and history, establishing an enriching and beautiful relationship between the two. The subtle body language conveyed by the actors as well as the implicit dialogue lets the sensual romance between them blossom naturally before it climaxes into a full embrace of their feelings.Elio's relationship with Oliver is compared to that between him and Marzi, Elio's female love interest. While their relationship is meant to contrast with Elio-Oliver's relationship and emphasizes Elio's desires to be with Oliver, Elio and Marzi's relationship is given the same treatment and helps the audience journey through Elio's sexual awakening as an adolescent. Guadagnino's dreamlike direction evokes that sense of isolation, curiosity, and pure sensuality that comes with this process of growing up, adding significant meaning and emotion to the relatively explicit scenes, both on and off camera.No matter what your orientation is, Call Me By Your Name is a film that anyone can find relatable. With a dreamy, piano-laden soundtrack of assorted Impressionistic pieces and a smooth, dreamlike directorial style, Call Me By Your Name perfectly captures the complex sexual spark of adolescence and sensuality, and captivates its audiences with elements of a coming of age story and same-sex relationship to heighten the dramatic elements in this beautiful work of art.",9,1,4,3 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ignore the 'fans' who hated this film, they're blinded by the Dark Side.
","No spoilers until indicatedStar Wars: The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since anything the original trilogy produced and introduces a new, innovative storyline that adds more complexity to the series. Rian Johnson breaks the traditional Star Wars formula and challenges the notions of, 'What is a Star Wars film?' and answers that question by being completely unlike any other Star Wars film prior.The change in direction is clear with the story and style of the film; while Force Awakens focused on nostalgia (as it should have), The Last Jedi ditches the nostalgia trip and focused on developing the most complex storyline in Star Wars yet. Gone are the one-dimensional characters, and in are the conflicted, emotional characters who are the source of what makes this such a compelling Star Wars film. One-dimensional characters were what made Star Wars great in the first place, but it's time to move on with more tension and dynamics with the characters using modern storytelling. Johnson's directing really shines through in portraying the more abstract ideas of the film's plot, and uses perfect pacing to evenly space out three total plots until they all converge onto the closing act.For the action aficionados, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has the best action in a Star Wars film yet. I wanted to leap out of my seat during many moments due to the sheer emotional capacity and thrills I felt were packed into single scenes. This is definitely an important factor that contributes to my rating; the action is only good because the storyline set it up to full emotional thrill ride.Just like the characters, the film isn't perfect. There are certain moments that can be received negatively, and I get that. The deciding factor, however, is how you want to interpret those moments. It's one thing for a scene to be questionable, but it's another thing to sit back and think about what Rian Johnson was trying to portray with those scenes. They all mean something in this film, and the degree of 'weirdness' to this scene isn't even all that bad as fans may complain. They all make sense, and, if they don't now, they will; don't forget that this is only the middle film of a trilogy! We still have more to see with how this arc goes. I was able to overlook some of these flaws (which overall had to do with dialogue, bland characterization, and weird moments that initially don't seem to make sense). They make sense/will make sense in the long run!Many of the fans who complain are the ones who hold the most expectations on how the film SHOULD go; they want answers to immediate questions and hold certain ideas on characterizations, so much that the slightest difference in expectation and lack of answers will anger them, so they're the easiest to disappoint, and the quickest to react. They are close-minded and toxic! They are blinded by nostalgia and do not like change, and don't know good stuff when they see it! This is a quality film; whether you like it or not is ultimately and only up to you. Do not let them fool you, and think for yourself on this one! Star Wars: The Last Jedi reads like a novel; you can watch it multiple times and pick it apart layer by layer, and still find more and more prevalent themes and motifs in the film. It's beautifully written and pictured to portray a fine part of the trilogy that manages to stand on its own. Fans who hate this film will end up eating those words some day on a film that brings a new and unexpected take on the Star Wars saga. Go towards the Light side, turn off your expectations for the film, and enjoy it for what it is. And may the Force be with you, and us all.SPOILERS BELOW:Addressing some of the issues people have with this film:
Why is everyone mad at Luke's characterization? He literally says in the film that the Jedi shouldn't be put on a pedestal, and neither should he. He's not perfect! The whole point of the Original Trilogy was to learn of Luke's journey through finding the light; it's not gonna end and he's not gonna be pure. I'd take a multifaceted, multi-dimensional Luke any day over a boring, one-dimensional Luke.Leia's floating: OK, this was weird when I first saw it, but the point still stands is that Leia never uses the Force, but she can when she needs it in cases of survival. This could have been portrayed better, and the scene didn't need to be as long or as hokey as it looked (straight out of a 70s superhero film). I agree this was a polarizing moment in the film, but the film's main storyline was strong enough for me to at least believe in the scene at the moment, and overlook its flaws.Killing Snoke off was both necessary and important. It serves as a shock for most of us who expected Snoke to survive until Episode IX, and also represents the film's removal of nostalgia and focus on a fresh take for the Star Wars franchise. Having him alive and be the 'main villain' of IX would have been too similar to having Palpatine as the main villain of the original trilogy. Snoke is a one-dimensional character with a backstory we couldn't care less for, and killing him off is symbolic of the film's intentions to kill off what Star Wars used to be and emphasize what it could be now. Let go of the past, kill it if you have to, as Kylo Ren says; we don't need a repeat of the Original Trilogy's formula.",10,7,20,17 December 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Satire About Entertainment Today
","Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor best known for portraying the superhero Birdman, as he attempts to reignite his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play.The film portrays the struggles Riggan faces in different 'realms' of the entertainment world which form an ultimate dilemma. On one hand, Riggan must deal with the fact that he is typecast as Birdman and fears he will only ever be known as Birdman. On the other hand, the Hollywood actor must deal with the world of the theater, a radically different and intimidating world that approaches acting and direction alternatively from Hollywood. Overshadowing these issues is the question, is Riggan doing this for his own acting career, or is he doing this just to be relevant in society again? The writing in this film was fantastic. I was fascinated by the psychology of Riggan Thomson's character; throughout the film, he is tormented by an inner voice that represents his alter ego, Birdman. Birdman serves as a character in itself that helps accentuate the satirical themes of the film. In a world where action films dominate the market and actors achieve fame from starring in said action/superhero films, Riggan tries to rid of his reputation as Birdman while Birdman goads him to embrace it. Riggan aspires to be a great actor, while Birdman aspires to be a famous, loved actor.Michael Keaton delivers an outstanding performance as Riggan Thomson. He perfectly embodies the inner struggle and split that Riggan deals with in the film. Keaton manages to help convey the complex and mixed emotions that Riggan feels as a washed-up actor in his subtlety; nothing ever seems overacted and blatant. I'm rather upset he didn't win the Academy Award, I believe he deserved it with such a tense and careful performance.Also worth an honorable mention is Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, the famous yet infamous theater actor who joins Riggan's production. Shiner is the foil to Thomson; he represents the theater world. He is difficult to work with and yet is a fantastic actor (In one scene, he learns his lines almost instantly, which intimidates the Hollywood-based Thomson). Ed Norton's performance brought a sense of intensity and dynamic to the film; his abrasive personality made me feel almost uncomfortable watching him as he acted in some of the more surprising scenes.This film is perhaps the best direction and camera-work I've seen in a film yet. The entire film (with a few exceptions) is made to feel like one continuous shot. What does this do? It allows the audience to experience Riggan's life and torment as if we were actually following him through the tight corridors backstage and in the wide open spaces of the stage. There are no cuts or jumps, much like our own lives. We never 'pause' or 'cut' to a scene in our lives, we live it continuously. I was amazed by every take's length and the level of mastery the actors displayed in rehearsing their spots. The film's perspective overall helps the audience experience what show business is like; the audience reaction, the repetition of rehearsed scenes, the feeling of embarrassment when a mistake is made, everything.At a time where the biggest money-makers in the film industry are superhero/action films, Birdman could not have come out at a more perfect time. Don't get me wrong, I love following the superhero films of our times, but ever notice that Academy Award-worthy films often don't do as well in the box office as, say Star Wars: The Force Awakens? This film points out the truth of the film industry; more people will spend money to watch high-adrenaline action than what critics may consider 'art,' and so those worthy of recognition may forever go on unnoticed.",10,2,5,31 January 2016
Black Panther," The Bridge Between A Ryan Coogler Drama and a Fantasy Superhero Film
","I came into the theater with high expectations for Black Panther, given it was directed by one of my favorite young and rising directors, Ryan Coogler. Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station and Creed, has proven to be an excellent director for portraying drama and character studies in contemporary settings. With Black Panther, though I had high expectations, I also didn't know what to expect; was Coogler going to do a drama or was he going to stray from his style to fit Marvel Studios' aesthetic?The answer is both, and the result is a unique film that at times feels like a Coogler film and, at other times, feels like a Marvel Studios fantasy.I overall enjoyed Black Panther; it fell short on some aspects in terms of being both a superhero film and a sociopolitical drama, but still manages to hit all the marks.The characters are well-written and lovable, simple as that. A superhero film is only as good as its villain, and Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger is sure to be in the books as one of the stronger Marvel villains in the MCU. The film invests its story into fleshing out the emotional drama and perspective that Killmonger uses to justify his antagonistic actions; for the first time in a long time in the MCU, we sympathize with the 'villain,' and his viewpoints touches on the social commentary in which the film finds its strengths. Letitia Wright as Shuri also stole the show, both serving as tasteful comedy relief and as a strong supporting character to Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa.The social commentary of this film, which is what I was most looking forward to, is excellent. It's not very explicit and takes some thinking to dissect, and frankly I could spend hours analyzing the metaphors this film produces that connect the fantastic themes present in Wakanda to our real-world issues of marginalization and how the world perceives Third World Countries. Instead, I will say that the social commentary is used as a means to advance the film's plot and retain the central themes; it's like any good Marvel movie that poses a moral question (Winter Soldier, Civil War), only this time it feels more contemporary and more relevant than ever. The themes touch on the power of countries and what responsibility they bear to the world, and particularly focuses on the marginalization and historical oppression of African Americans and poses the question on what can be done to resolve this continuous issue in our society. It's very compelling and is a story that must be told, making Black Panther an excellent addition to Ryan Coogler's dramatic filmography.That said, this film does try to balance between being a dramatic social discussion and a fantastic superhero film, and ultimately that becomes the reason why this film fell flat on certain moments. The action is derivative, CGI-laden, and boring, and this was disappointing given that Creed had simply phenomenal fight sequences and choreography. I will say that the action in Black Panther has the same emotional background and payoff that the fighting in Creed had, but Coogler is still trying to find his footing on how to direct a superhero action sequence, and I think he tried a bit too hard on appealing to comic book fans on this one when it came to the action (too many cutaways, not enough careful focus or emphasis on skilled combat, etc.). There were definitely some action moments I loved (at one point we had a one-shot moment again a la Creed), but there wasn't enough. The film is also grounded in fantasy; few scenes take place in contemporary cities, which I was hoping for more of, but, ultimately, that's personal preference. Wakanda's scenes feel somewhat like the scenes of Asgard in the Thor franchise, so the fantasy aspects can be a bit tiring. To each their own.Overall, Black Panther is definitely the best Marvel film in a while (since, arguably, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) but is certainly not the best. Although riddled with superhero cliches and dialogue, Black Panther's compelling social commentary, strong characters, and an all-around excellent cast make it an excellent addition to both Coogler's filmography as well as the MCU.",8,8,51,16 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not Nearly As Bad As People Will Say (Watch the Ultimate Edition!)
","Note: No spoilers until indicated.When it comes down to it, yes, Zack Snyder is a second unit director who, whether he thinks so or not, prioritizes visuals over story cohesion. And, yes, that's reflected in the CGI-laden Batman v Superman, as it was reflected in Man of Steel. It's certainly flawed, but it's not flawed enough to make it seem like the trashfire of a film that other reviewers seem to say it is.First off, Batman v Superman corrects some of the flaws that Man of Steel had. One particular gripe I had with Man of Steel was the fact that the final fight scene was unnecessarily long, clichÃ©, and destructive. Batman v Superman immediately corrects this by making this as a plot device that motivates Batman to turn against Superman. Suddenly I like Man of Steel more now. The scenes are depicted, for once, with the right amount of emotion to set up the pace for the film (it won't stay consistent, but we'll get to that later). Just to add on this, Man of Steel had too many fights in major cities that caused unnecessary destruction, Batman v Superman now has fights on uninhabited islands! Perfect!As polarizing as it may be, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor is wonderful. Instead of the ruthless Lex Luthor we're used to in the comics, Chris Terrio managed to modernize his characterization into the socially awkward, but incredibly intelligent, Silicon Valley-esque tech giant we see in this film. Many of the film's events orchestrated by Luthor perfectly illustrate his sinister characterization, sometimes without even needing him to be on screen.Zack Snyder's direction, once again, brings a less-than-cohesive film plot that seems to jump between the tension between the main characters and superfluous action. It tries to pack so much into so little time, and the result is the odd pacing and underdeveloped characterizations and scenes that are slowly becoming Snyder's trademark. I'd compare him to McG and say that this film focused too much on being visually a comic book and less on a graphic novel, with underdeveloped characterizations and scenes that needed to be fleshed out longer. Zack Snyder is still trying to find his right pacing, and it's not working yet.That said, Batman v Superman has one of the best action scenes in comic book film history. Zack Snyder, again, a visual guy, knows how to direct many of the complex action sequences the film portrays, and executes them beautifully, so I'll give him that.I HIGHLY recommend watching the Ultimate Edition; it helps even out some of the pacing and narrative flaws in the original. The narrative is still a bit messy, but it was already messy to begin with. However, the added footage adds much more to the plot and helps answer any unanswered questions viewers of the original may have had (see spoiler section below).Overall, Batman v Superman is not nearly as bad as critics or fans may say. Is it perfect? No, it has noticeable flaws. BvS tries to pack in the standards of a Christopher Nolan-brand superhero movie with the action spectacles of a Marvel film; the result is a visually aesthetic comic film with somewhat decent characterizations and scenes, at the compromise of its pacing and overall development.For opinions on some spoilers:SPOILERS BELOW:The 'Martha' issue is totally blown out of proportion. Batman doesn't 'suddenly become friends' with Superman just because their mothers share the same name, the name only served as a trigger that halted Batman from killing Superman. That gave him just enough time to realize that Superman was also more 'human' than he ever imagined, and that there were even bigger issues at hand rather than just killing Superman. The Ultimate Edition adds in more details that makes the plot more cohesive and less 'intuitive,' so to speak. If you want to know what the Ultimate Edition adds to the original, here are some key details:Additional opening scenes that add further detail on how Lex Luthor was able to place the blame on Superman for the village's destruction. Clark Kent's investigation of Batman's vigilante practices, which further motivates him to confront Batman (Adds more detail to the significance of the Bat Branding employed). Lois Lane's investigation of the bombing at the Capitol, which answers any questions viewers of the original cut may have had.",7,4,5,15 November 2017
The Greatest Showman," The OK Showman
","The Greatest Showman tells a musical, highly fictionalized account of P.T. Barnum's rags-to-riches story of starting his world famous circus, with the help of some friends, colleagues, and even enemies.Let's put aside the fact that it's a historical fiction and a musical, and assume that you know what you're getting into: a musical and a historical fiction film. I will not be critiquing the film based on any of those standards. However, the film is still lacking in several areas that impact this film.The music lacks heart. But this may not be an issue for you! For me, it is. The numbers in this film tend to follow soulful pop conventions, transcending the time period in which the film takes place and sounding more like a mid-2000s musical. You'll leave the theater with plenty of melodies in your head, as nearly every song is engineered to be an earworm. And that's the problem I have with it, the fact that I just used the word 'engineered.' Music in film, like music in life, is supposed to accentuate and interpret the moments we experience in life. With a musical, they're meant to convey the emotions and atmosphere of particular scenes. But you can't just write a song and expect to automatically have emotion in it! And that's exactly where the music of The Greatest Showman falls short. The entire film feels like one really long song divided and spread out into multiple parts for the film. It's as if the songwriters factory produced melodies and prioritized song memorability over emotional impact for the audience. On the surface, the music is memorable, but there is no emotional depth to these songs.OK, so why is there no emotional depth to these songs in the first place? Underdeveloped characters and a lack of real conflict. The film manages to get interesting in establishing an ensemble of unique characters that P.T. Barnum meets. But the film ends up using what little time it has (1 hr 40 min to be exact) to focus on P.T. Barnum. This would be fine; after all, he IS the main man of the show. But how does this affect our reaction when the film decides it wants us to sympathize with these side characters (which it does)? The side characters lack the exploration the audience needs to connect with them. Not to mention, there's no REAL conflict in this film! Right when I think the film is about to get interesting because an unexpected yet completely formulaic conflict comes up, it gets resolved before you can even grasp all the details of the said conflict. Just like that? That was easy. In my mind I still think there are many issues the film never addressed in the storyline that would have been excellent and even provocative sources of conflict.So, ultimately, The Greatest Showman is a half-hearted mess. It's good for something to put on in the background when you have family friends over for your annual get together, but don't expect to be swayed by the music, performances, or storyline, because the film really lacks the potential in all of those areas. It has everything you need in the musical formula minus the energy and heart.",5,2,6,4 January 2018
Deadpool," Great Deadpool Film, Decent Superhero Film
","After Fox screwed up the beloved Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, fans wanted the character done justice, the right way. And, in 2016, Fox delivered. Deadpool is a fun superhero movie that tries hard not to be a 'conventional' superhero movie. Does it succeed? Somewhat.Why I felt the film was fun and decent, but not great, was that it focused so much on being an R-rated superhero comedy movie that it fell short on being a really good superhero comedy movie (See my other ratings on the Marvel and DC films). Deadpool satirizes the PG-13 conventional superhero film that has not-too-violent action sequences, minimal swearing, and little to no nudity and basically overloads on everything that can possibly make the movie R-rated. The plot was minimal at best and doesn't expand on the X-Men Universe or storyline, because the film wanted to focus on Deadpool and his R-rated antics. The film has its emotional moments, but the comedic gist of this film overshadows everything and makes those moments a bit harder to soak in and absorb than any other superhero movie would.The comedy for me was hit and miss. There were sequences and meta-jokes (that broke the fourth wall) that I thought were hilarious and perfectly written and delivered; they were jokes that would please any fan who would speculate and imagine the perfect Deadpool movie. There were also sequences that fell rather dull; sometimes jokes were funny, but not THAT funny. It depends on your sense of humor of course; if you love X-Men and dirty, raunchy humor, you'll LOVE this movie. If raunchy humor isn't for you, you'll still find the movie funny. The comedy writing seems to cover all sorts of genres when it comes to humor, and, as a result, can fall flat at certain times while hit well at others.Fans of Deadpool will probably love this movie.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Best Action Film I've Seen Yet
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable.",10,20,32,27 January 2016
Annihilation," I Came In Expecting the Unexpected and I Got....Sorta What I Expected?
","I became interested in Alex Garland's work after watching Ex Machina a year or so ago. I was absolutely mesmerized by the writing and pacing, as well as the philosophical depth, of such an intense and unsettling film. When I began seeing the trailers and marketing for Annihilation, I had this feeling that this film was going to be beyond the horror sci-fi it was advertised to be. In a sense, I knew that the film was going to be as philosophically pleasing as Ex Machina, and beyond the scope of the typical horror sci-fi genre.Fast forward to me finishing Annihilation. I walked out of the theater with a mixed response. On one hand, it's a thought-provoking science fiction horror film; on the other hand, it's an incomplete story told with masterful direction. So here are my thoughts:The cinematography and design of this film are fantastic, that's without question. The film goes to great lengths to describe the world underneath the Shimmer, a world where biological rules are ignored and blur into hauntingly beautiful mutations of life. The design of the film is artwork in itself, the results of an expansive imagination that blends the genres of nature and horror. Much of the imagery in this film is beyond the likes I've ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's incredibly creative yet wholly familiar.The pacing and direction of this film as a horror film is gripping; I found myself holding my breath during several key climactic moments (that more or less involved excruciating and toe-curling gore). It's so incredible that the very design of the film and the way it's directed makes just looking at the mutated imagery of the Shimmer's effect on nature stomach-churning; Garland takes great care in establishing suspense and letting it pay off with the unimaginable.The story was unsatisfactory and riddled with plot holes. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt the film the was trying to portray a philosophical and abstract message with the film but failed to do so. The subplot of the film (involving Natalie Portman's character's personal life) doesn't seem to tie to the main plot and its devices, and feels incomplete. The supporting characters' backstories are explored but doesn't seem to have much relevance in terms of symbolism with the main plot. Anywhere where I can find an interpretation/abstract meaning of the film, I'll find it, especially for an Alex Garland film, but this one was tough to interpret, and thus felt incomplete for me. Too much attention was brought to the subplots and not enough was given to connecting them to the main plot.That said, the film manages to maintain interest in the story; it plays off as a mystery, slowly peeling the intricacies of its world and story layer by layer, keeping its audience invested as they try to unravel the fantastic elements of the story. I overall was happy with how intense and horrific this piece of art is, but felt the story was lacking and too ambiguous to develop any meaning from it, whether it be on a plot level or a philosophical one.",7,1,2,23 March 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," I Feel Like I'm Watching A Stunt Show
","You know how you go to any amusement park and there's always that really cool stunt show? It could be Waterworld at Universal Studios or the Indiana Jones stunt show at Hollywood Studios (Disney World), any of those. There's a short little story (loosely based on a deeper film plot), a good guy and a bad guy both after something, they do some choreographed fighting, they jump onto specially-made contraptions, some areas are rigged with pyrotechnics and water splashes, people are running all over set, maybe even cars are spinning around and chasing each other. For 10-20 minutes, it's a cool live show and a great opportunity to take a break from the long lines and the rides at the amusement park.Now imagine George Miller decided he wanted to film one of these shows, edit his footage with some colorful touch-ups, and compile two hours-worth of said footage into a film. That is Mad Max: Fury Road.I decided to write this review after actually watching the first Mad Max and The Road Warrior so I can understand the backstory of Mad Max. My initial opinion of Fury Road still stands. I really tried to like this film after seeing all of the critics' and fans' reviews. I watched the film twice to see if I was maybe tired the first time. I still felt nothing.I agree that the action is quite something. All of the stunts feel real and non-CGI, which is particularly rare for films nowadays. But so what? As real as it was, the action felt drivel, repetitive, and boring. I particularly LOVE action films, but this action did not do it for me. Even with the high speed chases (that lasted the entire film), the decked-out cars, the flame-throwing guitars, the explosions, I didn't feel the adrenaline kick in as I had hoped, nor did I ever feel I was viewing a spectacle. There were some action sequences I felt were interesting, such as the chained fight, but they only lasted a few minutes out of the entire film and were mild at best.It had everything, so what was the problem? What the film lacked was directing. The camera-work and direction don't do anything to help place the audience into the action, to feel it. All I get are either 1. Overhead crane shots that show how large the groups are and what surrounding action is taking place, 2. Long shots to emphasize distance, and 3. Close shots to show what's going on. The camera is only documenting the stunt show that is this film. At times where the film takes a short pause in action and progresses its 'story,' Miller attempts to develop some emotional depth in the story, but in the end it only comes off as trying too hard to appear deep and emotional. The character development was not there to help the audience understand the emotional moments.For my personal tastes, I didn't find the film's theme or look appealing nor unappealing. It didn't click with me. The cinematography was beautiful and emphasized the contrast in a beautiful, naturalistic, post-apocalyptic world. But the costume and prop design I didn't get and at times found it bizarre and gross, and oftentimes flat-out ridiculous. Minimal leather gear in the desert? Mothers basically wearing bikinis and makeup? I didn't get it.Overall, don't expect any plot or character development in this film. While this IS a sequel and thus does not require deep character development, the original Mad Max series didn't have much depth and development in them in the first place. That said, you can start off with Fury Road and figure out what Max's (minimal) backstory is from there. The action is real and unique, and, yeah, it's cool to watch live for 20 minutes at an amusement park. But two hours? No thanks.",1,14,27,31 January 2016
