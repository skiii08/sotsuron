Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better the second time!
","From my experience with Star Wars flicks I have noticed that the more you watch them the more you pick up. As of now I have seen the phantom menace two times and the second time that I saw it I understood more of it because I was unable to in the first, when I first saw it I didn't know what to expect hence my attention was placed on the anticipation and amazement given to me by STAR WARS...but the second time I already knew what was going to happen so I was able to pick up more information!",10,0,0,30 May 1999
