Minority Report," HORRIBLE movie, skip it
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is an absolutely horrible movie and a travesty to both film and to the short story it was based on. SPOILERS...First of all, you can't judge a movie 'based on a short story' without considering and comparing the movie to the book itself.  We always hear 'the book was better.'  Well, not only is the book better...it's also very different.  I have no idea where Spielberg gets the notion that he can completely destroy the work of Philip K Dick by making this nonsense.Let's start with the title:  Minority Report.  The Minority Report is a VERY IMPORTANT item in the short story.  It's critical to the plot.  However, in the movie, there is no Minority Report.  There's a mention of it ('where's the minority report?') but it is dismissed quickly and absolutely ('there is no minority report')  That's it.  A critical element of the story, and the TITLE OF THE DARN MOVIE is...non existant.I won't explain the role of the minority report...just visit a bookstore, grab the collection of short stories, and you can read the whole Minority Report 'book' in about 30 minutes.Another conflict is: In the book, Anderston ABSOLUTELY and above all else loves and defends Precrime.  At the end of the book, he decides to go ahead and kill the guy just to 'prove' that precrime 'works.'  However, in the movie, he fails to do this.  Further, he works at the end to bring it down by confronting his nemesis, remarrying his wife, having another kid and living happily after.What else isn't in the book?  Anderton getting new eyes, Anderton getting divorced, Anderton losing his son, Anderton getting setup by his own boss, Anderton running around town with a precog, Anderton having a drug problem, doctors who burned their patients, jetpacks, spiders....you name it. Anderton in the novel is no Tom Cruise, but a 300 pound slob, but why mix some book facts with a bad movie?  This movie resembles the original short story as much as it resembles The Wizard Of Oz.For those that say 'well, I didn't read the book and the movie looks great,' I can only say: this is one of the most ill thought out, poorly constructed movies with entirely too many plotholes.One example that comes to mind is Anderton's eyeballs:  they could track Anderton in his car and reroute the car, yet, even after he was being pursued, he still used his eyeballs to easily enter the precog room.  How? Don't you think they would have turned off his access?  Hell, laid off employees get their card access turned off...surely, access to the most important room in the PreCrime building would have been turned off?!? Funnier still, even after he is IN JAIL, his wife uses his eyeball to gain access to the prison...with a gun...to free prisoners.  You figure it out.What about the movie saying 'precogs can only see murders' yet Agatha the roaming precog can see rain coming, balloons needed, etc?What about the movie saying all the precogs must be 'connected' in order for it to work, yet with Agatha running around solo she is seeing the aforementioned umbrella, balloons, etc?Why didn't the precogs see the Witwer murder since that was premeditated?Spielberg has said that he added in extra twists and turns as the book didn't have enough...that's bogus.  Anderton suspected even his 'loving' wife of possibly framing him in the book, or was it Witwer, or was it... plenty of twists.  Anderton electing, at the very end of the book, to go through with the actual killing, was also very interesting.I feel bad for Spielberg.  He's washed up.  He hasn't made a decent flick since the 90's.  I just hope he doesn't ruin any more of my favorite books or short stories.",1,49,99,25 June 2002
