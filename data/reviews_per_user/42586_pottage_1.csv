Source Code," Nearly a great film
","I so wish I could give a higher rating, since the film was almost really, really good. The idea was brilliant - almost hackneyed but just sufficiently novel to make me want to keep watching. The action was excellent, the intrigue was just at the right level and the acting was highly credible (well, apart from the Dr Rutledge character).But since when we leave a cinema, we are most-closely reacting to the end of the film, I have to say I felt really cheated. I've seen dialogues from other commentators explaining how the ending 'might work', so I don't want a tit-for-tat argument there. Maybe like me, they desperately wanted the ending to be at least as good as the rest of the film. But my over-riding experience was of a writer who gave up - just didn't know how to end the film, and hoped against hope that the primary idea would carry the film through. Not dissimilar to the episode of Dallas where Bobby's not dead, but alive, having a shower and the previous 493 episodes were just a dream! Such a shame - maybe for many the sense of 'anything in a scifi film can happen' will be enough. For me, I felt hugely let-down.",6,0,0,10 September 2012
