Alien 3," Simple but great
","This is a counter weight vote, to even out the hate reviews. This third installation does have everything a movie needs. Characters, awesome suspension, awesome movie set. Sure there is no deep story. But was there one with 'Alien 2'?The third part is similar to the first. There is one alien, hunting them all down, one by one. Some consider the characters to be poor. But I liked them. I even liked the flat dialogs. In fact Danny Webb as Morse was awesome. A scoundrel with a big mouth. Great.I disliked the way the alien died. This did not seem to be very realistic. And I disliked, that Ripley did not check with Bishop in the first place.... but ...well...shit happens I guess.",10,4,9,17 March 2016
The Witch," Finally no Hollywood crap
","This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle. I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow, just like the whole movie.The movies has a slow pace but its still intense. And it will only feel intense if you give in and not wait for action and speed. This movie is no Hollywood spectacle.The movie feels like a depiction of real life. No stupid jokes and exaggerated action scenes. Slow and calm dialogues. I liked the way the witch was enacted too. I am happy to see that she is not shown as a crazy woman jumping around eating toads.On the other side, I wished there would have been a deeper insight into the witches thoughts.So... go and see if you want more than silly Hollywood witches.",8,184,295,14 June 2016
