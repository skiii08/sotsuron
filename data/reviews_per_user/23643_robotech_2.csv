Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Lite--but still Star Wars!
","This is very much a Star Wars movie.  It has the same feel to it, the same atmosphere.  After sixteen years, that's a remarkable accomplishment.The FX are top-notch, the acting isn't bad, the story is so-so--and that's the main way Phantom Menace falls down.  Where Episode IV was a complete and completely satisfying story in and of itself, Episode I is of necessity a prelude, a setup for what is yet to come.  Which means the story is a bit shallow, and characterization likewise, because it has to introduce everyone and everything and set things up for parts 2 and 3.  When all is said and done, this will probably be recognized as the weakest of all the Star Wars movies.And yet, it's still a Star Wars movie.  It still has the power to take you away, back to your childhood when you saw the originals for the first time. Watch it and reminisce, and don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
The Matrix," Why So 'Groundbreaking'? It had STYLE!
","Perhaps the Matrix was not the all-time greatest movie ever made.  Perhaps the acting was not the best.  Perhaps the philosophy was not the best.  But darn, did that movie ever have *style*.  Yes, it borrowed from anime; it borrowed from Hong Kong action; it borrowed from cyberpunk.  But there *is* nothing new under the sun, and almost everything borrows from something else these days.  What matters is how seamlessly the movie tied the whole thing together.  It couldn't please everyone, of course--what movie can?--but almost every element in the film worked to build a cohesive mise-en-scene that grabbed willing viewers by the throat and *yanked* them into its world. It was completely internally consistent.  Upon reviewings, even little things made sense.  It had good music, good action--and it created a dinstinctive atmosphere unique to itself, in the way that only truly great films (such as Star Wars) have managed to.The Matrix more or less revitalized and renewed the cyberpunk genre, which Keanu's prior cyberpunk attempt (Johnny Mnemonic) had apparently proven dead in the water--much the same as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is doing for the martial arts film genre after a tired string of Jackie Chan and Jet Li imports that have flopped more often than not.  And *that* is why so many people hold it in such awe.",Null,0,0,21 January 2001
