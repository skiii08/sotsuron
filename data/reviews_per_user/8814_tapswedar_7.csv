The Incredible Hulk," No expectations going in makes this good.
",I wanna start by saying that i liked the original Hulk movie. I think The actors were way better. Sometimes nolte was over the top but comic villains are supposed to be over the top. The hulk itself looks lightyears better then the ang lee version. The villains were better as well in this one. i loved the fact that this one was more or less a sequel to the other one. People forget that though the 'Hulk' was such as disgrace it did manage to get positive reviews from every major critic. The problem with the original is that Lee tried to make it more of a drama then a mindless action film. This new one is not mindless but it has a lot more action. The special effects are really good and that was my problem with the last one. I thought everything in the lee version was great except for the villains and the CGI. This one makes up for it but this movie doesn't even compare to iron man.,6,2,4,14 June 2008
Terminator Salvation," Not bad, nor great
","I gotta say that going in to the movie i was skeptical about the film but hell its a terminator. The movie is for sure packed with action. The special effects stand out so much because they are far superior to any of the pseudo action movies that have been out recently. The acting in the movie is good but the movie seemed to be carried by their performances and the FX. There was something lacking though. The story was OK but something was off. I would have to say the direction seemed to be on a novice level. There were moments that could have gotten cut. One of the biggest problems i had with the movie is that this is supposed to be an R rated movie because of the subject matter. Robots killing people for the hell of it in a post apocalyptic world is not a kid friendly movie, so why try to be kid friendly. The third movie got that right at least. Some of the homages paid to the originals are cool. But i think they did over do it at times which always takes away from originality. The movie gets an A for effort but a C- for actual quality.",6,1,2,21 May 2009
Wanted," Now this is an Action movie
","Action movies at its finest. Back in the day these movies use to be a dime a dozen but now you are lucky if there is one competent action film every five years. I personally am tired of mutants, people from other planets, and monsters being the heroes for once. Though this movie is based on a comic series it is not like spiderman or the hulk. This movie has the feel of the matrix meets equilibrium. Are the action sequences over the top yes but look at the great action films and tell me there's not over the top moments in those. Not to mention i absolutely love the fact the of the R rating. I have grown tired of the PC movies that come out. If PG-13 movies are so wonderful then why are there only 5 of the last 15 best picture awards winners pg 13. Not to mention those movies are very pushed to the limits of pg 13. Summertime use to be about popcorn and action films and its nice to see one that is absolutely balls to the wall.",9,3,7,7 July 2008
Twilight," piece of crap
",This movie sucked on so many levels.The script terrible. The acting is so so. The story is too corny and girl oriented. If this is a vampire movie then why are they always out in the light that is never addressed. They have no fangs. The is very little suspense. The scene that ruined the movie is when pattison is overacting about how when he is in the light he is so scary but when he gets in the light he just fricking glows. Are you serious? Not to mention nothing happens until the last 10 mins. Catherine hardwicke does display her talents because the photography and editing were very good thus why it does not get a one. Girls who hate violence and love Disney movies will love this garbage. Guys would find more enjoyment going to see wall-e ran back to back.,2,10,14,8 December 2008
I Am Legend," Just Seen
","I just want to go ahead and say there is a little spoiler in this review but if you are completely oblivious to then there's no worries.I just caught the midnight showing of I am legend and this movie is not 'i am legend' one bit. I think its a little disrespectful for the film studio to give this movie the name 'i am legend' when it is so far from the book. This movie is a complete and utter remake of Omega Man. Yes, there are changes but it is basically the same thing. This time around the creatures do not speak. The thing though, is that when i go see movies i don't go in with preconceptions of a movie because when you do that, you are only ruining the movie. Personally, I was shocked. This movie was very well made. I was a skeptic when this movie chose will smith but he pulls the part off and he does capture the character from the book. Thats basically where the similarities to the book end. I thought the movie was way too short considering the budget because the movie does capture the audience but moves very fast. I've read people complaints about the cgi and i honestly can say it did not bother me because it was no where near as bad as some said. I think the creatures did not need to be cgi they could have used real people like the reapers in blade 2. This movie should be called the omega man because it is very much a remake but this version definitely eliminated some of the big flaws in the original omega man. So kudos to Francis Lawrence for not making a piece a junk and i don't understand why they felt to call this i am legendOn a Techinical note for warner bros, i guess they did not have fake dust in the budget because Neville goes through buildings which are supposed to be dormant for 3 years and there is no dust or cobwebs. Maybe the creatures dusted each night.And also people remember this movie may look and sound like 28 days later from the trailer but its quite different. 28 days later is far superior but also very different.",7,11,22,14 December 2007
Transformers," Perfect Summer Popcorn film
",For the people who forgot that summer for movies were about the big action blockbusters. Not the academy award winning movies of the winter. I went in to transformers thinking it was gonna be good or just plain ole crap. It was very good. This summer was a disappointment for blockbusters. For god sake die hard 4 is considered good after having to sit through the cheesy mindless spiderman 3 or the pirates of the Caribbean 3: when time stops. This movie embraces everything the old summer movies use to achieve. I was also glad to see they went the independence day route and what i mean by that is that they did not go out and spend tons of money on big stars who are set in their ways. Remember when independence day came out will smith was still just the fresh prince. I hope they go on to a sequel and preferablly and adaptation to the original cartoon movie if thats even possible.,8,1,4,10 July 2007
Grindhouse," Good, but highly overrated.
","This movie should be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of production company screw ups. What in god's good name possessed the Weinsteins to first market the movie the way they did and then to release it on Easter weekend. I actually was relieved i could at least sit comfortably in the theater. Lastly this movie should have been held to summer and should have been an outdoor theater thing in the places that have them. On To the review Without a doubt the best thing about the whole movie is the first 3 minutes with Danny trejo in machete. I'm a huge fan of movies like dolemite and i think this would be up there. For the lay man Dolemite is a movie that is so ridiculous it is great. The first movie, Planet Terror, is a straight up hoot. The humor is great, the john carpenter theme works, and lastly the girls. The missing reel was timed impeccably. The flaw for this movie is not really a flaw but they had to show Rose McGowan with the gun for a leg in the trailer. A lot of the Joe Schmos saw this and were like 'its not realistic', well no crap its not supposed to be. It is truly a shame that John Carpenter can't ever get a budget for his movies like they had for this one.The trailers were overblown except for thanksgiving. The rob zombie one i felt was just a crappy rock video until nick cage as foo Manchu. You never know with the junk he's been doing maybe this movie would be a step in the right direction. Then the trailer don't. Its funny but it gets really annoying. And lastly thanksgiving , you find yourself saying did i really just see that. Thats actually a good thing.Heres where the overrated part comes in. Death proof is a giant let down. I felt this was a critic's horror movie. Critics have been crying for changes in the horror play-book. They got their wish. As usual Tarantino gives us a good soundtrack of some rock gems. Also there is some good characterization by the director which is a Tarantino norm. I just felt the movie was ultimately a let down because the Planet terror has you so pumped up and death proof is just really slow and boring. You will find yourself say 'when is something going to happen'. The concept is unique and definitely will be appreciated. I felt the best move would have been to run this one first because it is slow, then planet terror would move at the speed of light. When your are sitting in the theater for over three hours the last thing you want is the last ninety minutes to drag.In all honesty, I felt this movie was very smug. These two guys thought they could make anything and the viewing public would accept it. They thought they were better then the guys who came before them such as John carpenter, Peter Jackson, and Sam raimi. Now before i get crucified, before spider-man and the Lord of the rings, Jackson and Raimi were kings of this type of film. I felt Rodriquez and Tarantino thought they were better then them and it proves names of directors doesn't really mean anything. If its not appealing to the Joe schmoes and Paris Hilton of the world then its not going to be a success. Both movies are good but this really pales in comparison to movies like Army of Darkness or They Live. I loved and respect this concept i just hope they have the balls to make and release to the theater Machete. And Tarantino and Rodriquez if you might see this make Machete a double feature with a revamped remake of Dolemite starring Ving Rhames. Machete and dolemite back to back it wouldn't be stopped.",7,5,8,17 May 2007
