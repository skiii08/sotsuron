Resident Evil: Afterlife," Horrid and critically evil
","Paul W.S. Anderson, we know him, we love him, we worship him. He is the eye behind Death Race,Alien Vs. Predator and Pandorum. He is the human entity responsible for the Resident Evil franchise. Part one was great, and part 3 was the supremely painted masterpiece. And dudes, let's just admit it, we love, love love Milla Jovovich. And if we are honest with ourselves, this is why we compulsively pay 12.50 at the theater whenever another crappy Resident Evil chop-shop sequel comes out. We love her buns, her rack, her model-like features, her deep sexy confidence and her barely restrained libido. I speak the truth, and this truth was well known by the producers and even Milla herself. Moving forward with this truth we are now in a position to criticize the most recent addition, which is truly an atrocious aberration of movie making. Just stick with parts 1 and 3, which I give ten stars easily.",1,3,8,27 August 2014
The Maze Runner," Sweet.
","There is a miracle brewing here, and I hope there are sequels. In purgatory, there are two things present: the Kardashians and the movie Divergent. These insults to humanity exist on the bottom, most furthest realm regarding American cultural worth. Much higher on the spectrum we have Harry Potter and The Hobbit, which bored me to death due to banality and contrivance; though I appreciated the skill and casting that went into them They just weren't on the same plateau of The Lord of the Rings. And then there is the Hunger Games, a bit beneath Lord of the Rings, but nonetheless engaging, well made and most of all creative. Welcome to the genre known as the teenage Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel turned into existential film. On the one hand, teenage themes are endemic to the import of it all, and must be included in these kinds of films: First Loves, Bullies, Angst etc.—but the awesome films of the genre acknowledge the teen element while prioritizing the basic heart of the story, which is the mythological themes that are timeless among all cultures and time periods. They know the story is a backdrop for the unconscious energies at the guts of all human experience: death, isolation, meaninglessness and freedom. Percy Jackson, The Maze Runner isn't. The Maze Runner is on the level of Serenity, The Matrix and Firefly. You heard me right. This is the miracle I speak of. I fully expected Divergent (clearly, the worst movie ever made), but what I got was the diet cola of Raiders of the Lost Ark—s o don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Maze is as good as Raiders, Firefly or Lord of the Rings. It isn't. I'm just saying it's at least in the same ballpark. Again, the miracle being the creative forces behind a book turned movie about teenagers satisfying all systems involved without succumbing to total CHEEZE: The producers who think only of marketing, the director who only thinks of his/her creative license, the cast who only think of their performance, all working together to understand and express the satisfaction of the perceived audience. In this light, within the constraints of money and profit, this is an awesome, awesome movie. Bravo. 9 stars. Except.why didn't the kids just build a wooden structure to get them to the top of the maze? They could have just ran to the edge.",9,3,4,16 January 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Awful, horrible, totally detestable, a betrayal in every sense of the word.
","For evidence of myth to our cultural identity and sanity, look no further than movies, and perhaps more poignantly, comic books, most obvious in the gold and silver ages. Joseph Cambell: 'On this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today. The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now. And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside.' Spider-Man is completely unique. He has trouble paying his rent. He is unpopular and can't get the girl, his aunt nags him, he has to work to get through school, he's bullied, an orphan, an outcast, and despite his super powers, struggles with the same everyday life issues as everyone else, an 'everyman,' flawed, enduring grief and loss, going through identity crisis, full of fear and insecurity, his expressiveness released the moment the suit is donned (the opposite of the god-like, omnipotent 'hero'), reveals our all too human failure and vulnerability (and hence resulting in escapism), for even with his accidental powers, he could not save or protect his loved ones, and living in the real world of Hell's Kitchen and New York City only makes him all the more real. Due to the common problems we all experience, we can all relate to the fantasy of escaping into super human grandiosity wishes (the rock star, the astronaut, the Indiana Jones adventurer), for Heroes with personal problems allows us to suspend disbelief, supercharged by awe, due our connection and attunement with the struggles of the hero. Stan Lee realized, most genuinely, if someone is just pretending to be a regular person but is secretly really a superhero, then the implication is this: 'they aren't really like you and me at all.' Superman PRETENDS to be nerdy and unsure of himself, but he's not really. So all those kids who are really nerdy and unsure of themselves fail to relate to him, because the message is 'he's not REALLY like you, it's just a trick.' But Peter Parker isn't pretending to be a normal guy and a nerd, he really IS those things. So the implication is, perhaps there's a hero deep down inside of you as well, because that superhero Spider-Man looks cool in his costume and everyone thinks he's so confident, but inside he's just like you and me.And now we have Homecoming, an unforgivably polished, fully funded betrayal; the acting, screenplay, cinematography and special effects though superb, effectively exterminate the true voice of the actual character, one who despite all odds rises above his terminable uniqueness to become a heroic community leader, like MLK. As much as I felt unease at the overly simplistic and childish Tobey McGuire portrayal, at least Sam Raimi and the rest refused to bow down to corporate producers and stay true to the myth, unlike this sordid piece of overproduced trash. And as for the cutely portrayed John Favreau and Robert Downey Jr., do you two have any integrity? Do you not have enough money yet? I guess not, for money is more important to you than creating a movie millions upon millions of adolescents could have grasped onto, relate to, and find some meaning in, you two absolute failures as creative artists. And as for the vulture, in the comics was a diseased, repugnant utterly sorrowful being, without family or friends, who replaced the disillusionment of the working class failure/hero with a megalomania cal charlatan dressed in the pale, paltry robes of the true revengeful vulture, one who preys upon the carcasses of resentment, ugly beyond recognition, abandoned by all he had left, his meaningless job, is unforgivably counterfeited here, replaced by a numbly glib and smugly empty, boringly hollow Michael Keaton (whom I suspect did a by the numbers performance by the chains imposed by his enabling handlers). It makes me sick to my soul as we regale and worship this antithesis, pounding one more nail into the coffin lid on the myth of spider man. This sickening piece of trash is a fraud, a lie, made all the more detestable and despicable by the gate-keeping, flaccid meaninglessness of the creative killing producers. Boycott this film with every fiber of your being. Boycott it I say! Boycott it in defiance of the mythology it discounts, discredits and invalidates. Boycott it I say! Boycott for nothing else than another manifestation of the soulless, numbers crunching, vapid surface level symptom it is. Boycott it because you know you love the real and true Spider-man, the one who tried to rescue Mary Jane but failed, the one whose resentment resulted in the death of Uncle Ben, the one who gave you hope that you too, in all your nerdy, pockmarked abandon, could get the girl and be cool despite all the odds. Thanks.",1,11,18,29 October 2017
Alien," Best Ever
","How can this movie not get 10 stars? It baffles me. In context, this one came out in 1979. 19 F----ng 79. And it still stands up awesomely today. Let us first investigate the Ash. When did we first realize he was an android? When the milky fluid came spurting from him. Although he was often 'collating' we never really suspected until his head was bashed in proper. What an incredible character Ian Holmes created. And those little pre-exercise jiggles he did. We just thought he was a bit off, certainly not a robot. And Ripley, a strong female lead. And though the scenes of her in her panties were anti-feminist, she still was the lone survivor, who kicked the Alien out of the airlock. She kicked a-- and everyone will always remember that, especially James Cameron. And what about Tom Skerritt? As captain, he always left the science decision to Ash, as he was instructed to do by the company. He felt he was, 'just the captain,' though he did ignore basic contamination protocols by letting Caine in with the Alien attached to his face. His acting was perfect, a man who only knows the job he is hired for, compartmentalized, weak, and yet ultimately courageous in his decision to go after the Alien. And Parker and Brett were perfect. Pay attention to how their camaraderie is condensed into a few beautiful scenes. Ridley Scott should be credited for this, as we really get to know the friendship between them quite quickly (as James Cameron does in Aliens). Lambert is great in her nervousness. This is as good an any movie can get, a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, sorry for the spoilers, but rent as soon as possible, it is a piece of American Cinematic History.",10,7,10,25 June 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Good but not Great
","I can't understand the lack of imagination in so many comic book movies. While this movie is put together well, and the acting is great, it lacks the vision and humanness that compelled the actual comic books to be so enjoyable. Kids and teens read comic books because they speak universal, mythological truths' in the language of unconscious energies. This is also known as religion. Deep down everyone understands powerlessness, inferiority and immortality within the framework of one's personal history, time period and culture. Given we grow up in families, these issues are all the more important to kids and teens, especially issues of power and growing pains inherent in the developmental stages. Captain America personifies the sensitive and vulnerable person who is transformed into a superhero with superhuman abilities in the blink of an eye. Add patriotism and unquestionable evil (Hitler and Nazism) and the formula for a great character is born. He represents the fears and potentials we all hope for but cannot achieve due to our animal, mortal nature. One reason why Star Wars was so successful was because it understood that myths are alive and well in the modern age (though obscured by Rationalism and Science) and it transferred this psychological need onto celluloid. Movies are no different than superstitions; we just don't believe them as such. But they are still private dreams in the public domain, and because of this it feels dishonest and mindlessly inauthentic to gloss this value over with endless CGI action, lack of depth, and most of all characters who are so one dimensional and simplistic they could not have come from anywhere but a derivative formula. A convenient villain with a metal arm forged in the same time crucible as Steve Rogers who looks like one of the werewolves (in human form) from Twilight and is so totally devoid of imagination the viewer is easily distracted by the most mundane of distractions. How about this for a villain: Deep in the depths of lunatic asylum, festering and wasting away in a cell of powerful medications and medical experiments, the villain one day begins to hoard his meds and slowly remember who he is and where he is from—a Nazi experiment that used the same technology as that which was used on Rogers. And instead of a lame metal arm, when he is consumed with hatred and revenge his superpowers become more powerful, more diabolical and more fascinating whatever they may be. I'm not saying I know the political and financial ins and outs of making a great movie. But come on.",6,3,5,20 September 2014
Predator," Arnold, so Arnold
","I was still in high school when I first saw Predator, and it was almost as awesome as when Terminator 2 came out, almost. There was no political correctness back then, and Jesse 'The Body' Ventura could say whatever homophobic comment that occurred spontaneously to him, with impunity, even though even then it made him look like a macho piece of trash. You shall enjoy intentional close-ups of Arnold's impeccable pecs, unabashedly Native American stereotypes (Billy's medicine bag and tracking abilities), African American assumptions ('gonna have me some fun, gonna have me some fun'), and even the token Asian from First Blood Part 2 ('You no expendable Rambo'), and still you will cheer Arnold as he fights the Predator. And finally, in your White, privileged, entitled and presumptuous world, you will undoubtedly endlessly repeat the choice sayings to your White friends and family members: 'Do it, kill me I'm here,' and, 'Billy, what is it, what's out there?' And as you lay on your deathbed, you won't wonder about the racism and sexism you've promoted.",10,1,2,17 August 2015
Split," One of the best movies of the century.
","Unbelievably awesome, a total resurgence and atonement of M. Night since the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The idea that mental disorders may represent evolutionary progression is an idea that has been on my mind for quite some time now. For example, Psychopaths are 'morally reprehensible but absolutely necessary' is a theme all too true in real life as it is reflected in the movies. M takes the condition of Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously Multiple Personality Disorder) to a more humane, though excruciatingly terrifying, description is undeniably ingenious, and I applaud him for it. The direction and acting is absolutely superb, the editing unquestionable, and the mission to make a movie inscrutably unique and uncritically undeniable. Well done, M. very well done.",9,2,4,20 August 2017
Aliens," The Perfect Movie
","Another movie that deserves a perfect 10 stars. The real miracle of this movie is the character development, begun by Ridley Scott and perfected by James Cameron. In a few scenes we are introduced to the heart and soul of the soldier, of Ripley, of Hicks and Bishop. Why do we feel such a connection to them, so immediately, so intensely and so experientially? This is because of Cameron, and his relationship with the actors. Remember Al Matthews (As----es and elbows people!). Right now I'm beginning to think that it is the relationship, the connection, the attunement, between director and actor, that makes or breaks a great movie. Scott and Cameron understood this, and made excellent movies as a result. These days I see so many directors and actors making the same mistakes over and over again, not seeing eye to eye, and failing miserably. When will they learn? No film school can teach this. It's innate, and the stuff that makes a great director, such as Scorcese, Spielberg and Cameron. It's maddening to me, why the power of presence, unconditional positive regard and strength based direction is not taught in schools. Eric.",10,3,5,25 June 2015
Non-Stop," Liam does it again
","Really, is there anything better than a tear jerking Liam Neeson action film? Maybe one starring Jason Statham? This is the legacy of Jerry Bruckheimer, who gifted to us all the unforgettable Armageddon (and we love him for it), and another reminder Hollywood has just gotten better at packaging celluloid sentimentalism with heroic atonement. So good that, even though we pick them apart with relentless critical abandon and expose them for the unrepentant saccharine clichés they are, in the end, deep down, we find ourselves rooting for Liam and suspending disbelief as he embodies the protective father, alcoholic failure and terrorist ass kicker all at once. Only Taken is better (perhaps the best of the genre) and I for one am looking forward to Non-Stop Too, bitches. Curious side-note: tonight I watched Non-Stop for the second time, and it only took 3 Scotch Ales to thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did the first time.",7,0,0,29 March 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another conflated, self-absorbed Tanantino Film
","I'm starting to believe we have convinced ourselves Quentin Tarantino is a bit better than he is. Reservoir Dog's was great and Pulp Fiction a masterpiece. But we now know Tarantino ripped off Roger Avery and took much of the credit for Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown was good but not excellent, and Kill Bill, From Dusk 'til Dawn and Grindhouse were priceless. True Romance was another he ripped off from Roger Avery. But after all this, after he started solo projects; these films broke down to grandiose, self-absorbed entitlement. Inglorious Bastards and the Fateful Eight are prime examples of a narcissist without license, oversight or direction. They are boring, insipid, bloated and fatal, masked as marvels but sitting in our intuitive gut as failures. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the third installment of boring, far too long movies with excellent acting, cinematography and production that money can buy. But if you hated Inglorious and Hateful as much as I did, as the ultimate examples of movies as gaslighting, you will also hate Hollywood. I barely could stand it, writing this review as the gelatinous sand dune of a film progressed. We get the impression Quentin has his hand upon the beating heart of the culture and time period, and yet if we look closer, we see he perceives nothing at best, and a Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver he is not-in fact, nearly the opposite of. I guess I wish Quentin would have just stayed with what he knows, epitomized in Kill Bill, instead of making these massive bore-fests. However, the worst insult of all is making Hollywood absent of the effect of Manson, relegating him and the murders to a mere suggested subplot. I'm boycotting all future Tarantino releases for this reason only.",4,4,5,11 December 2019
Gone Girl," Good, but not great.
","Ben. Oh, Ben. We loved you and Matt for Goodwill. And yet, we can't forgive your for Gigli. There can be no two diametrically opposed movies ever. Gone Baby Gone was good, but not great, as Gone Girl is. We sit and wait for the action, the greatness, the imperious glorious abandon to come, and we are still waiting as the credits roll up the screen. What does this mean? It means Ben Affleck is no Martin Scorsese, no Robert Altman and no Steven Spielberg. No, he is mix between Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, always falling painfully short of greatness. It is no wonder Jenner Garner wants to divorce him. And yet, there is a Hitchcockian flare underscoring his work, which to me shows great promise, great potential, that could eventually culminate into something as brilliant as 'Strangers On A Train.' Perhaps the problem is that Ben just needs to 'Let himself go,' trust in the force (instead of his producers) and man-up and grow some balls and unleash his true creative vision upon us. Because there is something seriously 'held back' in your directorial debuts. Something causing the unleashing of your creative vision to be suppressed. What is it Ben? Fear? Loss? You have the potential, we can all see that. Now it's time to kick some a--.",6,2,8,15 February 2015
A Quiet Place," Horrible, awful, the worst ever, EVER!
","An awesome premise. A great screenplay. Incredible acting. Sublime cinematography--all completely wasted and destroyed by a few stupid and inane decisions. Unreal. Could have been the current version of The Thing or even Alien. Instead, we are introduced to stupid people who make stupid decisions based on the current circumstances: generally, shutting up. No explanation is given, no reason alluded to, and no resolve intimated. The greatest and most stupidest movie all at once. I can't stand it anymore, more.",1,1,6,21 July 2018
Evil Dead," Utterly lacking the original flavor.
","There wasn't much like this when Sam Raimi Et. Al. produced this precious little gem. The thing was, the preciousness was time sensitive, and in the late seventies,when all we had was Friday the 13th Part 1 (thank you Kevin Bacon), this was a welcome surprise to the genre. That Bruce Campbell was willing to get his ass kicked as a primer to the sequel is beside the point; the original movie is undeniably prescient, for a thousand more would follow. And as bad ass as the beginning scene is in this remake, it can't make up for the loss of the original horror/comedy aspect. This is the remake's elemental mistake, trying to make a horror/comedy into a horror movie. This should not be a horror movie. It should be a laugh fest when Bruce Campbell says, 'Chainsaw,' which is utterly missing in this rather pathetic remake. Take a look at Evil Dead 2, especially the scene where Bruce hammers in the cross to his beloved Linda in the grave below. That is the essence of what is not replicated in this remake, which is why I give it 1 stars.",1,7,11,6 August 2014
Jurassic World," Awful but watchable
","Everyone loved this movie, and I admit it was put together quite well. Great editing, cinematography, editing, script and acting, all very slick. A little too slick, by the book, by the numbers, predictable story line and plot. There is an island. On the island is a dinosaur theme park. The humans have every technological ability to keep the dinosaurs from escaping. That is, until the humans make a dinosaur with DNA from a all these different species that allows it to break free. And then we have nonstop consumption of humans, chasing of the dinosaurs, and by the numbers plot advances, romantic liasians and family friendly cute kid scare scenes (man, if those kids got eaten, this movie would be a 10!) One can almost feel the presence of the big time gambling producers, Steven Spielberg's watchful eye, and every gatekeeper imaginable controlling the thing, until the final result is inevitable: a massive bore-festing yawn-athan I could not wait to be over as I sat uncomfortably in the theater. I wish I had brought edibles with me many times during the over two hour soap opera. Are the special effects awesome? Yes. Is this any different in any way from the previous films, in term of artistic integrity and real risk taking? No. Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots this film is not. Wait for Redbox.",2,4,10,24 June 2015
Midsommar," A bit more engaging than 'Suspiria.'
","'The Witch' was a bit too Avant Garde or 'Artsy-Fartsy' for me; it was interesting, even intriguing at times, but had too much desolation symbolism for the average viewer to make sense of much of anything, ostensibly to 'make the audience think, question and wonder' about what it all means. Throwing in a Satanic goat here and there is nothing new. David Lynch, as much as I liked half of his movies, is the ultimate director god of this genre. It's a precarious fine line, like many of Bob Dylan's songs, between the artist bringing authentic and mythological meaning to contemporary problems in timeless fashion vs. bogging down into the drainless swamp of the individual's neurosis, most notably exemplified in the older philosophers, such as Nietzsche, who we must extricate the pathological depression from the gems of timeless wisdom regarding the human condition. There is a limited number of explanations available for psycho-phantasmagorical movies: the government, aliens, a dream, the devil, a hallucinogen, the matrix, purgatory etc. (did I miss any?). All of these are copouts, and why the TV series 'Lost' imploded upon itself. Most movie audiences are not stupid and will know when they can or cannot suspend disbelief. This will be felt as boredom and an overall sense of stupidity, regret and anger for paying the high cost of the ticket. While slow at times, 'Midsommer' does not betray the exciting premise, fortitude and engaging drama of the original 'Wicker Man,' slowly leading the audience to more subtle and nuanced veils of what is true and what is not. Currently, I am halfway in, hoping the film does not degrade itself by indulging in the 'limited explanations' described above. Unfortunately, the trauma story of one of the main characters does not weave perceptibly into the whole, and the movie makers would have been wise to apply a Gestalt to this film: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, an almost fatal flaw, gladly resuscitated by the quality of the script, the direction and the performance of the young, talented actors. However, I'll just be honest, in the Nicolas Cage remake of the 'Wicker Man,' as he burning alive in sacrifice for the harvest, there is a strong part of me that wishes, half on fire, he would have catapulted from the upper chamber, broke his arm, and ran screaming to the ocean, diving in, and after bashing his body on the rocks, clinging on, barely clinging on, only to pass out and awake half buried in a crag covered with seaweed and vowing his revenge, then surreptitiously crawling among the salty rocks and breaking into a warehouse-closed for harvest season, replete with all the necessary things required to recover and then turn the island into sausage proper. How much better would that have been? If only the actors, producers, directors and everyone else creating the stage had the vision of a revenge redressed! Okay, now it has dragged on for over 45 minutes, with the main character having orgies and more. I feel the ghost of Nicholson's 'The Passenger,' and 'A passage to India' now-a boredom resembling a sand dune. And so, in the final analysis, don't bother with this one.",5,0,1,17 November 2019
Man on Fire," Denzel at his best.
","Tony Scott seemed to live in his brother's shadow, but I don't think he got a fair shake, may he rest in peace. I loved Crimson Tide and I loved Man on Fire. His signature dish, to create fast paced, Kaleidoscopic, intense adventure stories marked by formula, but very much enjoyable. Man on Fire is one of his finest works and he directs Denzel brilliantly. Dakota Fanning is great and totally believable in her role. You like her so much you actually start to like it when Denzel starts cutting off fingers to move up the 'bad guy chain.' We get a sense of a man in despair, burdened down by he demon of alcoholism, a life full of pain and regret, who finally sees one last opportunity at redemption and meaning. Denzel replicates this in The Equalizer, but not quite as awesomely as he does here. He is truly one of our finest actors.",9,3,4,2 September 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," stinking bloody mess
","There was a miracle that happened not too long ago, in a land far away. And that miracle was called, 'The Lord of the Rings.' Because now we have the bloated, swelling, sellout CGI apocalypse that is The Hobbit. One wonders what Peter Jackson was thinking, and being influenced by. Was it the number crushing producers who insisted on the formulaic and standardized stretched-to-the-wire, soul-crushing trash of the Hobbit 1 and 2? Was it Peter Jackson caving into the mind-numbing corporate rules? We will probably never know. But one thing we do know: this production was somehow manipulated, controlled and raped by the powers that be, and Peter Jackson is complicit in this. Otherwise we would have the Lord of the Rings, would we not? There was no passion, character development, creativity or innovation in this, only the 'buy the numbers,' corporate and conformist values inundated by Peter Jackson's pale, pale puckering sphincter. I know, I know. You will call me a hater. But what I'm really doing is trying to improve the quality of cinematic life for all of us. This is a vapid, weak, watery, dull and lifeless video game.",1,7,11,9 May 2015
Shooter," Unbelievably good yet awful reviews
","Well, there's not too many that liked or even mildly appreciated 'Shooter,' but I am happy to say I am one of the few detractors. It's a formula for sure, but somehow by some miracle it all comes together as a very enjoyable film with a strong political message. Let's start with the acting. It turns out Marky Mark is a fairly fine actor in the right role, much like Brad Pitt (e.g. as Pitt appeared in 12 Monkeys). He gets into character, loses himself, and because he has this skill, the audience believes the character's hype, no matter how ingratiated. Michael Pena is the Latino call to Don Cheadle, two of the finest, most likable, most entertaining and most fun to watch actors of this generation or any other (see Pena's performance in Ant-Man, and Cheadle's role in Traitor for further evidence). Danny Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty are all pitch perfect (especially Beatty). The formulas' are aplenty and abound, which is why this is not a four start movie. The Fugitive template is used well, with the usual clichés: escaping protagonist after car crashes in the water, hero violates every law on the books and in the end is bafflingly exonerated, the token slow motion patriotic scene of Marky and a few others. But unlike the Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal or Nicolas Cage revenge flicks, this one comes with a strong message: political corruption is a conglomerate, and cutting off the head of the snack only results in another group of people, cartel-like, assuming the roles of their predecessors. 'You can't kill human weakness with a gun,' Beatty states, and deep down in our cultural hearts we know this is true, for our entire political institution is based and predicated on the weaknesses and vulnerability that created it (also known as the human condition): greed, avarice, jealousy, money, power, loss---they all figure in and are part and parcel of our organizational belief system (warrior values, simplistic either/or thinking, propaganda). It's Shakespearean, it's archetypal, and it's completely true, relatively, for all celluloid is a painted picture of the Zeitgeist Gestalt (the notion that art, that being movies in this case, imitates life and vice-versa). And in America, the our system is essentially narcissistic, grandiose, entitled, arrogant, self-absorbed. Objectifying with abandon. Sadly, that is our generational norm, our legacy, one we must change if everyone is to survive. Perhaps this is a bit too much to read into 'Shooter,' but the sensibility, the nuance of what I am getting at is still there. So 3/4 stars! Watch it NOW!!!!",8,0,1,15 July 2017
Prometheus," Awful, just awful
","This film was watchable, but it is awful, just awful, because of the massive, unrepairable and unforgivable bland and plastic grand scheme of the thing. And the stupidity, the awful, awful stupidity. In the first Alien, we are awed by the script's homage to the importance of quarantine and strict adherence to the rules and regulations of contagion protocols. Not so with Prometheus. In fact, once inside the Alien dwelling, all involved decide to take off their breathing apparatuses on a whim, and then a bit later, talk to an alien with the cooing love of a dog owner that repays their kindness by devouring them proper. There is no character development at all, the kind we loved from Alien (think of the banter between Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton), Aliens (Ripley and Newt and Hicks, all the marines), Alien 3 (the worst of the series by far, but still awesome), Alien Resurrection (Ron Perlman and Winona). In Prometheus, we don't even get the barest sense of any kind of celluloid chemistry, just one-dimensional, puppet, soulless characters with wooden lines and robotic acting. This was the glory of the Alien series: the instantaneous and highly believable chemistry between the actors, due to a great script and great direction. After 'Chappie' I'm afraid, very afraid of Alien 5. And as for Prometheus 2? There better be some aliens in it!!!!!!",1,3,6,26 July 2015
Wonder Woman," Perfectly Sexist
","Okay, here it is, in real time. So far the first scenes are the women challenging each other to actualize their warrior potential, and Gal has surpassed all the tests, especially that of the supreme mothers. Here come the Germans, eventually suppressed by the women, though their leader is killed. Chris Pine is now their captor. Now he is their confidante. Now he is naked and Gal is wondering why he has a penis, to which Chris responds, 'this is my watch,' revealing an actual watch, followed by unembellished focus on Gal's breasts and crotch. Now I'm watching the Amish-like speech of the Gal's mom, telling her if she leaves she will be excommunicated. Now as Chris and Gal row from the island, it is made clear the women's idealistic and simplistic and one- dimensional and stupid understanding of things is predicated upon Chris sleeping with her. Gee, thanks, Feminism. Now Gal is flaunting her ass, her tits, milking her sexuality for all it's worth. So much for the empowerment of our girls. Now Chris Pine is taking charge, dominating, as Gal is reduced to fondling and nurturing an infant child at the train station. And now, we are entertained as Chris completely subjugates Gal to modern innovation and living, reducing her to a hapless and powerless being in the world of men. Ad infinitum.",7,0,6,29 September 2017
Life," The Most Disappointing Movie In the Existence of Movies
","Upon the throne of mediocrity and in the context of sheer wasted talent due to an uninspired, banal and lackadaisical script, this is the worst movie I've ever seen (second only to Interstellar). Many will disagree, saying they were riveted from beginning to end, because the screen writing is engaging, the acting of course is top notch, and the directing, cinematography and lighting are even exceptional at times (thanks, money).Perhaps Alien was just too good, so good that everything after could only pale in comparison. Maybe Alien was one of those miraculous time stamps like the Beatles that for whatever reason was the most possibly realized constellation of talent, courage, luck and will. Walter Hill knew and deeply researched his Freudian psychology, the alien-penis with it's vicious thrusting inner mouth, the near anatomical vagina of the pods, and creating a virtual reality ship named 'mother.' Perhaps there is nothing more after this when it comes to alien quarantine and/or contagion movies. Perhaps only Carpenter's 'The Thing' even comes close. And I sit is with great sorrow I tell you, even despite the musical score, which was excellent, in this overall context, this movie redefines disappointment. After all this is Deadpool and Donnie Darko in space.And to leave us with the ending credits with 'Spirit of the Sky' is unforgivable. Here's a simple twist that would have elevated this movie to greatness: the martian spore contains the genetic history of the fallen Martian race to massive atom wars of long ago; the astronauts, being the evolutionary manifestations of the long ago spores of the Martian ruling class, sent to Earth right before the apocalypse, trigger the Martian amoeba to 'Terra-form' (for space travel instigates this evolutionary possibility), creating a new version of war of the worlds which illustrates and is a vehicle for current struggle of class, power, race and aristocracy we are all currently experiencing. Again, sad to see Gyllenhaal, Reynolds and the others entombed in the banality of it all; maybe that is the greatest sin.Sincerely,E-Cubed.",1,4,9,27 June 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Dumb, dumb and dumber.
","This Mad Max is supremely surreal/Dali, absolutely fascinating even. This one, like the first 3 films, we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects, thrusting us into the post-apocalyptic world, with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the best of the series, the unforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's tribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence I'm sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory. I'm not a hater, but massive dune buggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way. Miller, you messed up bad. What happened to Max, a 'shell of a man' who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long forgotten and buried it. In this way this movie pisses me off, in the same way 'The Phantom Menace' did. And yet, 9 out of 10. MILLER, you'r awesome!!!",3,93,188,24 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Way Better Than Prometheus!
","I am happy to say Covenant is far superior than Prometheus in pretty much every way imaginable. The first Alien movie was as perfect a movie can get, and like The Godfather, Alien is is one of the archetypal templates for its genre. This means the writers create sabotage when they completely betray one or more of the foundations of the original masterpiece, in this case 'basic quarantine procedure.' The worst scene in Prometheus, or any movie really, is when the supposedly highly trained scientist/astronaut takes off his helmet and lovingly approaches a potentially deadly alien creature, as one might approach a kitten. He is of course immediately eviscerated. I'll ignore the improbability the engineers' planet is completely compatible with Earth's atmosphere (hence no need for a pressurized oxygen suit) to focus on the crew acting in the same stupid, naive manner (in regards contagion, quarantine procedures), as they curiously plant their faces into alien fungi and are immediately infected/impregnated with alien spores. In Alien, Ripley won't let Cain and the rest in, one of the best scenes. This is because Alien knew what it was supposed to be: a movie about working class heroes who damn well knew and, and were highly trained in, safety protocols. It is the imperfect Ash, the insane robot/android, following company management algorithms' who signs the death warrant (props to the foreshadowing of David's madness and that, out of perverse 'love,' he is the killer of the engineer species and final creator of the original xenomorph). Another theme in all the Ripley movies is down to earth believable characters who are both instantly relatable and almost immediately convey the nature of their bonding (that is, character development). This is what makes a movie real, and to use the clichÃ©, 'suspends disbelief' (think Brett and Parker in Alien, the camaraderie of the troops in Aliens, the colorful characters in Resurrection and even Bishop's barely revealed humanity in Aliens). We have none of this in Prometheus or Covenant and I can't help but to think the pressurized system of Hollywood has now become a formula within a formula (e.g. choosing actors without chemistry within scripts without passion to please agents and producers who act like realtors rather than artists). But all caveats aside, Covenant has the best alien birthing and kill scenes ever, rivaling even at times the editing of Aliens. Though not nearly as convincing as Ash or Bishop, Fassbender nonetheless gets the job done well (imagine if he was let loose to completely create his own character? One gets the impression he was given a very limited range to work with, especially being one our best living actors). And the creatures themselves are very well done, even without Geiger. If the producers and writers and directors had any sense at all, they'd let Cameron both write and direct the next one, unchained.",5,1,4,18 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Tell the truth or forever hold your peace
","The producers, directors and writers cannot seem to comprehend that the camaraderie dynamics that made the first two alien movies so relatably simple do not exist in the same way 25 years later. In the first alien, Brett and Parker, in perfect 70's gestalt, were perfectly cast and written to embody the working class familiarity of that particular blue collar time period--think car wash blues by Jim Croce and you will get the sentiment. Their unforgivable mistake was trying to duplicate the zeitgeist of yore for now. It just doesn't exist anymore, and the character 'Tennessee,' in complete pathetic abandon, trying to be the African American actress on the movie, 'The Abyss' (Kimberly Scott) is about the most fake and phony attempt at recapturing the authenticity of the original I can possibly imagine. That James Cameron was able to do this elucidates his savvy, or perhaps even his genius, for he knew the developmental process of the conceivers of the new alien series were as important as considering as the passage of time itself; if the gatekeepers were not self-aware, they would only repeat the past through the lens of their own relative, reminiscent memories. This is why George Lucas failed on every level with Star Wars. He didn't understand that while the same basic mythological narratives remained timelessly true, the contemporary context and dynamic of cultural change still had to be woven into it all. Many of us are perplexed by these new movies, whose predecessors we magically related to. In these new movies, we immediately have no intrinsic relatableness to any of the characters; they feel one-dimension and plastic, forced upon the scene like hungry ghosts of what once worked but what can never work again. This is how the lack of humility and ego of the original creators sin--they disparage the passion of the original for the bleached forgone longings of their own selfish and repressed nostalgia. It's like how the Republicans wish for Norman Rockwell. That time is over--and perhaps never even existed--and, in trying to repair the unrepairable, the wishful depraved child hopes to recreate the childhood he never had, but should have had. And worse, they have completely forgotten what made the first two movies so timelessly awesome, and that was their dedication and conviction to the human condition in the context of hypersleep and deep space travel--that human being are exceptionally fragile and vulnerable, and therefore, say, contagion protocols must be enforced as the highest priority. In Prometheus they gleefully take off their helmets and try to lovingly caress the alien appendage. In Covenant, they practically plaster their faces onto the alien spores. Stupid, stupid, stupid, and why Prometheus (three stars) is only a little bit worse than Covenant (5 stars). These idiots made the same mistake with 'The Thing' remake. The original story of The Thing was about men, masculinity, isolation and paranoia of the other, a metaphor for the cold war and the fear even your best friend could be something other than what he reveals himself to be. It was like remaking Thelma and Louise with two men experiencing the travails of the metoo movement. STUPID! How about a remake of Mississippi Burning about the trials and tribulations of sensitive white artists living in South Dakota? Why, why are they so inept? It's so simple and obvious to me. The old Ripley isn't the new Ripley. Kurt Russell cannot be replaced by a woman, no matter how great of an actress or beautiful she is. This is not sexist, it's the intention of the original story. How about a sequel to Fried Green Tomatoes featuring a bunch of male facebook stock holders? I just don't get it, all those millions upon millions upon millions of dollars, only to make at best a ghostly bi-product of what made the original so glorious. Perhaps in the end it is pure cowardice. Those with untold millions just trying to crunch the numbers and follow a formula in order to create the best probability for a return, as though they were real estate agents. The thing is, they are not real estate agents--they are the gatekeepers of our culture, and sadly, like the massive foreign investors and one percenters eating up our precious neighborhoods with mini-apartments, lego like candyland dehumanizing structures and organizations and establishments catering to the hollow, empty soullessness of viral tech invaders, only let us all down. Perhaps this is a rambling diatribe--or perhaps it is an all too real warning. Where shall we be in twenty years? In Fifty? Shall the aristocracy reign supreme, as they have tried to do so, for timeless immorium, under the guise of conservitism?
Shall we let them continue to use PC as a fascist call for conformity and censorship? Or shall we, through the power of the arts, the power of the movies, stop the egregious affront before it's too late? Are you with me?",5,0,1,29 January 2018
