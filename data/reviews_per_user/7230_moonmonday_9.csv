Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Aggressively Mediocre
","I enjoyed the first Pirates film, yawned through the second, and never saw the third. When this one came to the bargain cinema, the power was out and I was looking for something to occupy the time before the power company did their thing.It was not two-plus hours well spent, but it was adequate to pass the time. There was some action to distract, a few laughs here and there, and some passable special effects, though they were sparing this run-through.My main problem with it was that despite getting rid of the incredibly annoying characters of Will and Lizzy from the first three films, as well as most of the rest of the recurring cast, they still found a way to avoid Jack as much as possible. It wasn't really about him any more than the other films. The promises to explore his past were completely untrue, and we got little more than a few jokes about how he knew Angelica. He was always a treat when he was on-screen, but so much of the film centred around less interesting characters that it was at times off-putting.Jack also seemed not to move the plot as he had in the previous films. In the first, he was always the driving impetus for movement. In this one, he seems to be swept up in everything else happening and never once actually drives anything. Instead of being a capable captain whose apparent buffoonery is often to get his enemies off-guard, he really does seem like just a very lucky idiot here, which isn't really fair to the character built through three films already.Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa was well-acted, if frustrating, and Ian McShane's Blackbeard was full of personality and gravitas, if completely unsympathetic. Unfortunately Penelope Cruz, despite being a capable actress, has little to work with as Angelica, and she failed to be anything but irritating until her very last scene. Why couldn't we have had that interplay the whole film? Sam Claflin somehow manages to be more annoying than Orlando Bloom as the inane missionary Philip, but he at least fulfills his role as eye candy, inasmuch as he can. Astrid Berges-Frisbey is serviceable as the mermaid Syrena, but makes little impact. The rest of the cast is fine but not prominent.The story is plodding and meandering, which is not surprising since it had nine screenwriters. It never seems to know what it's doing, and yet it manages to be rather unexciting. When the LEGO game released in tandem is more thrilling than your film, you know there's an issue.The theme of redemption and faith, overwhelmed by clumsy religious leanings, was off-putting and interfered with most of the characters involved being in any way sympathetic or interesting. The two who seemed to embody the extremes of that faith -- Philip and the Spanish captain -- both came off as completely awful, with the first an ineffectual clod you wanted them to be rid of and the latter nothing more than an ignorant, disrespectful zealot. The Spanish also tended to be nothing but a deus ex machina, who never made any impact on the story and only did anything when the script needed a convoluted climax. It was tremendously unfulfilling that they received no consequences for any of their actions at all.At least Jack's past with Angelica poked merciless fun at the seeming necessity for 'romance' in these films, even the pastiche between Philip and Syrena. Perhaps in the next film, they will dispense with the weak attempts at romance and concentrate on action and adventure, which is what people go to these films to see.Overall, it was a film that was okay for wasting time, but nothing special. Not better than the first, although at least it didn't end like the second, and I hear it was far better than the third. It was just unfortunately rather dull and unexceptional, which is a shame since it is supposed to relaunch the series.",Null,3,3,9 August 2011
Shaun of the Dead," Insert Noun of the Dead
","Zombie films are something that many people have tried to make and many people have failed to make well. Even George Romero and Lucio Fulci, it must be admitted, do not have the Midas touch in this genre. This goes ably to show that even when it's a single genre of horror, it's difficult to pin down.Multi-genre combinations are typically even more difficult to accomplish successfully, and unfortunately that's exactly what Shaun of the Dead tries to do. It fails in more or less every way that it possibly can: it's not well-acted, it's not funny, it's not scary, and above all it's really not entertaining or amusing. It's depressing and sad, and the film's end leaves one with a sense of futility and pointlessness, a sense of having wasted the entire running time on a completely and utterly meaningless thing.The whole film is spent with unsympathetic and unlikable clods who manage somehow to survive as long as they do through sheer luck and no real ability or even desire to persevere. The humour is hardly passable, even by today's standards; it's often either crass and unfunny or simply unsubtle and unfunny.The script is as pedestrian as possible, with attempts at tugging the heartstrings merely coming off as manipulative and illogical, especially given the subsequent 'resolution' the film gets. If the viewer is not furious, then he clearly wasn't paying attention. And the scriptwriters certainly weren't paying attention, as the script's coherency is laughable. Even for a comedy, it ought to be much tighter than this happens to be.After people raving about Shaun of the Dead, it's easy to go in either extreme direction. People jump on the bandwagon easily, especially when friends recommend something, and eventually it reaches a point where people who haven't even seen the film are recommending it to others. The overblown nature of the film, however, makes judgement of it much harsher. If it had been simply the small-time film that it probably was intended to be, it might be easier to forgive. However, as an overrated 'cult classic', it is not worth the praise heaped upon it for being something it is not: namely enjoyable.",1,49,113,1 June 2010
Silent Hill," Typical Hollywood Crap
","Strangely, the sequel did a better job of capturing the actual feel of the classic Silent Hill games from which this series ostensibly drew its name. This film, however, is a terrible disaster. It drags on for over two hours, in which time it never justifies its length. It's a pathetic attempt to alter the original game's story, but it manages to do absolutely nothing right, instead needlessly shifting characters' genders and creating extraneous characters that it never makes anything but annoying and awful.The direction is terrible, the photography is atrocious, and the acting is barely serviceable, which says something considering that this film includes some generally good actors. Sean Bean is utterly wasted on the disposable role he's given, and Kim Coates is literally *painful* as Thomas Gucci. There's so much in this movie that is worth of contempt, and not just because it flagrantly disregards the beloved series of games, but because as a film it's crap.Whatever message it attempts to present is lost in a morass of misogyny and incompetence. It's not even entertaining, which is probably is greatest fault; it certainly does not engage an audience, nor does it justify its ridiculously long running time.Skip this one and watch the sequel instead; it actually tells a decent story that feels true to the source material, unlike this pathetic garbage. And thankfully, it's also shorter.",1,17,30,9 August 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Astounding Wasted Potential
","I'm not a fan of most Broadway, which I suppose means that this will be discredited in the eyes of some; I especially find Sondheim's works to be often lacking in terms of composition, but the unique stage chemistry in the cast featuring Angela Lansbury -- shared with me years ago -- appealed for its undeniable charm. The story I found a bit too grotesque, but ultimately it was portrayed decently. However, when I heard of this film adaptation, I was less than enthused.I will agree that Depp possesses inordinate charisma (and the camera seems intent on featuring either his handsome face or his shapely posterior), but it is mostly wasted here when he is given essentially one thing to do: stare into the distance wearing a sour expression. Helena Bonham Carter does perhaps the best of the cast as Mrs. Lovett; I find it difficult to dislike her in anything, due to her earnest approach and organic talent. These were both well cast but not particularly well-used, and both go to waste for most of the film.Sacha Cohen was actually surprisingly good, and it's more the pity he was in the film so briefly. However, most of the rest of the cast phone in their performances or are so horrifyingly bad that they make the cartoonish killings seem cheery by comparison. Jamie Bower has an voice that speaks to the ear like nails on a chalkboard, and although Depp's is not that fantastic, he has the charisma to pull it off; Bower does not. The rest of the cast is forgettable, Alan Rickman as usual acting as Alan Rickman pretending to be someone else.The music is hideous, although the lyrics occasionally shine. 'A Little Priest' is the only moment of the film that even approached amusement with its hilarious statements on society, with most of the other songs incorporating not only the same motifs, but parts taken from other numbers. There is far too much mishmash, so much so that it is reminiscent of the low-budget compilations hawked on late television.The direction is regrettable. It's incredibly uneven and, at times, fairly uncomfortable too. Although it's clear that Burton wished for Depp to play Sweeney as a charismatic, sensually dangerous man, I question sexually-charged scenes between Depp and Rickman. Further, I noticed that it seemed everyone interacting with Todd seemed either to regard him as if they would like to bed him or be bedded by him; I'm not entirely sure about that motivation for virtually the entire cast.The visuals are impacting, but they don't always make sense. The wardrobe department presents ludicrous costume after ludicrous costume, too many hideous leather monstrosities and one or two noteworthy and beautiful outfits. And for all of the reasons why her pie shop was failing, did it ever occur to her that people might be put off by a shopkeeper with the appearance of a wraith? Apparently not. It would be one thing if everyone had the same pallor and fashion sense, but they do not.The story manages to plod along, things only happen in bursts and then grind to a halt, and very little makes any sense. The subplot between Anthony and Johanna is particularly painful, as it is not only poorly-acted but also receives no resolution whatsoever, despite it having hogged inordinate amounts of screen time already. The parallels between Anthony and Turpin, however, cannot be denied; a man who sees a girl and fancies himself in love with her after glimpsing her from afar? The assumption that we'll just go along with the two being 'in love' is too much to ask, and it would be challenging even for particularly good actors to pull off.The most egregious fault of the film is that it overstays its welcome and does such a poor job of infusing a potentially riveting and oddly sympathetic tale with any energy or charm whatsoever. Depp's Todd is initially very identifiable and even desirable, but his single-note portrayal quickly wears thin. By the end, one cares little for what happens to him. In fact, the only character that moved me even slightly was Carter's Lovett, driven by terribly misguided love and sweet dreams but far beyond redemption.For all those who complain about the violence, it's so completely ridiculous that it doesn't even bear taking seriously. The dummies tossed down the chute are clearly dummies, as much as I felt for watching. But cheap shots aside, the violence is extremely cartoony and not nearly as grotesque as some have claimed. In some scenes it's laughably ridiculous, and not a nervous laugh but one of comical disbelief.The sound is where a musical should shine, but the sound was exactly where Sweeney Todd failed the hardest. When they're not singing, they're whispering and inaudible. When they are singing, they're incomprehensible. The accompaniment is uneven, but it generally drowns them out, so much so that one requires subtitles even with perfect hearing. It is also noteworthy that Depp seems to go back and forth between Todd's intended accent and that of Jack Sparrow, which is distracting to say the least.Overall this film was poorly-acted, poorly-directed, and had very few shining moments. The music was never good, but the Lansbury cast at least transcended it with their stage charisma. However, none of the cast here, aside from Carter's earnest presentation in her downplayed role, were able to do much with their parts. It's not surprising, since at heart it isn't very good. Yet it disappoints since, in the hands of a better director and a few different actors, it might have been something very special.As it was, it was only dismal and disheartening, depressing and misanthropic, with the faintest hint of black comedy occasionally at the edges. Although I'm not particularly a fan of the stage production, it's head and shoulders above this film. It can't help but be.",2,2,6,16 September 2008
Van Helsing," Elements of Good, Execution Completely Lacking
","I am probably different from many in that my first exposure to Van Helsing was in the animation The London Assignment. It was a steal, so I picked it up and gave it a watch, with low expectations. But I found myself interested, so I thought I would finally watch the film that spawned the animated prequel.It is rather astonishing to me, actually, how a 30-minute tie-in prequel could be so many leagues superior to its big-budget Hollywood source material, especially when there is so much rich material to draw from. Then again, that may have been the chiefest problem: whereas The London Assignment focused solely on a single adversary, the film tries to incorporate so many things and so many moments of homage that it never finds a focus.The first and most inexcusable aspect is that none of the protagonists are even remotely sympathetic or enjoyable, and no real effort is made to convince the viewer that their plight is good, just, or correct. When the inevitable betrayal comes later, it is not unexpected, but it also fails to carry any emotional weight whatsoever. There is really no effort put into a setup or premise, which makes the film's narrative extremely weak. If the viewers don't care anything about the supposed heroes, why should they care if they fall into danger? The mindset of 'monsters are evil and should be destroyed' was weak in the 50s, that golden age of monsters and aliens in film, and it certainly has not weathered the half-century after. Just as Van Helsing and his crew are not sufficiently heroic or sympathetic, Dracula and his are not sufficiently villainous or unsympathetic. If anything, because of the willful ignorance and hatefulness of the villagers, the Frankenstein Monster makes a compelling argument against the supposed 'heroes'...which is another moment where the film falls flat when it is supposed to have a more emotional impact.When the heroes meet with hardship, why should we care? They have already caused great torment and sadness for the supposed villains, and for no legitimate or justified reason. It also rather presumptuously sets forth that this bizarre melange of beliefs promoted by the 'holy knights' in the Vatican are entirely true and right, which is a bit much to take for granted, especially with a diverse audience.Honestly, few of the performances are bad in this film. This is a fantastic cast, and Hugh Jackman does the best with his very weakly-written role. It doesn't hurt that he's particularly nice to look at, but good looks and acting talent cannot help a disastrously poor script and questionable direction; it has been mentioned before, and accurately, that Van Helsing is essentially a series of action sequences barely strung together by the faintest hints of plot.The characters should have been more defined, and then we might have a reason to care about them, or at least to be concerned if one will survive the current encounter. With a running time of over two hours total, many superfluous and needless scenes could have been eschewed in favor of some modicum of character development. That this is the same man responsible for the generally enjoyable Mummy revival series is shocking to me, since those films were such a considerable step up from Van Helsing.CG special effects were also, as elsewhere noted, grossly abused in this. While they were quite good, they were overused and made the whole affair look too dependent upon the effects, rather than the proceedings being augmented by them. Any longtime horror aficionado will tell you, it isn't the effects, it's the atmosphere. And even though Van Helsing was not really a horror film -- more an action movie with Gothic horror elements -- it lacked on so many counts, ambiance included.Essentially it was as if someone had thrown a bunch of well-known features of well-known horror or supernatural figures and roughly blended them to create a film. The plot only moved by grace of the script, not through logical progression or narrative development, and it constantly contradicted itself. The characters were bland at best, despicable at worse...and those were the heroes. The villains at least had centuries of literary heritage behind them. But the heroes were unsympathetic automatons, spewing rhetoric that was clear the actors did not share in conviction. Still, the antagonists were not nearly convincing enough in their opposition and managed to make little impression themselves.All in all, this was a work of wasted potential. Too many irons in the fire made this a chaotic mess that rarely made any sense and never managed to be as compelling as it should have been. How is it possible that a 30-minute animated video tie-in got it right, but the 2-hour-plus Hollywood blockbuster fumbled it so badly? If you really want to give this concept a try, watch The London Assignment and give this a skip. It's just not worth losing two hours of your life that you will never get back. There are so many more deserving films out there.",2,3,6,4 July 2009
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Piece of Utter Filth
","As if the third film in the original X-Men trilogy weren't execrable enough, this one takes the only decent X-film -- First Class -- and casually murders the popular cast of characters, which is referred to obliquely in the film's first hour. This is done to motivate Magneto, since of course he's never experienced the death of anyone dear to him before. It's not like he lived through the Holocaust or anything.Never once is anything explained, most notably how a dwarf with absolutely no powers but wooden acting managed to capture and murder them in the first place. And of course, that character must not die, at all costs. Because we really want to save this hideous abomination of a timeline?The story is ludicrous, even for a superhero film, and it's acted and delivered about as poorly as one might expect. It's impossible to invest oneself in, and even the attempt at historical trappings are pathetic. Either they're shoehorned 'hey-it's-the-se-ven-ties!' references (which tend to be anachronistic anyway) or they're half-arsed, and that's being generous.If you liked any of the X-Men films, and especially if you liked First Class, steer far away from this. It doesn't make any sense (Xavier can walk but can't use his powers becaaaause of the same serum that turns Hank McCoy into a blue Beast?) and doesn't respect its audience (Pietro is reimagined as 'Peter' and is about as annoying as you could imagine), but more than that, it doesn't respect the source material in the comics or the previous films.This film does 3D well. That is its only positive. It has the distinction of being the first and only film I have not been able to finish in the theatre, for which I walked out and demanded a refund.If you are a fan of the X-Men, do not see this movie. If you are a fan of the comics, do not see this movie. If you liked the previous films, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.This may sound like hyperbole, but it's not. I have sat through patently terrible films, but they also were films without huge budgets and actors who should know better, not to mention directors who really need to hang it up. If this was the best they could do...it's time to just stop.",1,26,45,12 June 2014
Sinister," Fear is Predictable
","So stop me if you've heard this one: an ambitiously stupid writer and his unbelievably obnoxious wife drag their children to an ominous house where weird things start to happen. No, really!Sinister has its moments of tension, but it blows through them within the first 30 minutes, in which time you also learn enough about the plot to pretty much figure out everything. The fact that the film runs nearly two hours long is definitely not to its advantage, as it overstays its welcome and keeps escalating the ridiculousness until any viewer who had seen even a few horror films would surely recognise what a cliché-ridden bore it becomes.The supernatural elements of the script would have been better downplayed, if not cut out entirely. They made for an 'easy out' for the story, rather than tightening it and making it seem truly chilling; even The Ring, something of an inspiration for Sinister, did it far better by making the supernatural elements seem concrete and believable, a ubiquitous and inescapable threat. This is even worse since the supernatural pieces of Sinister are often comically or plainly not scary, unless the viewer happens to have a phobia of children in face paint mugging for the camera. A more interesting and tragic story is told in the breakdown of the author's relationship with his wife, as insufferable as she was and as asinine as he was. It's why The Shining worked better than Sinister, because the threat was very real as well as being touched by supernatural factors. And I don't even care for The Shining, but it did a better job of telling essentially the same story!Amazing how a 'nearly broke' author can afford a massive château, multiple times moving house -- with movers! -- within a couple of weeks, and still not actually seem to be cutting corners at all. Oh wait, no, they only had Chinese takeaway once; they must be *really* roughing it. Also, is everyone else in the house completely deaf? Someone not only shouting or at times screaming at the top of his lungs, falling down ladders, tossing heavy boxes around, and not a single person seems to notice? No-one sleeps that deeply, least of all children. Funny, too, how a police officer who was concerned about the author he was unable to reach on the phone all day about the danger to his life wasn't able to, you know, get any other police to go check on him. Especially as only the most look would easily turn up where he was. Unfortunately, this is just a drop in the bucket of all the holes and various other problems in Sinister.Its cast are serviceable at best, but they can do nothing with a script that makes no character likable, interesting, or remotely reasonable. The deputy -- whom I can only recall as 'Deputy So-and-So', which should tell you plenty -- is the only interesting character and is barely on- screen, but he seems not to fit the film at all and would be more suited in the universe of Twin Peaks.Ultimately one doesn't care so much about the characters or their welfare, but instead the investment of time in the film itself, and so when the inevitable, predictable outcome occurs, it's nothing but infuriating. It's not scary, the effects are not special (and in fact are more reminiscent of a very pedestrian attempt), and nothing really makes much sense. You'll find yourself angry at poor writing and a massive waste of time, mildly unsettled by the first half-hour and bored by the last 3/4 of the film. Really, overstaying its welcome is something Sinister revels in, and it's especially annoying in that it makes the viewer sit through every smug moment of self-assured brilliance that the audience doesn't share, which anyone with half a brain anticipated from the first 30 minutes.It's amazing how some people were apparently really scared by this. The scariest part of it was that the script must have made it to screen without any editorial oversight or revisions. Save yourself the trouble and just look at the poster, it basically tells you the entire plot anyway and you save two hours of wasted time that will just make you angry.",1,5,10,4 February 2014
The Witch," Good for a laugh and little else
","It's always kind of hilarious when they try to do a movie making witches out to be monsters. They tend to be either ridiculous slasher pieces or goofy fantasies of people who, either way, don't understand that witches do exist and they're victims of a lot of massive and extremely unfair persecution.And here we come to this movie, which tries a different take by presenting a period piece of a Puritan family, beset upon by what we are to believe is a witch. Oh dearie me, how hilarious this is from the get-go. We've got all the stereotypes here, and it's pretty embarrassing. But the most embarrassing part is the fact that the script is incoherently-composed, and the acting is either dialed up to 11 or sleepwalking.It is nothing short of amazing, and definitely worthy of praise, that the cast could even deliver the ponderous, dense lines as well as they did, though. Especially given that the direction was not particularly great, with extremely questionable choices on photography, blocking, and focus.But what really ended up the most questionable of all was: what was this film trying to say exactly? Who was this film even for? I find it hard to imagine that anyone would actually enjoy it except as a goof in October, when they're in the mood for a 'scary movie', but not too close to Halloween because it's just not good enough for a special occasion. It's not even really scary, it's just something to watch because it's supposed to be in that genre.None of the family is remotely sympathetic or likable. They all come off as idiots or phoning it in, until the time comes for their Oscar bid, at which point they turn it up to a ridiculous level of ham. They also do incredibly stupid things, like stacking a precariously steep, narrow wall of firewood, ignoring giant animals that realistically they would know are dangerous and should be handled carefully, and naturally -- as with all films of this type -- turning on each other at the slightest hint of danger or threat. Because nothing helps people survive being set upon by supernatural threats by attacking...each other...instead of trying to come together to meet the danger or running away.So I'm not exactly sure what movie some of these crazy praise-filled gushers are on about, but it wasn't The Witch. It's so incoherent, you can't even really be sure if you should be offended at the stupid and clunky misappropriation of the titular term. Who knows what was going through the mind of the writer-director?I will be kind and say that this might have worked much better as a short film, perhaps half an hour at most. At the very least, the feature-length film is not as self-indulgently long as some I've seen (at about 90 minutes), so even if you're as unimpressed as I was, it doesn't overstay its welcome as horribly as some of its type.",2,5,12,26 March 2016
Prometheus," A Z-Grade Film With An A-List Budget
","Prometheus is probably the largest-budget piece of garbage I've ever seen. It does an amazing job of wasting otherwise capable talent and proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that whatever skill Ridley Scott had in crafting the original Alien film was magic that worked once and once only.The only character played with any degree of aptitude is the woefully underused Vickers, portrayed perfectly by Charlize Theron. But like most all of the cast, the viewers aren't given a chance to get to know the characters except in the most superficial way, and the characters the script inexplicably concentrates on are the least interesting and poorest-acted, namely Shaw and Holloway. Vickers should have been the heroine of the film; if they have any sense, they'll find some way to sidestep (pun intended) and bring back her character if they do a sequel...which I sincerely hope they won't, but fear they probably will anyway.Michael Fassbender's David is attractive in his own way, but also underdeveloped even though most of the scenes revolve around him...inexplicably. He has an attractiveness that makes the viewer want to like him and be interested in him, but there's not a lot in the script for the talented actor to work with...and thus, we're left with only his natural charm, which is stunted in the awkward role, with a walk that looks constantly like his underpants have crept up the cleft of his buttocks.No character acts sensibly or logically, no-one has any clear or reasonable motivation, and none of them is given enough time to develop so that we as viewers care at all about whether they live or die. In fact, this is such a low grade of film because of its amateurish attempt at portraying characters; we simply do not care. It is impossible to sympathise with anyone (aside from Vickers, if only because she actually believes in taking realistic precautions), and the story unfolds at a snail's pace and then ends up never resolving a single plot point that it introduced during its superfluous length.The monsters are afterthoughts, and very poorly-designed to have allegedly taken advantage of Giger. The whole thing is a huge mess and proves quite ably that a giant budget and a 'name' director are not enough to save a plodding mess of a script that apparently didn't go through any revisions past a first draft. It's a shame that better films often don't receive the green light or a fraction of the budget that Prometheus did, and Prometheus still was terrible, fakey-looking (even in the scenes that weren't filled with CGI, despite Scott's claims) and cheap.I didn't believe the reviews could be right in how harsh they were, but this really is one of the worst films I have ever sat through, without exaggeration. I have watched films that were bad but tried much harder, and I have watched films that were good but had less resources. There is no excuse for a film with this one's pedigree and budget to be as awful as it is, and thus it deserves a harsher judgement.Prometheus is a turd, and not even a polished one. It's a first-draft, barely passable mess that isn't saved by its handful of good actors, because actors can only do so much with a lacking script, and even good actors flounder with a lousy director, as Scott has proved he is.Avoid this. And hope that a sequel is not approved.",2,5,8,6 November 2012
