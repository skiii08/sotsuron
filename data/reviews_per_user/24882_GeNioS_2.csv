Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nope.
","Not much here......to read people calling Lucas a genius baffles me.  The story is good - as always, but Mr. Lucas, get some help with the rest of it.The special effects and computerized imagery is amazing, but every human element is lacking.  Nearly every line seems robotic, and sometimes it doesn't take a line.  Every movement in this movie has been scripted and it shows.  The impromptu and the emotion that comes with it is what makes a movie go beyond the average and Phantom Menace has none.  Actors are supposed to become the characters they portray.  But, for instance, Neeson wasn't Qui-Gon Jinn, he was Neeson playing Qui-Gon Jinn.  Give me a robe and I'll be me playing Qui-Gon.  If Lucas wants to show me how to put my hand up to my face as if I was deep in thought (a la Samuel Jackson), hey...I can do it just fine.You want my opinion?...I'd say see it once, and then wait for HBO...oh yeah...I forgot...Lucas controls that, too.",3,0,1,19 May 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," I didn't want to see it, and now I know why.
",I didn't see it in the theaters - I didn't run out and get the DVD. But the local video store had a 3 for $25 special and I only had 2 picked out and so i CHOSE to make this the third. Wow. This is one of the few movies that met my expectations. I thought it would suck and it did.Read other comments to find out all the awful stuff. I would just like to add that if I hear that stupid underage kid yell that the 'war is over' one more time I'm going to puke my guts out.This movie is so bad that I was almost able to put it in the bad movie favorites category and start liking it. Find my copy at the thrift store - they gave me 50 cents and I think I ripped them off.,3,0,1,9 July 2004
