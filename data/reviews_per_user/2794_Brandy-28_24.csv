Minority Report," Uh - Right
","Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzI couldn't believe how long this movie was.  I watched this movie Saturday night (late) and because of daylight savings time (you know when the clocks go forward) my cable company was fixing the channels and time and the movie was turned off in hour number two - and boy was I ever glad.  Doesn't this movie reek of The Imposter with Gary Sinese (which was a pretty good movie) You know, someone accused wrongly, has to risk his life to find the truth.I don't know, I don't think I want to see the final 6 hours - ooops, I mean final 1 hour of this film.  Been there - wish I hadn't done that.",Null,0,0,7 April 2003
Se7en," Excellent
","My goodness, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time of this movie. I did not put the tape on pause once to go to the bathroom.  I was, however a little upset at the way Brad Pitts chac. was acting.  I mean, cops don't really act so unpolice like.  I mean, he had a hot head and he didn't always go by the book.  He broke police procedures all the time, breaking into an apartment without a warrant, paying off witnesses to say what he wants them to say.  And then at the end of the picture, committing the ultimate act.  I won't say what, but he looked to me like he knew exactly what he was doing.  He even paused a few times, which tells me he had a 'do the right thing' thought.  But alas.......",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
Fight Club," One Fine Movie
","I don't know if I'm finally loosing it or not, but when I first saw this movie - the final flash scene after the credits was the male crotch of someone.  It was just a quick flash.  I thought it was Brad Pitt, because it had that nice V shape to it and we all know how Brad Pitt has that V at his stomach leading to places of pleasure.Did anyone else see this - or was this just wishful thinking on my part.  I want to rent the movie so I can slow mo it and check it out.Come on people - send me a message and let me know.Thanks.Oh and by the way - this movie is fantastic",Null,0,2,2 December 2002

Billy Elliot," Outstanding
","I was pretty shocked to see some bad reviews about this movie on this site. I think the people who gave this movie a bad review missed the whole point of this movie.  Have you ever dreamed about something - I don't know like a excellent job, or the lottery or that girl or guy you've wanted since high school.  That was the essence of this movie.  Billy Elliot wanted nothing more than to dance.  Granted some people said that some of the dance numbers Billy was doing went that good.  You have to look at the dance as a whole. Dancing in not only what you do with your feet and body.  It's what goes through your soul that is the important thing.  When you wake up in the morning and dancing is first thing that you think about - then you need to be a dancer.  Billy's every waking minute was filled with dance.  Yeah, maybe he used it to escape his horrible upbringing.  But this only fuels the fire further on.I know this feeling, coming from a totally different background from Billy. I came from a very privilege background, but that didn't stop the fire in my body that I felt for the dance.  Father and mother wanted something else for their son, but I wanted something totally different.And so it goes, Billy wanted to dance because of that fire in his body, he went away to this school and in the end danced the lead in Swan Lake, with his brother and father watching from the audience with awe and pride.Excellent......",Null,0,0,25 October 2002
The Mummy," Calm Down
","Like I said before, you people have entirely too much time on your hand. This is movie is exactly that - a movie.  Sit back and enjoy an escape. You people are looking for something to change your life into some kind of meaning.  Please, this movie is about a priest that is buried alive and comes back pissed off.  Pure and simple.  No life changing plots here, just pure entertainment.  You get to watch Arnold Vosloo come back from wearing just his melted skin and bones to wearing a little chainlink see through shorts with a pouch in the front for his family jewels - too little Brendan Fraser running after him, with his adorable self.  It's a feel good fun-stupid kind of movie.  A comedy if you ask me.  This is really a great flick to watch when there's nothing on television.",Null,0,0,15 December 1999
Blade II," THE JURY IS STILL OUT!!!!
","I don;t know about this movie as of yet.  I have to see it again to give it a rating or not.  When I first sat down to watch this movie - it was pure excitement watching it.  I really didn't watch the picture, you know what I mean.  I just wanted entertainment - and I got it.I do however am getting sick of seeing the Matrix-like-moves being ripped off.  Can't the new movies come up with their own type of moves.  And some of the fight scenes look toooooooo COMPUTERY - you know what I mean.I have to see it again to make sure I did indeed enjoy it......",Null,0,0,25 October 2002
The Polar Express," Just
","I have avoided this movie for so long - I don't know why. So I sat down and watched it on the Disney Channel this past weekend.By the time the train finally arrived at the North Pole I was so excited to see Santa Clause I couldn't handle myself.It was well worth the wait.And I like the way Santa was bigger and taller than everyone there. That's the way he should be presented. Santa is much bigger and taller than you could ever imagine. Of course, he was taller than the elves, but also the adults at the North Pole.He had that commanding voice and spirit in his face. You just felt the love and happiness.It's funny, I'm over 40 and I still hear the bells. Do you?.................See this movie and you too might hear the bells again.",10,6,9,20 December 2006
"Monsters, Inc."," Man - This Was A Lot Of Fun
",I watched this movie yesterday (Sunday) afternoon and again in the evening.Boy - I got to tell you.  This was loads of fun and Boo was so cute - with her 'Kitty'.I have nothing else to say about this movie - except - see it.  You will not be disappointed believe me.  You'll enjoy it and so will everyone else in your home - Young and Old alike.Trust me.....,Null,0,2,10 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I don't Know
","I got pretty bored after three hours of this movie. It reminded me more and more of such films like Harry Potter, Merlin, or the that other Kingdom movie that was on forever last year.Pretty enjoyable film if you needed to get lost for a few hours, but that's about it.And of course, they couldn't just end the story at this one, they had to go and make a series of this film.  You have to stay tuned.  After three hours they could of told the story already and been done with it.",Null,0,0,31 March 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Okay
","This movie was a little confusing - but I finally understood it after watching it the second time. There were a lot of complaints about this movie - people were saying that it didn't make sense and it was a stupid ending. But if you really look at it - there couldn't have been a different ending than the way it ended. If it ended any other way - the movie would have to start over again with the original Matrix. This way both machines and humans come out the winners, and Zion was saved. If the Matrix had lost, all of the millions who are still plugged into the false world (our version of the world) of the Matrix would of died while still plugged into that world. This way - if they reject the fake Matrix world - they can become unplugged and join Zion.Choice!!!!!!!!!! Period. That was the meaning of this movie. Human Beings NOW have a choice - in the first two movies no one on the planet did. They either excepted the Matrix or were deleted.I don't know - you have to see all three movies back to back to fully understand what they were trying to accomplish.",Null,3,6,15 November 2004
Armageddon," All Right Already - Enough!!!!
","People - people - It's been two years already - calm down.  Just like so many others have said in the past and in the present - this movie is about FUNNNN.  And that's it.  It is meant to entertain - nothing else.  I have seen this movie probably 10 or 15 times or so (cable - nothing else exciting to watch).  Something disturbed me though.  I was watching it last night (again) and something hit me.  It just didn't make any sense.  Maybe this is why some people are saying that this movie does not make any sense scientifically.  Okay - look.  **Spoiler Warning**  Now a reporter said that after the rock crosses the zero barrier - the rock would take 3 hours and 57 minutes until impact with the Earth.  Now when the rock is blown up by Harry just seconds before crossing the zero barrier, the NASA person says that the rock and I quote 'will miss Earth by 400 miles.'  Will someone please answer a question for me.  This rock - which was traveling at 2200 MPH as said by Dan Truman - How would the rock take 3 hours and 57 minutes to travel 400 miles when it crosses the zero barrier.  That seems impossible to me.  The film research department had to hear this, just like I did.  What happened?",10,2,3,6 November 2000
Pitch Black," Great!!!!!
","This movie was very entertaining - Vin is great/hot/sexy/bad boy.I really don't have that much to say about this movie - except for one thing.  I really did not like William Johns one bit.  He was just afraid and scared of Vin - that's why he acted like he acted.  Plus he was high the whole time - I would trust Vin's character before I trusted Jones - because for one, Vin would tell you the truth without any BS in the way.  Jones would lie to you and cut you in a minute.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
American Psycho," Well!!!!!
",All I have to say is:The only thing worth seeing in this movie is:Christian Bale's ass.  That's about it.  This movie blew and it blew hard.YAWN - BOO - AND SIGH.,Null,0,1,30 July 2001
Dreamgirls," Wonderful
","I read a lot of the reviews from people who hated this movie because there was too much singing in it. Am I stupid or did I read that wrong. Wait a minute - maybe there is too much singing in this movie - I wonder why - Oh Yeah - It's a musical - Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Come on people - I'm sure everyone has heard this story already - every knows the story line behind this movie - it's based on the book that was turned into a musical on Broadway. Lots of singing and dancing. Give me a break.. I hope you people were not going hoping to see gunfire and buildings blowing up. If you want to see that - go to another movie.Anyway - I thought this movie was fantastic. Wonderful storyline, wonderful singing and dancing and ended on a good note.Now - for Jennifer Hudson - my God. 'And I am Telling you, I'm Not Going' It made me weep and the goose bumps were up and down my arms and my neck. I purchased this movie from BB so I could see it as many times as I wanted. I had to back it up a couple of times just to hear her sing it again and again. Powerful and Heartful - no wonder she won an Oscar. Ms. Hudson blew me away with her voice and of course her acting. Spot on.I saw the original play on Broadway with Jennifer Holiday and Ms. Hudson reminded me a Ms. Holiday. Both powerful voices and acting abilities.See it. You will not be disappointed. Trust me........................",9,2,4,21 May 2007
Face_Off," Calm Down People - Give This Picture A Break
","I mean come on. I thought this story was great. Here you had a cop who obviously worked a lot of hours, days, weeks and never had time for his wife or daughter - that's why his daughter was acting out with the wearing of weird clothes and going out with losers, and also why his wife was a mean B*%CH.In this household - his job came first, then his family trailed a slow second.As far as the surgery was concerned - it was something that was secret and not main stream - if you remember - the doctor said that his body type would change also - it would have too - John Travolta was much heavier than Nicholas Cage.Besides the fact - it's all make believe anyway - grow up and enjoy the film. Jeez - don't take everything so seriously.",8,1,3,21 December 2004
Ratatouille," Funny
","I saw this movie over the weekend and I thought it was outstanding. Very funny and enjoyable.There were a lot of laughs and a lot of surprises. You will be thrilled from beginning to end.I would watch this movie over and over again. The ending turned out very good and I was a little surprised.All in all, I'm glad I waited to watch it in my own home.Before you watch this movie, make sure you have all of your provisions for the movie, i.e., popcorn, dip, drinks, because you don't want to miss a single frame of this story.",10,1,2,1 June 2009
Aliens," Better and Better
","This is the type of movie I watch at least once a month.  When I've been burned out on going to the video store and when there is nothing on tv, I grab this movie, stick it in and get lost for 2 1/2 hours.  This movie is excellent.  The acting, the plot, the aliens. Everything about this movie is great.",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wonderful!!!!
","This movie was pure entertainment.I loved every moment I was watching.I didn't even get up to go to the bathroom, I thought I would miss something.The only thing that really bothered me but I got over it after awhile was Emma Watson's acting - it's was a little too much for me.  I don't know if she was trying too act stuck up or she just learned her lines before shooting the scenes - I don't know.Great Movie 9 out 10 *'s",Null,0,0,18 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," I'LL BET YOU
","I will bet you that everyone who is giving their bad review two cents to this board are wayyyyyyyyyyyy over 12.I thought this was based on a 'CHILDREN'S' book for 'CHILDREN'.So, I would imagine that the movie would be for 'CHILDREN'.I haven't even seen this movie yet, but I've seen the first one and I thought it was just a bunch of fun - you know - something a 'CHILD' would love.Grow up a little and go take your little son or daughter, or a little cousin, or your neighbors children to see this movie and save the critical rant for - what - I don't know - 8 Mile or whatever else is playing now.",Null,0,0,20 November 2002
Con Air," Hold On
","This movie grabbed me from the start, right up to the very ending.  The only thing that really bothered me was Nicholas Cages accent in this movie.  He sounded like he was really reaching for it, but couldn't quite grab it. It sounded fake and stupid.  But otherwise the movie was excellent 8 of 10.",8,0,0,12 May 1999
Signs," Fun - Fun - Fun
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch.  I just love how M. Night keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There were only two things that got me a little upset about this movie.  1) How in the hell can aliens totally take over the planet so fast and why were we not ready for them - we seem to be ready for any other sort of 'war' and 2) The way the characters in this movie were acting, seemed they were on stage in a play for the first time and seemed a little wood like to me.  It was like they would say their lines, blink their eyes and move on to the next scene - kind of bizzare.But other than that - great fun.  And I also enjoy M. Night's character. The guy can act too.",Null,0,2,7 April 2003
Gladiator," Yawwwwwwwn
","A great movie when it came to blood and guts.  But very typical and done many, many times before.The ending is what really did it for me.  I thought it truly sucked.After all the fighting and pain, Maximus ends up like that.I was just so pi**ed off that I wasted 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life watching this film, for it to end just like that.",Null,0,1,8 June 2001
Contact," Give it a break already!!!
","As with any major discovery on this great planet of ours.  You know five minutes after Jodie came back they were sending others.  The second machine was not destroyed.  Because if you remember, the President's Aide or spokeswomen (Angela Bassett) said to the James Woods character that she was concerned that the recorder only recorded static, but it recorded 18 hours of static.  Granted Jody Foster was only gone for a matter of seconds.  I think people wanted too much out of this movie.  People can never just sit back and enjoy a movie without hacking it to pieces.  They just can't remember it's a movie, based on one person's opinion - only.  Not true fact (as we know it).  So pop it into your VCR, sit back and enjoy thisM-O-V-I-E.",Null,0,2,19 April 1999
