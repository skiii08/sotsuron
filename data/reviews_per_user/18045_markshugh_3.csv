Minority Report," Spielberg at his best
","Steven Spielberg is a genius, master filmmaker and as such Minority Report should be stated as a blockbuster fantastic film, not totally unexpected to be so good. Those in the mood for the action and adrenaline rush of a typical summer blockbuster will find something to their taste here. Yet there are richer rewards for viewers who are willing to engage their brains. Anyone who wants to think through the mysteries and paradoxes presented herein will discover a multi-course cinematic buffet that can keep the gray matter occupied for days to come. Action fans have plenty to engage their attention. Minority Report features its share of shoot-outs, fights, and chase scenes, some of which are quite spectacular. As for the special effects- they are very good and serve the ingenuity of the script, not the other way around. This is a marvelous film that should be watched by fans and non-fans of sci-fi alike.",Null,0,0,22 October 2019
Chinatown," Slow paced and languid
","I don't know why this film is so revered as honestly, I couldn't wait for it to get over- but it never would. Really, this is the longest film I've ever had the displeasure to sit through. Jack Nicholson plays a private detective without the usual Nicholson antics which would have at least made the proceedings more watchable, Faye Dunaway plays a heiress who hires Nicholson, and harbors a dirty secret and John Huston plays her father and head honcho who is the epitome of evil. The story isn't bad and I can see why the film is so revered, especially when you see the ending but man, does it take its time to get going.",Null,1,7,14 September 2018
Prisoners," A great Denis Villeneuve drama with an incredible turn by Hugh Jackman
","Denis Villeneuve didn't debut with Prisoners, but it was this movie that put him on the map as one of the most exciting new talents to come around in sometime. Prisoners is about a pair of girls who are abducted which leads to an investigation and search effort by the father of one girl played superbly by Hugh Jackman. This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie. Cinematography is stunning as is the direction.",Null,3,4,9 July 2018
