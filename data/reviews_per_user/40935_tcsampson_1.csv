Hereditary," Absolutely HORRIBLE
","This is the worst scary movie I have EVER seen. I love scary movies and watch almost every single one. You name it I have probably seen it. This movie is slow, drawn out, plot holes, and BORING. Terrible acting. Do NOT waste your money. The people saying this is a scary movie are lying. There might be 2 moments where I was startled and it doesn't take much to startle me. I was so upset and wanted my money back from the over rated film. It should be a redbox movie not in a theater.",1,5,12,24 June 2018
