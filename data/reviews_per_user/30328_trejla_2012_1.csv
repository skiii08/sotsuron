Requiem for a Dream," Blink. I dares ya.
","I borrowed this movie from the local community branch of the Vancouver Public Library. When I was checking it out, the librarian looked at me and said, quite conspiratorially, 'Have you seen this?'. Replying 'no', he continued to explain it in one word: Harsh. Being a recovered heroin and cocaine intravenous drug user, I was at first stunned by the content, like someone had thrown the door to my room open at 3 am, during my own darkest hours. I wasn't expecting any of it, and every minute of it has remained seared into my memory since. I wouldn't term the film 'harsh'. I think it's beautiful and bleak and hopeful and sad. I live within the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, and watching this film (three times in the three days I had it) reminded me of why I got away from IV use.",10,0,1,6 April 2006
