The King's Speech," The Best Movie of 2010
","I can't think of a more perfect movie than 'The King's Speech.' It got all the 12 Academy Award nominations that it deserves. I do predict that Colin Firth will win as King George, aka 'Bertie,' the sixth, and Geoffrey Rush will win as Bertie's loyal speech therapist Lionel Logue, who helps him overcome his stutter and then becomes his friend for life. Helena Bonham Carter was fantastic and exquisite as Bertie's loving wife, the Queen Mother Elizabeth, who recommends her husband to the speech therapist, and deservedly was nominated best supporting actress. I'm not sure if she will win, but I would nominate her. Best actress win? Natalie Portman, the front runner for 'Black Swan,' an overrated 'artful' horror movie that I will not see, and many people I know personally don't like that movie.What I liked most about 'The King's Speech' is that it is not a pedantic fact-throwing history lesson taught by your average social studies teacher. It is really a very touching story that delves into Bertie's positive relationship with his wife, his daughters, and the speech therapist. When his older brother King Edward (Guy Pearce) decides its time to abdicate the throne, Bertie is the next of kin and has to step in. But he is not all that confident enough due to his stammer, so the Queen Mother and the speech therapist help out. When Bertie is angry, he doesn't stammer. It comes out more so when he is nervous. During the speech courses, many lessons are learned, and some are quite humorous as you will see.Then comes the big speech at the end of the movie. It's 1939, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain got England into World War II against Hitler and Nazi Germany. When you hear Bertie speak through a microphone, your heart, mind, and soul will feel warm all over. 'The King's Speech' passes the litmus test for positivity in every way. You don't have to be a history scholar to understand the movie. Let the history be the backdrop and concentrate more on the relationships and the wonderful feelings the movie wants to convey.",10,2,4,25 January 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," One of the Better Romantic Comedies in Recent Years
","'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is a romantic comedy that is less predictable than most romantic comedies of modern days. It doesn't have the old formula of boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl break up, boy and girl run into unexpected place and reconcile at end, which we have seen numerous times that it's like we already have seen the movie. Here, we are seeing a more mature comedy with some serious undertones and plenty of surprises. Too bad there aren't too many movies like this around.Steve Carell is most restrained and controlled here in his role as Cal. He does not overact or try hard. He acts cool all along, and when he shows his emotions, he does them more internally than externally. He is in sudden shock when his longtime wife, Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce rather than dessert during dinner. Emily is bored and just had had an affair with her coworker, David (a sly but restrained Kevin Bacon). Cal moves out and heads into the singles scene. Ryan Gosling, a very serious and choosy actor in his generation where most men act like boys and he always acts like a man, is Jacob, a ladykiller who gets the girl every night, but has never kept one yet. At the bar, Jacob coaches Cal on how to get girls and tries to change his wardrobe in the process. Cal and Emily's children are deeply affected by the breakup of their parents, and each show their own emotions of it without resorting to overacting.13-year-old Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is hit the hardest, and acts out more lustfully than his older sister, Hannah (the ubiquitous and reliable Emma Stone, a hot property of this generation and currently doing well this summer in 'The Help' and other movies). Robbie has a secret crush on the alluring babysitter, Jessica, who takes a nude picture of herself and blackmails it to Cal. Hannah, an aspiring lawyer, already in love, has an affair with Jacob, who doesn't realize that she is Cal and Emily's daughter. Molly is underused, but like any other product of divorce, feels the pain of a broken family. Another surprise - Cal has a one-night-stand with Kate (Marisa Tomei, hilarious and heartbreaking, and shows her emotions the most externally), not realizing that she is Robbie's teacher, and gets angry when meeting with Cal and Emily, which adds fuel to the fire of the breakup.All the secret affairs unfurl at the third act of the movie. All is restrained in comedy until the family reunion scene when everyone finds each other out. Naturally, happy endings occur. The only thing about this movie was the pacing was on the slow side at the beginning, but gets faster as the movie goes on until the third act. But thanks to a talented cast, Steve Carell, who some say is a 'junk actor,' doesn't get to overplay the comedy loudly. He is quieter, and he shows that side very well. If you are expecting his shtick from 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' 'Get Smart,' and 'Dinner With Schmucks,' you will be pleasantly surprised when you see his most mature performance yet. He is playing against type and real actors, not comic virtuosos like Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell. It's not crazy, it's certainly not stupid, and you will fall in love.",Null,0,1,24 August 2011
Knocked Up," A Knockout! One of the Summer's Best
","Director Judd Apatow knows how to get the audience's attention with sexual titles such as 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and this movie, 'Knocked Up!' He specializes in raunchy, foul-mouthed comedies that don't resort to external gross-out humor a la 'There's Something About Mary' or 'Wedding Crashers' with talented frat packers like Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson. Right now on my mind, speaking of such, how about a movie getting back Stiller with Cameron Diaz and she gets to work with Wilson, someone she never worked with yet. These two guys could play men in love with her, fighting over her, with uproarious results. Wouldn't that be a riot?But getting back to Apatow and his own style of comedy, he has a wonderful troupe of sarcastic actors - Seth Rogen, his real-life wife, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, to name a few - lending a hand to the leading lady, Katherine Heigl of 'Grey's Anatomy' fame. And like 'Virgin,' the themes are love, sex, family, and laughing with groups of good friends, something we can all relate to.The title tells all - Two yuppies - Rogen, an internet nerd accompanied by his buddies, and Heigl, a promoted TV network reporter accompanied with her older married sister Mann, meet in a bar, and without thinking about it, have a one-night stand. Both agree to keep the baby and become devoted parents. They are confused about how to maintain the relationship, and in some parts, are not so sure whether they want to stay together. But all works out, and baby is born. Watch for hilarious cameos by Joanna Kerns as Heigl's Mom and legendary funnyman Harold Ramis as Rogen's Dad. This is a fresh summer movie where the audience laughs themselves silly. You can laugh so hard you won't be able to hear the lines. This is my blurb - Get Knocked Out at Knocked Up!",8,0,2,3 July 2007
BASEketball," Base is More Like It
","On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball (1998): 'This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie.'So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior 'There's Something About Mary' in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. 'Mary' was a gross-out fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.'BASEketball' tried to outdo Mary, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of 'South Park,' Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing 'I'm Too Sexy' as he videotapes his will, Jenny McCarthy, who has little screen time as Borgnine's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by 'Airplane!' alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate 'Airplane!' humor and mixing it up with the crudity of 'South Park,' but failing in every way.To make this long 100-minute movie short, 'BASEketball,' a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee, is about two lazy losers (Parker and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house. After Borgnine dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly Parker, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, egg-throwing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy, who seemed to get over Borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of 'Riverdance' and 'Titanic.' Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ, post 'Airplane!' and 'The Naked Gun' series.And like Siskel, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out, then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!",1,8,20,16 July 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not Monstruous But Entertaining
","The friendly folks from Dreamworks Animated Entertainment have pitched in yet another cartoon that shall satisfy both children and their parents. The only thing is that as I was watching the movie, there were a bit too many adult pop culture references that could go over a child's head. Yes, many modern animated movies are layered both for children and adults, but as I have discovered in the Pixar movies, the Disney animated studio, most of the layering is kept both at a child's and an adult's level by not throwing in too much pop culture to amuse the adults.The premise of this recent flick is a group of mutated monsters, well, saving the world from alien attacks. There is always a reliable cast that gives voice to each character to match the personalities so you can think, 'I know who's doing that voice.' The heroine of the movie is Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), a sweet and perky young California girl who is about to get married to an egotistical TV weatherman named Derek Dietl (voiced by Paul Rudd). Quicker than saying 'I do,' Susan, who was momentarily hit by a meteoroid, grows into a strong, near 50-foot mutant, stomping on grounds and pulling objects apart. She is taken by the feds to a monster prison run by the gung-ho and macho General W.R. Monger (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland). She meets and makes friends with four other mutated monsters held capture there for 50 years. They are the grunting half-insect, half-dinosaur Insectosaurus, the oozy, blue, one-eyed Bob (voiced by Seth Rogen), the fish monster Missing Link (voiced by Will Arnett), and the small insect mad scientist monster Dr. Cockroach (voiced by Hugh Laurie). As for Susan, one of the monsters dub her as Ginormica, although initially, Susan doesn't think of herself as a monster, but as a human being. Anyone familiar with the 1950s B-monster movies would guess which character the monster is being based on. Small children may not understand the movies their parents grew up on.The monsters are all banded together and now the general, as well as the President of the United States (voiced by Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert), want to free the monsters from captivity. All the military talks are done in a war room run by the president in order to reference the 1964 classic 'Dr. Strangelove' to keep the adults interested, but small children may not get that as well. To do that, they have to fight an alien ship. The attack starts in San Francisco (and the scenery of the city is amazingly drawn) and then moves to Susan's hometown of Modesto. In Modesto, Susan is taken aboard and goes face to face with an evil four-eyed alien with a pointy head named Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson) and has armies of aliens who look like him to do battle. Three of the four monsters get on board to help Susan, temporarily back to her regular size, since Gallaxhar zapped Insectosaurus. In the end, the monsters defeat the aliens and Susan returns home with all of her friends to her family, now happier as a monster than as a human.Most of the character development revolves around Susan/Ginormica. Despite her gigantic size, she's too perky to be frightening. All the other monsters are well-drawn but there is little depth to them in their development. Also, these monsters have personalities too benign to be scary. The humans in the movie, the General and the President, are drawn to look exactly like the actors voicing them to remind us who they are. But Gallaxhar is the scariest character in the entire movie because he and his armies are so evil. The animation and visuals are fantastic, and the actors, like in many Pixar/Dreamworks animated movies, lend fine vocal support. I don't think this movie will make animated history like 'Finding Nemo,' 'Shrek,' 'Toy Story,' or 'Ratatouille,' to name a few, but it is a sweet and genial escape, and the visuals are what make it worthwhile. It is shown in two versions  2D and 3D. Either way, it makes a pleasant outing. It is fun for the family, but it is rated PG for cartoon violence and a bit of crude humor and mild language.",6,8,14,29 March 2009
Shrek Forever After," Indescribable
","Over the years, the megalomaniacal geniuses of the Dreamworks animated movies are getting unfunnier and unfunnier with star power and pop culture references; they think they are smart to lure unsuspecting moviegoers and families into thinking their movies will sell to the world and will be just as good as the first 'Shrek' or even 'Shrek 2,' which is sad to say, the only two good Dreamworks movies there ever was. Everything else is all the same. Get a roundup of actors. Draw them to how they look like in their human forms. Give personalities to the characters that match their acting styles, only to exploit those actors. Add some stupid pop culture references out of nowhere to make the adults laugh, and they never do. And then the movie rakes in the money, but adults get bored and think it's just another ego vehicle, and small children are too young to notice a thing.So is to speak of 'Shrek Forever After,' which they say will be last 'Shrek' movie, and hopefully so because it is simply the worst and worse than 'Shrek the Third,' where the series was starting to outwear its welcome. So has the dumb Dreamworks animation studios, and I hope I'll never see another one of their animated movies, just sticking with Pixar, like all other smart moviegoers. Adults and children all love Pixar, and it has never failed on gone on an ego trip even once.In my best overview, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese (who died as the frog in 'Shrek the Third, and appears in a flashback in the first scene), and Julie Andrews return, getting their paychecks, but little payoff. Walt Dohrn is the new villain, a creepy character named Rumplestiltskin, and he isn't convincing, just dark and creepy. This is without a doubt the darkest of all the Shrek Movies, with the darkest settings and elements. Bored with his life as a family man, Myers as Shrek wants to go back to the glory days as an ogre, so he makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin, foolishly signs the contract, and gets into so much trouble in his alternate reality world. He is not born, and Rumplestiltskin is the head of Far Far Away. The gnome has captured all ogres but Shrek. Diaz as Fiona, who looks like a warrior, is captured, and in this reality, she doesn't know who Shrek is. Murphy as Donkey tags along and jabbers as always. Banderas as Puss in Boots does nothing but look fat. The witches are Rumplestiltskin's henchwomen who try to capture Shrek and don't let him go, and like all the other characters, they are creepy.If you think that's enough, rats (not the cute kind rom 'Ratatouille'),slugs, and eyeballs serve as sight gags. A bratty young boy chants in a gurgly voice, 'Do the roar' to Shrek, in a cheap attempt to get laughs at the opening scene of the birthday party. Cakes are smashed.This movie was made in 3D, and this is the biggest ripoff of the year. I'm lucky I got in with discount tickets. Save your money everyone. And this has been the highest grossing movie for four weekends, but has the lowest and weakest box office record of all the 'Shrek' movies. Hey, I'm a fan of Ralph Bakshi's 'Wizards,' and this is no small comparison, but where one would think 'Wizards,' or more appropriately, his 'Lord of the Rings' the next year, was dark and murky, I thought 'Wizards' was hilarious in a Mel Brooks mode. 'Shrek Forever After' holds the record for the least cute, dreariest, and murkiest animated movie I've ever witnessed, and more so than Bakshi's 'Lord of the Rings' and Disney's only PG-rated 'The Black Cauldron.' Some things have to move on, and 'Shrek' is one of them after a delightful start.",1,11,21,6 June 2010
Ratatouille," Bon Appetit for 'Ratatouille'
","'Ratatouille', Pixar's latest animated flick, may not rank in the same caliber as 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Incredibles', but it is a tasty, entertaining movie that serves a touching message, like all the other Pixar movies do.If you think that movies about packs of rats are horrifying, then think again. Yes, you will see thousands of rats running wild, but these animated rats serve a far different purpose. These rats do not destroy mankind and eat people, and these rats are so benevolent. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), the gray, furry main character, is different from the rest of his clan, and is the most intellectual rodent of them all. Remy is so tired of scourging garbage, and wants to cook in a French restaurant after stealing legendary chef Auguste Gusteau's (voiced by Ray Romano)book, 'Anyone Can Cook' in the home of an elderly woman that drove the rat pack away with a shotgun. His father (voiced by the ever-burly Brian Dennehy) does not approve of that, and wants him to accept the fact that he is a rodent unwanted in the human world. His brother Emile, the chubby, brown animal, approves of Remy's desires, but isn't nearly as picky as Remy is. Like the rest of the pack, Emile is only too happy to eat any garbage there is.Once Remy gets from the sewers to the restaurant, Gusteau's, he sees Gusteau's ghost, which gives him guidance on how to be a great chef. You see, Gusteau died of a broken heart after the evil food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole voicing it with pure gusto)took away one of the five stars. Ego's scathing reviews can put any restaurant out of business. At the restaurant, Remy hides under the hat of bumbling garbage boy turned chef Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and Linguini can only cook well if Remy is around to pull his curly, red hair or gnaw at him under his clothes. Also at the restaurant is Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), the only female chef who is at first reluctant to reciprocate Linguini's romantic interest in her, but then they fall in love, and Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm), the venal head chef and owner of Gusteau's who wants to do away with Remy, his rat pack that invade the kitchen near the end of the film, Linguini's sloppiness, and market Gusteau's products as fast or frozen foods. And Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, as always, brings comic relief to his characters, here as the mustachioed maitre d' Mustafa.As the movie goes on, messages abound. For instance, Ego remembers eating ratatouille as a little boy and decides to give it a good review and then lightens up his dark image. Note that Ego is definitely drawn darkly. But the real message of the movie is that when you are a lowly rat, you can rise to your status, go beyond it, and your clan can too.All the actors are in fine form for their voice parts. Oswalt is humorous and affecting as Remy. Garrett and Garofalo don perfect French accents for their characters. Dennehy gets into character as the tough father. Ratzenberger, as I said before, does his usual Pixar shtick. Holm brings menace to his role. But it is the reliable O'Toole who really enjoys the part as the dark, brooding critic, and does the best voice work of all, outdoing all the rats. Although this a G-rated movie, I would not recommend this to very young children. Skinner tells Linguini 'Welcome to Hell' as he hires him at the restaurant. There is a lot of wine drinking, and in G-rated movies, alcohol, smoking, and the aforementioned cussing are not used in such movies. And small children may be frightened at the sight of swarms of rats and then dead rats in one sequence. I did admire the upbeat messages of this movie such as what it's like to be a critic or rat, and I am being a critic right now, fair, but not lenient or evil like Ego. However, the thousands of rats together can be a put-off for many. Still, a good film, and the best part of it was the restaurant and the drawings of the City of Lights, and you feel like you want to travel there and eat at Gusteau's.And hopefully in the near future there shall be a Gusteau's somewhere in Disneyworld, but don't count on rats cooking the meals.",8,3,5,22 July 2007
Bridesmaids," Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Too
","Throughout the years, gross-out comedies would revolve around groups of guys ('The 40-Year-Old Virgin,', 'Wedding Crashers,' 'The Hangover' and now 'The Hangover 2,' which I have no intention on seeing since I didn't like the first 'Hangover,' 'Hot Tub Time Machine,' and 'Dinner for Schmucks,' from more recent years) or just one girl who is the object of desire of many guys ('There's Something About Mary'). But now, there is a twist. The girls are the protagonists of gross-out.Raunchmeister Judd Apatow is the producer. Paul Feig is the director. They treated the ladies the same way men would get treated in gross out movies. The ladies would drink, cuss, tear each other apart, and would have so much fun doing all that.'Saturday Night Live' alum Kristen Wiig is the star of the movie. She is Annie, a young woman whose life is on the rocks when her best childhood girlfriend Lillian (fellow SNL alum Maya Rudolph) asks her to be the maid of honor at her upcoming wedding. Her love life is not so lovely and she lost two jobs. She beds one man, but has the eye for a police officer who continually runs into her on the streets and everywhere else. Complications come when there are four other bridesmaids on the scene, and all of them duke it out. Expectedly, the best work comes from heavyset actress Melissa McCarthy as the tough as nails Megan, the sister of the groom. There is always that principle where the least attractive actor/actress becomes the most attractive when they get the best and funniest lines, steals the show from everyone else, and no one else can be as funny or clever, not even the leads. Surely enough, the filmmakers are doing her a favor where beauty is only skin deep, and they are right. The other three 'beautiful' bridesmaids are Rose Byrne as Helen, who becomes a fierce rival for Lillian as the matron of honor as she is the trophy wife of the groom's boss, Wendy McLendon-Covey as the tall blonde Rita, an aggressive foul-mouthed stepmother of equally foul-mouthed children, and Ellie Kemper as Becca, the most sensitive bridesmaid who is newly married and feels the sorriest for Annie because she is still single. Lesson to be learned: Never take your beauty for granted. You can be sexy because of your brain.There are numerous gross out gags that pop up and keep you laughing out loud. But there is a lot of heart as well so we won't think it's just another rambunctious comedy. Due to Jill Clayburgh's recent death, her presence is the most bittersweet. She did have very funny lines as Annie's lustful mother, although she looked wan and weak. It was nice to have a funny comedy be her swan song for her distinguished and respectable career.Have a great time and laugh. Bring all your friends to see 'Bridemaids' and you'll be glad you did.",7,1,4,30 May 2011
Cars 2," The First Worst Movie Pixar Has Ever Brought In
","Up until now, Pixar could do no wrong. Hopefully, this will be both the first and last time with 'Cars 2.' Pixar has so far been the best animated studio for the last 15 years or so, and has never delivered a bad movie even once. They don't resort to pop culture references and star egos like Dreamworks has around the same time. But then, even Pixar hasn't been intact with 'Cars 2.' With this movie, the studio is condescending to the level of Dreamworks also with pop culture and star egos, not to mention a confusing storyline that can baffle the young ones. Still no matter how bad the reviews, and I'm agreeing with them,the movie will rake in business like any other animated movie from the 1990s on.What is wrong with this movie? Where can I begin? Well, first of all, the story borrows and rips off the James Bond movies during the Sean Connery era. Although Michael Caine has never been James Bond, he is sure suave and reliable enough to play any British spy, animated or live action. He definitely is the perfect fit as the British secret agent car Finn McMissile. His part is good enough, but he doesn't seem to intertwine with two of the original 'Cars,' the hero Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) or the redneck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who now upstages McQueen as the hero. Mater has the role as an unwitting agent and is foil to Finn McMissile and his sleek female assistant Holley Shiftwell (The British actress Emily Mortimer), and even falls for her at the end of the movie. Still nothing of interest. Second, the story is way too confusing. It's all about greed of the oil supply. The villain is Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), who wants to replace all of the gas oil with synthetic oils so cars can use it in a World Grand Prix in Tokyo, Paris, Monte Carlo, and London. There are even offensive jokes about the Italian mafia, something never done in Pixar before, and Pixar usually has kind, sensitive humor. Mater, Finn McMissile, and Holley Shiftwell join forces to thwart this dastardly attempt and restore the oil to its normalcy, while Lightning McQueen races against a new Italian Rival Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).Third and most important of all, it is rated G, and with all the frightening gunplay and violence, and literal bathroom humor, it should be rated PG. Some people would suggest it should be PG-13. Back in the day, there were numerous G-rated cartoons that should have been rated PG, and PG-rated cartoons that should be rated R. 'Cars 2' is no exception to the inaccurate ratings of animated movies. The only good things about the movie are the colorful artwork, especially in the Tokyo sequences, and the addition of other characters besides cars, such as submarines and a smiling plane named Siddeley, McMissile's espionage partner.I'm so glad I didn't bring any small children to this movie. There were no laughs in the audiences and the children came out of there asking their parents, 'What's it all about?' Original characters come back in smaller cameos, but their scenes really had no place in the movie. The actor doing Fillmore did a lame imitation of George Carlin, who died three years ago. Luckily, Doc Hudson, played by the late great Paul Newman, wasn't replaced, he had a small tribute. If 'Cars 2' had the same type of endearing storyline like let's say, 'Toy Story 2,' or 'Toy Story 3,' adults would have been fine with it. But no, it had to be like any routine animated movie from other studios. Hopefully, Pixar in the future will go back to it's usual style again because there is an adult audience for animation.",1,9,21,26 June 2011
Shrek the Third," Let's Quit While We're Ahead, Shall We?
","Like most movies that comes in threes, 'Shrek the Third' is a waste of time. Right now, there hasn't been an interesting flick during the first half of this year, as it was last year, but now I am waiting to see 'Knocked Up,' an original adult comedy amid the needless three-quels of 'Shrek the Third,' 'Spiderman 3,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End,' and 'Ocean's Thirteen.' The original 'Shrek' was an uncomplicated charmer. 'Shrek 2' was even funnier, adding touches of glitz and glamour with the kingdom Far, Far Away looking like a Hollywood Scene, and 'Shrek the Third' is a forced, convoluted mess. And for the first time did I actually fall asleep through bits and pieces of this yawner.Okay. So we all know about Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and swashbuckling Puss N Boots (Antonio Banderas) and all the happy things that will happen to them at the end of the movie. In the first and second movies, they all seemed happy working together, but now they seem bored and would like to just get together for lunch. The late great film critic Gene Siskel quoted, 'Is the movie more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?' Well, let them have lunch!In 'Shrek 2,' we also got to know King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews), Fiona's parents. They return, but Cleese is wasted as the King Frog that ahem, croaks, for hokum, so that Shrek becomes King. For more hokum, we get a new character, a nerdy picked-on teenager named Artie (Justin Timberlake, infamous for ripping Janet Jackson's outfit on the air for the Half-Time Superbowl Show three years ago, which Jackson called 'a wardrobe malfunction.') whom Shrek wants to crown King. Timberlake does not sing and his nerd image contrasts the Super Bowl image he gained notoriety for. Other returnees from Shrek 2 include Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), reduced from prince to dance hall entertainer, Doris the barmaid (Larry King, better and shorter in his cameo from the previous movie) who has more to do, but not so interesting, and the three blind mice. Regis Philbin has a cameo as Mabel the ugly barmaid, but his voice is muffled and unrecognizable from the Regis we all know and love on television.And if you think that's enough, there are more needless characters on the way. We get Cleese's Monty Python cohort Eric Idle as the bumbling wizard Merlin who unfunnily switches the voices and personalities of Donkey and Puss-In-Boot as a gimmick. Idle probably did this movie as a favor for Cleese, or was it as excuse to hang around with him. Come on, you two guys can go out for Bangers and Mash for lunch. Then for good measure we get Saturday Night Live and Secondy City comics Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, and Amy Sedaris as fairy tale heroines who also have nothing else to do but look good and act like Charlie's Angels (starring Cameron Diaz) in the showdown to rescue Shrek and save Far,Far Away from a takeover by the arrogant Prince Charming. The biggest gimmick of the movie are the ogre babies and the half-donkey, half-dragon babies. The latter babies came at the end credits of 'Shrek 2,' when Donkey's lady-love dragon returned to greet Donkey, and they were lovable there. Even the babies are uncute and annoying here, with belching, crying, and vomiting constantly.No Shrek movie is complete without a closing number. Eddie Murphy gets to perform Sly and the Family Stone's 1970 hit 'Thank You Fa Lettingme Be Mice Elf Again,' with the credits in the form of baby blocks, and only Donkey and Puss N Boots dance. It's more fun to watch the whole cast and more fairy tale characters sing and dance to 'I'm a Believer' and Antonio Banderas does a wonderful job singing 'Living La Vida Loca,' getting all the other characters to dance.So now, do we see what happens when things come in threes? Boredom, that's what. Even worse, there could be a Shrek 4 or 5 for the little kids only, and not for adults as well, like Shrek 1 or 2. Adults need to be entertained with animation as well, but now 'Shrek the Third' seems like kiddie matinée fodder.",2,17,31,10 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Why So Serious?
","Why is 'The Dark Knight' so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like 'Batman' and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds.If Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In 'Batman Returns,' also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's 'Batman and Robin' was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, 'Batman Begins' was just the beginning, but 'The Dark Knight' is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director.Christian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne 'Will the real Batman stand up?'All the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets.The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen 'Mamma Mia' as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen 'Wall-E,' which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But 'The Dark Knight' is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.",10,8,15,11 August 2008
The Artist," This Season's Best Movie
","If you like something that's different in more ways than one for the holidays, where the movie has real plot and character development, and not standard cartoonish violence as in many of this season's holiday movies, then run, don't walk, to see 'The Artist.' The movie is headed by two international stars who should become well-known to American audiences - French actor Jean Dujardin as the hero George Valentin, and Argentinian actress Berenice Bejo as the ingenue Peppy Miller, along with the familiar faces of John Goodman as his usual cheerful self in the role of the egomaniacal studio head Al Zimmer, Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's troubled wife, Doris, and James Cromwell as Valentin's faithful butler.The message of 'The Artist' is all about changes in our culture. Also, this movie, while maintaining its originality, pays homage to two of the greatest Hollywood movies ever made, 'Singin' in the Rain,' where Debbie Reynold's regular voice fit best for talkies as Jean Hagen's itty-bitty voice didn't, and fell for her co-star, Gene Kelly, and the storyline of 'A Star is Born,' where the heroine's celebrity rises and the hero's celebrity falls. For those who really think that 'they don't make movies like the used to,' then you see everything in 'The Artist.' It is much more than an all black and white silent movie. It is a tribute that makes the viewer think, feel, and yet enjoy its magical movie-making. It is funny, sometimes disturbing, intellectual, and the viewer leaves with good feeling and emotion. And that's what a great movie is all about.The storyline goes that George Valentin is a hot 1920s silent movie hero who meets dancer Peppy Miller. He puts the beauty mark on her and then she is a star ingenue. However, Al Zimmer realistically announces to George that the movies are forever changing to sound, which is true in our culture, and George feels disheartened over his silent film celebrity status. Even more disheartening when Peppy's sound movie is a fit, George's last silent movie is a flop, and George's actress wife, Doris, deserts him. George moves into a small apartment with Clifton, and his Jack Russell Terrier, and still more desolation ensues. George drinks uncontrollably, attempts suicide twice, and the only people to save him are his smart and loyal dog who knows more danger signals than humans, and Peppy, who loves George unconditionally. The predictable but exhilarating ending is a real gem that not only makes the viewer feeling good, but thinking what will come next for years to come. And finally, George is back in form in the next status, which Peppy adapted to right away.The last silent movie tribute was, well, Mel Brooks' 'Silent Movie' back in 1976. Sorry, but audiences these days seem to be more interested in a thoughtful tribute than a mindless but still always hilarious and timeless parody by our spoofmeister Brooks. Thirty-five years later, we get the real treat for what the silents are all about. Call it artsy and all black and white, but 'The Artist' is a thought-provoker that I would like to see nominated for Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor Dujardin, and Best Actress Bejo. I'm not the best at handicapping Oscars, but it looks so far that this movie may win for all its artistic merits.",10,4,6,30 December 2011
Up," A Very Up-Lifting Adventure Tale
","'Up' is so far the best picture I have seen all year. In a slow season of movies, and the year is almost halfway done, I am glad I can write about an outstanding animated feature that would appeal to all ages. I like this one much better than 'Monsters vs. Aliens,' the previous film I reviewed because this movie relies on careful character development and an interesting story, rather than 'Guess which celebrity does this voice? Pick out the celebrity's personality and features in the drawings and you'll know who,' needless pop culture references which can bore the most discerning adult film-goer, and violent action. That's right. The reason why Pixar animated movies, and 'Up' is the 10th Pixar movie, always do so well, I can say even better than DreamWorks animation, because they are interested in plots and characters, where most DreamWorks animated movies in recent years such as 'Monsters vs. Aliens' can border on vulgar pop culture and celebrity parodies.The visuals and colors are breathtaking. The story is beautifully constructed and richly textured. The plot brings out all sorts of emotions to us. It can be funny, touching without being melodramatic, action-packed without being violent, and we get to delve into the lives of each main character around.We meet Carl Fredericksen as a young boy interested in flying adventures. He watches a newsreel of his hero Charles Muntz, a famous explorer who flew on a giant airlift to Paradise Falls in tropical Venezuela. However, Muntz is accused of bringing back fake fossils, so years later he sets out for a real giant, colorful ostrich. In the neighborhood, he meets young Ellie, a tomboy who likes to dabble in flying around the world. What follows is a very poignant footage set to music of Carl and Ellie getting married, living in a house the fix up, saving money into a gallon jug in the hopes of traveling to Paradise Falls, but too many expenses get in the way, growing older, and eventually Ellie dies. The footage is not at all maudlin, but it does touch the way we all live.Fast forward to the present day. The elder Carl (voiced cantankerously by Ed Asner) is left alone and his beloved house is about to be taken away and he would have to go to a retirement home. No, he says, as he blows up all the balloons attached to his house and flies it off the ground on his own. Joining him is a young wilderness scout named Russell, who becomes Carl's loyal sidekick and friend. The two take off to Paradise Falls, where Carl always wanted to go all his life. They meet up with a big colorful ostrich Russell names Kevin and a cute dog named Dug, who become welcome allies. The conflict of the adventure is that they see Charles Muntz (voiced convincingly by Christopher Plummer), who is after the ostrich that Carl is now friends with. Aided by Muntz are a large pack of vicious-looking robotic dogs which bring comic relief to the movie. But at the end, Carl's dream is fulfilled and more wonderful things happen, even without Ellie in person.Pixar movies always have a heartfelt message, which is why they are always on a roll. The message of 'Up' is that if you live long enough and you never give up, you can always have your dreams come true. 'Up' is rated PG for mild peril and action.",10,1,3,7 June 2009
Rio," An amiable outing
","'Rio' is not terrible like more recent Dreamworks movies where the animated movies always have to depend on star power and pop culture references for laughs, but their stories aren't as convincing as those of Pixar movies. Like most spring movies, 'Rio' is fine for an outing, but it is not the kind of movie I would put in my DVD collection.The best thing about Rio is the colors, the realistic animated backgrounds of the South American tourist city which also includes the slums as well as the beaches we love to see ourselves at, and a few good musical numbers, including the song that goes 'I Want to Party, I Want to Samba,' by Jamie Foxx and Will I Am, who play two birds held in captivity who entertain the other birds. Otherwise, I would say that the story is formulaic and predictable, and we've seen many of these movies before.The story goes that Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg from the brilliant 'The Social Network') a nerdy domesticated macaw dropped off in Minnesota from a truck on the streets, enjoys his companionship with his owner Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), and has never learned to fly. A Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio (voiced by Rodrigo Santoro) comes to town and wants to bring Blu back to Brazil to mate with the other remaining macaw from the country, the independent Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway). They get down there during Carnaval season, Blu meets Jewel, but sure enough, they are kidnapped by nasty bird smugglers, but make escapes to various parts of the city. It always appears that villains steal the show in otherwise middle-of-the-road movies, and that villain is the smugglers' cockatoo pet Nigel (voiced by Jemaine Clement, who does the best work), who gets more into the action and smuggling than the humans themselves.Linda and Blu are separated from two-thirds of the movie. She and Tulio are looking for Blu, who is now with the smugglers and Jewel. During the adventures, there are friends who aid in returning Blu to his owner, such as a funny bulldog named Luis (voiced by comedian Tracy Morgan), a wisecracking toucan named Rafael (voiced by comedian George Lopez), and two rapping birds played by Will I Am and Jamie Foxx. Recently they performed that party/samba number on 'American Idol,' and they did better on that show than in the movie. Then there are ugly, thieving monkeys who Nigel enlists the aid of to find Blu and Jewel in their escapes.As stated earlier the story follows the formula of most animated movies. Couple meets cute. Couple gets into danger. Then then male bird returns to its owner, and marries the female, producing their own birds. Villains lose and get locked up. Note that Rodrigo, a poor kid, reluctantly works for the smugglers, and would rather be with Linda and Tulio, as he searches back for the macaws. He just kidnaps the macaws just for the money, but the smugglers won't let him get away with that.In my years of seeing animated movies, I have to say that the Pixar movies are by far the best. They don't depend on clichés and formulas, like Rio. Even the first Ice Age Movie, made by the makers of 'Rio' didn't depend on these elements. They don't look for star power and pop culture, like Dreamworks does all of the time in recent years. However, 'Rio' goes slightly above Dreamworks, but still falls into the predictability cliché department. The backgrounds and colors make up the most for the movie, but the plot and character development is just about everything we have seen before as well. Fine for an outing, but not one of the best movies I have seen.",5,1,6,24 April 2011
Toy Story 3," Pixar Always Delivers the Best of Its Kind
","If there is one animation studio we can always rely on and so far, has not let us down, it is the Pixar Disney Studios. Their movies are always played for laughter mixed with substance, sometimes we'll shed a sentimental tear or two, and while their movies rake in the money, this studio has more consideration for its audience. I'm saying this against the recent trend of Dreamworks movies where it looks for pop culture references out of nowhere and star power, and while they look for bucks, they are more in for themselves. Right now, I'm hearing that Dreamworks has run into financial trouble. Pixar has not.'Toy Story 3' is the latest of the 'Toy Story' trilogy and Pixar flicks, and it never disappoints. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are back on hand as Cowboy Woody and E. Buzz Lightyear, and apparently, these actors work so well they enjoy working together. The other reliable cast members are Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Pixar Good Luck Charm John Ratzenberger as Hamm the Piggybank, Joan Cusack as Jessie the Cowgirl, and Laurie Metcalf as Andy's mother. New faces include Ned Beatty as the evil pink teddy bear Lotso, Michael Keaton as the dashing Ken doll, and Jodi Benson (Who more than twenty years ago, did the voice of Ariel in 'The Little Mermaid. Time flies.) as Ken's girlfriend Barbie.This story takes place many years later. Andy is grown up and is getting ready for college. He doesn't know what to do with the toys and thinks about putting them into the attic box. However, the toys end up in a trash bag, and his mother accidentally sends them to the Sunnyside Day Care Center, where other toys have been donated. All the toys feel that Andy is getting older and he doesn't need them anymore. Woody is still most attached to Andy and cannot separate from him. There the toys bond with Barbie and Ken, and at first they befriend the tricky organizer of the donated toys, Lotso, but soon realize that he is in just for self profit. Once again, as in the other 'Toy Story' movies, the toys all encounter peril, here going from one garbage compactor to the next, but they always make it home to Andy.This movie has the most adult themes - separation anxiety, scary toys (in the first movie, a rotten kid named Sid had very scary toys) that may frighten the most impressionable young children, and an ending that tugs at the heartstrings more so than in the other two movies. You wouldn't mind getting out a handkerchief for this one, but the rest of the movie is still funny and sometimes frightening, but not to give nightmares. I'm always looking forward to see the next Pixar movie, but at this point, I'm thinking twice before I throw out my precious money for another bombastic Dreamworks movie.",9,1,4,5 July 2010
The Proposal," This Summer's First Romantic Comedy
","Everything in this movie may look clichéd, and you may have seen much of the same material from so many other contemporary romantic comedies – girl and boy meet, girl and boy clash, girl and boy get together under unexpected circumstances, girl and boy fly to town to meet boy's parents, girl and boy are about to get married, girl and boy have a fight and break up, girl and boy fly out of town separately only to coincidentally find each other back home and fall back in love again. But a winsome cast holds everything together and sustains many honest laughs to keep 'The Proposal' from being another formulaic romantic comedy and date movie.Sandra Bullock has been the heroine of so many romance films since 1995's 'While You Were Sleeping,' but here in 'The Proposal,' she gets to play a ruthless corporate witch. She plays Margaret, the tough book editor of a prestigious publishing firm in Manhattan, bullying everybody, including her assistant Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds, who has also established himself as a romantic leading man in many of his recent movies. Somehow, they are smitten by each other deep down. They discover that when an immigration visa inspector (played by Denis O'Hare) declares that Margaret's Canadian visa has expired and she has not renewed it, and now he wants her to leave the country. Margaret and Andrew come up with a ruse saying that they are engaged to be married, but they don't go back to Canada. He whisks her off to Alaska.The Alaska scenery is actually shot in the daylights of Boston and Rhode Island. Here, Andrew introduces Margaret to his parents (nicely played by Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen) and his spry 'Grammie' about to turn 90 (the always reliable Betty White, 87 years young). The women immediately take a liking to Margaret and accept her as part of the family. However, the father is more cantankerous and doesn't want to see his son fly away millions of miles from home with his bride-to-be, but he warms up to his son and prospective daughter-in-law near the end of the film.There are a lot of laughs that keep the audience rolling, and intermittently, there are scenes played with heart for good balance. No, this is not going to make movie history or win any Academy Awards, but it is a light outing for anyone who wants to fall in love, have a good laugh, or even wants their hearts touched. 'The Proposal' is an enjoyable summer romance.",6,0,4,30 June 2009
