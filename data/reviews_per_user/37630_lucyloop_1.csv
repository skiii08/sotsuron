Black Swan," Average, doesn't live up to the hype
","Okay, to me this film was very average to be perfectly honest. It was so built up by the media and reviews that I was really disappointed when it didn't live up to the hype! It's really predictable to anyone that has an ounce of imagination or common sense. I watched this film with five guys and they couldn't even rouse themselves out of their boredom to enjoy the lesbian romp scene. Natalie's character speaks so little and holds the same facial expression for most of the movie that I find it hard to understand why there is such an Oscar buzz for her performance. I believe the writers probably intended her character to be likable and we are supposed to sympathize with her, but in fact she irritated and grated on me throughout the film so much that the tragic (and predictable) ending lead only to a feeling of relief.",1,14,24,2 February 2011
