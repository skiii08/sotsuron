The Blair Witch Project," A triumph in original Film making. A+
","My pick for original film of the year goes to BWP.  It has been a long time since I have been so excited to see a film and boy did this one live up to my expectations.  In my review I would like to make several points about this film and the reactions of other people seeing the film.1.)  If you liked the string of teen slashers we have been forced to endure lately or you liked the remake of the Haunting, then please, do the people who enjoy good films a favor and do not see the film.  I have seen the movie twice and have been through two very different experiences.  The first time I saw was at a local 'art' theaters, that is to say one of the 27 theaters that got the film on the 15th.  This was a great experience.  It was quiet throughout the WHOLE film and the atmosphere in the theater was that of enjoyment.  The people there knew what they wanted and this film delivered. They basically felt as I did.  The second time I saw the film was at the local stadium theater after the wide release.  This was less than enjoyable. In front of me was a couple with a BABY! Behind me was a family of loud kids and and even louder parents.  They felt it their duty to inform people as to ALL the happenings on the screen and that the movie was boring.  At the end, one patron actually yelled out 'This movie f***ing sucks!'  This was not an enjoyable experience.  I was angry at the people.  This is why I urge you not to go if you are not ready for an intelligent, psychological thriller with virtually no special effects.2.)  I urge everyone else to see this film.  If you want to be scared, see this film.  It reminds me of the first time I saw the Haunting(original). I was so scared because I had to imagine the 'monster'.  I was left to ponder what was going on.  That was so frightening.  I have not been as scared in my life as I was after seeing the BWP.  This film is such a relief from the usually 'here is your cgi monster now be scared darnit' flicks.Now I'm not saying all intelligent movie goers will enjoy the movie, but I do believe they will be able to see it for what it is, original.  A movie with NO script, NO name actors, and all real human experience.  That what this film captures.  The human experience, and films that do it as successfully as this film are true masterpieces and deserve a second look.",10,1,3,5 August 1999
