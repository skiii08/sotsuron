Moneyball," A movie you cannot refuse to watch!
","Man, what is it between me and good sports movies? And did I ever mention that I love Brad Pitt, no wait how could I have mentioned earlier when I am writing my first ever movie review? But anyways, I am going to marry sports movies next, starting with Moneyball- one masterpiece of a sports movie. It doesn't happen often that I watch a movie with my clearest of minds what with zillions of thoughts running wild. But this movie, man did I watch it with a full heart and head and I ll tell you what, nothing can ever get better than this experience. A word: I R.E.S.P.E.C.T. this movie, I mean big way! No you don't need to know the game, I mean I don't, it is the spirit of the movie/game, i don't know, that you look for and that is what was served with a cookie during the entire movie experience. If you haven't watched this movie, then sure you have been missing a hell lot in your life/movie watching saga.",9,0,2,28 October 2013
Erin Brockovich," A movie where you meet a women of some mettle!
","When someone asks you to name a Julia Roberts movie, it is certainly not Erin Brockovich, you would go for rather you would advise for pretty woman. And by all means, this movie can be cremated(I'm a Hindu and so is she) for Roberts' performance but the question arises of why 8 then? Well, you might have heard that some books are to be chewed and some to be digested... Likewise, this one has to be digested! Why? The Story! A single handed mom with a weakness for troublesome romantic relations (to speak of the neighbor biker) who has the best of convictions and a passion to fight for justice. But, this movie is akin to what is reading between the lines in a book.Yes, the movie contains a deeper meaning and our understanding of progress, which is not always right for the best of both worlds. For what maybe progress for the developed may turn out to be a warrant to death for the developing. The so portrayed neighbourhood is a victim to the company's chemicals for decades while little knowing about it. And when they come to terms with the chemicals, the situation is grim and the result: every thinkable cancer. Apply the analogy to countries and you will identify what I was referring to earlier. Erin is hence no short of a messiah to represent as many as 634 plaintiffs and grant them justice. Someone for being what many would called on the lines of a beauty queen, man she has brains. So, this one was an inspirational story to me. And can only be justified with an 8!",8,1,2,28 October 2013
Hotel Rwanda," This one made me cry and cry I did.
","There are movies and then there are some like Shawshank Redemption which catch hold of your imagination and let you experience the pain, agony, happiness or whatever emotion they wanted to convey. Hotel Rwanda is a movie of that category.Do i give credits for this emotionally packed, high on action with a pinch of violence to the actors in the movie, maybe the director, the writer? I don't know. All of them have shown that while making this movie they were at the top of their game.I had never though Don to be an actor of such mettle or Terry George,a powerful director for that matter, but they now have given me a reason to believe what they can do when given a chance. And since watching this movie i am on a hunt for their other movies. I am definitely buying the DVD for this one though.An apt portrayal of the HUTU dominion over the TUTSI, a perfect showcase of the sufferings of a war, a movie on family, a presentation of the west's doings in the Africa and how easily it would evacuate those they are 'concerned about' without helping those actually affected, this movie will show you all.If a man like Paul Russesbagina could do it in such dire conditions, i undoubtedly think there will be anyone who won't appreciate it and to portray the same must have been a challenge which, fortunately,was excelled at.What should I say about the direction, every scene in the movie is worth paying attention to, a fact true enough because I didn't blink even once during the entire movie :)For those who think such movies are only for the weeping clan, I'd say think again since this movie offers not only emotional highs but many lessons worth keeping in mind and to find them out, go watch the movie as soon as you can lay your hands on it.I was surprised to find that this movie was not even nominated for the Academy Awards of 2004 while some truly forget-worthy movies made the cut, to them I would ask what were they thinking? In my opinion, I feel this movie is pretty under-rated and deserves a spot in the top 25 movies of the IMDb. With that I finally would say, the ones who still are confused to whether watch this one or not, don't think twice, just watch the movie already!",9,0,0,29 October 2013
Doctor Strange," Marvel needs to settle villain issues.
","Dr. Strange - 8.25/10 One movie I was bound to watch in a theater. I don't believe in watching movies about the time they get released for the simple reason that it would mean washing my face and being social. Needless to mention, the times that I have been to a theater of any kind I went alone. Same for this movie. The internet is filled with discussions and criticism about every possible angle of the movie, especially 'DORMAMMU, I'VE COME TO BARGAIN!' and bits and pieces of the movie are indeed questionable but for me the real stick in the mud was not being able to utilize Mads Mikkelsen to his potential. Now when I say the guy has a certain talent to him, I mean it. Though if you ask me, someone like Giancarlo Esposito would be ideal for the role; Mads has a villain-like charm to him that can be realized completely only when the direction is apt. Which brings me to my other point: Marvel movie villains are pathetic. One would not expect anything equivalent of say Ridley's Dr. Lecter but even 10% of him would be a delight to watch. That said I can only hope that Marvel takes note of this and does justice to Thanos because only God knows what a catastrophe it would be otherwise. Moving on, I tend to be biased 9/10 times when I have to review Cumberbatch as the lead or even when he is playing the duck. So, I'd leave out my critic with respect to him. Tilda Swinton shows some of her Only Lovers left Alive level performance in this one and full points to her, though the direction in the last of her scenes was not up to the mark. What I loved most is that Ejiofor has moved on since his 2012 days and started making adult choices when it comes to signing movies, The Martian and Dr. Strange included. He is also showing good timing skill. A win-win for everyone, I bet. Benedict Wong is one actor I have always adored and his filmography shows an upward graph as well. I like how Ejiofor and Wong have been re-cast together albeit successfully despite there being a lot of other options. Also, I guess movie with 2xBenedict is worth a watch, so I'd recommend go book a seat and enjoy your date with Dr. Strange.",8,2,4,6 November 2016
