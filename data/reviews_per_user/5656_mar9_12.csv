Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nothing succeeds like excess
","Well, was it worth the wait? It took 16 years between the release of Episode 6 in the Stars Wars series, 'Return of the Jedi', and this film, the long-awaited first episode. After viewing this film, one wonders what George Lucas was doing all that time.If this film is anything to go by, he spent much of the intervening decade and a half counting his money, overseeing the numerous video-game and other spinoffs and scratching various parts of his anatomy. He certainly didn't spend too much time doing serious work on this film.Don't get me wrong, visually this is a stunning piece of cinema. The half-baked job Lucas did on re-releasing the original three films with visual effects updates was a clue. Special effects technology has made enormous progress since the first films, and boy, does it show. Huge spaceships, myriads of computer-animated creatures, massive explosions, fast-moving laser gun battles, a high speed pod race, it goes on and on.And on and on. Style has replaced substance in the Star Wars universe. The plot is tissue-thin, just enough to string together sequence after sequence of visual effects extravagance. A good example is the pod racer sequence, but it's of little relevance to the story and the set-up stretches credibility - what, the queen escaped the planet with no hard currency whatever? No Royal jewel-chest? Oh, please. The result is an overlong souped-up chariot race sequence, from which the only thing we learn is that the young Anakin Skywalker is a genius, but we already knew that because he's building C3PO in his bedroom.George Lucas should have left his further exposition of The Force alone too. Apparently, The Force within an organism is controlled by mitochondria (well, Lucas did rename them slightly, but it's obviously what he's talking about). Alec Guinness told us everything we needed to know in Ep. 4 - 'The Force is in all living things ... it surrounds us and penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together' or words to that effect. But no, now it's dressed up in some pseudo-scientific technobabble. To make matters even worse, Anakin Skywalker is alleged to be the product of a virgin birth (Spoiler, okay, but really!), or maybe sired by some rogue mitochondria in a Tattooine back alley. Too much information, George.",5,0,1,6 May 2001
Billy Elliot," Cinderella in Struggletown
","A boy from the wrongest possible side of the tracks gets his chance at stardom of an unexpected kind in this feelgood British film. Set against the backdrop of the miners' strikes during the darkest years of Thatcherism makes for some interesting contrasts as we see Billy and his fellow children seemingly oblivious to the menacing circumstances that they live in. Some fun moments arise from this - the scene where Billy walks along the street chatting with Debbie, oblivious to a rank of riot police on one side, is a delight.Jamie Bell is the child star who does a good job of making Billy believeable. One bit didn't work for me - the scene in the dressing room after Billy's audition, I'll say no more, except that this for me was a device to artificially pile on tension in the film at the risk of credibility - this is the one time in the whole film where Billy behaves completely out of character. I also wonder what happened to Billy's oversized ears by film's end - it's a bit hard to reconcile Bell with the adult that plays the grown-up Billy. Oh, well.For mine, the best actor in this film is Stuart Wells who gives a riveting performance as Billy's best friend Michael. The rest of the cast are generally very good also - flawed, real people, no Hollywood mannequins here. Perhaps a bit too real - the Northern accents are so impenetrable at times that this film could do with subtitles. A bit too much T-Rex in the soundtrack too, particularly since one T-Rex song is usually too many. But minor quibbles aside this is an enjoyable film.",8,0,0,17 March 2002
The Others," Atmospheric disturbances
","The best thrills and chills are those inside our own heads. Everyone knows it but Hollywood keeps trying to outdo itself with more gristle, more gore and ever bigger vats of blood. Not the case with this film, which is almost a throwback to the ghost stories of the 19th century and the B&W mystery films of the mid 20th century. Revisiting that territory, in a film as tidily put together as this one, is refreshing.Nicole Kidman is radiant as Grace, the isolated, migraine-prone mother of two perturbed children (Alakina Mann is wonderful as the older child Anne, James Bentley is good too). Both children suffer from photosensitivity and Grace is meticulous in protecting them from the daylight. But all is not well. They are marooned in a mansion house (Grace appropriately compares the house to a ship at one point), the place is eerily fog-bound, the postman hasn't come, three new servants have arrived unexpectedly and the children are noticing that they don't appear to be the only ones on the house. Then Grace starts noticing things too...The most trivial things become objects of fear and suspense in this film. A face in a picture, shadows, a moving curtain, a door that moves suddenly, a bump upstairs, half-heard whispers, a piano playing behind a closed door, dense fog. The atmosphere is developed superbly and Kidman plays her part - when required, she looks utterly s*** scared. But don't expect gory shocks for there are none.",8,0,0,6 March 2002
X-Men," Live action anime, but why?
","Passable but not great adaptation of the popular 'X-men' comic series. Once the decision was made to adapt this story from comic to live action, rather than opt for the obvious path of creating an anime version, the question had to be asked: what is the live version trying to achieve that an anime can't? It wouldn't be the special effects - CGI is so good by now that live action and anime can produce similar end results, only the palette and textures are different. The answer must lie in the acting, in the ability of human beings to provide emotional depth and subtlety that animation and voices cannot. 'X-men' doesn't quite make it in this regard. Which is a pity, given some of the names on the cast sheet.In fact, some things such as action and fight sequences in this genre are still best done by anime. A number of such sequences in this film look like manga frames brought to life. It's impressive, but ultimately weird. The fight scenes are cranked up to such a bizarre level, with odd camera angles and exaggerated violence, that they look frankly unbelieveable. Particularly when no-one actually appears to die in this film, if they lose a fight they just get belted for miles out of the frame and disappear. If the camera happens upon them sprawled on the deck, they get up and wade back into the brawl. If it doesn't, they seem to just quietly disappear from the film. Odd.Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart have both done better work than their roles as the two mutant leaders, doing their own version of the War of the Roses (check the actors' birthplaces and your English history!). Much was made in Australia of 'nice guy' Hugh Jackman landing the plum role of Wolverine. Apart from a simplistic study of macho posturing, he brings little to his role, it must be said. My favourite from this film is Anna Paquin, all grown up and looking just a bit like Claire Danes, which is no bad thing. We first see her upstairs in her suburban whitebread house, her mom's piano tinkling downstairs (a nice touch and this film's single delightful moment). Anna gives a brave and layered performance in what is admittedly the most interesting role of Rogue, the mutant with the poison touch. A few more performances like Anna's and this could have been a great film.To summarise, the film does enough to pique the interest of those unfamiliar with the corresponding comic series to give it a look. But only just. I cannot speak for existing fans of the comics.",6,2,4,3 March 2002
The Beach," Nothing (much) new under the sun
","Leo di Caprio flaunts his hairless chest, eats a caterpillar and goes nuts on a tropical island. The End.This film about a dope-fuelled utopia hidden on a remote tropical isle off Thailand could have been much better. The first half is strong, and seems to follow a strong theme of travelling in hope being better than arriving. Robert Carlyle puts in a good but brief role as the crazed Daffy. Once the story arrives at the legendary beach, the film gradually unravels. Di Caprio may be a charismatic screen presence, but he doesn't have the acting ability to bring the story to life. The sequence in the jungle where he loses his marbles is particularly weak. Tilda Swinton, who is one of but a few reasons to watch this film, acts rings around him.Bits of the film evoke other movies such as Apocalypse Now, Dr Strangelove and Lord of the Flies. This would appear to follow the book on which this film is based, in which the central character is obsessed with films and video games. This works okay in novels, where it is possible to transplant things from other media to fertilise a story, but if it's not done right (and it is not done right here) it only makes the film appear derivative. The novel 'The Beach' was popular and very successful and this film would appear to be a sub-standard adaptation. Wonder why they changed Richard's character from English to American, hmm?",4,0,1,26 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An ultimately disappointing finale
","Until the overblown Episode I made its belated appearance, this film held the dubious honour of being the weakest of the Star Wars films. Which is a pity, because the opening few minutes on Tattooine, with the rescue of Han Solo and the demise of the repulsive Jabba the Hutt are terrific. This initial high standard is not however sustained. Mark Hamill is frankly wooden in what should be the pivotal role. Harrison Ford's instinct that his character should have been killed off in this film is probably correct. Carrie Fisher has fun in a gleeful ripoff of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, although the ewoks are just plain silly, looking far too much like teddy bears to be taken seriously in what is supposed to be a desperate battle for the future of the galaxy.2 major weaknesses dog the resolution of this film. At the risk of major spoilage for anyone who has hidden under a boulder for the last 2 decades and hasn't seen this film, here they are:1: Darth Vader, who among other things ordered the brutal torture of Han Solo in the previous film for no reason other than his own amusement, suddenly discovers a shred of humanity after all on seeing his son Luke Skywalker being tortured by the emperor. This is supposed to be the villain that orchestrated the extermination of the Jedi Knights. It will take hard work by Lucas and Co in Episodes 2 and 3 to convince me that this is not inconsistent.2: The destruction of the first Death Star precipitated an Imperial counterattack that harried the Rebels to the farthest corners of the galaxy. The destruction of the second leads to instant victory for the Alliance, and peace. Okay, so the Emperor was killed as well, but is this enough to precipitate the total collapse of the Imperial forces - are all those generals wearing those bits of coloured plastic such mindless sheep? Oh, they are? Hmm.Unless George Lucas changes his mind and creates Episodes 7-9, this ending to the Star Wars series of films must be regarded as unsatisfactory. His dilemma is enormous: of the 3 leads, Harrison Ford is now a megastar and too expensive to employ, Carrie Fisher is probably not interested and Mark Hamill is a wizened shell of an actor doing computer games, though he could probably be understudied by Terence Stamp if a lookalike actor is required.",6,0,2,27 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," World Plan Triumph
","Peter Jackson and team rise to the challenge of adapting Tolkien's epic trilogy to the screen and they succeed magnificently. It is entirely possible that this film could only have been made, or at least only have been made as well as it has turned out, in New Zealand. Consider the advantages: cheap currency and labour costs, English speaking well-educated workforce with a strong work ethic, superb scenery and favourable climate. Add to this Jackson's obsession with getting the details right and we have all the ingredients for a triumph.This could have been a pig's ear of a film. Imagine if George Lucas had got hold of it! Fortunately, the important bits of Tolkien's story have been selected and correctly emphasised. Middle Earth is a land in terminal decline, a shadow of its former glory, and it's a seriously terrifying place. Jackson shows us all of this, the landscape dotted with ruins, the most magnificent of these the underground city of Moria. And it is populated with frightening hazards, the goblins, orcs, uruks and other fell creatures superbly realised.Tolkien tragics might criticise this film for not adhering strictly to the text. What needs to be remembered is that the Lord of the Rings trilogy in text form is essentially unfilmable. Tolkien's dialogue is longwinded, his poetry is lamentable and he cannot write female characters. What Tolkien did give us was the complete creation of a mythical world, with brief and often indirect descriptions of momentous events. Jackson has distilled the best of Tolkien's creation, preserved the emotional core of the story, extracted authentic performances from the entire cast (Elijah Wood is the standout, but everyone does well) and coupled this with magnificent production design, dizzying cinematography and excellent special effects. The other great triumph of this film is that it looks real, even hyperreal, down to the actors' stubby, filthy fingernails and gashed knuckles. It is this convincing realism that makes this film stand out from so many other fantasy films (including the 'Star Wars' series). Bring on parts 2 & 3!",10,0,0,28 December 2001
Pitch Black," Sci-fi slasher film offers little that's new
","This film begins promisingly with a fabulous spaceship crash sequence, landing our disparate group of misfits on an alien world (actually outback Australia seen through some coloured filters). There's grit and mystery aplenty in the early sequences, but once the alien hordes appear, the film reverts to slasher film convention until the end. There is little territory here that the Alien saga has not already covered. The visual effects are of a very high standard, but that's not enough to sustain this film, nor is all-too-frequent use of the 'F'-word a sufficient substitute for dramatic tension.Vin Diesel gives a suitably laconic performance as the indestructible anti-hero, while Radha Mitchell gives it plenty as the ship's pilot. But they and the rest of the cast are just fodder for the aliens and the special effects. I wasn't terrified of the dark after seeing this film. Could have been heaps better.",5,0,1,18 November 2001
BASEketball," Live action 'South Park' and it works
","Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us 'Airplane' and the 'Naked Gun' series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since 'Bullitt' and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone's rampaging pair of Cartmans.In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the 'Naked Gun/Airplane' formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film. America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.",7,0,2,21 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Astonishing story, well acted
","No-one would dare write a novel as far-fetched as John Nash jnr's life. A prodigy, a mathematical genius, a paranoid schizophrenic, a Nobel laureate. With raw material like this, 'A Beautiful Mind' was always a short-priced favourite to be a good film. Well, it is, but I don't think the Academy was right to call it the best film of 2001.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deliver exceptional performances. I'm again frankly mystified why the Academy firstly nominated Connelly as a supporting actress when she gets enough screen time to be rightly regarded as a co-star. And as for Crowe not winning Best Actor, well... People who view this film superficially could write Crowe's performance off, dismissing it as thespian sleight-of-hand, a bit of hunching, stillness, some drool and hey, presto, paranoid schizophrenia. They would be wrong. There is so much depth to Crowe's portrayal. He plays Nash in the early years superbly as a self-acknowledged genius, arrogant but just a bit detached from normality, the accent just right. Then the years of Nash's illness, the terrifying delusions, the pain in his eyes during his insightful moments. This is incredible stuff, and Connelly is not overshadowed, she plays the role of Alicia masterfully.It is interesting how Nash's delusional episodes are portrayed as real in this film, which is reasonable, given that they were real enough to Nash at the time. To tidy the film up, a couple of elements of Nash's life are neatly excised - the mistress, the early divorce from Alicia and their subsequent remarriage. Nash's 30 long years imprisoned in his illness are skimmed over in the final reel, which to my mind unbalanced the film a bit. It seems rushed in the last few minutes, as if Ron Howard has noticed that the film is already quite long and he's cramming the last bits in.Finally, could it be that Ron Howard has constructed this film to draw parallels between Nash's life and that of post-war USA? Initial brilliance, unlimited potential and boundless optimism. Then a catastrophic fall into paranoid fantasy, stagnation, impotence and paralysis (for the USA, the Cold War years, culminating in Vietnam). Then a rebirth and recovery, slipping into comfortable autumn years with an acceptance of self, but at the same time an acknowledgment of the troubled past. As Harrison Ford said in 'Frantic', 'I am an American and I am crazy!'",8,0,1,22 April 2002
Amélie," Romance is alive...
","... but this film could easily be regarded as the category killer of the romantic comedy genre. There are very few ways that anyone could make a better 'boy meets girl' film than 'Amelie'. It makes the endless succession of Hollywood romantic comedies look dull and ordinary by comparison.But what a curious pedigree! The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, gave us bizarre nightmares and post-apocalyptic alienation in 'Delicatessen' and 'City of Lost Children', although it must be said that both of those films include beautiful romantic moments. 'Amelie' retains some of the surreal elements of the two earlier films, but there is a lightness of spirit about Amelie that sets it apart and makes it something truly special.Audrey Tautou gives a magnificent performance as the quirky, clever, but intensely shy Amelie. We believe that we truly understand her as she secretly makes changes in the lives of those around her, playing matchmaker for some, bringing unlooked-for happiness, punishing the wicked with impish glee, but when it comes to her own pleasure and happiness, we see her torment and feel her pain as she is unable to make that crucial final step. How the Academy failed to recognise the quality of this performance with a Best Actress nomination is frankly incomprehensible. I note BAFTA among others got it right.There is much more to like about this film. The ensemble supporting cast, music, cinematography, the curious use of colour (Jeunet films are alike in this respect, the look like no-one else's), the narration - just enough of it without being intrusive. I have very few criticisms. The subtitling can be a challenge to read at times and I thought at least one translation could have been better. This is hardly a fault with the original film, however, just the barrier of language. Finally, a small reprimand to Jeunet for reprising the classic bonking scene from 'Delicatessen'. It just wasn't as funny the second time around. Otherwise, great film, see it. If you don't like it, you have no soul.",9,1,2,13 February 2002
Gladiator," A cut above....
","...the standard Sword 'n Sandal epic. Russell Crowe propels this film in a tour de force of a performance, ably supported by a solid supporting cast. Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for 'toilet'. One of the most repulsive creations ever put on celluloid by an actor. Can't blame him though, there had to be something substantial to match Crowe's massive screen presence. Bloody good.",8,1,1,29 January 2002
