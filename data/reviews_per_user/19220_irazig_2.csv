10 Cloverfield Lane," Without the word 'Cloverfield' in the title, this would have bombed!
","I haven't written a review in awhile, but now I must! There are so many similar films about survivors after a catastrophic event that if this film had any other title, it would not be reviewed so positively. Granted, the acting is top rate, I love John Goodman, but after 'Cloverfield', which I loved, I could not wait to see this. I was shocked by how little imagination was used in developing the story! I was also angry! By using Cloverfield in the title, it creates some anticipation that what you will see will be different than the run of the mill films out there. Nothing makes this different than any of the multitude of films about survivors in a bunker and their interaction. Save the money and time and just re-watch the original!",2,2,6,31 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A waste of talent
","My wife and I couldn't even watch the entire film. About 20 minutes in, we looked at each other and asked - what's going on?? I have liked these type of movies in the past, but only when there is character development and then action/special effects built around the plot. This film was doing the reverse, constant action with little or no plot (flimsy at its best) and continued wise crack remarks from Robert Downey Jr.I was incredibly bored and could not care less what was happening. I will not watch any more of these type of movies and now find myself watching older films I have seen before. i just kept thinking - what a waste of talent and money!!! Certainly we can make better films than this!! Maybe we cannot, its' whatever sells that's important!",1,1,32,3 October 2015
