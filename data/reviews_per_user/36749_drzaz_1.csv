Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It is awesome to this 17 year old boy
","Don't worry I admit it, I'm a STAR WARS freak. A big one. I worship the movies. Ever since George Lucas said to Leonard Maltin four years ago that he was writing Episode I, II and III I have waited. So Four years later, after countless trips to Star Wars websites, countless viewing of the Original Trilogy, a night in line for tickets and the purchasing of various action figures I can say with a big smile 'It was worth it!'In an age where Star Wars gets backlash rivaling GODZILLA's bad reviews (which deserved bad reviews) I Dan Revill bring you the positive review of the century. This is a magnificent movie. A beautiful movie worth multiple viewing at your local Famous Players (shameless job plug) in glorious THX.I might as well say there are flaws in this movie. The dialogue is weak (always has been), Jar Jar Binks is sometimes in the wrong place at the wrong time and yes, physics does prove that Watto can not really fly. But that isn't the point of STAR WARS. Those to say the least are trivial facts. The magnificence of this movie lies in other areas.First off the cinematography in this movie is amazing! I saw things that I had never seen before on the silver screen. After the pod race (it's not childish) I wanted to jump up on my seat and yell 'Did you see that!!!?' The lightsaber duels were beautifully choreographed and shot. The planets from Naboo to Coruscant are to say the least WOW!  Lucas has taken a universe that we knew and expanded upon it tenfold. Oh and the Senate scene is awesome. Yes that was ET and a couple of his buddies hanging out there. And Wookies too!As for the story and characters, well they are there. Lucas has crafted a good story full of action, adventure, intrigue, humour, drama and yes-even politics. You may have heard that the talented actors are wasted in this film and I think they are not. You have to remember that this is setting up relationships with different characters for the rest of the trilogy.Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn is noble, defiant and brave. This is his movie and he does a good job of it. One of his best performances. Ewan McGregor brings new life to Obi Wan Kenobi who will perhaps be one of the most tragic characters of this trilogy, for it is he who eventually loses Anakin to the Dark side. Ewan is magnificent to say the least though. Now little Anakin Skywalker all Galaxarian kid. Jake Lloyd brings us a child who is heroic and gentle. It sucks to be him. As for Anakin's future wife, Queen Amidala, Natalie Portman plays the role(s) very well. She has the beauty of a Queen who is trying to do what she feels is right.This universe is also populated with other unforgettable characters including old faves and new ones like Jabba the Hutt, Master Yoda, Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), Jar Jar, Sebulba, Boss Nass and a girl with braces (no joke!).Oh did I mention the bad guys? We got them too. Greedy Trade Federation and battle droids! Darth Maul and his master Darth Sidious bring some extra spice to this universe also. Maul was not in it for much of the movie but when he is, it is cinematic glory. Ray Park did an excellent job of portraying a Jedi (a Dark one no less) in his prime. What  a tour du Force.I won't bother telling you the story because you probably heard about it or read about it many times. It's a good deal and that's just what we need. How does it rate with the original trilogy? Well I think it's up there but my theory is that you can't have one without the other so this is a very welcome addition to the STAR WARS saga.So is this movie for you? If you are expecting classic trilogy Star Wars then this will be a shock. This is a reinvented Star Wars. It's made for the nineties ten-year-old. IT was made for kids and dreamers and not pessimistic people and cynics. But to say the least THE PHANTOM MENACE is for anyone looking to recapture his or her youth. It's time to have fun again and remember what made the original trilogy so thrilling. For everyone it is different. As for me? It's the scene in A NEW HOPE where Luke watches the sun set. It is there where wonder and discovery are melded together into cinematic beauty. That's what STAR WARS is all about. Discovery.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
