The Benchwarmers," That was crap.
","Seriously. Don't even bother to open the box, put the disc in the drawer, and find the remote. You're wasting your time. This movie, if you can call it that, at 1 hour and 20 minutes is a huge waste of your life you'll never get back..and you'll always regret it. Look at it this way. My 10 year old told me straight out he'd rather go to bed early then watch the rest of the movie. It was crap. The dialogue was slow, unfunny, clichÃ©d, and panders only to dim, nose picking autistic children. If you have half a brain in your head, do not watch this movie. I swear, it was written by some studio execs girlfriend, and looks like a cable access program.",1,1,2,15 July 2006
Argo," What a load of sh*t
","I can't believe how this piece of garbage has been hyped. It's a revisionist hunk of crap that only shows how out of touch Hollywood and the American public really are. The main character, Tony Mendez, was in Iran for 1 and half days. It was the Canadians who created the background story. It was the Canadians who issued the passports. It was Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor that took ALL of the risks. Yet, Ben Affleck seems to think if you tell a lie long enough and to enough stupid people, they'll believe it. After the fiasco that was U-571, you'd think Hollywood would have the decency not to go about spreading such misleading information. Apparently not. I'd give ARGO a zero if it were possible. It's disappointing that it's nominated for an Oscar. Argo - And Ben Affleck - You suck.",1,253,404,24 February 2013
