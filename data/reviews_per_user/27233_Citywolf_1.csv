Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas should be ashamed of himself
","I hear Lucas delayed making this movie, until the current technology would allow him to fully express his vision. Well, apparently Lucas got so lost in playing with all his new special FX toys, he forgot to include little things like plot and characterization.   I was interested in none of the characters or what they were doing. A perfect example of this is Darth Maul.  What I really loved about the other movies was that Darth Vader was a true villain whom we could also get to know and understand.  For Darth Maul, however, Lucas seems to have just hired a martial artist, thrown him in a neat costume, and told him to jump around, look cool, and keep your mouth shut.",1,0,1,20 May 1999
