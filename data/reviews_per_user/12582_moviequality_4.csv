The Expendables 2," great action treat from Hollywood legends
","All your childhood action heroes coming together on screen and still managing to kick some bad asses at their ages, Its great to see that. Most of them have grown old and in the movie they take digs at themselves,which quite adds light humour quotient to it. The explosions, car stunts, airplane bombardments are all good to watch. The movie manages to engross you with this non stop action and story flow with lots of gun fires and fist clinching punches.Expect classic action and not too much from this movie. The starting action sequence is great where the Sylvester and group enter the heavily guarded enemy camp in Nepal. Van Damme is the villain and one you don't want to mess with. Arnold gets applause from audience with each of his screen entrances. Rest all are good and are there to wreak havoc on the enemies.",7,2,4,28 August 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Brilliant mix of sensitivity and comedy
","It is a movie which has shown love in all forms, that is why the title. Love is crazy and stupid. From the middle aged character of Steve Carell to the love story of his son of about 13 yr old. The movie has many layers of stories in it. Steve Carell gets to know that his wife needs a divorce in the first scene of the movie. Then on the movie starts about what he does trying to raise two kids alongside. Ryan helps him shred his old style geeky look and helps him to get a makeover. I will not divulge any more details as it is better you watch the movie without any more pointers from the reviews.The comedy element is kept alive through out the film by its wonderful screenplay,also giving it a heart and touchy feel when needed. The huge star cast of brilliant actors all holding there own in this must watch romantic comedy of this year 2011.",Null,0,1,26 September 2011
Drive," A Stanley Kubrick movie
","The make and look of the film is different from any action or thriller movie you would have seen in recent times. If you are looking for some action and cheap thriller this is more than that.Ryan is a stunt performer cum mechanic also a driver to robbers some nights.Ryan finds himself attracted and infatuated to his neighboring married lady Carey, whose husband is in jail. Both are quite attracted to each other. He seems genuinely interested but it takes a turn when her husband returns from jail. The movie moves slowly taking you through the mind and situations of the characters. But the point is with very little dialogues from the characters. If you have seen 2001: A space odyssey by Kubrick, then you know how a movie can be interesting with few words in it. Its a good watch but i felt a few more dramatic dialogue sequences would do this movie a favour. If you like Kubrick you will like this.Ryan and everybody else has done a good performance. But the direction overtakes everything in this film, in a good way I mean.",Null,1,3,8 October 2011
The Bourne Legacy," mindless timepass
","People who have watched Bourne series and expect the same kind of fast paced action and drama. This film will disappoint if you go with that thought. But if you watch the movie just to spend a good time and don't expect much then its a good movie to watch once. The movie doesn't have the fast pace and at the beginning it goes so slow that you wonder if this movie title had 'Bourne' in it. There are some dialogues in the movie which take the story nowhere, you wish they got to the point directly. The director of the movie is changed so should the title so that people don't expect much from this movie. Jeremy Renner does a good act and recently has come up as the new action hero.",6,5,9,15 August 2012
