Lucky Number Slevin," A superb stylised film!
","I saw Lucky Number Slevin in the cinema and now have the DVD. This film is probably one of the most enjoyable films I have seen all year. The film has style, story and acting. Even though it has had many critical slating's I don't think it actually deserved them. The film is beautifully shot with artistic style and stylised costumes and sets. The music adds to this style successfully. The acting is also superb. Freeman and Kingsley make an excellent performance that is widely different to anything they have done before. Willis is excellent as the super intense Mr Goodkat. Liu is also very good at adding comedy to the film. However the best cast member was Josh Hartnett who played both the comic and noir lead convinceingly. The story is the film's greatest strength with a clever plot that keeps you guessing. Although you can guess the ultimate ending about ten minutes in, how you get to that point is tough to work out. It is also very clever by turning from a comedy into a dark drama without you even noticing.",10,4,8,14 July 2006
