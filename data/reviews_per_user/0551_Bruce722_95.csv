Moneyball," Exceptional film.
","Moneyball was an exceptional movie and one of the best sports movies in recent years. Brad Pitt's supreme acting ability carries this film but the plot is also very interesting. Being a sports fan, I was familiar with most of the content in the film but what was most interesting, to me at least, was seeing how wrong so many 'experts' were and how people refuse to learn from their prior mistakes. Look across the professional sports world and you still see people making the same mistakes that Billy Beane fought against a little over a decade ago. Nonetheless, the movie, though long, was not boring at all and I think most people would enjoy watching it, even those who are not baseball fans. Ultimately I think that's something unique about this film. Yes, it is a sports movie but it isn't necessarily about the sport of baseball but rather one person's fight against the prehistoric culture of baseball. That journey, and how well Bennett Miller directed the movie, is what is truly worth watching. RIP fat Jonah Hill... you will be missed.",8,3,4,19 January 2013
The Avengers," Simply put... MARVELOUS!
","I'm not gonna lie, this movie was absolutely amazing! Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that. All in all, if you like superhero movies, action movies, or just kick ass movies in general, you should like this movie too.",10,5,11,12 May 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Decent but it needed to be completed.
","While still a good movie, Mockingjay Part 1 was clearly only a portion of a story and the actual film suffered for it. Everything about the movie was done really well. The special effects and action sequences were top notch and the continually increased budget is evident here especially. The acting was fantastic and the setting was detailed and felt incredibly real. Even all of the little emotional elements delivered perfectly. The real problem is that, as I previously mentioned, it's only half of a story. The movie builds to something that never really occurs and the void in action will be even more obvious when the extreme action in the next film comes to fruition. Yes, I understand that the Lord of the Rings films do something similar. The difference is that those films manage to build towards their individual climax without actually failing to develop the overall story arc. I think Francis Lawrence tried to accomplish that with this film but the source material wasn't made for that to be done, where as the Lord of the Rings movies were. Mockingjay Part 1 is still a good film and ultimately will be incredibly important in setting the stage for what should be the best film of the franchise but it is still incomplete.",7,14,33,30 November 2014
Men in Black 3," The MIB sequel we've all been waiting for.
","Now this is the sequel I think we were all waiting for. Will Smith plays Agent J as great as ever but the real surprise here is what an amazing job Josh Brolin does at emulating Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. The add the incredibly interesting plot and this movie was just fantastic. Previews show how J must travel back in time to save K so that's no spoiler. However, the way the story was written was absolutely genius and the way the plot unfolds is even better. I didn't like how J continues to play the 'punching bag' of sorts, even though he is now a senior agent. I think that hurts the progression of the characters some. However, the character development in this film actually goes pretty deep into their histories and the relationship between J and K gets a lot of 'meat' added to it which I enjoyed. Overall, I didn't think it was quite as entertaining as the first but it was a great sequel. Now if I can just get a neuralizer to erase Men In Black II from my memory...",8,0,2,16 December 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Very well done!
","Though I'm not a big fan of Edward Norton he does a great job in this movie. It's darker and more emotional and dramatic than most superhero movies and I think that fits in well with the Bruce Banner tragic story. Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend 'Stanley' being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic. That fight is being hyped up the entire film and I just didn't think it was that great. Nonetheless, this was an outstanding movie and most people would enjoy it.",9,5,7,26 May 2013
The Equalizer," Decent but failed to live up to its potential.
","I had high hopes for this movie and, while it largely lived up to them, I felt there were some glaring flaws that could've easily been avoided, which would've resulted in a superior film. For one, Antoine Fuqua did a mediocre job with the directing role. It almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life, found a list of all the cool camera tricks, angles, and cinematic effects, and felt compelled to include each and every one of them. How did this impact the movie? It made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever. Secondly, there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make. That, combined with the plot getting a little out of hand, made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow. It wasn't all bad, however, as the rating should reflect. The acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well. The build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too. Unfortunately this film suffered from having a director who wanted to do everything instead of making a great movie.",6,1,1,24 October 2015
The Expendables 2," Good but not as good as the first.
","The Expendables 2 has a bunch of explosions, realistic hand-to-hand fight sequences, and guns and gore galore just like the first movie did. However, this sequel did some things better and some things worse. Looking at the good side first, it did actually have a little big better plot development and believe it or not, even more action heroes. Adding Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme to an already loaded cast and then having Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger each get more screen time were all plusses. All of the little inside jokes were absolutely hilarious, as well. The Arnie one-liners, Die Hard references and Chuck Norris jokes were fun little easter eggs for long time action fans. The problem is that this film somehow found a way to have even less character development than the first film, feeling somehow even more shallow. I actually really missed Mickey Rourke's character in this sequel. I thought he added so much to the first film in how he seemed to humanize the cast, especially Stallone's character. I suppose you could argue that Liam Hemsworth's character does that instead but I don't think there should necessarily be a limit on depth. And while those little nods to the 80's were funny, they actually took away from the seriousness of the film. Seeing Rambo, the Terminator, and John McClane all shooting bad guys side-by-side may have seemed awesome but there was simply too much of the over-the-top element in this movie. I felt the first film found the perfect balance between giving each action hero their due while staying true to making a great movie. This film, unfortunately felt like a parody of the first at times, rather than its own movie.",7,0,0,24 February 2015
Skyfall," One of the best Bond films ever.
","This movie was absolutely fantastic. Daniel Craig once again shows why he's the best James Bond ever. He's has all of the charisma of any of the past Bonds but has a grit to him that allows the movies to be a bit darker and more realistic. While I didn't enjoy Skyfall quite as much as Casino Royale, it was still much better than Quantum of Solace and is probably my second favorite Bond movie ever. I liked that they added depth to M and touched on some of the political element to MI6. I was a bit disappointed that Berenice Marlohe wasn't featured more. I've been hearing for the past month what a beautiful and fantastic Bond-girl she is and, while she is stunning, she was barely in the film at all. Overall, it's a great movie and more than just Bond fans will enjoy it. On a side note, since everyone seems to be mentioned Adele, I will also... she's awesome and her opening song to the movie is the perfect Bond track, lol.",9,15,30,10 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Great movie with tons of action and humor.
","I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Iron Man 3 so I was a little concerned going into the theater. However, in my opinion the movie was outstanding. The cast and characters were fantastic just like the first two and the plot developed well and, unlike the first two, didn't have so many plot holes. The villain was thankfully not a robot and had some depth as well, which was one of the biggest things Iron Man 2 lacked. There was also plenty of humor, actually, there was more humor than the first two combined and almost all of it felt well timed and fit into the flow of the film. There were a few jokes or quips that felt forced but for the most part there were a lot of laughs to go around. The only real area of weakness for the movie were the overpowered villains. *SPOILER* The villains were so OP it made watching certain battle sequences a little ridiculous. It shouldn't take several Mark suits to take out one of the villains henchmen. And like in the second film, their powers have a limited range (whip in part 2, the need to touch you in this one) so them being capable of going toe-to-toe, let alone overtake a Mark suit was kind of a joke. Nonetheless, the movie was fantastic and these weaker elements, while they sound like a big deal here, are really easy to look past.",9,1,3,25 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Overrated.
","This movie was just about what I expected in some ways but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype in others. First with the good stuff, it was exactly what I thought in terms of actions sequences, whip cracks, and archaeological hunts. Those things were the strong elements of the film in my opinion. There were also plenty of funny scenes and the effects, while terrible in today's standards, were pretty darn good for a 30+ year-old film. The reason this movie rated so low, however, is for the few negative parts. Things like the fact that the Indiana Jones character might be the dumbest protagonist in action film history for example. Or the corny scenes that mar so many films of that era. I honestly don't know what people were thinking back then to enjoy such tomfoolery. The other things that hurt the film weren't as major. The mystical/supernatural element was unfortunate but that's more of a personal thing. I tend to zone out when ridiculous stuff comes on the screen in supposedly realistic settings. The acting also wasn't great but it wasn't all that bad either. I was disappointing though in the lack of charisma from Harrison Ford during the movie. The same guy who managed to turn a douche bag smuggler in the Star Wars saga into a fan favorite didn't have much opportunity to do the same here. I mainly blame the writing and directing. Still, the movie was enjoyable and I look forward to seeing the next two being that I've heard the series gets substantially better after the first one.",6,0,5,31 August 2012
Minority Report," Entertaining and creative film.
","Minority Report is one of the most unique films I've seen. Tom Cruise stars in his role as John Anderton, lead officer in Washington, D.C.'s pre-crime division set in the mid-21st century. 'Pre-crime' is a concept that revolves around the ability to stop murders before they happen thanks to three 'precogs' and their ability to see into the future. This is an inherently controversial way to 'solve' crime but is largely accepted because it seems perfect considering that no murders had been committed in the six year experiment. The conflict is introduced when Cruise finds out that he is the next expected murderer. This puts him on the run from the division he once led and on an investigation to find out how he is supposedly going to murder someone he's never met. The action isn't overdone but rather placed well throughout the film. The combat sequences could've been better but they were still enjoyable. A few of the plot points were a little weak also but there weren't actual holes or anything. The acting was solid with Cruise and a supporting cast of Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow among others. The best part of the film, though, was the interesting plot. Even with the few weak parts it's just a very interesting story that develops nicely. Many movies struggle with the concept of the future being predicted but Minority Report does a great job and is very entertaining.",8,0,1,30 June 2013
John Wick," Not much there but it is fun to watch.
","If you're asking me if John Wick is entertaining, the answer would be a resounding 'yes'. The action is fantastic throughout most of the film, the gunplay is some of the best in modern cinema, and the unique elements of the film make for a combination of intrigue and strange humor that make the fairly short movie a joy to watch. If you're asking me if John Wick is a good quality movie, the answer is more of a 'meh, not really... but it's not bad.' The acting is almost non-existent (seemingly by design to fit Keanu Reeves' style), the plot is about as generic as they come, and the ending is laughable. During the first 90% of the film, they made an effort to be as realistic as possible. That end sequence almost erased all of it. It was still an entertaining movie but I was hoping for more.",5,2,7,26 July 2015
Gravity," Suspenseful and exhilarating.
","Gravity was a very unique and original movie and because it was also executed incredibly well, it was a great movie and deserves much of the praise it has received. The special effects, cinematography, perfect amount of first-person angles, sound, and lack of development all create a certain sense of unknown and suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat almost from the beginning. The acting, essentially Sandra Bullock, is also very good, albeit slightly overrated. While it isn't the movie of the year in my opinion, it is still an exceptional film and one of the few movies I've ever seen that I felt like 3D added something rather than taking something away.",8,8,12,27 February 2014
Lone Survivor," A salute to our fallen heroes.
","Lone Survivor was a decent movie but it failed to deliver on a lot of the emotion from the book, aka the real life events. Forewarning, the rest of this review will contain SPOILERS. I'll go ahead and start with the positives. The acting was phenomenal and the main guys, Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and especially Taylor Kitsch, who I thought stole the movie, really deliver. They are able to establish an incredible rapport and level of camaraderie in a very short time so credit to them for them. The combat scenes, which make up essentially three-quarters of the film, were done excellently as well. Peter Berg really delivered here. The movie was gruesome, bloody, gory, and felt real because of those often subtle but occasionally dramatic sequences. Another thing I loved about the film was the sense that, more than just a movie, it was a dedication to those who lost their lives and have done so for our freedom throughout our history. The 5-minute intro with real-life footage from BUD/S training and hell week started in and then the photo/video montage of the heroes who died in the battle after the film completed it. Bravo again to Berg for that. Lastly, I loved that Marcus Luttrell had a role in the film itself. He is in several scenes and it was very unexpected when he first popped up in a scene.Now for some of the negatives. They changed so much stuff for the movie, it almost felt like a different battle. Now don't get me wrong, obviously there are things that must be left out when making a movie from a book due to time constraints. However, leaving something out and changing it are two totally different things. One of the changes that bugged me most was them showing Luttrell see the CH-47 Chinook crash. In reality, he didn't find out about that until later on when he was in the village. Another thing that irritated me was how they showed the Taliban invade and shoot up the village that was keeping Luttrell. This was actually the biggest change in the movie because they change the entire meaning and importance of villages like these. In reality, the Taliban attacks the village with threats but never actually raises a gun at it because they know, if they demolish an entire village for not complying with their ways, they will destroy their supply line in the Hindu Kush mountains. This is broken down in detail in the book and is you supplement that with more research you will quickly see that the Taliban would not massacre an entire village that didn't engage them first just because said village is obeying their Pashtunwali culture over the Taliban. If they did that, their supply line would fall apart and this reality was completely lost in the movie. There were several other changes that were minor but there was one last one that I felt is worth mentioning and that is Mike Murphy's death. When reading the book, the most emotional element was the tragic and tormenting way that Murph dies and the movie fails to portray that. Now I will say this, Marcus Luttrell was very involved in the movie and acknowledged that there were changes made because the studio wanted to dramatize things more. I'm sorry but the story is pretty damn dramatic on its own and doesn't need more action or drama.Regardless, this movie was a decent, not great, film and is a salute to the men who have lost their lives fighting for America. While it could've been better, it was still worthwhile experience and I am curious to know if I would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't already read the book first.",7,1,7,12 January 2014
Fury," Good WWII movie.
","Fury is a good film that depicts an American tank crew towards the closing of World War II. This movie had a lot of hype coming out and I think it largely was able to live up to most of it. Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shai LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pena form a fantastic cast of unique and substantially developed characters. The acting of Pitt and Bernthal especially carry the film. The plot, though lacking much premise beyond the war itself, is also developed really well throughout. There is one particular scene towards the midpoint of the film when they're about to leave a city after capturing it that really stood out and is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes in war movie history. Unfortunately, the movie couldn't carry that emotion throughout the rest of the film. The closing battle sequence was a little too 'Hollywood' and didn't vibe with the realism and grit of the rest of the movie. Because of that, many of the character deaths felt unauthentic and didn't deliver the emotion that they should've. Overall, it's still a solid movie but it had potential to be much better.",7,0,5,8 February 2015
This Is the End," Instant comedy classic!
","This is the end is the most unique comedy since the original Hangover. The concept of real life actors experiencing the apocalypse in a comedic sense is absolutely hilarious. Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, and Jonah Hill shine as the core of the group of celebrity friends and I loved the cameos by all of the other celebrities but especially by Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Rihanna (though I wish Emma had a bigger role... there's no such thing as too much Emma!). The laughter was almost from beginning to end. Honestly, the end is kind of why this film didn't get a higher rating from me. While there were still some parts that made me chuckle, it generally wasn't as funny as the first two-thirds or so of the movie and felt a bit rushed. All-in-all though, this is a must watch comedy, if you don't mind ridiculous and crude guy humor.",7,1,5,2 October 2013
Iron Man 2," Not as good as the first but still entertaining.
","This movie was nowhere near as good as the first one. First of all, I hate when they replace main characters in movies. I understand that it's not necessarily the fault of the film but replacing Terrance Howard with Don Cheadle affects the feel of the movie; similar to when they replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gylenhaul in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Also, a technology that was pushed to be so incredible and impossible to replicate in the first installment is thrown around in this movie like if it's no more rare than an std. Lastly, similar to the first film, there were some huge plot holes. If a villain's weapons are a sort of lasso, wouldn't common sense tell you to just fire on him from outside of the lasso range? I would certainly think a genius like Tony Stark would be able to figure that out. Also, if you access the main computer and can reset the War Machine, why couldn't you also reset the others? Nonetheless, Robert Downey Jr. once again proves to be a top notch actor in Hollywood and the movie's transition to the 'Avengers' adds some excitement to an otherwise quick and overrated ending. Still, I was a little disappointed.",8,2,2,24 May 2013
World War Z," Better than I expected.
","I should preface this review by stating that I have not read the novel that this movie is based loosely off of. Therefore, my entire review is ignorant to any source material and is judging the movie as a stand alone film. As far as that goes, I thought this was one of the best zombie films ever made. Yes, it is plagued by the same exaggerations all zombie films suffer from. However, World War Z is actually a genuinely good movie, zombie nonsense aside. The acting, led by Brad Pitt, is fantastic and the plot develops well. The intensity in the movie starts up right away so there's no lag time to deal with while they develop the setting. The setting is already familiar... it's America today. The discovery of the zombie outbreak is part of the joy in watching the film and the initial sequence where you're first introduced to the situation is one of the most intense segments in recent memory. The action itself feels very realistic, aside from the aforementioned exaggerations that is. Pitt isn't made out to be some superhero or anything so he feel real too. The only real flaws for me were the exaggerations and that the ending felt like it was rushed. The entire two hours builds to this culmination that just ends right away and doesn't give you much closure. I suppose they were going for that with how they set the scene in the closing moments but from a viewer's perspective, I would've liked it a bit differently. Overall though, this is a great movie that most people will almost certainly enjoy.",8,2,4,18 September 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Great movie.
","I honestly didn't expect to enjoy Forgetting Sarah Marshall as much as I did. Now don't get me wrong, I expected it to be hilarious, and it was, but I did not expect it to actually be a quality movie. Jason Segel proves that he's more than just a funny sidekick and the supporting cast of Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Russell Brand, in addition to the smaller roles performed by Johan Hill, Paul Rudd, Jack McBrayer, and more, made the line-up fantastic. Mila is absolutely breathtaking and this film really helped launch her career by showing that she can tap into that humor that transcends 'chick-flick rom-coms'. The plot was engaging, though not entirely realistic, but being a comedy movie, realism isn't always the biggest requirement. Overall, the crudeness isn't for everyone and it's more of a guy's film but I think most people would enjoy it.",8,0,2,18 August 2013
The Hunger Games," Really good but could've been great if they stuck closer to the book.
","Really good movie but, as usual, it wasn't as good as the book which was outstanding. Obviously, you must inevitably cut out quite a bit of content in order to turn a 10 hour book into a 2 hour movie. This is not necessarily where I felt the movie missed it's mark. I didn't mind that certain minor characters were cut out (Madge and the Avox girl) and others' had their roles diminished (the prep team). I also didn't mind that certain characters' roles were embellished for the movie (Gale and Crane). However, while those were things that were necessary for the transition from pages to big screen, certain changes were not and slightly affected the overall feel of the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND INTEND ON IT, QUIT READING NOW. For example, Katniss and Peeta were instructed to never separate from one another during the training session by Haymitch. This was a crucial strategic element and the movie not only glossed over it but actually largely removed it entirely. This made the 'star crossed lovers' vibe difficult to push. The way the Cato/Thresh thing went down also was unnecessarily changed. It wouldn't have been any longer to keep to the book here. In the book, Cato was more of a villain whereas in the more, while they tried to make him out as one, small changes diminished this effect, this change being just one of them. Now for the biggest areas of the movie where changes weren't necessary. First of all, the Mockingjay, which is the symbol of the entire trilogy, lost all importance in this movie. All tributes take a 'token' into the arena with them and this was Katniss' token. The fact that she got it from Madge and Madge not being in the movie is irrelevant to the fact that they still could've had this symbol keep it's meaning as a symbol of rebellion and a smack in the face of the Capitol. Secondly, the scene of Rue's death. While I thought the movie did a really good job here, there is a critical moment afterwords where Rue's district shows their appreciation for Katniss' actions by sending her a piece of bread. Katniss then salutes them to show acknowledgment. This should not have changed because it is a major part in Katniss' rebelling against the Capitol. Katniss voluntarily saluting the cameras without initiation didn't make any sense. Instead of sticking to the book, the movie decided to replace this important sequence with a scene of Rue's district revolting. Not only did this not happen in the book but it actually doesn't occur until the second book when Katniss and Peeta take their victory tour. I wonder how they are going to fix this when they make the next movie. I did like some of the changes they did make though. It's not really possible to keep a movie in the first person so showing things that happened outside of the arena (Crane meeting with Snow, the control room, people watching back home, etc.) helped push the third person feel that was a must. Overall, it's impossible to know how I would rate the movie without reading the book which is really strange because you normally know. I might think that the movie was outstanding because I wouldn't know any different. Then again, I might feel like some of the scenes were rushed and not explained thoroughly enough. Nonetheless, it was a really good movie. It could've been great if they would've stayed a little more true to the book but it was still a good film and I look forward to seeing the next two.",8,4,12,10 April 2012
The Impossible," Incredibly moving.
","The Impossible was one of the most suffocating and powerful emotional dramas I've ever seen and the fact that it is a true story constantly plays in the back of your mind while watching, effectively multiplying the emotion and drama even more. The acting was incredible and the special effects, especially the tsunami scene in the beginning, were fantastic. Having seen almost most of the critically acclaimed films in the 2012 year, I can now say that they made a mistake in giving the Best Actress in a Leading Role to Jennifer Lawrence for her role in The Silver Linings Playbook. That award should've gone to Naomi Watts for her incredible and moving performance in this film. Lawrence did great but Watts was amazing, key difference in my opinion. The Academy's blunder aside, The Impossible is a movie that is definitely worth a watch.",10,1,3,21 July 2013
Argo," Not Picture of the Year but still really good.
","Argo was a very good film but Picture of the Year it was not. Sorry Academy but you got it wrong once again. Don't mistake this for bashing. Like I said, Argo was a very good film. Ben Affleck has proved once again that he's not only a fantastic and underrated actor but that he's becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood. Argo had great pacing for the type of movie it is, the plot developed perfectly, the characters all felt real and authentic, etc. The only negative I would really have is that some of the suspense felt cheap and forced. Sure, they truly did escape Iran. That part is a true story. However, how close they were to getting caught is not necessarily known. So the fact that the final 30 minutes of the movie was close call after close call and that these scrapes didn't develop authentically but felt manufactured was not ideal. Nonetheless, I'd say this is a really good movie that, while it's a little overrated and over-hyped (it won Picture of the Year when I'm not even sure it's the best true story CIA film of the year - that would probably be Zero Dark Thirty), most people would still enjoy. 'Argo f*** yourself!'",8,1,2,2 March 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good but not as good as the first.
","While Star Trek: Into Darkness was still a really good sci-fi film, it unfortunately failed to either live up to or exceed the standard set by the first film in this newly rebooted franchise. The acting by the entire cast, including additions Benedict Cumberbatch and Alice Eve, was fantastic and the special effects continued to be on par with the best in the business. I also thought Abrams did a good job continuing the development of the characters from the first film, making these movies really feel like they connect well. The only negatives with the film, in my opinion, stem from them not branching away from the original series. I didn't love that in the first film but I thought the 'alternate universe' concept was an interesting way to stay true to the franchise source material while still allowing the writers a certain level of artistic freedom. That is no longer the case and Abrams' insistent on staying attached at the hip to the original was a weak point for me. While it felt like an interesting concept in the first film, it felt like lazy writing in this one. I really do hope they continue to build this story with more films because I love the universe and the cast but hopefully in future endeavors they leave Leonard Nimoy off of the cast list.",8,2,5,10 February 2015
Just Go with It," One of Sandler's better family films.
","Just Go With It is actually a really good movie with plenty of laughs. Adam Sandler has struggled as he's transitioned to more family oriented films to keep his edgy and outlandish style but this is proof that he's still got it. Jennifer Aniston has one of her best roles ever where she isn't completely intolerable. While both of the stars are outstanding, the biggest laughs come from Nick Swardson. He is so ridiculous and out there that he can pull off the craziest of roles. Also, unlike most comedy movies, this film isn't full of annoying moments that never seem to end. Then you throw in the beautiful Brooklyn Decker, who actually is a decent enough actress, and you have yourself a movie worth watching.",8,2,3,18 August 2013
Terminator Salvation," Fits well with the franchise.
","While I didn't think this movie was as good as the first two, I thought it was way better than the 3rd film. The acting was great, the story was well told and tied into the story arc well, and the effects were incredible. It really is impressive to watch all four films over a short period of time. You really appreciate how far the technology has come. I thought they did a great job with the setting and overall feel of the environment. I also thought that the concept of Sam Worthington's character was really interesting and the 'Arnie' cameo was pretty sweet. There were some things that I wasn't a fan of however. I thought they tried to add too many new little gizmos for Skynet. I also thought the ending seemed a bit weak and almost like an afterthought. They have paraded around the concept through the entire series of your 'fate' not being set and yet the series is always determined on never wavering from the future laid forth in past films. While the argument can be made for that logic, it can also be made countering it. Lastly, while I thought the casting for Kyle Reese was fantastic, I thought having Bryce Dallas Howard play the role of Kate Connor was a terrible idea. Not only does she look nothing like Claire Danes but she also looks way too young. The timing just doesn't feel authentic at all. Shoot, they could've just used Claire Danes and kept the continuity completely. I doubt she was too busy since she hasn't really been doing anything major. Also, while she would still be young, at least she's a bit older than Howard is and they could've always made her look a little more aged. If you can make a robot look like the spitting image of Arnie, I don't think adding a decade or so to Claire Danes would've been too much of a challenge. Overall though, this was a very good movie and definitely fit into the series well. While they have yet to really show why John Connor is a threat in the first place or to show the resistance make even a dent in Skynet, they at least hinted towards a possible light to end the darkness with the frequency concept. I don't know if they're ever going to make a fifth film or even reboot the franchise which seems to have become the rage these days but if they do neither, at least we can more or less figure out how things unfold from here.",7,1,4,19 September 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Such a disappointing sequel.
","Ocean's Twelve gives ammunition to those who are against the concept of sequels. It started out ridiculous, dragged quite a bit, became mildly interesting, became even more ridiculous, then was stupid, and then finally even more ridiculous. The acting was once again fantastic but outside of a few main characters, none of the side characters seemed to get any further development or decent screen time. Bernie Mac and Don Cheadle especially seemed like almost wasted roles because they were both so underutilized. Yes, George Clooney and Brad Pitt got more screen time and Catherine Zeta-Jones got quite a bit as well but still, it felt like the great cast just wasn't used properly. The writing was the worst part though. It's almost like they said 'hey, let's make a movie and then if the ending doesn't work, let's just make some stupid stuff up and if it doesn't really make sense or seem plausible, who cares, at least we get the ending we want.'",3,1,3,23 July 2013
The Expendables," Very action-packed and entertaining
","The Expendables is very action-packed and entertaining. There were some obvious flaws like a lack of substantial character development and a not-so-original plot. However, this movie did have some of the most realistic and intense hand-to-hand fight sequences I've ever seen and who doesn't like big guns and bigger explosions. The fact that they were able to take so many great action heroes and put them all in the same movie without much sacrifice was amazing. Also, I felt that Mickey Rourke's character was so crucial in added depth and layers to what would otherwise have been a fairly shallow film. The self-absorbed movie critics will hate on this movie because 'it lacked unique cinematic effects' or whatever clichéd criticism they normally say, but if you want to see an action-packed movie with a full cast of action heroes, you won't regret watching this movie. After all, the whole point of cinema is to entertain isn't it?",9,2,3,24 February 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marginally better than the first.
","I liked Captain America: The Winter Soldier more than the first film but only marginally. While I thought it had more action and 'badassery' it felt like it was a bit void of the developmental elements that made the first film strong. I also thought there was a bit too much humor early on. The Falcon character is where the lack of development hurt the most as he felt forced on us. It felt like he existed only to make certain scenes and plot points possible. To me, that's lazy writing. Either develop him more and add a bit more time to the film or leave him out entirely and find different ways to make things happen. I also thought Scar Jo's character still lacked much development. She had more screen time than in any of the previous movies but I think her and Cobie Smulder's character, agent Hill, continue to be the most underutilized characters in the series. Nonetheless, the action and special effects were amazing and the acting was good enough.",8,0,1,6 April 2014
Life of Pi," Picture of the Year
","I honestly didn't expect to say this again in the current calendar year but 'this is probably the best movie I have seen this year'. Yes, I think this is probably even a better movie that The Dark Knight Returns which I was all but certain would be my personal Picture of the Year winner. Life of Pi was simply amazing. The story is incredible and the way the film is delivered couldn't be better. You truly go on this story with Pi Patel and Richard Parker. The acting by Suraj Sharma is surprisingly fantastic as well. Some people will surely call this movie boring because it has a slower pace to it but Tom Hanks' Castaway film was also on the slower side and as that movie showed, if a film is well done the slow pace allows for more emotion and a connection to the characters. Shoot, I got watery eyes when Hanks' character lost Wilson and that was a stinking volleyball, lol. This movie plays along that same style of a slow paced story of survival but is done even better due to the incredible cinematography that rivals Avatar in terms of magnificence. Another thing Life of Pi did remarkably well was end without disappointment. By that, I do not mean that the ending isn't sad. I mean that the ending lives up to the film. Again, take Castaway for example. That movie was great but its ending was quick and left a lot to be desired. The ending for Life of Pi throws a subtle twist that is sort of a mind blowing moment. That subtle twist leaves you pondering the events of the film well after it ends.",10,19,36,29 November 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Much better than Ocean's Twelve
","Now this is what a sequel is supposed to be like. Ocean's Twelve was a joke but Ocean's Thirteen was fantastic and maybe even a bit better than the first film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt once again lead a fantastic cast and have some great moments of dialogue and back-and- forth. Those two are great on screen together. It also seemed like they were able to actually give each character a fair amount of screen time whereas in the second film most seemed meaningless. There wasn't much additional development of them but they all contributed to the film in some way. As for the actual plot, it felt more genuine and not just thrown together like the last one. All in all, it almost feels like a waste to even watch the second film other than a couple of comments and a character that barely sees the screen in this movie.",8,0,0,1 August 2013
Interstellar," Great potential but Nolan got in his own way... as usual.
","Interstellar is your typical Christopher Nolan film. It has an incredible score that plays throughout essentially the entire movie, beautiful visuals, an interesting and captivating plot, great acting, great character and setting development, a heavy reliance on suspended disbelief, and enormously huge plot holes. Some people don't mind them but I have trouble with plot holes so big that they actively go against what has already been established in the story arc. Forewarning, the following sentences will contain SPOILERS that are as big as the plot holes they discuss. Now I won't get into the details on every single little plot hole and inconsistency because this review would become way too long. I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the 'really good but not great' category where so many other films reside.",7,2,4,18 April 2015
Pacific Rim," Surprisingly entertaining.
","Pacific Rim was surprisingly one of the best movies I've seen this year. I expected an entertaining action movie with mechs fighting monsters, but a movie void of any quality acting or plot. Boy was I wrong. While it was a very entertaining action movie with mechs fighting monsters, it had a very interesting storyline with solid plot development, granted a little brief. The acting was also up to par and the character development was fantastic, giving life and depth to characters that seem at first to be a bit superficial. There were also some nice cameos by actors like Charlie Day and Ron Perlman, who though I don't like, had a cool role. Overall, this movie takes a substantial amount of suspended disbelief but I think most people who like cool action movies will really enjoy it.",9,1,4,27 October 2013
American Sniper," Should've been an HBO miniseries.
","American Sniper is yet another example of why more stories should be told through a medium more akin to an HBO miniseries, similar to John Adams or Bands of Brothers. By trying to force Chris Kyle's incredible life story into a 2+ hour traditional film format, the story did little to no justice on Kyle's impressive accomplishments, both militarily and as a man. The result was a very jumpy and shallow viewing experience where you didn't feel a connection to Kyle's SEAL teammates or his wife, Taya. The actors, namely Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, did the best job they possibly could've done with the script they were given. The script was the best it could've been when trying to fit into the clichéd 2-hour time slot. But it all comes back to the decision to make this into a movie. It just wasn't possible. There were also some directorial decisions that I found highly questionable but they weren't major nor were they things most people would either pick up on or care about. Ultimately, this review should end on a high note though, so I will point out the strongest element of the film: the ending. The closing 10+ minutes are incredibly moving and deliver, what I believe was the entire purpose of the film itself. They leave you in awe of the man, the myth, the legend. The decision to leave the remaining credits without audio was also a genius decision. I've never left a theater and felt like I was leaving a funeral. I believe that is the appropriate feeling that this movie should portray and I commend Clint Eastwood for making that so.",6,4,19,18 January 2015
Ant-Man," Great movie!
","Ant-Man was actually a really good movie, one of the better movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of late. Paul Rudd was perfect for the role and the rest of the cast did marvelous (get it?). The movie took a little while to get going and it had one of the same drawbacks that the first Iron-Man had (where the villain can operate his suit with no practice whatsoever even though a large portion of the film is spent with the protagonist learning to control his 'powers') but once it got going, the humor, action, and excitement was non-stop. Surprisingly, there was a fair amount of emotion as well, which helped connect the audience to the film. Overall, it's a must see for MCU fans and superhero fans in general but I think casual movie-goers will also appreciate it.",8,2,11,23 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Not as good as the critics claimed.
","I thought this movie was really good but it definitely wasn't the 'best superhero movie ever' like so many people have proclaimed. They could've developed some of the characters beyond Steve and Peggy more and given the movie more depth. That would've made certain character deaths more meaningful. The action sequences, while not as impressive as some of the other superhero movies, were still awesome in their own right and the fight scenes were fairly entertaining. The ending could've been a lot more emotional as well. I'm not asking for sobbing and ridiculous crying but if you actually think about what was happening, having some more emotion would've made it feel more genuine and authentic. Chris Evans is great as Captain America though. His role doesn't call for the darkness of Bruce Wayne or the charisma of Tony Stark but it does call for a certain level of confidence and straightforwardness and arrogance. Chris Evans hits all of those well. One of the few other weak parts was the villain. The Red Skull just wasn't all that terrifying or intimidating. Sure, he wanted to 'take over the world' but nothing really made him uniquely evil other than his skinless head. All in all though, this was a very good movie and while it wasn't as good as the other Avengers films in my opinion, it is still better than most action movies around.",8,0,0,29 May 2013
American Hustle," The critics are wrong once again.
","Once again the movie critics prove how little they know about what goes into making a great movie. Yes, the movie had incredible acting and the setting was founded upon detail after detail. However, does entertainment value mean nothing? I'm sorry but I was to enjoy my movie-going experience, not be bored out of my mind while I acknowledge that Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress. Honestly, the only things redeemable about this movie were Lawrence and Bradley Cooper's insane yet fantastic performances and Amy Adams relentless cleavage and side-boob. None of the characters are likable in any way and the plot drags and is annoying. The acting and the well detailed setting are worthwhile but the rest of the film is not.",4,3,4,3 May 2014
Oblivion," What were the critics smoking? Oblivion is amazing!
","What an incredible movie. It's really almost impossible to review it in any detail without giving away spoilers but I will say this, Oblivion is one of my favorite science-fiction films of all-time. It isn't over the top, it doesn't try to do too much, it just relies on fantastic acting thanks to protagonist Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, along with a fantastic supporting cast and a story that is absolutely amazing. The plot developed at a perfect pace for the environment and created a setting that felt genuine throughout. The only flaw was that there were some elements left unexplained, but then again it is a sci-fi movie so it doesn't take too much from the experience. I don't understand why so many critics slammed this movie but they do tend to like weird, artsy fartsy garb and dislike anything resembling a well-made action film. While this movie didn't have much action, it seems like it does from trailers so don't expect a gung-ho modern shooter or anything. If anything, it feels more like a Matrix style film in terms of pace. Regardless, I've said as much as I can say without revealing too much. I think most people would likely agree that Oblivion is a sci-fi epic worthy of the 2 hours.",9,8,12,7 August 2013
Watchmen," Loses the impact of the book...
","This was a very disappointing book-to-film portrayal. Not only do they include the only stupid element from the book (Jon's ability to see into the future which I fully expected them to keep) but they also changed some things for the worst. For one, unlike in the book where there is some foreshadowing but the twist is still somewhat of a surprise, this movie gives away the identity of the villain pretty much from the beginning. Also, they give the characters superhuman abilities for some reason that, other than one minor glitch in the end of the book never actually existed. Rorschach can't leap 10 feet into the air at will, Adrian Veidt isn't a superhero, etc. This not only turned a dark and realistic world silly but it also made the closing sequence of the film incredibly retarded. And speaking of Veidt, this was by far the worst casting of all of the characters. In the book, Adrian Veidt appeared to be a 'larger than life' person, not just in terms of his celebrity and persona but also in terms of his physical appearance. The dude was a big, strong, and intimidating person but Matthew Goode looks like a dorky little twerp. Malin Akerman also wasn't a great selection but she at least pulled of the role of Laurie Jupiter decent enough. The rest of the casting was fantastic and they nailed the style of the book spot on. The soundtrack was also really good. Honestly, other than the Adrian character in general, they really stayed very true to the book. It's just that this story is so reliant, not on action and effects but rather on the development of the characters and the world itself. And while they developed the world really nicely, I think they failed to develop Dr. Manhattan enough and his back story is really one of the key turns in the book. Overall I think they gave it a solid effort but it just doesn't have the same impact. I think people who read the book will at least find this movie at least intriguing and somewhat enjoyable but I think people who never read the book will find the movie mediocre at best.",6,1,5,11 September 2012
Man of Steel," Not the greatest superhero movie ever but maybe the great Superman movie yet.
","Zack Snyder's dark take in Man of Steel, a la Christopher Nolan's Gotham, really worked in my opinion. I've always felt that Superman had one of the more tragic of backgrounds and the more uplifting and happier stories never felt genuine. Richard Roeper's criticism that 'There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story' or Rafer Guzman's criticism that 'this reboot skimps on fun and romance' shows just how many critics missed the point. This isn't a kid's story, period! Leave all of those childish and whimsical expectations at home. In my opinion, this grittier version really hit home and took the drama and intensity to whole new levels. While it failed to deliver on the level of the some of the Avengers: Phase One films and definitely wasn't on the level with any of the movies from the Dark Knight Trilogy, it was still a great movie. The acting was really good, especially from Amy Adams in her supporting role. She managed to turn a character without a lot of development into one with a surprising amount of depth and believability. And Henry Cavill was great as Superman/Kal-El, probably my favorite yet. The supporting roles by Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and so on were all also fantastic. I don't think I can remember a movie where all of the supporting roles were played by people more famous than the protagonist but that was the case here and it worked because of Cavill's performance and how the movie was laid out. The action sequences were great, as was to be expected, and the way the plot developed was not annoying as most critics claimed. Many felt like the constant back-and-forth hurt the film's progression but I actually quite liked it. It kept the two and a half hour movie from dragging and felt fresh. The one flaw that I felt actually took a bit away from the movie, however, was the shaky-camera cinematic effect. I'm sorry but this isn't a world where the audience is going to feel the 'we're there' and in the actual scene itself. All that did was make you wish it wasn't there. Overall though, this was a great movie and while I've never been a big fan of the Superman lore, if you can remove bias and suspend quite a bit of disbelief I think most would really enjoy it.",9,1,8,18 July 2013
Pitch Black," One of the best sci-fi/horror films of all-time.
","Pitch Black meshes the sci-fi/fantasy genre with the horror genre better than any other movie, including Alien. Vin Diesel's character is amazing. His highly questionable moral compass combined with a strange sense of principles creates a very interesting character dynamic. The supporting cast is solid too, with Radha Mitchell possibly seeing even more screen time than Diesel's Riddick. The cinematic effects, however, are what make this movie stand out. The camera effects are sometimes a little overdone but the color palette used throughout most of the film is done to great effect. The plot suffers from a couple of clichéd episodes of stupidity that plague almost all movies (most notably Paris' ridiculous act towards the end). It also wraps up a bit too suddenly. It feels like the movie is building towards a climax and it ends rather abruptly. Nonetheless, this is an instant cult classic that has held up well over the years and I highly suggest checking it out.",8,0,2,5 September 2013
We're the Millers," Not as good as I hoped.
","We're the Millers is unfortunately your typical modern comedy. The acting is good enough but the plot is predictable and the situational humor is drowned by the absurdity of the situations themselves, effectively losing the entire point of situational humor. Jason Sudeikis is typically really funny but he isn't given much to work with here. Jennifer Aniston looks amazing and Emma Roberts is about as pretty as they come but they don't push this movie over mediocre. Honestly, the only really entertaining thing about the film is the other family they run into. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are hilarious and own the screen when they're on. Again though, they don't have enough screen time to make the movie better than meh. The funniest scene in the entire film, in my opinion, actually takes place after the movie during the blooper reel. In it they replace the TLC song from the trailer with the theme song from Friends, catching Jennifer Aniston, aka Rachel, off guard. I got a good laugh out of that but when the best laughs come from the bloopers, there's clearly something missing in the movie. Overall, it's not a bad movie but it should've been much better. I have a feeling the only reason most people are giving it higher ratings is because of the stripper scenes.",4,10,19,29 November 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Lawrence and Cooper are fantastic.
","While I don't think Silver Linings Playbook was quite worthy of all the praise it got from the 'experts' and the academy, it was still a very good movie. Bradley Cooper is absolutely fantastic. This is by far the best role he's ever had and he shows that he really is a very good actor. Jennifer Lawrence is also incredible. Not only is she stunning but the range of her acting abilities seems to have no bounds. A lot of that range is shown in this film and, while I can't confirm that she did in fact perform better than the competition, I can say that her role was flawless and I can't argue her winning an Oscar for it. The supporting cast was also great with Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker, among others, providing added depth to the movie. The only flaw I had was that it dragged quite a bit towards the middle/end portion. It started great and ended great and most of the middle was very entertaining but from about the 60% to 80% part of the film it did feel a bit sluggish. Nonetheless, the dialogue and character development keeps you intrigued so I think most people would appreciate the movie.",8,1,3,6 May 2013
Divergent," Mediocre at best.
","When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.",5,191,312,6 April 2014
Ender's Game," Not perfect but still great.
","I will start by saying that Ender's Game was a really good movie, maybe even great. The acting, especially by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford, was flawless and the supporting cast, however underutilized, were phenomenal as well. The special effects were incredible and the story, supported by a fantastic score, was very well told. Honestly, this is truly one of those rare stories that both children and adults alike could really appreciate. There were some things I thought could've been improved on. There were some areas where time passed very quickly and if I hadn't read the book, I think I wouldn't been a bit confused. I think using some cinematic tricks for time lapsing quickly could've been used to create a better flow and make certain elements seem more genuine. To be honest though, as a stand alone film, that's all I really feel was flawed. Obviously it wasn't exactly like the book, nor did I expect it to be. It's just about impossible to condense an 8+ hour novel into a 2 hour movie. However, there were also some things that they altered from the source material that I didn't care for, I'll explain here:***SPOILERS*** As I said, they had to cut some things out and most of it was fine. They eliminated some of the minor characters (like Shen and Crazy Tom and a few others) and also some of the development of the Battle School dynamic. Those cuts came across perfectly fine. They also skipped some of his progress in said school and to do so they altered the way he developed the Dragon Army. Again, this was done really well and stayed true to the spirit of the source material. This trend continued throughout the story arc. However, there were a few changes that I didn't like. The biggest thing (in terms of creating a void from the book) was the entire Valentine and Peter dynamic with Demosthenes and Locke. While I didn't expect that to have been included in detail, I would've liked some sort of mention of the goings on. Maybe she could've mentioned it briefly during their conversation at the lake. It didn't have to be explained much but it was a very critical element, not to the book necessarily but to the story later on. I think they could've found a way to touch on it. While on Valentine, the most glaring of the changes was the ending (again, this is a SPOILER). In the end, Ender sends Val a message saying he's left to explore the universe. There are a few issues with this. For one, Val is supposed to be with him. She is an integral part in the entire saga so if they plan on making this into a franchise, which supposedly they do, how are they going to get them back together? Also, his abrupt departure creates somewhat of a plot hole. Where is Ender going? In the book, he doesn't leave for over a decade, which allows for other colonies to begin on other planets. In the movie, however, no other planet is colonized, so again, where is he going? What they should've done was develop his relationship with Petra a bit less in order to include more development of his love for his sister, Val. Then he could've written her a letter stating that he planned on leaving at some point but still had some things to take care of where he was at, you know, politics. This would give time for her to write back telling him she's going to meet him there and they could then leave together whenever he was ready. It wouldn't have taken almost any additional time and it would've fixed two glaring issues. The others problems I had weren't as major but still bugged me a bit. The second to last battle at Command School was a failed mission in the movie, however, Ender NEVER loses in the book. He comes close during that mission but he does NOT lose. His genius feels somewhat affected by them making him lose that mission. Lastly, they changed Graff's character quite a bit. In the book, he is stern with Ender and at times a jerk but he truly loves the kid and would do anything for him. In the movie, they almost made Anderson the kind one and Graff a horrible person. I didn't care for that change at all.Nonetheless, the movie was still great and I highly suggest anyone who enjoys science fiction, or just great movies in general, to check it out. In my opinion, it's definitely worth the price of entry.",8,2,5,1 November 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great but could've been epic:
","This was an outstanding movie and, in my opinion, better than the Spider-Man of a decade ago. I enjoy the way Andrew Garfield portrays the Peter Parker character much more than Toby McGuire. He is not such a dweeb, is more charismatic, wittier, and just a better actor in general. And thank you to whoever decided to use Emma Stone as the romantic/love interest. Not only is she one of the best young actresses in Hollywood but she is absolutely stunning. Much more believable for the role of the beautiful 'damsel in distress' than Kirsten Dunst. I'm sorry but I am not a fan of Dunst and don't understand why people find her attractive. I also though the rest of the cast was great. Denis Leary and Martin Sheen almost stole the show. The director also made the physics more realistic. With the exception of a football bending a goal post in half, the physics felt more authentic throughout, not only the combat but also just the gliding through the city shooting out webs. I also liked the plot development. I had a friend mention how they prolonged the 'origin' too much for his tastes but I actually enjoyed that a lot. If they are making this into a trilogy, there's plenty of time for Spider-Man moments but you can never come back and capture the beginning stages of the superhero and the person behind the mask. Ultimately, the only thing that held this movie back for me was that it felt like we've seen it before. Other than some minor alterations to the story and obviously different actors, this was very similar to the one a decade ago and more than anything, it felt like the older one. I thought it was better but not by much, mainly because it had the same overall feel and tone. I would've much rather had them take the Spider-Man story they had here and made it a little darker and more intense and dramatic. There is plenty of potential there but they don't take advantage of it. Instead, you essentially have yet another little kid/teenager superhero movie. Out of all of the superhero movies being made, it's definitely the least mature of them and that holds it back for me. Give Christopher Nolan this story and he'll make it amazing.",9,2,5,7 July 2012
The Fast and the Furious," Great modern classic!
","There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.",9,9,11,1 June 2013
Now You See Me," Very disappointing thanks to a sloppy script and misleading previews.
","Now You See Me might have the most misleading trailers of all-time. The previews make you think that story follow the four magicians, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco. However, the characters with the most screen time are actually an FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo, an interpol agent played by Melanie Laurent, and a washed up magician played by Morgan Freeman. Guess what? I didn't know any of those actors were even in the movie. The movie also didn't seem to have an identity. It constantly jumped back and forth between magic not being real and then certain things not being possible without magic. This constant uncertainty from the film's perspective created a lazy feeling in the script. As for the individual characters, Woody was hilarious, Isla was absolutely gorgeous, and Eisenberg was, well, the same character he always is. Which reminds me, can we stop calling Jesse Eisenberg a great actor? The kid plays the exact same role every single time and that's who he is in real life. He isn't 'acting', he's just playing himself in different situations. Back to the movie, it had decent plot development but with so many characters involved, none of them were really fleshed out properly. Lastly, it had the typical twist in the end that's become almost clichéd where it wasn't written into the story well but just forced on the viewer. All-in-all, if you want to be mildly entertained with over-the-top magic tricks and a chaotic story and then toss in a romance for no reason, this is the movie for you.",4,6,10,8 September 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Day of Future Past is a fantastic superhero movie in every way, shape and form... except for the gaping flaw that is its premise.
","Day of Future Past is a fantastic superhero movie in every way, shape and form... except for the gaping flaw that is its premise. Don't get me wrong, I understand that one must suspend their level of disbelief greatly in order to enjoy these films. Newsflash, I love superhero movies so clearly the suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. There is a difference between being willing to accept something as possible and there being a monumental plot hole, which was the case with this film.***SPOILERS*** The movie is set WAY into the future where these 'robots' called Sentinels have effectively wiped out all mutants in existence and a large portion of the human population as well. Because these Sentinels are too much for the X-Men, they conceive of a plan to send Professor X's consciousness back in time to his younger self, when the Sentinels program was in its infancy in the 1970's, so he can stop Mystique from killing the creator of the program and then being captured and experimented on, which is what results in the Sentinels being the unstoppable force they become. Because sending someone's consciousness back decades would physically tear them apart, the only man for the job is none other than Wolverine.And that's the premise of the film. Did nobody else scream 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!' when reading that? Allow me to clarify once again. I am willing to accept that there are invincible robots, that mutants exist, and that you can send someone's consciousness back in time decades for an extended period of time. I have no problem with any of those concepts because I have suspended my disbelief completely. However, if you know who creates this horrible program and you can send someone back in time, wouldn't you just send Logan a little further back and kill the creator, effectively eliminating the threat of the Sentinels before they ever exist?There are other plot holes throughout the film but I'd categorize those as relatively minor, akin to the ones you will typically find, not just in superhero movies but in films in general, so I won't go into detail on those. I'll simply say that a 9 or 10 caliber superhero movie with incredible acting, especially from James McAvoy, great special effects, and awesome action scenes easily drops to a 6 or 7 caliber movie because every single dramatic element was clouded with an 'If they did this obvious thing, none of this crap would've happened'. (6 + 7)/2 = 6.5, which rounds to 7. That's about the best explanation possible for my reasoning.",7,2,5,25 May 2014
Ocean's Eleven," Very good heist movie.
","George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a fantastic cast in Ocean's Eleven. The plot is also very interesting and the movie and characters, even though there are a lot of them, develop rather nicely. My favorite character is probably Don Cheadle's though. He plays the role of reckless British explosives nut flawlessly. I thought there were a few plot holes but none that actually affected the critical plot points regarding the heist so they are easily overlooked. I think they could've spent more time on the actual heist/planning process but the movie would've probably been too long if they did. Overall, this is a really good movie with solid acting and, while it's isn't exciting, it still provides for some nice entertainment value.",8,0,1,23 July 2013
Inside Out," One of Pixar's best!
","Inside Out is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. The creativity that went into this film is yet another example for why the people at Pixar might be the greatest film makers of all-time. The voice acting was incredible, the visuals were flawless, the characters came alive in realistic ways, the plot was interesting and surprisingly moving, and the concept overall was just genius. The only flaw was that it did drag just a bit towards the middle of the film but that's just my opinion. Overall, I think this is a film that adults might actually enjoy even more than children. Honestly, I don't think children will even be able to appreciate much of the film.",9,2,21,14 December 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Cliff hanger ending was weak.
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a really good movie with great visuals and it continued telling an amazing story. The increased action of this film over the previous one will surely get most people's attention and will probably make most younger people actually like it more. The special effects were also a bit better, in my opinion, and the dragon sequence at the end was just amazing. My only real probably with the film is the ending. That just isn't a good place to leave the film hanging. Obviously you should look at all of these films as one large movie broken up into three parts but the reality is that the third part won't be available to see until next year which makes this movie stand alone, in a sense. When considering that the entire movie seemed to be building to a climax that never occurs, it feels a little anticlimactic.",8,0,3,15 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Can't wait for the second installment!
","If you liked The Lord of the Rings movies than you'll like this film. The visuals are absolutely incredible and it has that familiar LOTR feel that we all know and love. I couldn't quite give it a 10/10 for a few reasons. For one, there are so many characters that most of them have absolutely zero development whatsoever. Frodo gets more screen time than some of the dwarfs and that's really unfortunate. Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin are the focus of the film, as they should be, but the rest of the dwarfs are essentially filler in the movie. I don't know how Peter Jackson could've done this differently without making the movie even longer (and it's already about 3 hours) so it's really just the nature of the content that has trouble transitioning to film. Secondly, the feel, while similar to LOTR, doesn't seem as epic. When watching Lord of the Rings, even after already having watched it before, there's a sense of awe that this film doesn't quite capture to the same degree. Regardless, the movie is outstanding and I have a feeling that if watching all three films back-to-back-to-back (when they're released that is), it will come off much better. I can't wait for the second installment.",9,6,16,21 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Ending could've been better.
","Ghost Protocol was a really good movie with solid acting and interesting characters. Tom Cruise continues to be a great Ethan Hunt and Jeremy Renner's character was solid as usual. Also, Simon Pegg's character added some very nice comedic effect. However, this isn't just any old movie, this is a Mission Impossible movie and while it was better than the third one, it paled in comparison to the first two. Now this movie did have the best continuity of any of the prior films but it also had some of the weakest special effects and some of the most unrealistic fight sequences. Also, while the continuity was fantastic, the ending was terrible. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I honestly didn't have a problem with them killing off his wife. However, why keep her alive with that twist in the end? That was completely unnecessary. It's like if the only reason they did it was to make Ethan Hunt look smart but the drama and emotion of the movie until then worked better if they would've left her dead. I think if they wanted to keep her alive they should've played it off like if Cruise wanted for Renner's character to replace him. Almost like a protégé sort of twist. Nonetheless, this movie was definitely worth watching, I just thought the ending (either way) could've been better.",8,0,1,21 April 2012
The Theory of Everything," Simply amazing!
","The Theory of Everything was absolutely captivating. I use that term because I'm having trouble finding another word that does the film justice. Entertaining? Yes, but not in the traditional sense. Enjoyable? Sure, but it didn't leave you filled with joy necessarily. It pulls you in completely for two hours and doesn't let you go. Eddie Redmayne delivered one of the best roles I've seen in recent memory in his portrayal of Stephen Hawking. Not to be forgotten is Felicity Jones, whose genius in playing Jane Hawking is up to the task of matching Redmayne. Those two carry the film and director James Marsh does a brilliant job of harnessing their roles and creating the masterpiece that was this movie. From the acting to the score to the cinematography to the choking feeling you get at times, this movie is a must watch.",10,0,2,15 August 2015
Frozen," Really good Disney film.
",Frozen was definitely a cute and well made movie. The voice animations were fantastic and Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel did an incredible job as Anna and Elsa. I thought some of the spontaneous outbursts of song were a bit forced and took away from the moments a bit and I thought they could've made some of the emotional elements a bit deeper. That last part is what tends to separate Pixar from the rest of the bunch but Frozen still mostly delivered. I thought it was a bit over-hyped because I don't think it's the greatest animated film ever but it's still a great film and definitely the best of the past year or two and I definitely suggest checking it out.,8,4,8,1 June 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Didn't live up to its potential.
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. It had all of the pieces in place to be one of those great movies that combine a certain innocent charm with insight and introspection to deliver a heartfelt and emotional movie that anyone can relate to. However, instead of putting that all together in a fashion that feels genuine, like The Truman Show for example, it just feels like it's missing something. Ben Stiller is great and Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine, and Patton Oswalt (among others) do a great job in their supporting roles, albeit far shorter than they should've been. I think the big problem was Adam Scott's character. People like that are so seldom they almost don't even exist and this movie hinging on his 'bullying' made it tough to relate to. I don't mind that the pace was slow either. I expected that. I didn't expect for the film to build to a moment of revelation only to end abruptly and without much to hang your hat on, so to speak.",6,0,0,29 April 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Good movie but not as good as the Damon films.
","Though The Bourne Legacy doesn't quite live up to the original Bourne Trilogy it is still an outstanding movie in its own right. For one, Jeremy Renner does an absolutely phenomenal job. While I don't think the character development or acting is necessarily up to par with Matt Damon, I think he more than legitimizes the film. I also thought that Rachel Weisz did a solid job and Edward Norton provided a decent villain for the movie. In addition to the acting and character development, the plot developed superbly. I thought making this film coincide with the Bourne trilogy was genius. Honestly, the only elements of the movie I didn't enjoy were the general lack of action and the outlandish aspects of some of the action sequences. These two poor aspects coupled together to really hurt the movie because it would start to drag but then when action would finally happen it would sometimes be silly. Still, this movie is definitely worth watching... just don't expect it to be as good as the first three.",7,2,5,16 December 2012
22 Jump Street," A repeat of the reboot.
","22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise. Why does that not matter all that much? Because in this laugh-filled comedy, they actually mock that fact multiple times where they tear down the 4th wall and don't even care. Sure, I felt that they overdid it a bit with this, as well as the exaggerated homosexual innuendos, but the good still far outweighed the bad. Like the last film, the sequences were outrageous but funny and the acting was just dude-bro enough to be spot on for what they were going for. Expanding Ice Cube's role was also a smart idea, as was the casting of the stunning Amber Stevens. It astounds me that she hasn't had more success in her acting career. Overall though, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll like this movie too because 22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise... see what I did there?",7,0,1,1 January 2015
Kick-Ass," Refreshing take on the superhero concept.
","Kick-Ass is one of the best 'superhero' movies ever. I put quotes around the word 'superhero' because it is not your traditional superhero film. The entire concept behind it is very unique and refreshing, the characters are not archetypal at all, the acting is good enough, and the style is very in-your-face. Granted, that in-your-face, overly graphic and profane style will certainly rub many people the wrong way. This is not a film for everyone. The only weak element of the film, and it's also part of its strength, is the ridiculousness of certain scenes and action sequences. I can't know it for that because the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously is also part of its appeal but there are times when aggravation occurs. Overall, this is a great movie that, while everyone won't enjoy, those that do will certainly love it.",9,1,1,20 August 2013
Lincoln," Very good movie with incredible acting.
","This was a very good movie. Daniel Day-Lewis does an incredible job as he portrays Abraham Lincoln and the rest of the impressive cast does just as well. Truthfully, this was a character and acting driven movie and it had to have been in order to work. The only real negatives to the film, in my opinion, were the length and the slightly misleading name. Regarding the length of the movie, don't get me wrong, I LOVE long films IF they're done well (Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc.). While this movie was done well, it easily could've been 15-20 minutes shorter without missing anything critical (which cannot necessarily be said by LOTR or Braveheart). The other thing I mentioned was the misleading name. Obviously Lincoln is still the protagonist but a more accurate title to the movie would've been 'The 13th Amendment' because that's the entire focus of the film. Personally, I expected this film to be more like a condensed version of the John Adams mini-series and the title and previews are the reason why. Nonetheless, this was a good movie with fantastic acting and cinematography and I think most people would really enjoy it.",8,2,6,8 December 2012
Big Hero 6," One of the best animated films ever made!
","Big Hero 6 is hands down one of the best animated films I've ever seen and maybe the best non-Pixar film since The Lion King. The realism in the animation, while not losing the charm associated with the genre, is stunning, the humanity and emotion in the film is superior to most live action films you'll see, and the story is fresh and entertaining. It combines humor with sadness with action to make for an exciting viewing experience. They also make you absolutely love Baymax, the big, white, puffy looking marsh mellow robot in all the advertisements. Overall, this movie is suitable for people of all ages, genders, cultural backgrounds, etc. Jump into San Fransokyo and get ready for a great film.",10,63,96,22 March 2015
Brave," Good but not great.
","I thought Brave was a very good and enjoyable family movie, but it didn't quite live up to it's Pixar brethren. For one, it felt incredibly short. I know the time listing says 93 minutes but I honestly doubt it was much more than 80 minutes. I have a feeling that '93' number is including the short film that preceded Brave called 'La Luna'. That was probably 5-10 minutes so that would seem more accurate. Also, the previews didn't do a very good job at representing the movie. The previews made it seem like the protagonist, Merida, would become overwhelmed and then run away from home. During this adventure, she would 'find herself' by overcoming various obstacles during the course of the film. While this was partly true, the 'adventure' lasted about 5 minutes and didn't lead her to any form of self discovery. Instead, she ended up back home and the path the movie took from here wasn't all that entertaining. The movie looked incredible and the voice acting was great but the plot just didn't unfold in the way I thought it should've. Still, this was a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.",7,2,3,23 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great movie!
","'I AM GROOT!' There, that's my review. Lol, in all seriousness, Guardians of the Galaxy was a fantastic movie. First of all, it was absolutely hilarious. The only superhero movie to date that I think rivals it in pure humor is Thor 2 but that was largely thanks to one person, Kat Dennings. This film has great laughs thanks to every character. From Peter Quill constantly fighting his ego to Gamora's 'who put the sticks up their butt' misunderstanding to Drax not being able to understand metaphors to Rocket's abrasive edge to Groot's incredible dialogue, they all provide laughing moments throughout the film. The action sequences were done really well, as is to be expected from Marvel these days. The plot also unfolded nicely. I was worried in the beginning that they were trying to stretch the audience's attention too thin and have too many plot elements going on at once but they merged fairly quickly and developed well. I still would've preferred for this element of the Marvel universe to stay separate from the Avengers but hey, it's still very entertaining.",9,1,5,3 August 2014
Jurassic World," Solid way to reinvigorate this franchise.
","Jurassic World was a great way to reinvigorate this film franchise. The first two were incredible but the third film left a sour taste in most people's mouths so this movie had a lot on its plate. If it flopped it would've certainly been the end to this franchise for a long time until years down the road Hollywood gave it the inevitable remake treatment. However, if it succeeded in delivering a quality product that fans would enjoy, the sky was the limit. Well, lucky for us fans, it delivered a really good film. With regards to the cast, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do a great job as the male and female lead counterparts; Vincent D'Onofrio once again takes the role of the villain and he does so masterfully; Jake Johnson provides great comedic relief throughout the film (maybe too frequently to be honest); to be frank, the only weak part of the cast were the two child leads. In what has become an unfortunate cliché in this franchise, children were given too large of a role and they couldn't deliver the necessary emotions. The first film got lucky there... more often than not, banking a large portion of your film on the capabilities of child actors is a mistake. Thankfully this was not a movie entirely reliant on acting so it wasn't a grave error but trying to emulate the magic of the first definitely hurt the movie a bit. The film also failed to deliver quite the same edge-of-your-seat thriller experience that the first two did. A lot of that had to do with any sense of unknown being eliminated almost immediately. In the first movies, you rarely caught a glimpse of the 'villains' (T-Rex or the Raptors) during the build-up of the suspense. This helped create a certain tension that really captured you. This movie doesn't manage to do that at all. Instead, Jurassic World is an action movie that has dinosaurs, humor, and solid acting. Essentially it felt like a 21st century superhero movie but instead of Iron-Man or Captain America it had Velociraptors and an Indominus Rex. The problem is, it shouldn't be that type of movie at all. Nonetheless, the action, the nods to the original film (which was probably my favorite part of the movie), and the dinosaurs devouring people makes this worth the price of entry. Just don't go in expecting it to building on the originals.",7,5,16,4 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another great MCU experience!
","Age of Ultron, like most of the Marvel films, was absolutely fantastic. The combination of action, progression of the already intriguing story arc and character development, special effects, and humor make for a great viewing experience. I thought the additions of the new characters were executed well and Whedon somehow managed once again to give every character their fair share of screen time. There were only really two disappointments I had with the movie at both happened in the very end. The first is that there was zero integration with the Agents of SHIELD television show. I thought that final scene where they're introducing the 'new team' would've been the perfect opportunity to at least have a Colson cameo at the minimum. The other scene was when SHIELD came in at the end for support at Falcon was nowhere to be seen. Sorry but that would've been the perfect time to transition him with War Machine and the rest. Those disappointments aside, the only other elements that weren't perfect fall within the suspension of disbelief. Overall, another wonderful installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10,1,8,22 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Simply amazing!
","The Dark Knight is definitely one of the darkest Superhero films of all-time. What Nolan has accomplished with this series is nothing short of remarkable. Some people say the movie is too long but hey, most great movies are. Heath Ledger's role as the Joker was fascinating. How he was able to totally and completely transform into the ultimate villain shows what an incredible actor he was. He was able to perfectly capture exactly why the Joker is the best villain ever in exposing the dynamic between the Joker and Batman's relationship. Christian Bale and the rest of the cast was phenomenal as well and the acting was superb from top to bottom. There were a few disappointments. The first was that Katie Holmes was by Maggie Gyllenhaal. It breaks up the continuity from the first film and let's face it, Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't attractive at all. Are you seriously telling me there weren't any other pretty and talented brunettes in Hollywood who could replace Katie? If you're going to replace someone in a film series, which I truly hate doing, always upgrade. Secondly, I was really disappointed with Two-Face's quick departure. In the canon, other than the joke, Two-Face is the ultimate villain against Batman. Yes, it felt right in the movie so I can't hold that against it but as a fan of the lore, it was a bit of a disappointment for sure. The last thing is that the plot felt more unrealistic in this film than in the last one. Most of the major plot points rely on unreliable or fantastical elements. These are all within my suspension of disbelief for the film but Batman Begins didn't contain as much of this. All in all, amazing movie and truly the best superhero sequel of all-time. RIP Heath Ledger.",10,0,4,7 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Would've been perfect if not for one error:
","This was easily the best movie of the set to this point. They changed a lot from the book but almost all of them worked well in the scope of the film. The acting was the best it's been yet, the plot developed really well, and the darker cinematic vibe was perfect for how Harry was feeling throughout the book. Honestly, there was really only one negative and it's something they changed from the book so if you haven't read it you might not mind at all. As I said before, 'almost all' of the changes worked well. This particular change, however, is being looking over. In my opinion, the most intensely emotional and dramatic sequence in all of the first five books happens in Dumbledore's office after they all returned from the Ministry of Magic. In that moment, the emotions of what took place at the ministry almost literally pour out of the pages. The director felt, I suppose, that this gut wrenching portion of the book was sufficiently covered in a mere 30 seconds of filming where Harry and Dumbledore barely scratch the surface of what occurred in the actual book. I think this scene should've met the book completely. Only then could they have done it justice. Without that flaw, however, the movie would've been darn near perfect. I hope the movies continue to get better and better.",9,0,2,3 June 2012
Elysium," People are crazy if they think this is a good movie.
","What a disappointing movie Elysium turned out to be. Let's start with the one positive. The concept for the film is fantastic. The idea for an elitist group of society to be separated like that isn't necessarily original but there's a lot of potential there. Matt Damon and the rest of the cast is also pretty solid (other than Jodie Foster who sucks at life). The special effects and CGI are also pretty top notch but that's about the end of the positives. All of the other features combine to create an almost suckfest of a movie. The most glaring is the identity crisis suffered throughout the almost 2 hours. There are certain technologies in the film that would make Avatar jealous and on the other hand, there are things that we have right now. There doesn't appear to be any sense or logic to it, it's just variable and irregular and it kills the suspension of disbelief, which let's face it, this movie hinges desperately on. The plot is also ridiculously predictable and none of the characters are developed well. Overall, should've and could've been better with a quality director.",4,0,2,15 February 2014
Reservoir Dogs," Overrated.
","This is your perfect example of people liking something strictly because it's different. Other than the acting, which was actually very good, everything else about the movie was mediocre. Quentin Tarantino thinks that you can simply use chaos to replace good storytelling and that's just not the case. This is a cult classic but like most of those, it's majorly overrated. Outside of the opening scene, nothing about the movie was entertaining in any way and really could've been told just as well in 20 minutes. Honestly, that's what Tarantino does. He takes a 15 minute story and fools the audience into thinking it's a halfway decent movie by using over an hour of fluff to fill out time between the constant back-and-forth of the plot. The acting and the opening scene earned the movie a 5/10. Anything more than that and people are just lying to themselves because they want to feel part of the cult following. Then again, I'm pretty sure we have a name for people like that nowadays and they're called hipsters. Isn't it ironic.",5,1,3,21 September 2012
Jack Reacher," Great film.
","Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. I went in thinking, thanks to some slightly misleading trailers, that this was going to be a high octane action movie with a bunch of gun fights, car chases, and explosions but little development and quality. I was completely wrong. While there were a few gun fights, one car chase, and an explosion of sorts, it was done in a completely different manner and was more of an action thriller. Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of a 'thinking movie' than I anticipated. That being said, the turns in the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists but nothing that really hurt the movie-watching experience. All-in-all, I'd say this was a great movie that most people would very much enjoy watching.",9,93,123,11 May 2013
Les Misérables," Best musical I've ever seen!
","Anyone actually telling you that this movie isn't amazing, just ignore them. Some people don't care for musicals so I understand them not enjoying this film but people actually trying to break down reasons for why this movie wasn't great are just morons. Les Misérables is probably the most intense and dramatic musical I've ever seen. The acting, especially at the top with Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe was Oscar worthy. I haven't seen an entire theater cry that much in my life. Sure, Titanic made just about every cry but that was one scene at the very end. There were probably 5 or 6 scenes throughout Les Mis that were so moving, there were sniffles all around. The singing was also very impressive. Jackman is an all-around star and this movie proves that much. I was also really impressed with Crowe and Hathaway. They're not as polished as Jackman but their voices, and how they acted out their roles, fit perfectly. The only actor who came up short was Amanda Seyfried but even she did a commendable job and the character of Cosette wasn't featured as much as the others. I thought the cinematography, the part of the movie the haters are trying to attack because they can't attack any other element, was also perfectly fine. Overall, this was one of the three best movies I saw all year and, personally, I think Anne Hathaway deserves an Academy Award for Best Actress because she was fantastic. I understand not everyone appreciates musically driven films but if you do, this movie is definitely worth spending the movie to see in theaters.",10,2,5,28 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not as good as the book.
","This was a really well done movie. I was really intrigued to see how well they would portray the book on film and I must say, they did a fantastic job. There were undoubtedly some major and minor differences but I felt almost all of these were perfectly fine. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. For one, I understand you can't add everything and that some things might have to be changed in order to make the movie work but if that's the case, why add things that are completely unnecessary? For example, the moving stairs. As for the things taken out or changes, I have no problem with all of them, except one. In the end when they're making their way through the various challenges, they took out Snape's potion riddle. To me, that was the second most important and memorable challenge of them all behind the chess challenge. This would've only added another minute or two and should've been included in the movie. Nonetheless, this was a well done book-to-movie adaptation. The acting of some of the students left a little to be desired but it wasn't too bad and I've heard it improves as they, and the book/movies age.",7,0,0,26 May 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good but not great.
","This movie easily has the most changes in terms of book-to-movie out of the four movies thus far. However, while there were many changes, this is also based on an incredibly long book so I totally expected it. Out of the changes, however, only one really bugged me. I hated what they did with Dumbledore's character. After Harry's name gets called by the goblet, he goes absolutely berserk in the movie and even shoves Harry. This never even almost happens in the book and is so outside of the character established already that it felt wrong. Nonetheless, if I try and look at it strictly from a moviegoer's perspective, it was probably the best of the movies so far. The acting was better than in the prior three, the plot progressed more smoothly, and the effects seemed better... especially the dragon sequence. While I wish they would've stuck more closely to the great book, they did do it justice. I would say I only deducted 2 points from the 10/10 maximum for the change to Dumbledore's character and for the fact that there seemed to be a couple of points in the movie where I would've missed what was happening if not for having read the book already. It's easy to get ahead of the movie somewhat if you already know the entire story so I might be exaggerating this effect somewhat but I thought it stood out. Still, this was a very good movie and I look forward to finishing the series.",8,0,1,1 June 2012
Thor," Great film.
","Like the rest of the Avengers films, this movie was fantastic. I thought Chris Hemsworth did a great job in his portrayal of Thor and the rest of the cast was great. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The action sequences were done great and I loved how well this film tied in with the others in the universe. The little nods towards Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were subtle yet really well played. I thought Loki's motives were a little shaky, especially considering that it's the entire foundation of the movie. Nonetheless, the rest of the plot develops really nicely and the film gets a bit of everything from action to drama to romance to suspense. If you can suspend your disbelief enough to accept the premise of the film, I think this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable.",9,1,2,29 May 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Not as good as the book.
","This movie, like the first, was very well done. Also like the first one, there were some major and minor differences; however, not all of these seemed to work as well. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. The most glaring example is how they butchered the ending of the movie. That didn't happen even remotely that way in the book. They made the Harry Potter character look kind of dumb with the way he reacted in the chamber whereas in the book, the things that happened weren't necessarily in his control and he had to react in certain ways in order to survive. Also, they cut out quite a bit of the process Harry, Ron, and Hermione took in discovering the secret. Still, they ultimately got the gist of the book and didn't really leave out anything too major. The acting of the students was drastically improved so the movie flowed smoother. I just thought they could've done a much better job with the book-to-movie adaptation.",7,0,0,26 May 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," A bit overrated but still a good movie.
","Zero Dark Thirty was not the movie I expected. I went in expecting more of an international thriller involving the capture of Osama Bin Laden but the movie has much more of a crime drama feel to it. It's very slow and has almost no action whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing it's just not what I expected based on the trailers for the film. I will also say this: The critics have highly overrated this film. Now don't get me wrong, I do not mean to make this review sound negative because I thought it was a really well made movie. The acting, especially by Jessica Chastain was superb. She's truly one of the best female actresses out there and I expect her to have many more leading roles in the near future. I also thought that the way the movie focused on her struggles to fight for her stance was well done. Lastly, I loved how the film ignored any political bias whatsoever. I was worried that there would be a slight liberal slant in the film and I didn't think there was any. With the way media is today, that was refreshing. The only negatives I had were that the ending wasn't done as well as it could've been and didn't feel like it fit with the tone of the movie. Also, the director decided to break up the movie into chapters for some reason and that was a terrible decision. The film flowed just fine without it but that added an episodic element that made a long movie feel even longer. Nonetheless, it was a good movie that was enjoyable, albeit long, to watch.",8,3,7,1 February 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," One of the most original sci-fi films I've ever seen.
","All You Need Is Kill, Edge of Tomorrow, Live Die Repeat, I really don't care what you call it, bottom line, this movie was absolutely incredible. It's probably one of the most original plots I've ever read, seen, or experienced in any medium and Hiroshi Sakurazaka is genius for coming up with such an incredible story. Even with a great story, movies have been known in the past to not succeed in delivering on the fantastic plot. Luckily, Doug Liman executed the story arc to perfection and Tom Cruise and the stunning Emily Blunt were flawless. These two essentially carry the entire film and display great chemistry in the process. The action sequences are done well and the cinematography is excellent. Honestly, there's not a single flaw in the film, no matter how hard I try to find one. Yes, it is science fiction, not only from an alien perspective but also because the entire film is based on the concept of a time looping paradox, so there is an element of suspended disbelief that is required in order to enjoy the film. That being said, I think this movie did as good a job as any I can recall at staying true to the concept. Overall, this might have been the best film of 2014. Unfortunately the marketing team failed miserably at giving it the exposure it deserved. Additionally, the ending may have confused some who are not well versed in science fiction. Here is a great breakdown of the ending and what I think makes the most sense (the first explanation): http://screenrant.com/edge-of-tomorrow-ending-spoilers-time-travel/2/",10,0,3,28 November 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Typical Ferrell movie.
","In typical Will Ferrell fashion, Anchorman combines childish and over-the-top humor with very crude and profane humor and delivers some really funny scenes. Where the film fails to deliver, however, is in anything remotely resembling a well developing plot. A anchorman is on top of the world, gets intimidated when his girlfriend becomes his co-anchor, gets fired for being an idiot, hits rock bottom, and then gets rehired after saving the day. There, that's the entire movie. The other 90 of the 94 minutes is the humor I was referring to. If you don't mind it, you'll find some laughs and probably find the film a worthwhile watch. If not, you'll likely wish you could get back that hour and a half. Personally, I find myself somewhere in the middle, but leaning more towards finding the laughs worthwhile. It's a good movie to watch and laugh at with friends, that's about it.",6,0,0,28 December 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Worst of the series.
","Unfortunately each successive installment of this Hobbit trilogy not only failed to build on the previous film but actually left even more to be desired. Yes, this is the film where the resolution finally comes to fruition. Yes, they did a fantastic job connecting this trilogy to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy through this film. Yes, the action sequences, the special effects, and the acting were all top notch. But I can't help but feel like this movie just missed in a few key areas. The characters, for example, feel less authentic than in the previous films and, being that this is the movie where a lot of death and tragedy occurs, you're not connected or attached to them because of that. It also didn't have that key character who carries the movie. While Bilbo was this trilogies Frodo and they carry the narrative, neither actually carried the film through the action. In the LOTR films, Aragorn and Legolas did that. The problem with this trilogy is that Thorin is no Aragorn and Legolas isn't featured enough to compensate for that. You end up with Dwarfs without sufficient development and essentially faceless elves and humans and none of it connects to the viewer on an emotional level. That being said, I think this movie, when marathoned with the previous installments, will resonate better. I just don't think it stood alone enough to live up to the epic standard already established in the universe.",7,0,2,27 December 2014
Shooter," Great movie.
","This is a great movie and goes to show once again that the critics really have no idea what they're talking about. They seemed to get too caught up in the politics of the film but that's really just a minor part in what is mainly just your good ole action movie. If they didn't like guns and blood, don't watch a rated R movie called shooter. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic and the supporting cast is also great. Michael Pena and Danny Glover are both really good and Kate Mara is amazing. She's definitely one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. The gun element is really nice to watch also. The plot develops well and the story flows nicely. Honestly, the only flaws in the film for me are the sometimes corny dialogue and a few minor errors. Overall Shooter is a great movie that action film fans will certainly enjoy.",8,1,1,28 June 2013
Taken 2," Phenomenal Sequel
","I absolutely loved the first film and was concerned that they were just throwing together a money-grab with this sequel. The trailers all made it look like it was the exact same movie all over again. That couldn't have been further from the truth. Sure, it had a similar feel in terms of cinematic elements and action style but the plot was completely different and yet it tied into the first movie really well. I can't give the film a perfect rating because it felt like it lacked the same unique experience that made the first one so special. That's probably not fair but it's the truth nonetheless. I noticed that a lot of people disliked or were disappointed by this movie for some reason. That reason escapes me because I thoroughly enjoyed it and would think that anyone who loved the first movie would enjoy this movie too. While it doesn't quite match the first one, give it a shot... you won't be disappointed.",9,0,1,16 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Movie of the Year!
","The Dark Knight Rises is absolutely amazing and, in my opinion, the movie of the year. Yes, that means I thought it was even better than The Avengers which, in and of itself was also incredible. Batman Begins is still my favorite superhero movie of all-time but this film matches The Dark Knight if not surpassing it by a hair. I'm big on plot and character development so that's the only potential negative I can give the first Dark Knight. It felt more like an action based movie and got away a bit from the development of the Bruce Wayne character. Well this movie returns to furthering the development of the protagonist to a very in depth level. It of course also had the amazing plot development, action sequences, and dark realism of the first two that made this trilogy as a whole the best set of films in superhero history.I'm not going to lie, I had some concerns about this movie going in. The first concern was the selection of Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway as Bane and Selena Kyle/Catwoman, respectively. Well, just like Heath Ledger, these surprising selections turned out to be perfect for how the characters were portrayed. As villains go, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best villain in cinema history as far as I'm concerned but Tom Hardy's Bane comes incredibly close. The only negative I would say here is that there were a few scattered moments where his dialogue was fairly difficult to understand. I think they could've cleaned that up a bit more. Now Catwoman, WOW! I thought Anne Hathaway did an absolutely amazing job here. I honestly think she was by far the best catwoman yet and I don't think she could've done a better job. Kudos to Christopher Nolan once more for seeing what so many other people couldn't.As I said before, the action sequences were stunning as usual. There's nothing new there. One thing I will say that I loved, as with the first two, is how realistic they manage to keep a lot of the fighting and action scenes. Along with the overall darker tone, the realism has really made this series more enjoyable than ever. The ultimate judge for this movie, though, is how well the plot unravels before your eyes. The first two movies each had pretty intriguing twists and turns that were somewhat unexpected but they don't touch this one in that regard. The discoveries of Talia al Ghul's and Robin's characters, Bane's origin and purpose, Catwoman's development (in addition to Batman's as mentioned prior), and all of the tie-ins that round out the trilogy were incredible. Plus, the way the ending unfolds in truly remarkable and writing it here just wouldn't do it justice. I will say this though; I can't wait for the next one, if and when they make it ;)",10,1,4,21 July 2012
Iron Man," A few flaws but great nonetheless!
","Hands down one of the best superhero movies ever made. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man and the rest of the cast is great as well. They give life to the characters and are all amazing actors. The action sequences were done really well also. This movie has humor, drama, action, romance, intensity, and is told well. The only real issue with the plot itself is that there are a few major plot holes towards the end. For example, how is Obadiah able to see what Pepper downloaded from the computer, check on the progress of his own suit, and then get to Tony's house before Pepper even has a chance to call Tony? Another thing, how does Obadiah get into Tony's house so easily in the first place? Wouldn't you think a genius billionaire like Tony Stark has a halfway decent security system or that Jarvis would've notified Tony? Lastly, how is Obadiah able to master the nuances of his suit immediately without having any trial phase? It took Tony quit a while to master his suit's various functions and yet Obadiah was able to do this right away. These things take away from the movie and prevent it from being a perfect 10/10 but the film was still great. If you're willing to overlook a few flaws then you'll enjoy this a lot.",9,2,3,24 May 2013
Monsters University," Not as good as the first but still decent.
","Monsters University is a pretty decent movie but it lacks a lot of the charm the first film had. I think a lot of that has to do with how original the story was initially and how that unique element is lost a bit in further iterations. I think Boo provided a lot of the charm in the first movie as well. It wasn't so obvious until watching a movie without her. Obviously Mike and Sully were both great but the competition with which the film is built upon feels a little weak. I know, it's a children's movie, but that's kind of the problem. While Monsters, Inc. was a film that the adults could appreciate, this one is more of a pure kiddy flick. It's still entertaining to a certain extent but without a lot of the depth from the first one, it's ultimately just a fun kids movie and not much more.",6,1,2,16 November 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Simply amazing!
","Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really 'hurt' the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.",10,6,11,11 November 2013
Lucy," Laughable premise but slightly entertaining nonetheless.
","While the premise and concept of this film is absolutely ridiculous, the special effects laughable, and the plot without actual resolution, the movie still finds a way to be at least slightly entertaining. I think that mostly stems from Scarlett Johansson doing a great job with the character and the movie, however outlandish, is actually a little bit interesting. It still isn't worth your time but it isn't a complete waste of time and being under and hour and a half guarantees that if you feel that it is, at least it didn't waste much of it. I do feel that they missed an opportunity to make a great movie though. There is a time between the film starting and Lucy becoming a superhero/magician/Neo that I thought we had a real gem on our hands. Unfortunately they left reality at the door and chose to make a borderline comedy instead.",4,2,7,12 February 2015
Flight," Not amazing but still pretty good.
","If you're judging this movie purely on the various elements of cinematic categories (such as acting, production value, plot development, etc.) it's an incredible movie. Denzel Washington delivers one of his best performances and that's saying something because he's one of the best there is or has ever been. The supporting cast of Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, and John Goodman is fantastic as well. The special effects were also done incredibly well. The plane crash was impressive and looked amazingly realistic. The movie, while really long, didn't drag either because the plot developed well and the characters felt authentic. So why the just pretty good rating? Because what's the purpose of a movie? To me it is to be entertained and I have always had trouble enjoying a film when the protagonist is such a detestable character, which Washington's was. There was also quite a bit of completely unnecessary nudity. Sure, Nadine Velazquez is absolutely breathtaking but was that opening scene really necessary? It seemed forced and more for shock effect than anything else. Nonetheless, this was still a very good movie and I think most people would enjoy it.",7,1,3,20 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Magnificent conclusion to this epic story!
","An amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the Harry Potter series. Of course, the books were far superior in every way but these last couple of movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind every scene which the earlier films couldn't quite do. The acting continued to improve in every film as did the development of the overall story arc and characters. I also felt like this was the best movie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully engage in the story. Overall, I am very glad that I was able to complete the book series and films. This entire process has been an enjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of entertainment, isn't it? To enjoy it? That's always been my belief and this story was absolutely captivating. I can't wait until the next time I can make it to Universal Studios to check out what I've heard is an amazing job at recreating the environment. Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing premium entertainment for my mind!",10,1,2,16 June 2012
Pitch Perfect," Kendrick disappoints but the supporting cast carries this movie.
","Pitch Perfect was genuinely funny and didn't take itself too seriously. The musical arrangements were actually pretty decent though and the comedic elements were not traditional at all making them even more humorous. The only things that hold hack the film, in my opinion, are the generic plot and Anna Kendrick's lack of any charisma whatsoever. The plot is the exact same as almost every single other music, dance, etc. movie made in the last decade: Protagonist joins team/club/group that is struggling, they go through bumps along the way, protagonist either quits or comes close to quitting, protagonist gives it one last go and helps the team/club/group achieve their ultimate goal all while experiencing relationship issues throughout. As for Anna Kendrick, I think this movie showed that, while she's talented, she's not capable of being the focus of any movie. Characters like Fat Amy distract the audience from Kendrick's utter lack of charisma or charm. Honestly, her character is one of the least interesting characters in the entire film. Regardless, this movie is still worth watching because of the humor alone and the musical arrangements are a nice bonus.",7,0,3,27 December 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Great movie
","Now this is what a book-to-film adaptation is supposed to be like. Catching Fire might be the best interpreted example I've ever seen. The director, Francis Lawrence, seemed to really understand that books, unlike the previous director, Gary Ross, who seemed to miss some key symbolism. Lawrence cuts certain elements from the books, as well as some scenes and characters entirely, but he doesn't miss almost any key sequences that give meaning to the story. The only thing I wish he would've made more like the book was Katniss Everdeen's interaction with Plutarch Heavensbee. In the book, there was a tiny bit of foreshadowing that I would've liked to see in the film. But that's it. That's the only thing in the entire book that was left out that should've potentially been included. That just amazes me how on point they were here. The increased budget also showed. The effects were better, as was the acting. Obviously Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress but the rest of the cast also did remarkably well (Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Jena Malone, Lenny Kravitz, etc.). Bottom line, regardless of whether or not you read the books, this movie stands alone as an outstanding viewing experience. I can't wait to see how they portray the third book.",9,0,16,23 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential.
","Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential. The first flaw in the film is that the protagonist of the film was a miserable fail because Aaron Taylor-Johnson simply cannot act. Sure, he did great in Kick-Ass but the reality is that those films are more silly in nature. Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes that were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it. Making his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible acting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the film was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to add intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film. Honestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was about 30 minutes shorter. Johnson's lack of acting ability wouldn't have been so pronounced and the ridiculousness of the unrealistic drama wouldn't have existed. Those two adjustments and now we have a legitimately awesome Godzilla film.",6,2,3,28 November 2014
Looper," Fantastic movie.
","Such a surprising cinematic experience. I was apprehensive before watching because most movies dealing with time travel completely butcher it and make the movie seem more silly than anything. Thankfully, Looper did a very good job with it. They didn't try to explain anything about the science of it, which I was fine with, but I felt that they nailed the concept. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job, not only acting but as portraying a young Bruce Willis. Obviously the make-up department deserves credit for the look but JGL mastered all of the mannerisms and the style of talking. Very impressive performance on his behalf. And I love Emily Blunt so her being in the film is a nice bonus, plus it's nice to see her take on a slightly different role from her typical typecast. The only negative in the film, in my opinion, was the telekinesis element. I thought it was a really silly aspect of the film and didn't need to be in there at all. The Rainmaker, could've easily been portrayed to be a genius child, not a borderline superhuman. That's really the only part of the film that was mediocre. Looper is definitely a movie that I think most people would enjoy. Some will probably find it challenging to follow but those that follow it well will surely consider it entertaining.",9,0,2,15 January 2013
Fast Five," Great film.
","Fast Five was awesome. It was essentially Fast and the Furious meets Oceans 11 except with more explosions. There wasn't as much car action as there was in the past movies (1 and 3 especially) but that really didn't hurt the movie much. Like the prior installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, this one featured a really good story, impressive action, solid acting, and some unfortunately unrealistic aspects (like determining the identity of someone by using mediocre traffic cameras to read their eyes or face through a mask) that were the only real negatives of the film. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was a beast and a great addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Vin Diesel was epic. I wish they would've shown some of the car chases that they left out (Dom and Brian acquiring the Porsche for example) but I suppose they felt the movie was already too long. I also thought the brief cameo in the after-credits scene by two females from movies past was a cool touch but I truly do with they would've ended the story with this film instead of extending out the franchise. Regardless, it was definitely a good movie and most would really enjoy it.",9,2,3,6 June 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," Better than expected.
","Mad Max: Fury Road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip. Yeah, that happens.",7,1,4,24 October 2015
Warm Bodies," Surprisingly entertaining.
","Warm Bodies is a surprisingly entertaining movie from beginning to end. I think these writers need to get with the program. Making serious, dark zombie movies just doesn't work. The best zombie movies have been light-hearted movies that don't take themselves too seriously like this one and Zombieland. This film had plenty of humor, some solid acting, and a unique twist on the clichéd zombie apocalypse concept. Here we have a zombie, played very well by Nicholas Hoult, who for some reason is drawn to human things and not just because he wants to eat their brains. This takes a turn when he sees Teresa Palmer's character and somehow falls in love. Looking at her it's easy to see why. She looks like a combination of Hayden Panettiere and Kristen Stewart but more attractive than either one. I truly hope she gets more roles because the camera loves her almost as much as R did. Back to the movie, throughout the rest of the film she essentially reteaches R how to be human and he begins to adapt over time. When this phenomenon begins to spread, the human population has an interesting situation on their hands. Overall, was this movie realistic at all? Of course not, but it's a zombie movie. Analyzing the film for plot holes or anything like that would be just silly. If you want a fun movie- watching experience, however, it's worth checking out.",8,0,1,9 September 2013
