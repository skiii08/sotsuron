It," Outstanding!
","Absolutely brilliant remake of this Stephen King classic. Right from the outset, IT will have you in the edge of your seat with all its suspense and toe-curling scenes. The visual effects are outstanding for a horror film. The new portrayal of Pennywise the Dancing Clown makes the character more scary and mysterious than the previous 1990 portrayal. A must watch film for any horror fan!",8,4,10,10 September 2017
"Monsters, Inc."," 'There is only one word to describe this film, and thats 'Brilliant'' A Must See
","There is only one word to describe this film, and thats 'Brilliant'. I was searching through my old VHS collection when I found this movie. I just forgot how good it actually was. The Toy Story soon to be' trilogy is better, but yet to me nothing animated will enter that league as thats timeless, but this film is certainly a fresh idea. The film is well written and appealing to its target audience. It would be great if there was a sequel about what happened after Laugh power took over. To be honest, if I could put my top five pixar films in order it would go 1.Toy Story/Toy Story 2 2.'Monster inc' and 3.Wall-E. Overall: Despite me watching this film for the first time in 7 years on a worn down video tape, it did not spoil the quality of the film. I would recommend it to any Toy story fan out there for something different, if they haven't already watched this phenomenon. It would look Fantastic in 1080p High Def on a shiny new blu-ray disc, partly the reason why i'm upgrading to blu-ray soon. A must see",9,0,1,23 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Okay, decent. 3-D was terrible
","Watched this film In 3-D at Local Cinema. i have to say, compared to all the Disney Films I have watched and owned (Both VHS and DVD), This film is probably the worst. The Real-D 3D Technoligy really did not work as most of the film seemed to be in 2D. However, I did enjoy most of the film but really as Disney films are supposed humorous and I didn't really laugh a lot during this Movie. I don't think that I'll be buying this movie on Blu-ray/DVD anytime soon, but I will certainly recommend but not for 3d viewing. Overall, this film was disappointment of a Disney film but not quite an outright disaster.",4,0,1,23 March 2010
