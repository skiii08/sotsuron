Your Name.," One of the Greatest movies i watched in my entire life.
","I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? Even Spirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that. This is a movie that you must watch before you die, really.",10,153,220,3 October 2016
Toy Story 4," Overrated
","I wonder why a lot of people like this, The idea of this film is great but somehow I feel something is off. It's a bit absurd when Bonnie didnt even know that Woody is missing, If we looked back at toy story 3, woody is her favourite toy. Seems like nobody care about woody too, they just let go of him by the decision that he just made for seconds. The friendship lost its meaning. We didn't see the team like the predecessor, its more about woody and bo peep with its typical woman empowerment idea. The friendship used to be the main idea of the movie, especially when they are holding hands to face the fire in toy story 3. Maybe the idea of this film is different, but doesn't mean that you can just throw it away.This movie is about making a decision, woman empowerment (equality), character development, but it seems dull. They keep adding things that happening right now to be seen as a platform that supporting equality, but the story itself is full of plotholes. When we see the first toy story, it become so interesting because how woody handling a toy that didn't know he was a toy, a new and sophisticated toy that believe that he's on the other planet. Its a brilliant premise.",6,3,6,9 July 2019
Mr. Nobody," This film is very personal
","When I told somebody that Mr. Nobody is my favorite film, they haven't watch it. This film is hardly anyone's favorite, so I think this is very personal.
I like Thought provoking films like I Origins, Her, Donnie Darko, Get Out, Memento etc.For me, this film bring me back to a time of my childhood, all of it, the cinematic, the soundtracks, like every aspect of the film, altough I'm asian, the culture is very different, the people looks completely different, but somehow this movie have some sort of relateness to me personally. The imagination of this film is bizzare and somehow remind me being a child, I use to imagine things.For some films like Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterd, and Hateful Eight, they are great movies that I constantly revisited, because I like the tense, the dialogue, the writing, I always found something new everytime I rewatched. But this movie, I rewatched it several times for the feel, the atmosphere, the soundtracks. It's a beautiful movie.",10,0,0,12 April 2020
