Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you're not a true fan you wouldn't understand
","I'm a fan of of the Star Wars series.  Not a follower, not a fanatic, or a fanboy, a fan.  So when I started hearing the reviews being put out by critics, I started to second guess my pre-purchase of the my tickets.  But let me tell you, when I sat down in my seat and started to actually see the masterpiece that Mr. Lucas put together I can tell you it is one of the greatest movies every made.  Not the greatest, but one of the greatest. What the critics don't seem to understand is that Phantom Menace was meant to be a beginning, and to let us know where all the events from episodes IV-VI came from.  So all I can say to those who have not seen it is, go in with a open mind of just seeing a movie, not a spectacular movie event, not a phenomenom, just a movie and I promise you will come out satisfied and astounded what Mr. Lucas has put together for our enjoyment.",5,0,0,20 May 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Quite possibly the best movie ever....
","There's not really much to say about this movie visually it was stunning, the plot was very believable and engrossing and the fighting scenes were examples of cinematic excellence.  Please if you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go see it today.A perfect 10 out of 10.Thanks Ang Lee",Null,0,0,22 January 2001
