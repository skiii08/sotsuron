First Man," Visceral drama imbued with a sense of wonder
","First Man is a triumph. As a warts-and-all biopic of Neil Armstrong, detailing the most important part of his life, I can only speculate as to its authenticity. The main problem with biopics, it seems to me, is that unless there is documented evidence of that person's innermost feelings, it's effectively just guesswork. That's where the drama comes in. What makes a great story like the US/USSR space race come alive is the impact it had on the lives of those most intimately involved. There's little risk of getting it wrong in speculating how a man might feel over the premature death of his young daughter from cancer, or surviving a near-death experience of his own; the emotional strains these things would place on his relationships with family and friends. No, the real strength of this story is not so much laying bare the soul of Neil Armstrong as using his personal experiences to allow us on board the space race itself. Having said that, magnificent though the depictions of NASA's endeavours are in First Man, the main cast really bring it to life and invest the story with a sense of purpose. No one conveys emotional depth through silences better than Ryan Gosling, and Claire Foy was wonderful as the worried wife pushed close to the edge of endurance by the risks her husband was taking, and the emotional distance he kept, seemingly as armour against allowing himself to give up.
Where First Man really ups the ante is in the NASA development testing events, when things went wrong. The accidents in which Neil Armstrong was personally involved were conveyed on the big screen with gut-churning intensity; there's no doubting his courage and coolness under pressure, to be able to think and perform his way out of certain death in those situations. Damien Chazelle's direction places the viewer in the cockpit with Armstrong; you effectively become him at key moments. This intensity is aided and abetted by a superb soundtrack of music and sound effects, the like of which I can't recall experiencing since Interstellar.
The icing on the directorial cake is the 1969 moon landing itself; the way it is done actually creates the sense of wonder and awe which I feel would have been experienced at the time it happened; there is absolutely no feeling of anti-climax as Armstrong and Aldrin step out onto the lunar surface and take it all in. Magnificent.",9,0,1,16 October 2018
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Culturing learnings make benefit my funny bone
","Sacha Baron Cohen's humour tends to divide opinion, which is probably true of any humour. Suffice to say, some people find his work puerile and shallow, but I am not one of those people. If you enjoyed Ali G Indahouse, this film will make you cry with laughter (I know I did). You may just need the proverbial band-aid for your splitting sides. The basic plot is the documented trans-American culture trip of Khazakh journalist Borat, who seeks, along with his producer, to 'make benefit glorious nation of Khazakhstan'. Of course, in true Cohen style, it is a great opportunity for him to use his alter-ego to embarrass, annoy and perplex the various facets of the American public. He sends them up, and his Borat persona, to hilarious effect. The only plot-related device I will allude to is Borat's infatuation with Pamela Anderson, which develops after he sees a snippet of Baywatch in his hotel room. This results in him expanding his itinerary to a trip along Route 66 from New York to Los Angeles. To summarise, if you're a Cohen fan, you'll love it, but even if you aren't you should give it a try....unless you have no sense of humour, in which case you might find yourself in there.",9,1,7,8 May 2007
In Bruges," Who says Belgium is boring?
","I saw In Bruges at the cinema last night, and I haven't enjoyed myself so much in ages. Martin McDonagh's film is apparently a first for him, and on the strength of this work he should be schmoozed or lashed into making a lot more. This story of two hit men in the doghouse, holed up in Bruges for two weeks, is as dark a comedy as I've seen in some time, but it works on every level. This beautifully shot film is a wonderful advert for Bruges, Belgium's touristic jewel in the crown, and is accompanied by an excellent score. Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes (in a very different kind of role from his usual) are all excellent. Gleason's character is a world-weary, almost fatherly figure, who gives the impression that he's ended up being a hit-man almost by accident. Farrell's character is by turns boorish and childish, yet charming and likable at the same time. The language is frequently crude, but fitting to the characters portrayed here. The story has an inevitability about it, and so there may not be too many surprises for the viewer, but it hardly seems to matter. I can't praise this film too highly, and I urge all adults to see it.",9,1,3,23 April 2008
Train to Busan," Zombies on a train
","First we had snakes on a plane, now Korean zombies on a train. Awesome.
Korean cinema is a curious beast; I love the films of Park Chan-Wook, but other contributors have a tendency to get a bit mawkish and oversentimental as the drama unfolds, and I'm afraid that what was otherwise a beautifully paced and entertaining ZOMBIE film ended up this way. I'm all for character development, and being made to care a bit who lives and who dies, but....IT'S A ZOMBIE FILM! It starts out tongue-in-cheek, with some genuinely squirmy horror vibes, and I think it would've been best if it managed that balance throughout, but it lost its way tonally a bit in the last 20 minutes.
Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it, and it will linger in my memory of top zombie films.",7,1,6,31 August 2018
BlacKkKlansman," An important film which also entertains
","When I heard about the bizarre story of a black American cop who apparently infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Colombo, Ohio, I assumed it would be tongue-in-cheek, and possibly 'true' in the same sense as the Coen bros' 'Fargo'. I was taken with the mad Afro hairdos depicted in the trailer. When I heard it was a Spike Lee film, I thought it had a chance of being very good, and happily I wasn't disappointed. For me, BlackkKlansman is a return to top form for Mr Lee.
While it is a very entertaining film, it packs a real punch to the guts at the same time. It feels like a blast from the past with respect to the openly institutional racist attitudes, but sadly by the end we're all reminded that it never really went away, and the white supremacists are just as misguided and dangerous now as they were in the '70's.
John David Washington (son of Denzel) was a revelation. I was intrigued as to why such a talented actor took so long to emerge into the limelight, then I discovered he had a career in NFL first. A talented man, then, just like his father. He shows every sign of successfully emerging from Denzel's shadow and having a blistering acting career of his own. He really owns the role of Ron Stallforth.
Adam Driver was also excellent as Ron Stallworth's colleague and accomplice in face-to-face meetings with Ku Klux Klan members.
I don't know how true to Ron Stallworth's 'memoirs' BlackkKlansman is, but I imagine there will have been some dramatisation to make it more filmic. Having said that, there were a few bits which seemed just a little contrived. Even these moments didn't take me out of the story, though, so the overall feeling I was left with was one of satisfaction, which juxtaposed sharply with the jaw-dropping finale, as I'm sure Spike Lee intended.
If you're not sure this film is your thing, I wasn't sure it would be mine either (I don't usually go in for social conscience stories), but I can't reccommend it highly enough. This just might be the best film you see all year.",9,8,14,31 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's a tough gig, but someone had to do it!
","Well, what a lot of fuss about nothing much. I think Bambi just got shot all over again, folks, judging by the more extreme perspectives on RoS. I mean come on, it's entertainment, not an actual religion. A lot of people really need to go and get a life, because they've obviously got way too much time on their hands.
Okay, my tuppence happeny's worth (not that anyone probably cares for a balanced opinion nowadays)...... Rise of Skywalker is good light entertainment. It sometimes thinks it's weightier than it actually is (a pointless nod to the preciousness of the franchise), and the plotting/storyboarding is fairly weak. It does rather smack of the 'How are we going to finish off the franchise, guys?' question having been posed at the end of Ep VIII, post-production. Having said that, the characterisation is consistent with the previous films, the effects and action sequences are of a very high standard, the acting is decent and, the story is finished off quite neatly within the framework of RoS itself. Some story ideas do feel like they were developed through the last three films (Rey's origins, the malign influence of the Emperor in the background), though I suspect that was an illusion created by the kind of open-ended planning which features heavily in TV shows these days; JJ Abrams has plenty of experience in that regard.
If there was no such thing as the Star Wars franchise, I'd have watched RoS and thought to myself 'the story could've used some work, it was confusing at times, but fine entertainment and top sci-fi action all the same. I'd happily watch it again'.",8,5,18,5 January 2020
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A rollocking roller-coaster of a ride full of sizzling gypsies
","Okay, I made up the bit about sizzling gypsies; pardon my obsession with Blackadder. Peter Jackson's second Hobbit film sets a more adult tone than its predecessor. Gone are the songs, and the comedy moments are rarer. The biggest laughs by far were provided by Bombur (watch out for his barrel moment!). In were multiple beheadings and fatal piercings, and a host of plot developments which deviated from the content of the book substantially. I wouldn't cite this as a flaw; as another reviewer pointed out, the nature of story-telling in cinema is often very different from literary sources, and the director's plot additions are mostly justified in setting the scene for events that are to transpire 60 years hence in Middle-Earth. While some story threads appear frivolous, they are generally done with enough charm that I didn't mind. There is one thing I couldn't quite accept; yes, there was some slightly ropey CGI along the way, but the story carried me along. That wasn't what bothered me. I realise it's a fantasy film, but the laws of physics were apparently laid aside in an extended dragon encounter - flesh would've been crisped, people would probably have been crushed etc. I was reminded of the bombastic and unedifying dinosaur chase scene in King Kong; I'd hoped that Peter Jackson wouldn't make any more errors like that. Putting ridiculous moments on screen is fine for comedic effect (see the aforementioned barrel chase), but when it's meant to be serious, it insults the viewer's intelligence. Now I've got that off my chest, I'll round off with all the things I loved about this film. Up to the dwarfs entering the Lonely Mountain, I would probably have given this film a 10. The dragon is FANTASTIC. The famous moments (barrel escape, spiders) were excellently done, I liked the pacing (I was given the impression it would be relentless, but thankfully there are some quieter moments that give a chance to breathe), I appreciated the Dol Goldur encounters and all related plot- strands that tie the story into the LOTR canon. So, if you didn't like the songs in Hobbit 1, and if you are desperate for more action, and don't mind the plot deviations, you'll probably love this film. If you're a Hobbit purist, you might want to take a pinch of salt in with you.",8,2,6,19 December 2013
The Favourite," Stylish, witty and original period drama
","I have a rapidly growing admiration for Yorgos Lanthimos (it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it) as a director. I recently watched The Lobster, which is one of the most original, bonkers and fabulous films I've seen in a long time. So, quite a bit for Mr Lanthimos to live up to with his most current film, The Favourite.
The story covers a scarsely considered, brief period in British history, the latter days of the reign of Queen Anne, whos failure to produce an heir led to the house of Hanover taking over the British throne. On the face of it, it is hard to imagine how this era could be portrayed in any other light than one of sombre reflection, but the lightness of touch and wit evident here is very refreshing. The three principal characters are all women (Queen Anne played by the excellent Olivia Coleman, her principal political adviser and confidante Lady Marlborough, played by the wonderful Rachael Weisz, and Abigail the desperate newcomer played by the revelatory Emma Stone), which is highly unusual in big-budget film-making (even in this day and age), and the actors who play them are uniformly excellent. Someone I know made a valid point that none of them are terribly likeable characters, but that's sort of missing the point; they existed at a time when men typically dominated every aspect of life, so despite their favoured positions in the pecking order, they could only really exercise their influence on each other. They are also quite complex, 3-dimensional characters, with moods, rational and irrational behaviours, fears and regrets.
The film looks wonderful, with a variety of interesting shots, including a kind of fisheye effect used to great effect, the dialogue frequently sparkles with wit, and there is a lot of humour. Only later on does the tone turn more serious and sad, which reflects the overall change in the state of mind of the queen. The acting ranges from good to superb across the board, and I loved the artifice of the intermissions with Roman numerals and a character quotation, acting as a form of chapter heading; nothing new, but it fits the tone of the film perfectly. The only thing I took issue with was a small aspect of the soundtrack, involving two brief periods dominated by a two-note dirge, with what sounded like a single fiddle note followed by the pluck of a double bass, repeated ad nauseum. Mind you, that's just my personal feeling. Don't let it discourage you from seeing the film - it certainly wouldn't be the first time a bit of soundtrack distracted and annoyed me in a film which was otherwise excellent.",8,3,6,11 January 2019
Children of Men," What happens to society if the human race becomes infertile?
","That is the primary question raised in this film. Male and female fertility problems are steadily on the increase, and while it may be difficult to reconcile the sudden and total loss of fertility in Children of Men with real trends, nonetheless it is a condition that has real potential, and the possibility haunts us all. The scene is 2027, and global civilisation has collapsed after 18 years of human infertility; at least, that is what has happened if the British government are to be believed. They preside over a nation held in the grip of totalitarianism, a police state obsessed with the detrimental effects a wave of immigrant humanity will bring to the 'last bastion of civilisation'. Against this regime are a small but committed group of terrorist revolutionaries who hold a secret that will tear apart the fabric of this fragile society. Children of Men is an excellent example of a neo-futuristic apocalypse. The notion of human infertility has been explored before in The Handmaid's Tale, but the focus in that story was the oppression and 'slavery' of the few women who remained fertile. Children of Men explores the breakdown of society that ensues as its primary subject. It is beautifully shot, the director (Alfonso Cuaron) choosing his shots with precision in almost every scene. The actors all deliver good performances, the script is tight and the scenario in which the people find themselves is utterly believable. Finally, set in 2027, the futurism is pitched to perfection; not so far into the future as to demand huge technological leaps forward, it is restricted to huge advert displays on the sides of buildings, moving image adverts on the sides of buses, and a virtual holocube computer game controlled with finger styluses, the sort of technology that one imagines would be freely available in spite of the obvious collapse of societal infrastructure. These are peripheral things that never interfere with the story. The only flaw that I could level at the film, a common one in films these days, is that there was a discrepancy between the sound levels for the dialogue and the background noise/effects sounds, such that the dialogue sounds muffled and difficult to make out in places. I saw this film on DVD, so it may be that the sound was pitched more evenly at the cinema, but this remains one of the most irritating aspects of home cinema.",9,1,5,8 May 2007
Kong: Skull Island," Whatever happened to Kong?

Swing of the fist to the side to the side To the side to the side to the fist the fist Swing the fist to the side to the side Kong Ammo in the machine gun(apologies to Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV)Okay, this might seem a little bizarre to the average reader, but I just couldn't help myself. Pong...Kong; the transition is obvious. True enough, some of the lyrics in Frank Black's excellent song don't lend themselves terribly well to the subject at hand, but what do I care. I liked Kong: Skull Island, it was a reasonably satisfying old fashioned monster movie, with a heavy dose of Apocalypse Now and a tiny smidgeon of Predator thrown in for good measure (Mr Jackson didn't say 'if it bleeds, we can kill it', but he might as well have). However, it serves less well as a 'sequel' to the 2005 film by Peter Jackson. Firstly, In Kong: Skull Island, which is set approximately 50 years after King Kong, the locals seem to have transformed from menacing, woman-kidnapping, human sacrifice-making people into some kind of enlightened Buddist-lite haven of niceness. Secondly, where are the dinosaurs? They were everywhere the first time round, now just 50 years later (they had clearly survived millions upon millions of years there, let's not forget) they've all mysteriously disappeared! Thirdly, in King Kong, Kong appeared to be on his own (we reason this is why he falls for the charms of Naomi Watts?), but in Kong: Skull Island, we find out Kong had a family but they were all killed by the 'skullcrawlers'....er, hold the phone there for a second. Skullcrawlers? Where the hell did they spring from all of a sudden? Is this Skull Island in a parallel dimension or something? It's the same island, but all the inhabitants seem to have fundamentally changed apart from Kong himself! Except even he has changed - it can't be the same Kong we encountered in King Kong, because of course he was killed in New York. We might accept there was a young kong relative (perhaps a son) who was left behind and grew up to replace him, but how is it that an apparently sole ape produced offspring and continued to rule the roost when the aforementioned dinosaurs (of which there were plenty) all failed to keep breeding? Maybe Plato was onto something after all...did I say Plato? I meant Aristotle. Who's this Plato guy anyway? Just as well it wasn't billed as a sequel, then. I have just one other beef with Kong: Skull Island - character development (or, rather, lack thereof). The poor chaplain seemed to exist only to a) get eaten by a skullcrawler, and b) provide a character for the actor doing Kong's motion-capture performance, a la Andy Sirkis in King Kong; Sirkis' sideshow was much the better- written character, I might add. Most of the survivors barely merited their survivor status, which was a pity - perhaps the monsters didn't like the taste of cardboard. John C Riley's character, Hank Marlow (a WWII US pilot who survived crash-landing on the island), is the primary exception. In fact, he is the beating heart of the film, and his promised survival and reconciliation with civilisation, and his family, are what keep us engaged and rooting for them to escape from Skull Island.",7,4,7,23 March 2017
Centurion," Historical fiction doesn't get more exciting than this
","Centurion is a great film, and I suspect it's going to be totally underrated by the cinema-going public. I saw it at my local Odeon last night, the only cinema in town showing it, and I strongly suspect it won't be on next week. This is an example of a really good British film from a director with a strong pedigree not getting the kind of publicity and public interest that is frequently given to the most heinous rubbish that Hollywood can produce. Granted, many people don't share my director-centric view of forthcoming features; I'm prepared to risk getting my fingers burned occasionally in avidly chasing any films made by a select bunch of my favourite directors, but my approach is usually rewarded with excellence, like Centurion. In structure it is a very simple story, beautifully shot and honestly told. The bloody battles are very realistic - you get a good feel for what it might actually have been like to fight hand-to-hand in ancient times, frantic and deadly. The characters are simply drawn, and develop through their actions rather than words (quite literally in the case of Olga Kurylenko's 'Etain'). There is good and bad on both sides of the conflict, which is true to every war in human history. Ultimately, it offers a quite believable scenario to explain the mysterious historical disappearance of the 9th Legion in Hibernia.",10,224,347,27 April 2010
Iron Man," Marvel superhero movie that packs a punch
","I went to the cinema to see Iron Man not expecting much; I liked the cast already, but it's been a while since I saw a really good summer blockbuster. Anyway, I was blown away by how good it is. Robert Downey Jnr (Robert Stark) was a revelation - I can't imagine anyone else in the role. The usually reliable Gwyneth Paltrow worked wonders with a slim role as Stark's PA, and the package was completed by a shaven-headed and bearded (and almost unrecognisable) Jeff Bridges as the fatherly company VP. This film is a perfect blockbuster - it delivers fast-paced, exciting action, nuanced but light performances, and a story that is never boring or incomprehensible. If you're looking for something profound or life-changing, you won't find it here, but you shouldn't expect to. The hero is a genesis of the journey he makes during the film, and the bad guys do get their comeuppance, but expect (and look forward to) at least one sequel in the next 2 years.",8,1,2,12 May 2008
Jojo Rabbit," Close to perfection
","I knew I was going to love Jojo Rabbit when I saw the trailer and read about the premise, and I was even more certain when I realised it was directed by Taika Waititi. How long does he have to wait for some Oscars or something? The man is a borderline genius.
I suppose some people will never accept that Nazism and the Holocaust can ever be used to get laughs, but what this film does so well is ridicule their hateful ideology and show it up for the absurdity that it was. That must go in no small measure to the book upon which the film is based, but it still had to be adapted, and in fine style too. The horrors of the latter days of WWII are portrayed unflinchingly, and in those moments of course the humour gives way to pathos. The way in which these two elements of the film are balanced is particularly clever; at no point did I feel like my emotions were being cynically manipulated for kudos.
The acting in Jojo Rabbit is superb. Scarlett Johansson thoroughly deserves her Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Jojo's struggling mother, determined to remain independent and hopeful of an end to the war, despite Nazism and her own son's insistence on being a staunch Hitler Youth. The child actors are also very good (although I'm not sure the Jewish girl Elsa could be said to be played by a child actor, since Thomasin McKenzie is 19), and the supporting cast do good work with their various and peculiar characters - the jolly yet creepy Gestapo man (Stephen Merchant), the cavalier but comradely commander of the local Hitler Youth (Sam Rockwell) and his limp sidekick (Alfie Allen), and of course the significant presence of Waititi himself as Jojo's imaginary friend Adolf Hitler! He did a great job of portraying Hitler as Jojo imagined him to be, and I liked the way the Hitler persona changes as Jojo grows up a bit and becomes acquainted with harsh reality.
The one character which I didn't relate to and couldn't see the point of was Rebel Wilson's Nazi instructor with the Hitler Youth. I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson, but I don't think it was her spoiling the role, just that the character was superfluous.
In pretty much every other respect I thought Jojo Rabbit was beautifully satirical and poignant in equal measure, and I urge everyone to see it!",9,1,3,13 January 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Demented and fabulous
","I like my action films, especially if they're done with style and originality. It might surprise you, therefore, to hear that I've never seen the original Mad Max films. Maybe it was Mel Gibson that put me off (I never thought he was a good actor, although I did really enjoy How I Spent My Summer Vacation). Anyway, I feel it gives me the objectivity to properly address the merits of Mad Max: Fury Road. It feels like so much more than the sum of it's parts - it's certainly not Tom Hardy's best work to date, although he makes a sufficiently game Max, so the way is open for Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult to steal the show. Early on I found myself distracted by questions of how most people survive in this dystopian future, but the whole thing steamrollers its way across the screen with such demented fun that I soon forgot all about that. If you don't like explosions and lots of shouting, this might not be the film for you. Having said that, the mayhem is punctuated by moments of calm to make sense of the narrative, and when all hell is breaking loose (which is most of the time), it puts Michael Bay to shame. Shame on you, Michael Bay, why can't you make films as good as this? The budgets are certainly big enough.... Where was I? Oh yes, sum of its parts. Plot. Really, what plot? If it's plot your after, don't come looking for it here. I haven't seen a film with such a paper-thin one since, well, er...John Wick? Okay, not that long ago. But my point is still valid. Which is that there isn't much of a plot. But who cares when it's so damn cool? Also, see it in 3D. No really! I usually hate 3D versions of films, but this is worth it just for one scene late on in the film (relax, no spoilers). I had a great time watching this at the cinema. What a day. WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!",8,1,7,26 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," The alien canon is not yet moribund
","**MAY CONTAIN NONSENSE**Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle, if that wasn't the best Alien film since Aliens. Yes, I really mean that. It's definitely my third- favourite film in the 'Alien'franchise. In many cases, that would sound like sarcasm, or at best faint praise. However, Alien and Aliens are hard acts to follow in the sci-fi/action/horror genre. Alien: Covenant treads a careful path between advancing the story arc set in place by Prometheus, but stylistically tuning into Alien. In my view, it does both in sufficient measure to be lauded on both counts. This was never going to be an easy balance to maintain after the relative mis-fire that was Prometheus. So what's the story here? I'm going to assume you've seen Prometheus. You have, haven't you? Very well, then, read on... We left the survivors of Prometheus intending to pilot the 'Engineers'' spaceship, complete with complement of enigmatic bioweapon on board, to destroy the Engineers on their home world. Elizabeth Shaw, one of these survivors (in fact the only human survivor), was hoping to sell some top quality chocolates to them, but David said no. Alien: Covenant, meanwhile, starts off with an expedition 10 years later to a different planet, over 7 years' flight time away from Earth. The ship encounters a destructive neutrino burst en route, resulting in the crew being ejected from hypersleep to deal with the damage. While repairing the solar sails, one of the crew intercepts a garbled signal from space, which it turns out is coming from a nearby planet. Mysteriously, the ship's astronomical data had the target colony world as the nearest habitable planet, yet here they are being informed that this much nearer planet is more promising. The captain died in the accident, the crew don't fancy going into hypersleep again, and the acting captain wants to investigate the source of the signal. The rest, as they say, is history.... There are many things to like about this film, if you're into the genre. If you're not, why are you even bothering to read this review, or any of the others? Anyway, the exposition was nicely handled, and any failure to comprehend the link between Prometheus and Alien is yours, not Ridley Scott's. Similarly the action. My one beef regarding effects would be where CGI was used to update the chestburster scenario - it NEVER looks as good as the original effects when done well; see my review on The Thing (the modern prequel) for more on the same topic. However, it was a minor negative which didn't mar my enjoyment too much. Characterisation was a bit cardboard overall, but when most of the characters are disposable meat (and you just know that they are going to be, so let's not pretend you were hoping for more) it hardly seems to matter. Style over substance, that's my bag. Seriously, though, the characters who matter are the ones who get the chance to show they have one, by surviving longer. Perhaps there were just too many people for us to get to know them all properly, which wasn't a problem in Alien, but was handled to some extent in Aliens with a longer run time and substituting complex story-telling with character interaction and dialogue. If what you really want is not to be able to tell who's going to live and who isn't, then Alien: Covenant isn't going to do that so well. It does tend toward the predictable, but I was having too good a time being carried along by some good old-fashioned action to worry about it. I'm now dying to see where they're going to go with it.",8,31,60,13 May 2017
