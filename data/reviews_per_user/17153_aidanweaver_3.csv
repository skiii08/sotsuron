Requiem for a Dream," No Words To Describe It
","Before I saw this movie I had teared up in 3 movies. Forrest Gump, Garden State, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. In this movie I cried for about 10 minutes. I have never seen a movie that changed my life so much as this. I rented this movie with moderate interest in it and began to watch it while cleaning my room. Before long I had stopped cleaning and was completely transfixed on the TV. All I can say is this: You will hear from people that the film is terribly shot. The camera is shaky and the lighting isn't perfect. The story has its plot holes and the music has its moments where it simply doesn't fit. But this is my favorite movie. There is so much truth in it and the acting (especially Ellen Byrstyn) made it impossible to doubt. And with an amazing ending to finish it off I cannot say this movie was flawed. Its imperfections led to its perfection. If you want a movie that changed your view of things watch this. If you want to watch Saw 38 or Rambo 18 be my guest but unlike those, this one is memorable and could very possibly change the way you think about things (not just drugs).",10,1,2,21 August 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Truly Amazing
","Pan's Labyrinth was amazing in every possible way.Of all of the movies I have seen, this is one of the most amazing. It is challenging to put together a movie with accurate history but also with a sense of horror fantasy and cinematography. The acting is wonderful and the directing and editing is perfect. If I were to say the most amazing movie I have ever seen this is definitely in the top 3. Definitely worth seeing. You don't need to be a fan of fantasy to enjoy it. I was so engrossed that I forgot it was in Spanish. I recommend this for everyone.10/10",10,2,4,21 August 2013
The Conjuring," Good, possibly even great.
","I give this 9/10 instead of 8/10 because though it is able to take a classic story and recreate it so that the scares are familiar, they have a new feel to them. I also have to say the acting was well done, and not many horror films these days have that. I give it 9/10 and not 10/10 because it lacks extreme originality. Yes it has some new stories. But it's still the classic story of a haunted house where a religious group comes to preform exorcisms and it doesn't go as planned. Overall, it's awesome. Is it scary? Yes. Especially the first 5 minutes of the film. Is it the scariest movie I've seen? No. But it's close and it's worth watching.",9,0,2,7 August 2013
