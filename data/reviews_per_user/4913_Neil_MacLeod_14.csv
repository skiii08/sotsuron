Scarface," A Classic
","22,684 people have voted regarding 'Scarface,' which is a good sign that people appreciate this movie even 21 years after its release. I am not a huge DePalma fan but this movie is undeniably great, with immensely good acting, a great story, and some of the cheesiest music of the 80s. Love those electronic organs! If you haven't seen it... why are you reading this? Go see it already! At the time of it's release the violence caused an uproar but 20 years on it is not so gory, compared to some recent movies.One of Pacino's best, man I wish he did things of this caliber recently. Take the good (Heat) with the average (The Rookie) I guess. I believe Pacino is 64 years old, so I look forward to a few more years and a few more good movies from the method actor's method actor.",10,3,6,1 November 2004
Finding Nemo," Great stuff! *No spoilers*
","Pixar can do no wrong.  Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., etc.  All instant classics, funny, warm-hearted, and with enough in-jokes to please all.  Finding Nemo is more of the same, great voice-casting and dialog.",10,1,3,28 October 2003
Spider-Man," Great stuff! *No spoilers*
","I was surprised they gave Raimi this movie but he did not disappoint with a faithful (mostly) to the comic adaptation.  Yes the Green Goblin does look like a Transformer but really, in the comic he wore tights so I will take the 2002 live action version as opposed to that.  Spider man 2 looks even better, with Raimi bringing his horror skills to play in his version of Doc Ock.",10,0,1,28 October 2003
City of God," No Spoilers, just a plea for you to see this film
","This movie got a lot of publicity when it came out, and is deservedly #23 on the top 250 list here on the IMDb. In the off chance you are browsing that list for movies you haven't seen yet and thus reading this comment: do yourself a favor and go rent/steal/borrow this movie. A 'tour de force' {I think that's French for bloody amazing :) } of movie-making, it has to be seen to be believed. It speaks not just to the degradations and hardships of life in a Rio slum, but in any impoverished area in the world. I just now saw it, the same weekend I caught 'Secret Window' at the cinema here in Nippon, the 5th Element on TV (again) and 'The Core' on DVD... like comparing a diamond in the rough to 3 lumps of cubic zirconium... buried in feces... in a septic tank... : )",10,0,2,6 November 2004
No Man's Land," IMDb's movie of the day is worth tracking down (NO spoilers)
","I'm glad the IMDb featured this flick as its movie of the day, it is a great film and one which I think a lot of people passed over because it has... (shudder) sub-titles. : ) I am always aghast at some people's reactions to 'foreign films' (in other words not Hollywood-produced), much less if it actually requires you to READ the dialogue. If you like war movies (and I am talking about those war movies which have you contemplate the brutality and morality of armed conflict, not those that glorify it... although those can be fun too) then you will... well perhaps 'enjoy' is too strong a word as I found parts truly horrifying, not in a 'look at the gore' way but in a 'man is a terrible beast' way... so let's say 'captivate' you with its intensity and what I felt to be an honest assessment of war and this conflict in particular. Greatly acted and a great idea behind the movie, this film gets 10/10 from me, though as I mentioned it is not the same 10/10 a LOTR or Star Wars gets, this movie is not a popcorn muncher but one that will get you thinking and keep you thinking long after the credits finish.",10,101,160,11 November 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Boring. (no spoilers)
","Despite the stilted dialog and hard-to-connect with characters, I liked the original 'Resident Evil' for what it was, a stylish conversion of a video game with undead mutant dogs. Just can't get enough of those. The sequel is just a snore. Jump cuts and WAY too much slow motion get in the way of the action sequences; characters who (once again) you don't care if they live or die; and long stretches where there is no tension or excitement, despite the intent of the director. Certainly not bargain basement awful like 'House of the Dead' but not even a decent rental for a Tuesday night at home. Better to rent a George A. Romero flick if you want zombies, 'Underworld' if you want a slick leather clad heroine, and any action flick by james Cameron if you want run and gun shooting.",4,1,3,25 August 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," More movies like this please
","'Being John Malkovich,' 'Adaptation,' 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' all great and all nothing like the run of the mill grist the movie industry usually grinds out. Nice to see big stars willing to take a chance on a script that can't have been easy to follow in written form. This film is well-done, and Jim Carrey shows once again he is capable of more than just delivering one-liners. The film world needs more movies like this and less movies like 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin,' 'Reindeer Games,' and 'Maid in Manhattan.' Boycott the next piece of crap that shows up at your local cinema (Gigli; Catwoman; Coyote Ugly; etc.) and spend your coin supporting projects like this.",8,0,2,1 November 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," Someone who loves this movie please explain why
","Well, I finally saw 'Once Upon a Time in America' and it was not worth the wait. : ) Can someone who really LOVED this movie tell me why? I saw the extended version and it was like watching glaciers making love... : ) SO slow. The kids acting in the first part of the movie were painful to watch.To give you an idea of how low an opinion of this movie I have, I saw 'Sharkey's Machine' (1981) today on TV (Burt Reynold's last big movie) and let me say I enjoyed it's 70's style silliness better than this seemingly pretentious 'masterpiece.' Don't get me wrong, it has it's moments but in between long periods which could have been trimmed. The sets and costumes look great though... : )************ Spoiler Alert ****************** What is with the opium den stuff? Not really explored at all, just to be taken as a given that De Niro is a Hophead? *********************************************Anyway, someone tell me how this gets over 8 points when other ENTERTAINING flicks get the shaft. Keep in mind I also found 'The Deer Hunter' too long, but couldn't get enough of the extended version of LOTR. Perhaps I am just a heathen... ; )",3,5,14,26 October 2004
Saw," A good earner
","Wow, I am blown away with the money this flick has made:Budget: $1,200,000 (estimated)Gross $55,153,403 (USA) (26 December 2004)That is amazing for a horror flick, much less one that is as graphic as this one. Add in second-run showings and DVD/video and the distributor and producers will be living large. I think the horror 'wave' is peaking now, any guesses what will be the next genre to take Hollywood's fancy? Sci-Fi? Westerns? PS Why is the movie 'Leon' a recommended choice at the bottom of the 'Saw' entry? I'd think 'Seven' or even that Jennifer Lopez/Vince Vaughn serial killer flick would be better choices...",Null,2,4,20 April 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Confusing and boring in parts
","You know when an onscreen character prefaces his speech with the line 'you probably won't understand what I am about to tell you' that something went wrong during the screen writing.  Excellent and lengthy action scenes interrupted by equally long but boring speeches, all fans of the original Matrix are waiting with baited breath for film 3 next month in order to understand vast swathes of the second.  5/10 (5/5 for the action and 0/5 for the plot).",5,0,0,28 October 2003
Ice Age," A nice movie
","A great-looking animated movie with good voice-acting from Romano, Leary and that Dr. guy from ER.  Of course a little sappy in spots (it IS for kids after all) it also is chock full of humour including the funniest beginning and ending to a movie I have seen in ages.  If you don't like this one you are a bad person.  : )",9,0,2,28 October 2003
Signs," Great stuff! *No spoilers*
","'Unbreakable' was a big disappointment after the jaw-droppingly good '6th sense' but M. Night redeems himself with this excellent and creepy film. As usual the 'secret' is not all that secret and not all that cool either, but the atmosphere generated by the story does its job admirably in keeping you on the edge of your seat.",8,0,1,28 October 2003
X2: X-Men United," Pretty good flick
","I loved X-Men (the first movie), a great sci-fi comic adaptation by Bryan Singer.  The second one is good as well (some think it better than the first due to its faithful homages to comicdom) but just not quite as amazing as the first.  Familiarity breeds contempt?  Taken for granted?  Watch and you be the judge.",8,0,0,28 October 2003
Gladiator," Ridley Scott Goodness
","Back when Crowe was not a household word (unless you had seen ROMPER STOMPER) this is the usual brilliance by director Scott.  A cool story, cool visuals and effects, cool acting... just plain cool.  If you haven't seen it... why on earth not?  If you have, see it again!",10,1,2,29 October 2003
