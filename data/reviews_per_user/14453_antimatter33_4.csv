First Man," A very poor effort. Stunningly incompetent.
","The film neither captures none of the following 1) the man himself 2) his life as it happened 3) the nature of space flight 4) the actual drama of the events that he was a part of 5) the character of Jan Armstrong, although it was best at this latter thing.1) The character played in this film by Ryan Gosling is, as far as I can tell, nothing whatsoever like the actual Armstrong, who above all was known for his intelligence and dry sense of humor. Gosling's performance is dull and humorless.2) The events depicted are correct in gross details, but absolutely botched in terms of fine ones. By dressing up the proceedings with imaginary shaking and unheard sounds, all the director does is demonstrate how little he understands either the events themselves or the nature of space flight in general. The film opens with a scene in the X-15 that has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual event which inspired it. The depiction of the emergency experienced on Gemini 8 is plain stupid, and by being stupid, destroys the real drama of the event and obscures the actual emergency, which was very real. I will not even discuss the lunar mission. By this point in the film, I was finished with it.3) The film gets absolutely nothing right regarding either the details of space flight as revealed in actual films and recorded transcripts, or indeed even as a half-assed representation of the reality of being in orbit. To tell the truth, the early Buck Rogers films are better than this turkey.4) By being so stunningly incompetent regarding details, the film finds it impossible to get even close to even the broad outline of life as an astronaut in the mid 1960s during the height of the space race. The obsessive use of handheld cameras makes this completely idiotic anhistorical approach even worse.5) Jan Armstrong was, like Neil, a witty, perceptive person with a naturally sunny disposition. In the film, she is played as a frowning, obsessively fretting scold. It is a terrible disservice to the real woman. Nevertheless, her performance has hints of the real person.I could list any number of other defects. NASA was not just Neil Armstrong, and above all functioned as a team with shallow management layers. That is completely missing in this film, as if it had never existed. The many interesting characters and personalities with whom Armstrong interaced are either entirely missing, or cardboard cutouts.The technical realization in the film is also embarassingly affected an amateurish. That's enough said about that. It's just as well.A bad film.",3,3,4,23 August 2019
Fury," Not much to say - violence porn. It's going around these days.
","Americans seem to desire war, the way a thirsty animal desires a cool pond.There is nothing to recommend this film other than the outstanding production values. 5 stars for that, 0 stars for content.-drl",5,3,4,28 January 2020
A Bridge Too Far," Difficult to evaluate, but virtues far outweigh defects
","First - for war film buffs this film is a great treat that bears repeated viewings. There is great attention to detail and period accuracy, all done in rich color and sharp focus. A true fleet of C-47s was assembled to make the spectacular sequence covering the airborne drops. The walking barrage of the Irish Guards is reproduced with terrifying force. The inner city fighting has a closeness and tenseness that proves that effective battle cinema need not be peppered with severed limbs and exposed entrails. The uniforms, rank insignia, and equipment on all sides are done with historical accuracy in mind. The actors have been chosen for their resemblance to the characters they enact. No film about WW-2 was ever done with such attention to accurate detail. And the history itself, the course of the battle, is well represented, at least to those who already understand the course of events.And that brings us to the second point - the plan for battle itself was so complicated that perhaps director Attenborough could have done a better job laying out the rationale behind the plan, and given more attention to elucidating its individual components - perhaps by onscreen time and place markers, as was done in 'The Longest Day'. It is easy to get confused, and easier still because of the richness of what is seen on the filmmaker's canvas. There is little time to pause and think about how the various events are connected either in space or in time. For example, although I had a fair understanding of the battle, I had to remind myself which side of the river the Germans were on - and of course it was (mostly) the north side at Nijmegen, and the south side at Arnhem. Indeed, the films greatest expository flaw is in failing to consistently distinguish by cinematic clues the spatial relation of the towns, waterways, and bridges, and the disposition of the attackers and defenders among them. By the time the Poles enter the battle, a viewer without foreknowledge will find himself completely confused about who is where, and what is actually happening.And that, in my opinion, is a grave defect in this otherwise magnificent film, and one that keeps it out of the very first rank of martial films. Nevertheless, I give this last of the great WW-2 epics a well-earned 8/10 for its ambition and its attention to detail. And of course, with repeated viewings it becomes easier to sort things out.",8,0,1,9 June 2019
Valkyrie," A Superior Film with Superb Ensemble Acting and Attention to Details
","A film with the presence of such fine actors as Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and yes Tom Cruise, would be expected to entertain, and this one certainly does. On its own, as a war thriller, it is perfectly understandable and interesting. But better yet, the film is scrupulously accurate with details of the plot, small details of the officers' uniforms (something at this late stage that every war film should get right, but which few do), and in general capturing the surrealistic air of 1940s Germany under the rule of a madman. Cruise has taken a lot of undeserved guff for his religious beliefs. What he chooses to believe is up to him. The bottom line is that he is a superb actor, and manages to convey the great strain that Colonel Stauffenberg must have felt as the plot moved forward. Here was an officer only recently escaped from death on the battlefield, having lost much blood, an arm, an eye, and parts of his remaining hand, yet doggedly pursuing his goal of rescuing the moral center of Germany. The oath a German officer takes has been described as a nearly physical bond, and Hitler had cleverly converted the Wehrmacht's oath into one given to him directly. Breaking such an oath is a painful thing to a German officer, even when the oath has been given to a monster. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators had the courage to relinquish that oath in favor of a larger morality. In so doing, they saved the honor of Germany, even if in what in the end was a rather pathetic way. From that small seed of honorable behavior, among others (e.g. The White Rose) has grown today's democracy, the bulwark of a free Western Europe. This film would make a good double feature with 'Sophie Scholl, The Final Days'.",8,0,0,18 October 2013
