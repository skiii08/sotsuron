Saturday Night Fever," Coming of age movie
","A great coming of age movie.  A movie that defines what a person is.  One of John Travolta's first movies and best.  It helped defined the age of Disco music, and bring from what was underground music to new age music.  Why anyone would give this more than a 9 or 10 is unbelievable.  It's a ground breaking movie, it was different, something new for its time.  The moves that Travolta did, and the dancing.  How can someone watch this movie and not say 'Oh Yeah'?  Remember Siskel's late partner, Eibert, he thought this was one of the greatest movies of all time. Great movie Great movie.",9,0,1,22 April 2004
Transformers," Optimus Prime is still a favorite to humans!
","OK, I love the movie, outright. The only thing is Michael Bay, maybe they could have gotten someone else to direct that was better. He directs in the way that he directed Armageddon, and Pearl Harbor. The close up's of the transformations made it a little hard to tell how they were transforming. And the lack of Starcream being more involved in the movie was a let down; however minor. I wish they would have used the the transformations sounds from the cartoon more in this movie; although, I did hear it every once and a while. It would have been great to hear Optimus transform with the original sound from the cartoon. I love that they brought Peter Weller back from the cartoon series to do Optimus Primes voice, anything else would have been a let down, and would have brought the score way down. Other than that, good acting, great special effects. The only question is to ask. Who is going to be the transformers on the sequel? I'm thinking devastator (Constructicons). Everyone knows Soundwave will be in the next one, and starscream. And Kup will be too, you gotta have an old timer to goto when you don't have the answer, that's the way it works in real life. Oh yeah, far fetched, but maybe not, Unicron. But he may be in the third one. And the director may go as far to put a triple changer in for the first time. Anyways, enjoy the movie, it's a must to go watch on the big screen. NOTE: They should have had some of the 80's music from the original movie in this movie.",9,1,3,4 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the first three
","I would give this a ten, but there are certain flaws to this movie, but not as many as the first two. Visually its stunning, great battles and great presentation. The dialogue is pretty good, but not the best. A little bit of humor is also in the movie. Some parts even might have a tear jerker quality to them.The one thing I did not like, and its minor is: Darth Vader in the suit does not say much. And all of a sudden there are trained crews, on the star destroyer at the end? Where did they come from? They are not clones. Another thing is, Obi wan I think is the most powerful. He defeats in Darth Maul in the first episode, he defeats Grevious and Darth Vader in the Third. And Yoda cannot defeat any of the Sith's? Just some nice magic saber light show when you watch Yoda fight.But guess what, if you watch the movie closely, and there are probably more. You can see characters and other things that are in the Original Star Wars. Lower right hand corner coming into the space port, you can see the Millennium Falcon, also at the end, its Governor Tarken. Maybe I am wrong, but who knows, its up to your imagination. Oh yes, do you notice that the guards for the chancellor change from blue to red? Anyways, very good movie. Minor glitches, but the best of the new three, but not the best of all.",9,1,5,23 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Hope Redux
","First of all I don't see how this movie's rating so high. Must be twenty somethings who never saw the original trilogy and thought the special effects in this movie were awesome. Which they were, that is why I gave the movie a 5. The story is lacking. Like one person said in a review I read, 'Do the bad people in the galaxy have an ACME 'Build a DeathStar quick' kit laying around? How could something this big be built by remnants of the Empire, without the Republic knowing about it? Can JJ Abrams write? Didn't he do the same thing in Star Trek II: Into Darkness? Just took the plot from an original movie, rehash the same story, and add CGI with the same characters in a different time line? I kept up with a few of the books after the events of Return of the Jedi and JJ Abrams just throws them out as though it never happened and in turn creates a new time line. It would have been nice to see Admiral Thrawn come to life.If you wanna know how the second movie coming in 2017 is going to turn out, then watch 'The Empire Strikes Back'. I bet it's going to be the same concept except different characters, planets and systems.Hey Kylo Ren, what are you going to say to Rey? 'Han never told you what happened to your brother...No I am your brother!' Bottom line...Wait until the movie comes out on Blu-Ray. I got a feeling when this movie does come out on disc, they will put in a on a 4k disc to promote 4k players.Oh and by the way this movie is too politically correct for all the liberals out there. Too much if you ask me. On a lot of websites, I notice that two of the characters allegedly may have more than a bromance relationship going on. Shove something else down my throat I don't wanna see. Next two movies that come out, I'm waiting on redbox.",1,15,22,23 December 2015
