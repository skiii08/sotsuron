The Equalizer," A top rate movie
","In my humble opinion, this movie scores very high. It was well acted, will an outstanding story line. There is violence, but that is the reality of the world we currently live in.Denzel gave a truly outstanding performance as he ages. His character unfolds as the story does and pulls the viewer along. He plays the part of ex-CIA Special Operator with realism to the point where he is a Poster Boy to link up with the members of Seal Team 6 to fight ISIS. Such a force would defeat ISIS quickly.Not all Russians are 'bad guys' and tough, but this movie sure convinces you that they are up to no good.As you would expect, good overcomes evil.Kudos Denzel !!!!!!",10,6,19,2 October 2014
