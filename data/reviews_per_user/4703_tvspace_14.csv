Kill Bill: Vol. 2," afterbirth
","Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is the ugly, sadistic, misshapen, and vulgar offspring of a cinematic barbarian, Quentin Tarantino.  Worse, it's boring.This is truly one of the most wretched films I've ever sat through, on every level.  The movie has no style; rather like a particularly bad episode of Saturday Night Live, each scene seems beamed in from a different planet in the solar system.  Trying to get into the groove with this movie is like trying to eat poached eggs while riding in the back of a Dune buggy.  It just ain't gonna happen.The most notable aspect of the film is the obvious sadistic pleasure Tarantino takes in dreaming up cruel and violent deaths for his characters, then filming the demise in agonizingly clinical close-ups.  The fact that the director obviously believes all this carnage is righteous revenge only adds to the squalor.  If Tarantino was an 8th grader, he'd be sent in for counseling.  Since he's a film director, he'll be congratulated for his 'edginess' by those who think that the only way to measure art is by the jolt it gives you on the Richter scale.While this movie has been repeatedly described as a 'Kung Fu movie', in fact it is nothing of the sort.  Tarantino doesn't begin to have the discipline to make a genre picture.  Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a self-indulgent flatulence that borrows devices from Kung Fu, Spaghetti Westerns, horror movies, and comic books in the haphazard manner a hyperactive, pimply-faced junior-high delinquent rummages through his stunted intellectual landscape before writing 'F*ck Mrs. Jones' on the urinal wall between classes.Kill Bill, Vol 2 might be described as trash, but that wouldn't be fair to trashy movies.  It utterly lacks the essential joie de vivre that makes a good drive-in romp fun to chew popcorn to.  Indeed, Kill Bill takes itself seriously  -- deadly seriously -- and is as dull, self-righteous and dim-witted as a Driver's Ed movie.  Time at first seems to stand still in this movie, as one interminable monologue after another explicates the minute science of mamba snakes or the trivialities of running a strip joint. By the time the film is over it has gotten so slow that time literally runs backwards: Tarantino makes you sit through the credits of the first Kill Bill at the end of this one... his ultimate and final act of self-indulgence.Tarantino is a hack, and this movie is his hacksaw.  Steer far clear.",2,7,13,25 April 2004
Scarface," The Rocky Horror Gangster Show
","I went into Scarface expecting a searing gangster drama to stand up next to classics like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Carlito's Way. Instead the movie is an over-the-top, operatic melodrama that is only shy a bunch of costumed hecklers to make it into the next Rocky Horror Picture Show. I found the disclaimer at the end -- that not *all* Cuban-Americans were like those depicted in the movie -- to be perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of the whole presentation, as much so as if one alerted the audience after Godzilla that not *all* lizards were bent on the destruction of major Japanese cities. In other words - no kidding!From a stylistic perspective the movie is badly dated, with the Giorgio Moroder score occupying a particularly glaring spot in the finished film as being an unfortunate product of a not-very-lamented bygone era -- a musical Land of the Lost awash in obsolete synthesizers and peculiarly unfunky rhythms. While we can't entirely blame the film for being made at a nadir of American culture, which 1983 undoubtedly was in some respects, the bottom line is that Miami Vice did a better job of integrating the same cultural artifacts into some fun-to-watch television, and that isn't really saying all that much.Despite these criticisms, the movie is not unenjoyable to sit through. For me, in its guileless employment of mid-80's cultural flotsam, it became a sort of time machine to that era. At first you are sitting there cringing at what you are seeing, but then you remember: people dug this movie when it was new, and in believing that you are forced to take a trip back to a time when the bell-like sounds of DX7 synthesizers and blow-dried hair were actually *cool*. You remember that movies are made to be watched immediately, and anything we can get out of them 20 years down the road is more of an unintended consequence of conducting anthropology via the art-house cinema.And there's still a few moments in the film which just plain work: 'You wanna job?' 'Say hello to my little friend...' and others. In moments like these you sense the seeds of the Sopranos and other gangster movies with a extra large helping of attitude. In the end, though, Scarface is a campy journey into a dead-end aesthetic of polyester and pop-up headlights. It isn't so much documenting excess as it is an example of excess itself. I wouldn't be surprised in 20 years to go see it as a midnight movie and find a bunch of teenagers hurling toilet paper and insults at the screen in gleeful fits of postmodern revelry.",5,3,7,22 February 2005
The Ring," around the collar
","The Ring plays out like a movie written by a computer that was fed the plots of the top-grossing horror movies of the last 5 years and from those details randomly generated a 'story':  the boy who communicates with dead people from The Sixth Sense; the videotape from The Blair Witch Project; the dying teens and prying reporter of Scream; the murderous mother of The Others: stick it all in a blender, run on high for 60 seconds, and the mush left at the bottom is The Ring.This is a film that, when done, simply doesn't make any sense.  Some movies leave you scratching your head, but The Ring only leaves you scratching your derriere.  This is such an helter-skelter exercise in everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink screenwriting that you've quit trying to make sense of things long before the credits roll.  I'm tempted to call the writing adolescent, but that's a disservice to the adolescents in the audience whom I saw the film with: they were snickering at this ludicrous movie long before the adults caught on to what a stinker we were in for.Somebody poured a lot of money into this silly mess, though, and it shows on the screen.  The film is crafted with the care of overwrought appetizers served at an uptown art opening.  Every beam of light is in place, and the camera adopts stylish angles, almost none of which are relevant to the storytelling, but which fill the viewer with the same vulgar pleasure as watching a well-made beer commercial.It isn't all bad, though.  The dripping, creepy images -- centipedes, drowned children, and more -- can't help but effect you on a visceral level. It's just not storytelling.  It's cinema as a series of moody vignettes with the story as an afterthought to try to justify the endeavor according to classical moviemaking tenets.  The Ring is the horror movie equivalent of softcore:  a guilty pleasure that isn't.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
Spider-Man 2," what a tangled web we weave
","After years of moronic Hollywood action movies, when you go to a summer blockbuster these days you're simply hoping to be only mildly disappointed instead of grossly irritated by the proceedings. So it comes as a joyous surprise to discover that Spiderman 2, against all expectations, is a smart, funny and exhilarating movie that takes us back to when good movies made money, too.Like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws, Spiderman 2 manages to combine a compelling action plot with good writing, sharp acting and assured visual film-making. Even the love story, usually the squirmingly-bad part of big summer movies, works like a charm. Director Sam Raimi puts together action scenes that are soaring, operatic tributes to Spiderman's comic book roots, yet at the same time have the grit and grime of reality, as slabs of rusty metal, shards of glass, and 2-ton taxicabs all come flying through the air at our web-slinging hero. Suffice to say that the Matrix directors could learn a thing or twenty from watching this movie.In an era when a lot of Hollywood movies have an almost fascist edge to them, with superhuman, square-jawed heroes dispensing one-dimensional villains and weakness with bare fists and bad attitudes, it is refreshing to see Spiderman's alter ego Peter Parker fully developed as a lovable schlub who can't even hold down a job delivering pizzas in his 'real' life. Raimi's first act is as tightly constructed, and as enjoyable, as a Billy Wilder script, as Parker stumbles from one bad circumstance to another, rings under his eyes from staying out late fighting crime, flunking out of college, and late on his rent. Tobey Maguire is Jack Lemmon in 'The Apartment', with a night job as a superhero. It's great fun and wonderfully executed.Likewise Alfred Molina's villainous Dr. Otto Octavius and his wife (played by Donna Murphy) are cleverly cast as uber-cosmopolitan, T.S. Eliot-reading intellectuals, whose liberal idealism runs amok when the Dr.'s scientific ambitions get the best of him. It's funny and compelling at the same time, and the cybernetic contraption that Octavius welds to himself, however cartoon-like, is considerably creepier than similar devices that pop up in 'darker' movies. Indeed, the scene where the wicked sprites in the Doctor's machine sway him from good to evil with their impeccable (but silent) reasoning is a brilliant Shakespearean flourish, like Macbeth being worked into a lather by the witches of the Scottish moors.The battle Raimi sets into motion between his awkward hero and his romantic villain spins its own web, at the center of which lies a solution not born of violence, but of conscience. Ultimately Raimi turns Spiderman's flights of adventure through the city into a kind of lonely art, a physical release from Peter Parker's limbo, his alienation, and post-adolescent angst. It's hard to think of another superhero movie where you get such a charge out of watching the character fly, run or, here, even fall on his face. Raimi has made Spiderman human, vulnerable, and funny. The movie's best scene may be when Parker, suffering from a kind of superhero 'performance anxiety', goes to a doctor. 'I've been having this dream... where I'm Spiderman...' he tells the M.D. 'Oh, so you're Spiderman?' the doctor asks wryly. 'In my dream,' Parker insists, then, growing fidgety: 'Actually, it's not my dream, it's a dream a friend's been having.' Spiderman 2 is the dream that Sam Raimi's been having, and it's the kind of movie summers were made for. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,2 July 2004
Zodiac," Disappointing, uneven
","Zodiac was surprisingly poorly done given the pedigree of all involved. This very long movie is pretty horrible until we jump forward in time to the late 70's, when it finally finds its stride and becomes quite engaging. Overall it is paced and edited almost like a comedy -- late cuts into scenes to get a few lines of zippy dialog, then quick cuts out to rush on to the next plot point. It completely doesn't work as a creepy, suspenseful serial killer movie, which requires long slow takes full of dread and anticipation.There basically is very little interest by Fincher is the actual crimes (the original Zodiac killing doesn't even make the cut, as we start halfway through his spree 6 months later). Instead he is focused on a kind of shifting buddy movie (first between Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. as co-workers at the San Francisco Chronicle, then later between Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo as detective David Toschi). This is a weirdly Hollywood move to me -- let's make the movie about the all-American (if flawed) good guys, not about the killer or the victims or the dread in the city at large.Downey, Jr. is awful -- straight up. It's a scenery-chewing performance you'd expect to find at a community theatre. Anthony Edwards -- as Ruffalo's partner -- is pretty bad too. Brian Cox's portrayal of Melvin Belli is ridiculous and doesn't ring true. There's just a LOT of bad acting in this movie.My sense after watching it, and seeing how immensely the movie improved once it got to the late 70's and turns into a kind of Richard-Dreyfuss-Close-Encounters movie about a man destroying his family life with a weird obsession, is that it should have started in the late 70's then flashed back to the original story in the late 60's as needed (which might have been very little indeed, given all the bad performances in that part of the footage).A small detail but one that somehow captures the weird, unpoetic and uncomfortable relationship this movie has with its own narrative: as we zip around from location to location we are constantly being given subtitles telling us where we are. I.e., 'The Corner of Washington and Cherry' -- and every time we go back there we get that title again -- as if we can't recognize the location on our own. Well, we CAN'T recognize it, because Fincher failed to associate an iconic image with the intersection that he could cut to at the start of the scene to place us, without using subtitles. The movie is just klutzy throughout in hundreds of little ways like that, distracting you from the story with its graceless style. By the end I felt like it was made by people just clocking in to earn a paycheck.In a way I think the best movie about the VIBE of the Zodiac (without being about him at all) is Phillip Kaufman's very creepy Invasion of the Body Snatchers, released in 1978 and set in the same San Francisco -- it could be seen as a metaphor for the breaking down of the social contract (as most viciously embodied by someone like the Zodiac) in late 70's America.",5,2,4,17 April 2019
Closer," a digestive
","Closer may not be the worst movie ever made. I haven't seen every movie ever made, so I'm not in any position to make that evaluation. I can simply say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is dull, repetitive, unbelievable, pretentious, sophomoric, and vulgar. Its leaden pace induces narcolepsy even as it desperately tries to titillate with the language of fornication. The 'adults' in this movie are like the incarnation of the fantasies of a psychologically troubled 15-year old boy: both obsessed by and disgusted with their own sexuality. In one interminably long, dull scene, Jude Law -- impersonating a woman -- has cyber-sex with loutish doctor Clive Owen. The embarrassing part is that Director Mike Nicholas is so out of it that he thinks there is something inherently novel about this all-too-common internet phenomenon and so lets the stale scene play out at a laborious pace somewhere between cosmological entropy and stop-motion-photography. We're left to watch these blandly pornographic proceedings with all the enthusiasm of a half- anesthetized dental patient awaiting the drill.About halfway through this movie a mischievous thought occurred to me: perhaps something more interesting was going on elsewhere on the premises. So I left my seat, retired to the men's room, and, at great leisure, relieved myself of my previously delicious dinner. (Thankfully I saw the movie in an establishment with immaculately well-maintained restrooms.) I can say with all honesty it was the most enjoyable 15 minutes of the entire movie-going experience.",1,25,44,13 December 2004
District 9," Literally unwatchable
","I had to leave the theatre after half an hour because the 'Blair Witch Project' camera-work was so awful that I was literally about to vomit on the theatre floor. The funny thing, is the way the plot was developing, it would have seemed perfectly acceptable to do so.The story itself piqued my interest and I am curious to know how the plot turned out. On the other hand, the allegorical politics of the movie were so heavy-handed and sophomoric that I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie even had the producer sprung for a tripod.Mostly, I'm thankful that I didn't spring for popcorn on the way in. (Or, shrimp cocktail, for that matter.)",2,2,12,27 August 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Wow!
","I'd like to be able to simply say 'wow' and let you see the movie for yourself:Wow.However there are a lot of really ignorant reviews coming out about this wonderful movie so I will try to persuade you, dear visitor, why you should believe me and not Kenneth Turan of the LA Times, or whoever you are unfortunate enough to be saddled with in your local paper.Moulin Rouge is a post-modern, filmic 'La Boheme'; that is to say, it is an opera.  Unlike the opera you can see at your local Opera House, though, this movie is thoroughly contemporary, not only in its selection of music, but also in its organizing aesthetic, which is related to, but not derivative of, MTV music videos.As opera, in its heyday, incorporated elements of all the other arts (literature, music, theater, painting), Moulin Rouge, as a contemporary opera, incorporates the arts of our day:  all of the above, plus movies, rock and roll, and booty-shaking nightclub dancing.  In both the classic opera, and in Baz Luhrmann's movie, there is that sense of being confronted with a work that is pulling out all the stops, that is 'letting it rip'. It is an intimidating type of art if you are looking for a mildly pleasant diversion, but a richly rewarding one if you're willing to go along for the ride.A lot of reviews are criticizing the editing as being overly aggressive, too fast, jumpy, discombobulating.I think these reviewers, having correctly observed such irritating habits in director Luhrmann's last movie, 'Romeo + Juliet', were, shall we say, overly sensitive to that issue before the movie even started, and have failed to appreciate the picture editing for what it is:  fast, yes, but smooth, propulsive, and functional.  The editors have created a Dadaist marvel that manages at the same time keeps you in touch with the story, the characters emotions, and the physical geography of each scene.  If there is ever a moment where physical space becomes abstract, it is by design, as the movie slides back and forth between traditional narrative space, and a presentational, music-theater aesthetic.Don't be misled:  this is not the kind of quote-unquote 'MTV editing' that sours rotten action pics like 'ConAir' and other assorted Hollywood crap. This is a visual tour de force that will take you on a nearly psychadelic voyage through an imaginary Paris.The musical choices are extremely bold.  This is a film that could have, ought to have, in fact, turned out as embarrassing and campy as the Peter Frampton/Bee Gee's disaster 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'  It is a measure of the director's self-confidence that he dances so far out on a limb that the leaves tickle the ground, inviting disaster, but never falls from his perch.Nicole Kidman gives, I think, her best performance yet.  Ewan MacGregor is the complete leading man.  It's great to watch them together on screen. They are both real actors in an era when most are not.
I spent probably too much time worrying that the movie, like most, was going to fall apart before they managed to find their way to the end of the story. You needn't worry, when you watch it:  this movie works, like a charm. The crowd I saw it with tonight (opening weekend, LA) burst into applause at one point midway through the second act.  That NEVER happens in LA.  It was a deeply satisfied crowd that left the theater.  Don't believe the jaded reviewers who have lost to much of their imagination to take Luhrmann's wild ride:  go see it!",8,0,0,21 May 2001
Black Hawk Down," An intense experience
","Black Hawk Down is an intense, raw, documentary-like war movie; it's as if the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan just kept going....and going. Most of the film is a series of brutal, heart-pounding firefights between heavily outnumbered American special forces and wave after wave of Somali, machine-gun-toting brigands.  The film is exhausting to sit through, as the relentless attacks fall one upon another, the Americans pinned in shattered buildings, or in the cockpits of crashed helicopters, or inside their own Armored Personnel Carriers.  The movie doesn't just depict war as hell, it is hell itself... endless carnage served up without meaning or reason. 
The film isn't a masterpiece.  It doesn't offer much in the way of story, or a cogent point of view.  Actually, it could have been a masterpiece if it had deliberately and consistently avoided all efforts at classical storytelling and adopted a strictly clinical approach.  It is the occasional attempt at turning the film into a classical Hollywood movie (i.e. Castaway or Saving Private Ryan) that keeps it from achieving the kind of single-minded artistic purity of the best war movies, like Das Boot and The Thin Red Line.  Its efforts at organizing the carnage are too cursory to turn the movie into a well-crafted drama, but they do spoil its chance at being a different kind of war movie, one that presents war as pure experience, without narrative.The movie is not helped by the careful touch director Ridley Scott takes with the image of the U.S. military.  Certainly the U.S. was on a heroic mission in Somalia, trying to ameliorate the terrible famine that Somalians were suffering at the time, yet the film seems too self-conscious about avoiding any negative images of the U.S. military whatsoever, whether it is incompetent officers (the usual standby, of course) or grunts committing questionable deeds.  Amazingly, though the U.S. soldiers are being assaulted seemingly at random in a dense urban environment, not one accidentally guns down a civilian, or even shoots at an assailant who is in a non-aggressive posture (i.e., running away).  These guys would have to have supernatural powers to differentiate immediate threats from false alarms in such an environment, and it simply isn't believable, in a movie that places all its bets on being 'realistic'.  I had the good fortune to see the movie in Hollywood with the director  and producer (Jerry Bruckheimer) in attendance.  In their remarks after the screening it was clear that the movie was made with substantial cooperation from the U.S. military.  While the pyrotechnics in the film might have suffered without this cooperation, it's fair to wonder what sort of substantial compromises were made to the story to accommodate the military's cooperation, and neither director nor producer seemed to recognize the inherent problems with such a relationship, and it shows in the film.Nonetheless Black Hawk Down is an exceptional film, one of the best war movies to come out of Hollywood in the past 20 years, and one that at times illustrates a fresh if brutal approach to the genre, and as importantly takes us deep inside a nightmare that has receded into memory as a minor if unpleasant international incident.  This film shows that, if you're on the ground, there's no such thing as a 'minor incident'.  You're either behind a desk, or you're out there living in hell, and what you see on CNN ain't the half of it.",5,3,4,26 February 2002
Pride & Prejudice," Soapy modernism
","While this film is in many ways technically well crafted, it is completely spoiled by the anachronistic attitudes of the characters. Throughout, the important characters behave as if they were modern Americans (and in Donald Sutherland's case, speaks like one), rather than citizens of the early 19th century, where the movie is set. While I'm actually a big fan of some of the movies that re-imagine novels like Pride & Prejudice in a modern setting (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary, etc.), when the director decides to make a period picture that presumes to represent Jane Austen's novel as written, there has to be some minimal standard for adhering to the historical nature of the book. This movie fails (badly) to meet that minimal standard. In fact, the way the folks in this movie behave more like characters who wandered out of Beverly Hills 90210 strikes an offensive note. It suggests self-absorption: the modern audience isn't really interested in what it might have been like to live in Austen's day, but rather wants to be reassured that it was a simple mirror image of their own melodramatic, 'emo' existence. It rubs one the wrong way to think that people who will never read the Austen book will sit through the movie, and come away thinking they've in any way digested what Austen had to offer. It isn't merely a matter of style differences (though the style of speech and interaction often feels far more modern than historic). It's that the very relationships between the characters as written by Austen are strongly affected by their class standings and differences. It's impossible to read the book and not understand that Austen's primary task in the writing of it was to criticize and satirize the class underpinnings of her society. To turn such a book into a simple soap opera is sham. The ironic thing is that Austen's book is much funnier and livelier than this movie. Pride and Prejudice as written has more in common with Monty Python dressing up as middle-class British ladies in order to make fun of (20th century) British society than it does with this maudlin romance.",2,5,14,23 April 2009
A Beautiful Mind," Satisfactory
","A Beautiful Mind is satisfactory.  That is about the most soaring adjective I can come up with; in a better world, then, I would be damning the movie with faint praise, but in fact since most Hollywood movies these days are decidedly unsatisfactory you can take that as a recommendation, if not a wild one, that you fork over some of your hard-earned moolah and watch this flick.It is a middle-of-the-road movie about a far-out topic; it is a meat-and-potatoes approach to a subject as delicate as sushi.  Certainly one would have enjoyed a more adventurous and transcendent approach to a movie about mathematicians, but at least 'A Beautiful Mind' succeeds in its modest way at drawing us into a difficult and not-inherently-dramatic story.  The movie is leagues better than the edgier Pi (1998), which tried to illuminate math with an artsier touch.I'll leave it to others to describe in detail the astonishing make-up and acting work that turns Russell Crowe, successfully, into a 70-year old man. 
A Beautiful Mind is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but in an era when most movies are painfully dull and vulgar, it is pleasing to sit in a theatre full of patrons enjoying the modest intellectual charms of this film.",5,0,1,13 January 2002
Identity," a ludicrous thriller
","Identity takes two or three of the most ludicrous plots you've never seen, twines them together in a ball of yarn, dips it all in a bucket of atmospheric goop and calls it a psychological thriller.Well, it is, quite literally, a psychological thriller, though its version of psychology is so far removed from real human mental activity that it leaves the unfolding of the drama seeming mechanical, arbitrary and yet predictable (in other words: written).The less said about the plot, the better, both in order to avoid inevitable spoilers, and because the story gets off to a contrived start, then meanders downhill into the realm of the silly.  Generally speaking, though, this is a film that plants itself proudly at the head of the Too-Clever-by-Half crowd. Along with Memento, The Sixth Sense, and other assorted half-baked postmodern thrillers of the past 5 years, it makes the fatal error of thinking that the secret to a good thriller is to outsmart the audience. While it fails to accomplish even that lamentable goal (except in flashes where it works by confusion and obfuscation), it does, like those other films, demonstrate that the tactic does not a great movie make.
The film does manage to sustain a kind of jumpy nervousness that has to count as some kind of accomplishment compared to, say, the boredom that overtakes one midway through The Sixth Sense, but it is in its insistence on sustaining that feeling through every homogenously gloomy, rainsoaked scene of the film that the director reveals how little he understands the genre...how little modern Hollywood understands, in fact, the genre. Hitchcock demonstrated over 40 years ago that the magic ingredient to the great thriller was the seemingly banal patina of modern life from which the director would manage to extract one unexpected horror after another (whether Norman Bates' mother or the Birds of Bodega Bay).  Identity lacks even a single scene that could be said to reside in that everyday world. Every scene is filmed like a climax, with dripping gutters, howling winds, distraught heroes, and the flinty scrapes of knives slipping in between ribs.  It takes the insistent, homogenous aesthetic of a television commercial and plays it out for two hours.  All that's missing is Catherine Zeta-Jones showing up with a working T-mobile cell phone at key moments in the plot and you'd have a heck of a marketing blitz.  I'm not convinced, however, that this is why we go to the movies, when we go to the movies.",4,0,2,26 April 2003
Mad Max: Fury Road," Midnight movie from the 80's!
","I've seen Mad Max: Fury Road twice and tried to see it a third time tonight. (They were only showing 3D screenings after 8:30 p.m. so I had to pass... who's with me on this? 3D is for kids...)Since I very rarely watch movies twice in a theater, this is an odd impulse, which I don't entirely understand, made more odd by the fact that I didn't like the movie too much the first time I saw it. I didn't like it, but I also felt I was in the absolute wrong frame of mind to digest what was being thrown at me on the screen. So I went back.What I found on second viewing is that Mad Max: Fury Road is the filmic equivalent of an unbelievably great, if slightly challenging, hard rock record. The pleasure in watching it isn't really story and suspense (there's little of either), but just soaking in the craziness, the out of this world textures (cars, costumes, weapons), the awesome soundtrack (music and effects). During the second screening it seemed for most of the show I had a huge smile plastered across my face, because I felt so in tune and aware of all of these elements intertwining. When I wanted to go back a third time tonight, it was with the same impulse that I might want to listen to a great record again. To take that journey once again, and to capture even more nuance and subtlety in the compelling vision being played out on the screen.In the end I feel like this movie captures something lost about my teenage movie-going in the 80's, when we used to go see stuff like A Clockwork Orange; Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii; or Texas Chainsaw Massacre Pt. 2; and (not always of sober mind) have really extreme audio-visual experiences in a movie theatre. That kind of filmmaking to my mind has largely been lost in an era of, on the one hand, incredibly dumb Hollywood movies, and on the other, extremely self-consciously 'arty' films made to impress critics. For me, it's great to see George Miller, for at least one shining moment, explore other possibilities with the medium.",8,2,8,28 May 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," excess
","The Bourne Supremacy is a real movie. It isn't a real good movie, or a real bad movie, but it is a real movie. Unlike Mission: Impossible or latter-day Bond movies, it takes a secret agent and plops him down in a fairly gritty, believable world that, while not as nuanced as a John le Carre novel, at least allows us to perceive the action as taking place on the same Earth we inhabit.30 years ago this would not be a notable accomplishment, but in 2004 you have to be thankful for any mainstream summertime movie that isn't a ludicrous cartoon from start to finish.At its best, The Bourne Supremacy is a taut, deadpan thriller that doesn't get too hung up on genre expectations. As the film wears on, this becomes less true, until the Moscow finale, where it degenerates into the kind of hyperactive summertime roller-coaster that leaves you wondering if you could get away with checking your cell phone messages underneath all the explosions.Unfortunately, despite the movie's pluses, it is ultimately somewhat spoiled by its overly hip camera-work and editing. The camera employs the kind of stylized hand-held look that television's 'Homicide' brought to the masses, and while at times it works to good effect, more often it is tiresome and distracting.This footage is edited together with an overabundance of style that at first dazzles, then irritates, and finally nauseates (literally). With a seemingly endless supply of flashframe images, jump-cutting, and whip-pan transitions, The Bourne Supremacy bears more than a passing resemblance to the re-training film Stanley Kubrick subjected Alex to in A Clockwork Orange. By the climactic chase scene in Moscow, your eyes are rolling back in your head in epileptic fashion, while the abrasive sound effects -- doing their best to keep pace with the visual assault -- peel your ears off your head. The editing in The Bourne Supremacy is only possible because of the ease with which computer-based film editing tools like Avid allow the editor to endlessly manipulate the footage. The ultimately vulgar effect of this overworking of the footage teaches a lesson: just because a computer makes it possible, doesn't mean it's a good idea.",Null,0,1,26 July 2004
