Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For the fans
","If you haven't seen this movie before, go see it. If you have, then see it again. And again. George Lucas has done another great installment to the Star Wars Saga. I saw this movie on the opening night of screening. After seeing it, I went home, slept, got up the next morning and saw it again. I love it.Pros- The plot is very well executed with great acting from Liam Neeson, Ewan Macgregor and the beautiful Natalie Portman.The light saber duels are certainly better than from the other episodes.Special effects were so excellent that you felt as if you were there.John Williams again did a mavelous job with the soundtrack and the new theme for Episode 1, Duel of Fates is what some say as Williams' finest. I agree.Cons- If you don't know anything about Star Wars, you won't get much out of this. But if you see it again and again, you'll soon get more and more of the movie.Jar Jar. He (she?) gives me the *****.All in all, a great movie for the fans, and a good experience for the newcommers.",9,7,9,19 August 1999
