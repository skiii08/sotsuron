The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk Fast Review
","I just came back from the midnight showing of The Incredible Hulk. All I have to say is that it was worth the money. I really enjoyed the film, to the point where I wish it was longer. At first I had my doubts, but they were overcome by satisfaction once the film was done. I heard people complain about how bad the CGI was, but I thought it was well done. (Stop complaining!) The Story was well written, the acting was great, and I must say I loved the cameos and jokes through out the movie. Of course they had to change some of the story to make it work as a movie, but none of the other comic book fans I met complained after the movie, which means job well done. All in all this is a good action flick, and a worthy addition to the Comic book Movies (collection).",9,2,7,13 June 2008
Iron Man," IRONMAN, a must see!
","After seeing this movie the second time, I must admit I am still impressed. This movie is not as easy to convert from comic book to film, due to the complex story line. Thing is, the way they rewrote it, with todays common issues and interests, they did a good job. Robert D. Jr. did a great job playing Tony Stark, and the other actors were also well picked. The effects were amazing, and the action kept me watching. Yes at times it was slow, but that is because they had a great mixture of origin story and build up, which made up in the end. I don't know why it took me this long to rate the movie... but after seeing the new Hulk film, I felt like watching Ironman again, also to pick out the clues that I missed the first time. All I can say now, is that I can't wait for the Sequels! Great job cast and crew, another great addition to Marvel movies.PS: Watch Ironman before The Incredible Hulk, trust me.",9,1,2,14 June 2008
