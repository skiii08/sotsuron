The Blair Witch Project," Never gonna belive on IMDB ratings agains
","Boring, very boring, very very boring.
no horror
no camera quality (obviously the theme is not relative) but it needed to be in HD camera atleast if you're not showing the original footage.I remember I saw a movie 'A Question mark' an indian movie which was based on this 'The blair witch project'... But let me tell you 'that remake is a way better project (obviously you won't see it as that's in other language.Anyway my main review is 'I thought about it when I saw donnie darko and american psycho, But now I've decided not to believe imdb rating and viewslist'.",1,3,7,4 August 2018
