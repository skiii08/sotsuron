First Man," Wow talk about a bore fest
",Congrats on taking something so incredible and making it a bore fest. Was Neil Armstrong really that moody and lacking personality? 2 plus hrs i wont get back. Ryan Gosling is the main problem looking moody and thoughtful it was depressing watching him act. Congrats all on a total balls up way to go!!,1,2,4,6 August 2019
The Irishman," Total Mis-casting and Too Long
","Great cast??? Yes. But.....totally mis-cast. This is a vanity project by a director who has cast the three leads who are far too old to be playing the leads, even with anti-ageing film optics. Their is no way De niro and co should have been cast. Realised when Sheeran played by De Niro went to beat up the grocer...a tortoise could have run away from a clunky slow De Niro. Pesci just looked embarressed the whole way through....thinking why am i here. He hasnt acted for 10 years it showed!. Pacino was the best of the three. Sherran in real life was 6 4' De Niro is 5 8', rumours Liam Neeson was considered he should have got the part. In my opinion the film lacks credability purely based on the three leads someone needs to have a word with them they have ruined the film but not saying im too old!! The rest of the supporting cast were excellent especially Stephen Graham. The film is about an hour too long as well, was bored by the end. Everyone has different opinions but this film could have been a classic but instead turned into an unbeliveable vanity project by people who need to let their past of playing hard men go",3,6,10,7 February 2020
