Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie that delivers exactly what you'd expect!
","First off, a very important guideline to follow when seeing 'The Phantom Menace': you MUST go into this movie 1) Knowing it is the opening episode of six and 2) At least with an open mind. Preferably the mind of a child (you know - the mind you probably had when you saw Episodes IV-VI.) That said, this movie is incredible!! I must admit it was strange seeing new images following the Star Wars theme after 16 years, but I wasn't disappointed in the least. Cynical critics have blasted this movie for bad acting and old fashioned storytelling but come on! Have any of these movies had  Academy Award acting performances? No. That's not what you see a Star Wars  movie for. Two scenes are now forever burned into the memories of film goers everywhere (I hope!) The pod race, and the intense lightsaber duel between the Jedi and Darth Maul. Although the duel in Empire is more verbally emotional, nothing tops the sword play in this movie. The final battle between Obi-Wan and Maul is completely convincing. For all the complaining recently about movie violence, it's a shame a wonderful movie for all ages is ripped by critics and fans like this one has been. See this movie...several times just like the others. One last thing. I went into this film expecting to hate Jar Jar Binks. Instead I found him a welcome source of comic relief and a wonderfully believable character. Well done George Lucas! I'll be in line for Episodes II and III!",10,0,0,10 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not only hilarious; biting social commentary as well.
","Who would've thought one of the most hilarious, disgusting, vulgar, and outrageous movies of the year would also be extremely intelligent. This movie has the guts to comment on issues people argue about everyday. Issues all movies in the P.C. '90s have chosen to ignore. Congrats to Parker and Stone for accomplishing what I didn't think was possible: after 2 years of TV episodes coming up with the funniest and shocking episode yet (and holding interest for over an hour.)",9,0,0,10 July 1999
The Fifth Element," I can't believe this movie averages a high score!
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I felt bad giving it a 1; 0 should have been an option. The story was boring, the acting horrible, and talk about a waste of special effects. Also, Chris Tucker is lucky he didn't kill his entire career. Although I can't remember his name, the critic who called this film 'Star Wars for the '90s' should be demoted to writing reviews for high school newsletters. I have a guideline for giving a movie the worst rating possible: I have to want to leave the theater. I've seen technically weaker films but at least I didn't feel tortured by staying. YUCK!!",1,25,58,10 July 1999
Tarzan," Disney's formula is getting old.
","This film has a strong beginning and ending. Too bad the middle was nothing more than the usual Disney shlock for kids only. It was nice to see Disney take a chance with the scene where Tarzan is found and the untimely end of the villain, however,  the villain himself was a stock Disney character and is one of the weakest points of the movie. Unfortunately, as long as Disney keeps raking in the money the formula will probably stay the same. Not nearly as good as Beauty and the Beast or The Hunchback of Notre Dame.",6,0,1,10 July 1999
