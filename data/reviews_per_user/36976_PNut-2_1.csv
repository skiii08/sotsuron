The Blair Witch Project," Don't expect too much
","I went into the theater to see this movie fully expecting to be scared senseless.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  Nevertheless, I found the movie to be very good, and would have thought it better had I not known so much about it previously.  I believe the best thing one could do is watch the movie without knowing that it is fiction and without any expectation to be frightened more than ever before.  It is a scary movie, and even better if you don't know what to expect.",5,0,1,2 August 1999
