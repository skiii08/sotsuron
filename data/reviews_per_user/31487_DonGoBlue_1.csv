Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It wasn't funny
","From what I previously read in the newspapers and from TV movie reviewers, I was prepared to laugh at what was in the movie. But, it wasn't funny, and I walked out of the theater with my wife about one hour into the movie. I laugh fairly easy, but this movie left me cold. Movies such as 'Something About Mary' and 'Little Miss Sunshine' were hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing when I saw those two movies, but Borat was just gross and repetitive in scenes that I'm sure the producers and directors thought would be funny. I may be alone in this opinion, but that is the way I felt, and I rarely, if ever, walk out of a movie.",1,9,19,14 November 2006
