Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Bill
","I opted to see 'LadyKillers' instead of this movie recently. But after a few people said it was so great, I decided to give it a chance.  Wrong move!!! There were a few nice action sequences but it was like watching paint dry waiting for them.  I'll go ahead and mention spoiler alert now since my comments may spoil it for those who enjoy this type of movie.  I nodded off a few times so they might have answered the only question I had which was how Bill got the daughter from the pregnant mother he tried to kill.  By the time they showed the daughter, I really didn't care.  At least 30 minutes of useless dialog should have been removed.   It even took an eternity for Bill to die.  And why was Uma crying after striking the fatal blow???  It was about as dumb as her going after everyone with that sword even though she was an expert marksman with a gun.  Although LadyKillers wasn't as funny as I had hoped, it was the better movie of the two.  My recommendation is that you skip both of these and read a good book if you want some real entertainment.",1,89,179,8 May 2004
The Big Lebowski," Can't be a great movie when the story sucks
","I doubt anyone will read this since there are pages and pages of great reviews. But, I had to comment since I gave it only a 5; considered a 4. *** SPOILER ALERT *** Watching someone buzzed is funny for about 10 minutes unless there's a good story to keep me engaged. Racy dialog for 1998 I guess. It's now 2007 and it felt weak. Sorry your stepmom is a nymphomaniac, etc. just wasn't that funny or clever. More like cute. Believable characters, but I really didn't care. Everyone was just so stupid. There were a few funny lines, but the majority of the 'jokes' were more about overwhelming ignorance than humor. I chuckled a few times. After an hour of the ignorance, it was predictable; the chair falling forward was no surprise. Stupid low brow physical comedy mixed with sort of high brow comedy. Like laughing at someone for using their salad fork during the entree. No deep belly laughs. 'It really tied the room together' was funny the first time he said it. Decent twist but after viewing it a 2nd time (since a few reviewers said they hated it the first time then loved it later), I still don't know what proof The Dude had of the husband's motivations. The ashes in the coffee can - another chuckle. Them blowing all over Dude with him just standing there; stupid.",5,3,8,20 July 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than M2 but ending flaky
","I really enjoyed M3 even though it was less action and more dramatic than its predecessors.  For the record, I thought M2 sucked - it was all action and nonsense.  SPOILER ALERT:   M3 was going well until Neo got to the mechanical city.  There were a number of places near the end where I wondered why certain things were done...like why everyone hovered around the pilot and then had to run to their weapons when they were detected trying to sneak home.  Also, the Oracle said she didn't tell Neo certain things because 'he' (Neo's alter ego by another name) didn't think he was ready to know.  Of course it would have been a much shorter movie had everyone been logical.   I still don't know who that 'baby thing' (as someone else called it) was supposed to be - King of the machines I guess.  Or how/why that child ended up spending so much time with the Oracle.  And that final fight was stupid - just felt over done.  After a few blows with no apparent results, you would think an intelligent being would try another option besides throwing the same punch or kick that was ineffective earlier.  But after suffering thru Kill Bill Vol 2, I still give this 7 out of 10.",7,3,6,29 June 2004
I Am Legend," I am fantastic!!!
","I loved this movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat and Will was absolutely superb. I think he was Oscar worthy. He carried the entire film and showed a wide range of emotions. *** Spoiler Alert *** Someone complained about why he was hunting when he had food at his house. You might want to ask that of anyone who hunts in the US. Most do it for sport and considering his situation (only taped TV shows, no human contact, etc.) it's easy to believe he was just bored and wanted something different to eat. There were a few plot holes and things that were unexplained but that's life. As with all movies based on books, they have to leave something out. Compared to much of the junk that's being made, this is definitely one to see. Will be in my DVD collection as soon as it goes on sale.",9,0,5,28 January 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Hated It!
","I didn't see KB1 when it came out because it was almost exactly how I expected - minimal plot strung together by a series of bloody fights. Anyway, I decided to give it a chance. I had to fight the urge to turn it off after the first fight scene. It was very unbelievable and went down hill from there. There were many scenes which insulted my intelligence but the hospital scene was probably the worse. After just coming out of a lengthy coma, she was able to undress a grown man, then dress herself in his clothes, pull herself into a wheelchair, wheel herself out of the hospital into the parking garage (none of which she had seen having been in a coma since her arrival) without being stopped/questioned by any hospital staff, then pull herself up into an SUV. However, she didn't have enough lower body strength/control to move her big toe once in the SUV. Yeah, right!!! Of course, believability isn't mandatory when you're making your own movie. When QT sells a script, I'll be the first to check it out. Until then, I'll leave his special brand of Sci-Fi for those with less logical minds.",1,4,12,10 January 2005
Identity," Not as dumb as Joy Ride
","Nearly every decision made the by characters in this movie defied logic. Therefore, I was less than sympathetic for each character's outcome.   I spent the first 30-45 minutes hoping the next idiot would get his/her just desserts.  SPOILER ALERT ***  I tried to appreciate the originality of this film but the stupidity kept getting in the way.  I was ready to accept the stupidity as the contents of an insane mind, but the ending messed that up since it represented reality.   First, I find it hard to believe that a real prison vehicle would allow such quick/easy access to a prisoner from the front seat.    Why would you ever need to access a prisoner from the front seat?  You can't provide good emergency assistance in a twisted position. Second, I found it hard to believe that the Dr. would be so careless when transporting a criminal of that magnitude.  I've seen criminals hog tied on Cops for much less, yet this multiple murderer was handcuffed with his hands in front instead of behind his back.  And after a few whimpers, the Dr. opens the bars to assist the distressed prisoner!!!  What?   Talk about weak story lines!",4,1,4,30 June 2004
Hustle & Flow," Going to buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD!
","I loved it!! This is NOT a family movie - it definitely deserves the 'R' rating. Some will complain because of the negative images, but they are part of our society and ignoring them won't make them go away. I rated it based on my level of enjoyment - not on movie snob criteria like sophisticated dialog, elegant sets, etc. It made me laugh, made me cry - just made me feel. While I can't personally relate to the characters, it allowed me to see up close what happens when people have little or no resources. Each character was different yet most were the same - stuck doing what they had to do to survive. I was rooting for DJay. Like another reviewer, I'm glad Terrence got to make this film and showcase the depth of his talent. I was even feeling his flow and wanted to 'Whoop that trick' too!!",9,3,6,26 July 2005
