Blade Runner 2049," The Sci-fi movie...
","Blade Runner 2049 manages to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor, although not so noir and more futuristic, but the film is impeccable. The entire production of the film was well made, all detailing, from the smallest detail to the largest set. Dennis Villanuave was the best choice for this film, a director who technically manages to stand out among others, the choices of making a film without much green screen was risky, but he managed to make it the best part of the film. Although long, the film increases its rhythm to the bottom of the plot, soundtrack and sound editing help you stick to the chair in the action scenes. In the end Blade Runner manages to be great technically and physically, good story, good message, good actors ... THIS IS THE FORMULA FOR A GOOD SCI-FI MOVIE!",9,3,7,5 March 2018
The Death of Stalin," IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD LAUGHS, THERE'S AN EXCELLENT MOVIE
","Stalin's death brings good laughs and good messages. The film is not a well-made comedy, although it is excellent and intelligent, it also brings about what power does of people, hunger for power, discontent of some for the government of others and especially envy. The film brings every joke, every laugh that my throat started to hurt in the middle of the movie. Excellent script, well adapted and well written, with a perfect timing. And it is still a film about the history of the Soviet Union, bringing a very decisive period in this part of history.
The film is incredible, not the best film of the year, but the best comedy film I guarantee.",9,0,2,27 February 2018
Darkest Hour," Nationalism is over the limit.
","Not wanting to despise everyone's work in the movie, but no, it just does not. The film shows when Winston Churchil assumed the post of prime minister in 1940 and shows the difficulties in which he passed. The problem is not this, and how the story of the 2nd war is told. Anthony McCarten, the writer of the script, did everything to put England on a pedestal, written: the heroine of World War II. It puts all the rest of the countries like losers, villains, the one that error.
With that mistake, let's talk about the good things in the movie. Yes, Gary Oldman does a bitch for a performance, no doubt the best of his career. The design, makeup and costumes of the film are stupendous, especially makeup.
Between mistakes and positives of the film I give my farewell with a single phrase: nationalism is over the limit.",7,1,3,24 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of the movies that the actors destroy ...
","A film depends a lot on the actors, they pass on the emotions and feelings of the characters in the script. In this movie the actors are the best! All the scenes that have Woody Harrelson or Sam Rockell or Frances McDormand are incredible. What they have managed to deliver is rare. Frances McDormand is the most outstanding, all the anger, the restrained sadness is demonstrated in her face, certainly one of the best performances of all time. The originality of the film is impressive, I do not know what Martin McDonagh smoked before writing this story; is very creative all the facts, he manages to surprise you in every scene. The comedy is also very present in the film, in some scenes it disturbs but in general it helps to give a special touch to the characters.
It is one of the best of 2017 certainty.",9,2,4,6 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark, funny and sad in the same time...
","When I heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be good, only, but after watching it, I hit palm for everyone involved in the movie. Impressive. The film manages to be so original, so well written, with jokes, dramas, punches and Frances McDormand. She is so badass in this movie, showing that yes, it was written to her this role. Sam Rockell and Woody Harelson are very well, but Frances McDormand can be a lot better. The movie has its funny parts and sad parts, but some funny parts go beyond the limit, for me the only mistake. Other than that, there is nothing to talk about, the film is excellent, just watching it you will notice, not reading this review. Do you deserve to win the Oscars? I think it has better, but we'll see.
Well, the story is very touching, it has an excellent ending, and it gives a very good message, talking about what choices and actions count in life and in its social environment. It will not disappoint you",9,2,6,25 February 2018
Dunkirk," The magic of IMAX...
","What a good movie! Seriously, one of the best of war years, technically magnificent, stupendous no doubt. Christopher Nolan and his cast is the director for this sort of thing, all the sound coming out of the speaker seems to be so realistic and that puts you on the battlefield. Watching IMAX is the best choice, it was made for the IMAX, no movie can compare to the experience that this movie goes through. Despite not having so many dialogues, the film manages to live up to the feelings of those soldiers, both the fear and the relief of seeing the civilian boats.
Another great Nolan movie.",9,2,4,5 March 2018
Get Out," For you who did not watch will be surprised.
","Get Out is one of the best horror movies of this century. He is very creative, that is the business. He does not follow the formulas of these new horror films, he manages to be impeccable in this matter. Jordan Pelee, a likely marijuana user, because to write a story of that caliber has to smoke something, it's the head of that movie. He is very original in every way. The actors are very well, Daniel Kaluuya with only 29 years of breaking up on paper. The movie is going to suck you, but it's not that big, it's small.
For you who did not watch will be surprised.",8,22,44,9 March 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Perfection above perfection!
","Call me by your name is the most perfect movie I've seen in years. He can hold you until the end of the movie, with beautiful places, impressive performances, beautiful soundtrack and a shower of emotions. Who did not watch, watch. You may not like it but crying is likely. The film has a very well adapted script, for those who have read the book and liked it, this movie will not disappoint you. All the movements of the actors are precise, showing provocations, true smiles, sensual glances ... EXCELLENT DIRECTION OF ACTORS! Timotee Chalamet is priceless in the film, especially in the final scene, which passes the character's feeling to us on a tray. Photography, although not as talented as it is stupendous, helps to leave the most beautiful Italy, rivers, buildings, monuments, narrow streets and especially the novel between Oliver and Elio. The film is sensual
Who has not watched it, watch it and who already watches it once again BECAUSE IT DOES BETTER!",10,1,7,25 February 2018
The Shape of Water," The best movie Oscar is in good hands!
","So let's start. What a movie, ladies and gentlemen! When you go to watch a movie by Guillermo Del Toro you already know what awaits you: originality, a beautiful, well written, strange and well directed film. Well, this movie has it all and more! The film so beautiful, not only by aesthetics, but also by history, is an elongated poem that talks about differences and about everything love.
Guillermo Del Toro, my friends, is the mind behind it. He has already stood out for other films like Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, but this one managed to put a title that will never be taken from him: Best director of 2017. Nothing more than deserved did an incredible job, as in all his films.
The actors in this film were chosen by the finger, they are the face of the characters, certainly was the best choice of cast. Richard Jenkins, Sally Hawkins and even the fish Doung Jones did a great job.
To all of you I say: the best movie Oscar is in good hands!",10,24,45,7 March 2018
Annihilation," It's rare to see such a movie...
","It's rare to see such a film, so ambitious, so beautiful. I need to mention that my expectations were pretty low for this movie, but he overcame so much ... Despite leaving things unexplained, it gives you room to create very likely theories. The script is very good, a non-linear way of telling the story, leaving you intrigued to the last minute with moments of suspense, fights and doubts. He is a film head, he does not explain everything right to you, you have to interpret in the way that you so I find a unique experience. The film technically is beautiful, all the effects, the places, the mutations, everything is beautiful and well done, it was a movie made with the heart.
It's a movie that if you like Blade Runner or science fiction movie will like, trust me",8,3,7,13 March 2018
