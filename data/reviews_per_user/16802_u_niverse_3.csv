Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Best Adventure of All Generations!!!
","This is probably my favorite film of all time. I watched it nearly .... (Oh, I forgot) times. Why to love this? Because it gives everything that you need: love, adventure, inspiration. Great master Steven Spielberg's masterpiece with Geroge Lucas writing and Harrison Ford starring. I still can't believe how could it not win Best Picture and Best Director Oscars. It lost Best Director to Warren Beatty's 'Reds'. But let's be just. Maybe Reds is good film, but not as Raiders. This was Spielberg's another upset at Oscars. And 'Chariots of Fire' won Best Picture, the film that most people do not know anything about. 1981's Oscars still remains one of the greatest upsets of all time. But time shows what is good and what is bad. Watch and Enjoy!!!!!!",10,1,2,20 March 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," One of the Best Examples of Japanese Anime
","This movie was my introduction to Hayao Miyazaki. Before that I heard a lot about this director, especially about Spirited Away (2001). But for a long time I could not watch it. Finally I saw it and loved.This is a story of two sisters - Satsuki and Mei and 'Spirit of Forest' Totoro. Little girl discovers that there is someone around their home. And she begins to follow this creature and finds it. Some time later her elder sister also meets Totoro and they become friends.This story is so inspirational. I recommend this film to all people who wants to enjoy Japanese anime. After that be sure to watch other Miyazaki films.Watch and Enjoy!!!!!",10,0,2,24 March 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Best WW2 Film Ever
","Spielberg directed this epic war film in 1998. It stars Tom Hanks as Capitan John Miller, Matt Damon as Private James Ryan. Ryan is only surviving son of mother and government decide to call him back. They give this mission to John Miller and his companions. Then the chase begins.Before watching it I heard many positive reviews about this movie. When I watched it I said: 'Yeah, they are right'. I have seen many films about war, but this is definitely something extraordinary. This is probably the most innovative war film of all time. It has great cultural impact. Spielberg created famous game Medal of Honor after this. Then it influenced some films like Black Hawk Down and s. After 13-14 years this film still have its effect on people.At Oscars film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Bes Picture and Director. It won Best Director for Spielberg, but it lost BP to Shakespeare in Love. Everyone was shocked. This is probably the greatest Oscar upset of modern times and of course, another Spielberg snub.Watch and Enjoy!!!!!",10,1,2,25 March 2012
