Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good remedy to cure self-complacency
","First of all i was unable to find reason for Kazahstan people to get pi**ed off about this movie and i guess they are not, because only nation which could get angry about this film is Americans and, as we see from comments, they do so. However, the jokes at the beginning were not quite successful, because they sounded like they were intentionally prepared and the visual image was added after, thus they became technical and reason-in-it-self like.The good parts were those episodes similar to Bunel's masterpiece 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' where Borat shocked well tuned bourgeoisie society and mocked their numbed customs and lifeless attitude. The same was with feminists - the only reason why Borat so successfully mocked them was because they took themselves too seriously. It doesn't mean, that feminism is wrong or something, it just showed how funny people can become when they are so righteous and assured about the relevance of their ideas.Generally Borat project resembles the idea of Southpark - whether we make fun of everything or nothing at all, so it's kind of hypocrisy to laugh at the beginning of the movie but then after you see reflection of your nation, refuse the film by denouncing it as unethical.So this film could bee seen as another call for stop being so self centered and finally being able to laugh about yourself and about the 'sacred' things like country, god, nationality and many others. Because when people or nations are unable to laugh about themselves war, hatred and other social malfunctions can emerge and it's good when someone reminds us about that.",7,1,4,10 January 2007
