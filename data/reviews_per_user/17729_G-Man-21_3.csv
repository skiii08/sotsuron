The Blair Witch Project," not what it's hyped as
","This film is not the gripping thriller that it is hyped as.  I appreciate the unique method of filming, but the overall effect is not nearly as scary as the press has made it out to be.  If you want to be scared by a documentary type film, watch the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  I usually have the ability to suspend my disbelief, but in Blair Witch I found myself questioning what the three characters did at every step.  Why were they so damn noisy, why were their lights on all the time, etc.??? 
I expect that some people will be very scared by this movie, but it is not as groundbreaking as it is made out to be.  It suffers from the same old horror movie irrationality.See it on Video to appreciate the different filming method, etc.Gave it a 4",4,1,4,19 July 1999
American Beauty," Good acting, little substance.
","I saw this movie after it got nominated for best picture.  I have been a Kevin Spacey fan since seeing him in The Usual Suspects, but American Beauty was not high on my lists of movies to see.  Well, now I know why.American Beauty is a not totally disinteresting look at what happens when pretty much every character hates his or her life.  I felt like this movie was far too depressing to be funny, save for a few lines that are just catchy.  The scene with Spacey and the consultant are outstanding from an 'office space' point of view.  However, the movie tries to make comedy out of some really heavy subjects, and I found myself thinking about the true content of the movie too much to really enjoy the movie.  A favorite for best picture?  I don't see it.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Braveheart," An emotional classic
","This movie is one that I have seen several times.  The real depth of this movie is not only found in the story, it is found in the acting.  The acting in this movie, when combined with the magnificent score, provides an experience that is rare in modern movies.  Braveheart is at once moving and exciting.  This movie is truly a must see.  The graphic violence is probably the heaviest this side of Saving Private Ryan, so beware.  But similar to Saving Private Ryan, the violence is used to tell the story, not to shock. I am always impressed by this movie and it is absolutely one of the most emotional movies out there.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
