Sucker Punch," Phenomenal, great lesson for the masses
","Sucker Punch is NOT about cinema, it's not trying to be meta, and it's certainly not about the flashy graphics and excessive effects. Sucker Punch is an attempt to reach the audience in a way movies usually can't. It shows simply that each of us suffer our own asylums, but not many are as rambunctious as the character Baby Doll. Looking at it as it is, a movie, it certainly has its cons. But it's not just a movie, it's a lesson, one to be taught to everyone. Too many people just sit around complaining about their lives, about how crappy their situation is. And more than likely they're right. Sucker Punch is a movement to try and get the audience off their a**es and fight for what they want: freedom. If you can't see the movie as more than just flashy lights and good effects then you're wasting your time. Get off your a** and go do something with your life, something you've wanted to do for a long time. Free yourself.",10,4,9,9 May 2014
