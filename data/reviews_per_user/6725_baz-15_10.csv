Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this is a boring film!!
","This has to be the worst dreck of a film that I've seen in my 26 years of existence. What a load of old crap. To think that I paid IRÂ£3.25 for it. I could have bought the new Boyzone single! Anybody interested in films as art form should change their mind about going to this loser. Stay at home and rent Highlander 2 on video .My criticisms: No Mark Hamill Way too much computer animation. The minimum of acting/direction. Boring. Incoherent. Jarjarbinks. Well I think I've said enough now. I recommend people to see real films, films like taxi driver , mean streets, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, the thing, the wicker man , monty python and the holy grail, pulp fiction, the last detail, festen, breaking the waves, les valseuses, aguirre the wrath of God, willy wonka's chocolate factory, high plains drifter, the hunchback of notre-dame, the adventures of robin hood , life of Brian, pinocchio, das boot etc.",Null,0,1,21 July 1999
Snatch," very funny
","This is a fine follow up to lock stock, its just as good. It's got a similarly convoluted plot, great script and knockout performances, especially the characters brick top, mickey, turkish. Cousin Avi is also very amusing. Brad Pitt shows how versatile he is, displaying his skill at accents. Everything that can go wrong does,leading to some hilarious situations. There's too much good things in this film to list off, you should go and see it. A sample of funny dialogue: 'no sugar for me...i'm sweet enough'",Null,0,0,20 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A thrillingly titilating ensemble of talent and acting nous
","Jedi is a masterpiece, a far better film than its two weaker predecessors. It contains the greatest action set-pieces ever committed to celluloid. The plotline works not only on the microlevel, but also on the MACROLEVEL. Lucas is undeniably one of the great geniuses/visionaries of this century or any century. This is the film 2001 a space odyssey could have been. It surprises, it delights, it inspires. Highpoints to note: Sarlaac pit rescue (stolen by Hamill , using his thespian talents to give us the most convincing and devastating portrayal of a Jedi to date),the final scenes with Yoda( beautifully directed by Marquand; sensitive yet empowering),the climactic father and son confrontation (I dare anybody to say they didn't feel a chill go down their spine as Vadar hissed the word ` sister? '), Admiral Ackbar's scene-stealing charisma (surely the greatest performance ever given by an amphibian ), but it will surely be the Endor scenes which Lucas will be remembered for !! Who didn't leap out of their seats as the ramshackle collection of ewoks stole victory from the jaws of defeat, dismissing an entire legion of the Emperor's finest imperial troops? Kudos to the underdogs. It warms the heart. These little furry guys deserve their own movie ... Thanks, George. I'll carry them in my heart for...ever. (Sigh)",Null,4,9,18 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," part3 of this embarrassment
","One of the worst films of all time, this was released to an unsuspecting public in 1983. I saw it then when i was 10. I actually loved it back then but i was only ten. It's atrocious. You have these guys messing about with a giant slug. It would make you sick it's disgusting. Loads of violence for all the family to enjoy, like peoples arms being chopped off.lovely. The acting is terrible. The script is terrible. Then you have this stupid 'space wars' battle and they blow up a big spaceship.Wow. Finally there is a huge battle between teddybears and mechanical duck things. Amazing. Note my irony. Anyway it all ends happily (oops,spoiler). More bucks for uncle lucas. No wonder he vanished after this film. 0/10",Null,2,4,7 March 2001
Alien," hahaha. so bad it's funny
","Can't believe how popular this film is. This is just because alien2 made megabucks. There is no story, and the acting is pretty bad. The only good bit is the bit when the monster jumps out of the guy. And that bit isn't that good either. This 'spawned' a load sequels, which are all just as terrible. 2/10",Null,0,4,7 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," good action flick
","THe opening sequence of battle scenes was the high point and the rest ain't too shabby either, but it does drag in places, there's only so much sword fighting i can take. it starts at bilbos party and goes up to the point where gandalf and boromir are killed, i think it covers the start of book 2.",Null,0,0,14 February 2002
The Thing," One of Carpenter's best works
","I first saw this film when i was 12/13 , it sent a shiver down me spine. Fantastic atmosphere, fx, music, story, suspense. Probably JC's best film i've seen. The blood-test scene is a s**t-kicker! You're left wondering about a lot of things, so it's cool that way too. Some great quotes : 'Cheeky b***h', 'F*** you too!!', 'You've got to be f***ing kidding', 'Mac I'm not a prisoner!!'.",Null,0,1,12 February 1999
Apocalypse Now," complete drivel
","Purports to be about the vietnam war, but it is justa selfindulgent mess. It's all over the shop, totally incoherent mess of a film. And it took about three years to make! It's a waste of money and talent. The plot is as thin as they come. There's a crazy soldier in the jungle, and martin sheen has to kill him. It takes him 2 1/2 hours to even find him! This film's popularity is basically because it is so violent and the bit with the helicopters. This is based on a short, 100 page book. Talk about inserting filler!! 3/10",Null,1,2,8 March 2001
Aliens," bang,bang,bang. Lousy.
","Typical Hollywood muck, all guns and monster effects. No good acting or script. No surprise that Cameron went on to make that little gem, 'Titanic'. This one is a bit better than that, but still it's rubbish. There's a load of aliens running around the place, and the soldiers have to kill them. There you go. Made loads of money, so they kept on making them. Aagh! 2/10",Null,0,0,7 March 2001
The Sixth Sense," rubbish
","One of the great 'overhyped' films of 99, just like the star wars film was. This one is better than star wars but is still awful. You have this guy played by Bruce Willis, who spends most of the film talking to a little boy. The little boy is the most annoying thing about the film. Even Brucie looks good beside him, which is not an easy thing to do. Anyway the film is just the little boy looking scared and sinister. The acting is terrible. His wife is a nice looking girl, too good for a ruffian like Bruce. Bruce is just about the worst actor there is. There is supposed to be a really suspenseful atmosphere to the film. Cobblers. This film is just a big mess with no atmosphere or funnies. And if you like bad endings you'll love the ending. Overall, i give it 1/10, not 0 because Brucie's wife is nice.(the wife in the film, not demi)",Null,0,1,7 March 2001
