The Ring," Good Horror...Though the Japanese Original is better
","I greatly enjoyed this film, though I must say the Japanese version of this is scarier since.Unpredictable story engages the viewers...along with one of the most novel and scary moments I have seen recently in horror toward the end of the film makes this a great film to see.Recently out on DVD/VHS...Buy it or Rent it.  Hopefully, the Japanese orignal will be released here soon too.Ron",10,0,0,3 March 2003
