Howl's Moving Castle," Another wonderful movie from Miyazaki
","(first of all: sorry if my English is not the best out there, but it's not my native language)I was lucky enough to see the world premiere (at Venice Film Festival, September 5, 2004).Not only the art and animation is breathtaking (with almost no CGI), but the story is also above Miyazaki standards.The characters are wonderful, each one with his (or her) own personality. Among them the best is for sure Calcifer, the Fire Demon, who is actually an almost all-powerful being, but is often underestimated by the other characters ('If you don't obey, I'll pour water on you!').The music is one of the best parts of the movie. Even if you don't notice it, it is always there, always conveying the right feeling.Bottom line: this is an excellent movie. If you liked other movies by Miyazaki (such as Mononoke Hime, Spirited Away, Laputa Castle in the Sky...) you cannot miss it.",9,148,198,6 September 2004
