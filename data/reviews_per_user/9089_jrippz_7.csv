Casablanca," Uh YEah
","Casablance: Damn good movie. Beautifully written, directed, and performed. My dad's been quoting this movie for as long as I can remember. Well, the whole world's been quoting the movie, with 'We'll always have Paris' being one of the most famous lines in movie history. It's easy to see what a strong and obvious influence this movie had on Spielberg(particularly Indiana Jones(ma boi)). Bogey is deh nuts in this film. His character's relationship with Captain Renault is one of the best character relationships in movie history, period. And wow! Ingrid Bergman really was beautiful. It's an incredibly memorable movie, and I do recommend.",10,0,2,17 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Use enough dynamite there, Butch?
","No better western duo than Paul Newman and Robert Redford. And no better trio than Redford, Newman, and Katherine Ross. Their triangle relationship is beautiful. To me, it represents a wonderful example of the potential of human relationships. No anxiety, no possession, just a free, happy trio. The bicycle scene is one of the greatest scenes in film, and I've always thought so. You either get it or don't. Very little scenes in anything convey a feeling of freedom and happiness the way that one does. The dialog is great/hilarious. So many quotable lines. One of my favorite westerns. Makes me want to become a bank robber...JUST KIDDING HAHA!!!!!!",10,1,2,17 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Excruciating and beautiful.
","Grapes of Wrath is a really difficult movie to watch. For nearly two hours, you watch a family lose their home, get bullied by the police, starve, and lose half their family members to death. And the despair and helplessness is all captured and presented beautifully. GOW is an extraordinarily directed movie, with a fantastic use of camera and lighting. The cloudy country shots are beautiful. As are the dark, enclosed shots(in a different way), with their contrasting sense of lost confinement. It's a simple thing to mention, but the way Muley lit up when Tom was searching through is home was really awesome. The movie is bitchin.",10,0,1,17 October 2010
The Exorcist," Scary.
","The Exorcist will always be one of the scariest films in existence because, along with its technical qualities, it preys on people's innate fear of 'the devil' and all that kind of stuff and what it represents. Its subject matter isn't something that's completely recognized as fantastical, but something that's socially suggested as 'real'. Pretty every scene with Linda Blair is iconic for a reason. Nothing's more disturbing than watching a little girl pee on the carpet in the middle of a dinner party. Escpecially when she's peeing for an 'evil' reason. The sub story of the young priest is highly disturbing. And this movie proves that profanity and crazy insults are crafts of the devil. Watch with the lights off while playing with a Ouija Board. It's the only way to experience this movie.",Null,1,1,17 December 2010
The Graduate," uhhhh
","The Graduate epitomizes New Hollywood for me. The way Dustin Hoffman's realistic performance and awkward character contrasts with the campy, airy adult characters is New Hollywood's generation contrasting with Old Hollywood's generation. Simon and Garfunkel's music is used to excellent effect, and I still say that this style of soundtrack hasn't been used to its greatest potential yet. The film is still relevant to today's youth as every new generation inevitably has some sort of rift between their parents/former generation. In fact, more so than the 60s, there's a rift between individuals and their own generation. And the movie's theme(s) fit perfectly with that too. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who can relate with the tragic Mrs. Robinson.",10,1,2,17 December 2010
Psycho," Awesome.
","I shall never look at motels the same way. They are disturbing. Actually I've always thought they were disturbing. Hitchkock probably always did too. This movie delivers tension like no other. The famous shower scene gets me every time I choose to watch the film(Psycho). When ya first saw you didn't see it coming. But then when you saw it again, you anticipate in dread. So it's got REPLAY VALUE. Excellent photograpy and camera work. The house on the hill sure is spooky. And the ending scared the crap out of me when I was little. I still does. It's such a disturbing looking skeleton. It looks like an ape for crying out loud! Gee whiz. It sure is a great flick. Hitchkock foreva. Rest in peace my dog.",10,1,2,17 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Tragic and horrifying.
","Hard film to watch. I think what's most tragic about Cuckoo's Nest is that people will watch it and won't realize that, in real life, institutions like mental wards really are evil. Nurse Ratched represents authoritative manipulation and corrupt subjugation as a whole. Jack Nicholson was perfect in his role as McMurphy. Wild, free, eccentric...Jack very much is the character. Deep, penetrating writing. And the portrayal of the patients is brilliant too. As well as the acting. I love the scene where they take the boat and Jack introduces the other patients as doctors, and then they make these convincing doctor faces and gestures. The ward patients and the ward doctors are largely what they are because they're playing a role that others suggest they play. To me, that scene conveyed that idea.",10,1,2,16 December 2010
