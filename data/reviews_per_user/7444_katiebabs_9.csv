The Blair Witch Project," **1/2 Very Orginal Idea but Had me Fooled!
","The thing about this movie is that you have to believe that these 3 people were missing in the woods, I told people that it is not true and it ruined it for them. That is the whole premise. Even though I did know it was just a movie, the idea was incredible and I give kudos to the directors for this idea and the way they went about doing it. The whole movie is interesting and at times it was scary. I was a little disappointed but at the end I know I would never go into the woods again alone or on a camping trip!! Every filmmaker should watch this film for ideas that could help them become better or just for inspiration.PLOT: 3 college filmmakers go into the Maryland woods to do a documentary about a witch and are never heard from again. The  movie is the film they shot over the 3 days.VIEWS: The movie had its moments and the acting was very believeable. The thing about the movie was the story and the whole hype before it came out. This movie would be great to watch on a stormy night. You must have an open mind. It is scary if you let it be even though some will be disappointed in it.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: The abandoned house, the tent scenes",Null,0,1,10 May 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Movie should be shown in every school!!!!
","This year was such a so- so year for movies that this movie should win Best Movie Oscar, Best Actress Oscar, Best Actor Oscar...etc... This movie is simply powerful. If you ever wanted to do drugs or have done them, after you see this you will never look at a needle or a blunt or even a cigarette ever again!!! Every teenager should see this movie. After I left the movie I was shaking. The plot is simple. It takes place during a whole year, broke up season by season. It begins in the summer. There are 4 main characters- A mother (Ellen Burstyn) who loves her son and is still mourning her dead husband. She lives all alone in her apartment. Well, she gets a call to appear on tv and that's when it starts to go down hill for her. Wanting to lose 50 lbs and fit into an old red sexy dress, she goes to the doctor for diet pills.. aka- Speed. Then there is her son (Jared Leto) who is on his way to become a junkie with his friend (Marlon Wayans) who deals and also does drugs but not to the extent for his friend. Then there is Jared's girlfriend (Jennifer Connoly) who is the daughter of a rich fashion district mogel who is in love with jared and the same goes for him. She also does drugs for fun. They come up with the idea that if they start to sell drugs, they will be able to make money and become something. From here the story moves fast through each season to their final downfalls. NO matter what anyone says, this movie is incredibly real, almost like a documentary. The acting was incredible. They all did fantasic jobs but the most surprising of the bunch was Marlon Wayans. He really can act with being foolish or joking. Ellen Burstyn will be nominated for an oscar. All these 4 actors should. You must, MUST see this movie. It is very disturbing but so real and sad. You feel for the characters because they are all people you would like. They just want happiness in their lives and to live for something. Unfortunately they think drugs are the way. If I was a teacher in a health class I would show this uncensored depiction of how drugs can ruin people with such promise and hope. See it!",10,0,0,2 December 2000
The Mummy," ** stars, nice visual movie but not much more than that.
","THe Mummy is a movie that could have been so much more than those great effects. If the script had been better then I would have been really amazed. By the end I was bored, the story was going nowhere. Brandon Fraiser is well cast and he is the one that kept me watching. He looked like he was having fun which this movie should had me feel but I thought it was dull. A movie like this needs more than action and those effects. You can almost compare it to the Indiana Jones movies but they have a good script and a better hero. Next time maybe the writers of those movies should help out and work on a movie like The Mummy.PLOT: A journey into the desert for a mystical book brings danger and an enemy. Watch out for the Mummy!VIEWS: Better script was needed.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: Those nice shiny bugs! Brandon Fraiser's wisecracks.",Null,0,0,12 May 2000
American Pie," ** 1/4 Hilarious, crude but enjoyable movie!
","American Pie is not the type of movie who doesn't like disgusting and crude jokes. Teenagers will adore this movie, especially young boys. But the movie does make you laugh and shocked. It is much like Something About Mary, but funnier and makes more sense.Plot: 4 high school senior boys, that are friends, make a pact that they will lose their virginity before graduation. From there wackiness happens.Views:Adults without a sense of humor will not like this movie!! But if you have an open mind and like to laugh, give this movie a chance. Somethings in the movie are gross and foul but they make the movie all the more interesting.Scenes to watch for: That infamous pie scene, the party at the beginning of the movie, after the prom.",Null,0,0,9 May 2000
American Beauty," *** Movie makes you think!
","American Beauty is one of those movies that could be an independent film but also a studio movie. The director wants you to use your mind and feel with the characters. The story is beautiful, sad and moving. Kevin Spacey really did deserve the oscar for best acting. All the acting is excellent. Definitely see this movie if you have the chance.A man who is a husband and father basically can't stand his life anymore right after he meets and lust after his daughter's beautiful friend. He decides he wants to live life the way he wants to and doesn't matter what happens. It is told through his narrative and we also see how his wife and his daughter act around him.The Director tells a wonderful story and also teaches the audience a lesson. He does certain things with the scenes and the actors that must be watched carefully. Plainly just a beautifully done movie. Deserves all the nominations and awards it recieved.Scenes to watch for: Kevin Spacey throughout the whole film! The dinner scenes, the scene with the moving plastic bag.",Null,0,0,9 May 2000
The Insider," *** 1/2 stars Wonderful everything!
","The Insider is a great movie and it is based on a true story. Great script, great performances and especially one of the best of the year from Russel Crowe who plays a man 20 years older than himself. Al Pacino was also very good as the 60 Minutes producer trying to get the truth to the airwaves. Definitely see this movie because the truth about our news media that is suppose to bring us the truth is disturbing. Very potent stuff!PLOT: A middle aged man is fired from his tobacco job and a producer from 60 Minutes wants to know what he knows and the truth about his firing. Based on a true story.VIEWS: It is one of those movies that tries to uncover the truth. But what blocks the truth is more disturbing that what the truth is. The acting is incredible and really moves the movie along. Just see it.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: Al Pacino's speech to the 60 Minutes producers.",Null,0,0,12 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," *** stars. Good last movie from Kubrick
","I don't understand why the critics based Eyes Wide Shut. It was a good last movie by Kubric. Of course he has done better movies but like all his movies, and this one, you must watch every scene and sometimes not understand what he is trying to say. I can just see years from now, this movie will be disected in film classes. Yes, the main topic is sex and everything about it but Kubrick was trying to prove a point. This is the type of movie you must watch again to understand, which you may never fully do.PLOT: Tom Cruise goes on a sexual journey when he finds out his wife- Nicole Kidman was thinking about cheating on him. He wants to hurt her as she hurt him.VIEWS: Again, I don't know why the critics bashed Tom Cruise's acting. I think he did a great job as the tormented husband. yes, some of his adventures are surreal but it makes the movie more watchable and a topic of conversation. Maybe because Tom is not usually in this type of role, the critics didn't like it. But they were so praising about his role in Magnolia. I think he did a better job here. Most must open their minds to understand this movie that is total Kubrick. Most of his movies are this way.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: Orgy scene.",Null,0,0,11 May 2000
The Green Mile," *** Good movie but toooooo long
","The Green Mile is your typical heartfelt movie but it should have been cut short but 30 to 45 mins. The acting is great and Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan make the whole movie. Also, Stephn Kings story made the perfect movie.PLOT: The story of a death row prison guard (Tom Hanks)in the 1940's and the special death row inmate that changed his life.VIEWS: Wonderful prison movie almost as good as Shawshank Redemption but this movie has some incredible things that happen in it. But because it was over 3 hours, it dragged on a little and the end left me a little disappointed. The movie has a lesson and shows not everything is at it seems.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: When Mr. Jingles is introduced",Null,0,0,11 May 2000
The Matrix," *** stars for the effects.. What is the Matrix?
","The Matrix just blows you away by the effects that can't be discussed, you just need to watch and by amazed. The plot is a little crazy and strange but it is a true sci-fi movie for the next generation. Are things real as we see them or just an illusion? This movie asks this and so much more.PLOT: A young man (Keanu Reeves) is disilusioned with life until he meets a man who shows him everything is not what it seems, even his life.VIEWS: The acting is okay, the story could have been better but nothing really matters except for those mind boggling effects. This movie set the ball rolling for other movies. Forget the next Star Wars movie, just be amazed by what the next two movies will bring. Alot of questions are raised. The Matrix is a hard movie to comment one because it could be so many things. You are the one to make your own decision about it from being amazed to wanting out.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: The fight between Keanu Reeves and Lawerance Fishburne, the Matrix journey, and those great effects which is in 90% of the movie.",Null,0,0,12 May 2000
