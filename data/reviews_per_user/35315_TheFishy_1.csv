The Blair Witch Project," People who hated it didn't understand it
","First of all, this movie requires close attention. The plot is pieced together very well and I find myself awake early hours imagining what exactly the Blair Witch was. Most of the horror of this movie doesn't come to you right away. This isn't something stupid and overpriced like 'The Haunting' or 'The Mummy'. This is true, 'what the hell is that' horror. You won't pee your pants in the theartre. But you will poop your pants trying to sleep at night. (Minor Spoilers) People didn't understand the piles of rocks they found (that was a fake grave), the stick figures (three victims and one hairy witch like described before by the woman), the reason they were being hunted (they walked into a witch burial ground and broke something), and last of all who was after them (the world will never know). (MINOR spoilers over). Now that you have some of this pieced together go see this film. I can admit it was overhyped. I can admit it has its flaws (jerky camera work, too much bitching at each other) but I can admit that this is one of the finer films i've seen this year. True imaginative horror with an excellent setup. Don't be expecting 100 million dollar eye candy and a horror like soundtrack. Just expect a indie class horror film. And a great film at that.",Null,1,2,15 August 1999
