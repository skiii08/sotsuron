The Double Life of Véronique," Beautiful, but somewhat unaffecting
","Much of this is an adoration of French actress Iréne Jacob by Director Krzysztof Kieslowski; in a sense it is a homage to her, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented. If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin. She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her. Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected. She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red). The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka. But the main point is Iréne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves. We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe. And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd. Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there. Véronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her... She loves her father and old people. She is a teacher of children. She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true. And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point: she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties: there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998). It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.Note that as Weronika/Véronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life. It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star. This film is his way of making love to her.Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs: Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994). We could use another like him.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Vertigo," THIS is a masterpiece?
","Vertigo is considered one of the greatest films ever made and celebrated as Hitchcock's masterpiece. Perhaps it is. But I found myself bored as I watched it even though I had to admire the artistic intent. There are so many holes in the film it could qualify as cheesy. However, try telling that to those who love it. I think they love it as much for its flaws as for its perfections.Perfections: the feel of the San Francisco Bay area, the sense of historical California, the great beauty of the ocean framed by Monterey cypresses, the redwoods, the Golden Gate Bridge as seen from below and off to the side, the Bautista Mission, the fifties interior decor, Madeleine's costumes, the angle of Scottie's fedora, the acting by the three stars, James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is also celebrated, but I found it a bit overbearing at times, and of course Hitchcock loved using music to direct our sensitivities, and one can tire of that.Flaws: Scottie hanging from the drainpipe railing, watching the cop trying to save him fly over to land several stories down, dead. What is not explained is how the cop was expected to pull him up with nothing to hold onto or how Scottie managed to survive. Apparently he fell but only broke his back because in the next scene he is in surgical corset unable to scratch certain itches.The ersatz psychology. It was the fifties and psychoanalytic psychology was all the rage. One of the bestsellers of the day was The Fifty-Minute Hour: A Collection of True Psychoanalytic Tales by Robert Lindner in which a shrink relates tales told by his patients. Hitchcock loved this sort of thing (cf., Spellbound (1945) with Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman). Audiences also loved it. But the psychology is strictly bananas.Driving on the wrong side of the road (about which Hitchcock is reported to have said when it was pointed out to him, 'You drive your way. I'll drive mine.') The plot. Oh, the plot. Never but never has there been a more elaborate and unlikely murder-your-rich-wife scheme. Judy Barton is hired, persuaded or, gee, maybe hypnotized into playing Gavin Elster's wife who is to commit suicide by jumping off the bell tower at the mission. First Gavin (Tom Helmore) has to establish that she's crazy and suicidal. This is done by having her drive dreamily around the Frisco Bay area looking for the haunts of her great grandmother who committed suicide. The key is to get Scottie to believe it so he can testify that she was suicidal. For this to work, (1) Madeleine has to fool a police detective--one might say mesmerize him, which she does, (2) Get him to the bell tower at the right time where he is afraid to go to the top--that works, but you have to buy the psychology, (3) Time it so that Madeleine appears to jump off, but in reality you throw the dead body of your wife off after having broken her neck (body kept warm perhaps in your car with the heater on?), (4) Hide with Madeleine at the top of the tower until the coast is clear (whenever that might be).Although Kim Novak's performance is interesting it is unlikely that she could fool ex-detective Scottie into believing she was somebody else. When she reappears as Judy Barton in the brown hair and the different makeup, it really makes the audience do a double take before realizing that she and Madeleine are the same. But Scottie's take seems to be that she (and some other women at first glance) look like Madeleine--after all, he just got out of the nut house. It is only when he sees the necklace that he comes to his senses.Another thing aficionados love about this movie is the way Hitchcock was able to subtly strip his stars of their glamour and make them look more or less human. James Stewart never played a part anything like this before. All the funny faces he has to make, perplexed while driving, terrified on the way up the bell tower, insane and terrified in the dream sequence, etc. It is said that Hitchcock blamed the lack of popular success of this movie (when it was belatedly released, not now) on Stewart looking too old, and therefore Hitchcock never worked with him again. But I think Stewart, after seeing the way he looked in this movie--so unheroic, so lost as a real human being--decided he was never going to let Hitchcock do THAT to him again, and that's probably why they never worked together again.Kim Novak's curvy body and flopping you-know-whats are revealed in outfits that Grace Kelly would never wear. And poor Barbara Bel Geddes with those most unattractive glasses! How she pines for Scottie. One of the best scenes occurs when she shows Scottie her self portrait as the mysterious Carlotta with the glasses on (!) followed by her 'Stupid, stupid, stupid!' self-flagellation after Scottie, who was offended at the grotesque sight, walks out.But why is Scottie always hanging out at her place? And how they talk the plot in the beginning so that we might know that they were once a couple! But Hitchcock never worried about anything but the effect his movie might have on the audience. Improbabilities, clumsy plot devices, etc., were secondary. And you know what, he was right, as P.T. Barnum was right. Hitchcock never overestimated the sophistication of his audience.Somebody said that the real entertainment in watching this movie is in watching it again after you know the story. I think they're right. It's definitely a film buff's movie.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Scarface," Compelling
","I missed this intentionally when it came out in 1983 believing it to be another version of the Al Capone story. Of course Al Pacino would be brilliant as Al Capone and demand every square inch of the screen and get it. And he was and he did. And director Brian DePalma would spray the screen in scarlet, and he did. However this updated and revised version set in Miami from a script by Oliver Stone is very much worth watching even though it's almost three hours long.First of all, Al Pacino is riveting as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee released from prison by Fidel Castro in 1980 who arrives in Florida with a yearning to rule the world and a huge chip on his shoulder. His character is an extreme version of the 'live fast, die young' species, the kind of guy who takes extreme chances and fears nothing. It is a shame that it is not obvious that for every one of the Tony Montanas in the world who actually made it to the top of the cocaine pile, there are thousands who weren't able to dodge the bullets and died not just young, but very young.Second, there is not a dead spot in the whole movie. Stone's action-driven script and DePalma's focused direction compel our attention. If you can stand the bestial mentality and the animalistic flash culture of the drug lords and their sleazy world, you might even want to see this twice.What I found myself watching closely was Michelle Pfeiffer at twenty-something, strikingly beautiful and totally degenerate as the cocaine-addled moll. Also very much worth watching was Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony Montana's sister Gina. The big brother/little sister incestuous theme (from the original Scarface of 1931 starring Paul Muni and directed by Howard Hawks) was craftily prepared and reached a striking climax (if you will) in the scene in which Gina tells Montana that he must 'have her' (that's not exactly the words she used) since he won't let anybody else have her. The touch of necrophilia that followed was perhaps gratuitous.What I loved was the way DePalma reminded us again and again of how trapped the characters were by their desperate indulgences, the expensive liquor, the cigars, the cocaine, the stacks of money that took hours to count by machine. The scene in which Pfeiffer takes a snort of cocaine, a puff of a cigarette and a swallow of booze one after the other as the only thing she knows how to do in this world (with the white powder still on her nostrils) was wonderful in its piteous effect. I also liked the scene in which Montana, seated in his black leather chair with his initials in gold lettering, surrounded by his security video screens, dives into a pile of cocaine and comes up with it on his nose. Reminds me of the old doper saying, 'Too much is never enough.'The shoot 'em up finale of course was much, much overdone and about as realistic as a John Wayne barroom fight, but I loved the way Pacino played Montana near the end as a kind of paranoid Napoleon, the little guy who wanted to rule the world now finished and insane. Note, by the way, in how many scenes Pacino played a very vigorous persona sitting down.In a way this is in the final analysis a morality tale, a kind of very flashy 'crime does not pay' saga not because the cops will get you (they don't) but because the life itself will corrupt you beyond anything human. Those who live by the gun will die by the gun, and there is no security among murders and thieves.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Crude and gross but with some telling satire
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Although superficially this mockumentary would seem to be a satire of the people of Kazakhstan or the citizens of any country thereabouts, it is really a satire of America the beautiful. Surprise! It makes some good points and there are some laughs. Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time. But that's okay. For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.Of course you might be bored too. Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again. I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.Yes, we're bored in America. Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies). Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated. A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.But should we care? Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it. Will they be scarred for life? Will they 'get it'? Will it make them uncouth? Will they watch it more than half a dozen times? One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered. Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people. But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing. In Hollywood any publicity is good. They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners. Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, 'We support your war of terror!' gets a nice round of applause. And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.Actually, they don't do any real thinking. Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country. The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever. But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners. And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.Some people sued or threatened to sue. Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear. They sued but lost the case, I understand.Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed. He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson. That was pretty funny. I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged. But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents. The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch? My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans. On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies. Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night. Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things.",7,4,9,16 April 2007
Training Day," Outstanding corrupt cop drama
","The ending was a bit of overkill. That could be said. And the mano-a-mano fight après the ending was a bit drawn out. That too could be said. But the rest of the film was more than excellent.'Training Day' is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then 'led' on the 'trip' by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil—and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of 'guidance' you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Friday Night Lights," High school football as a glorious religion
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)For an appreciation of this excellent film see the beautifully written review by D. Mikels. What I want to do here is present a counterpoint. I played high school football too and might have sat on the bench a little less except that I was a slow-footed T-quarterback at a school that ran the single wing. Yes, it was that long ago.The football presented in this film by director Peter Berg is a little different. In fact it is a whole lot different. Here high school football is the most important thing in the world, not just for the players and coaches, but for the entire town. If you drive through a west Texas town or an Oklahoma or even an Indiana town on a Friday night in the fall, the town will be deserted (as in the movie) while the stadium at the high school will be lit up like a gigantic Christian revival meeting in which it might be fully expected that Christ will appear to perform the Second Coming.It is no exaggeration to say that in the heartland of America the rites and rituals of football, joined into by almost the entire populous, take on all the trappings of a most zealous and evangelical religion. What Peter Berg has done here is capture that maniacal devotion and idolatry--that oh, so American way of life in a quasi-realistic way.I say 'quasi' because there is some license taken with reality by the film makers. First of all, and most importantly, the players are too old. Derek Luke, who plays star running back Boobie Miles (and does an outstanding job), was 29 when the movie was filmed. Jay Hernandez who played Chavez was 25. Anybody who really plays football or coaches it can tell you there is a world of difference between a young man of seventeen or eighteen and one of twenty-five or thirty.And the scenes filmed especially for the movie with the flying tackles and the rolling flips and the bone-crunching open field tackles--forget it. Those are staged tackles, like kung fu fights in Chinese movies. Everything looks fantastic only it's about as realistic as a barroom fight in an old cowboy movie from the forties.What is realistic? When sexy, saucy blonde Melissa goes looking for her trophy seduction of the MoJo quarterback--that's real. She knows that the highest status in town belongs to the star of the high school football team, and the highest status of any girl is to get that guy. Also realistic is the pressure put on coaches and administrators to win football games. Winning isn't a matter of life and death. As some coaches will tell you, it's more important than that. And they mean it. Die and you're only dead. But lose at football and you are disgraced for life. Typifying this mentality is Don Billingsley, father of running back Charles, who wants to beat the life out of his son for fumbling the football. Can't the kid see that you let down your teammates, your school, your town, your friends, your relatives and God Almighty if you fumble the f-ing football? Also real is Boobie Miles's answer to what subject he gets all A's in: 'There's only one subject. That's football.' Or this line from a disappointed fan calling in to the local radio jock show after the team loses a game: 'There's too much learning going on at that school.' He's not kidding. He means it. Too much time in the classroom. Too little on the field.So is this film--as its devoted fans believe and know to be true--an ode to the glory and beauty of football? Think again, jockstrap. It's a glorification. It represents a mentality in which the greatest events of life occur when you're eighteen years old. After that it's all over. What you got left is beer, the wife, TV, and Bruce Springsteen's 'Glory Days.' Or to choose another lyric, what you've got are 'Veterans of the fight/Fast asleep at the traffic light.' (Jackson Browne) There are a number of goofs and anachronisms in the movie. IMDb lists a dozen or so including cars in the parking lots that weren't even made in 1988, the year of the film, and football gear used that didn't exist then. But that doesn't matter, and nobody who loves this film cares in the slightest about that because what really counts is the fantasy, the imagined and recalled glory of a time when everything was new and astonishingly vivid, when events made indelible marks on our hearts and souls. When we were all 17. This then is mythology in the making and in the living.The question begs itself: is this good or is this bad? Is football as a religion something to be treasured or condemned? Personally I have mixed feelings. Young men have aggressive tendencies that need to be channeled and middle-aged men need to play war games. Football allows an acting out of these needs without undue harm to anyone. Certainly football is better than gang-banging.When, some many years down the road, the history of cinema is brought up to date, this film will be remembered because it is a very good film, and Billy Bob Thornton's fine performance as Coach Gary Grimes will be appreciated. But instead of the film being seen as a realistic portrayal of what it's like to play and be involved in high school football, it will be seen as a commentary on the sociology of middle America in the late 20th century, a time when the nation was very rich and football was not only king but something close to a way of life, something indistinguishable from a national religion.",8,0,2,5 April 2006
Erin Brockovich," Everything she does is real
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore. We love her. She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised. She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder. She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder). We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)... How about...no, no, NO. Give her someone near her equal. How about a real actor twice her age? How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))? Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance. Not only does it work, it's a triumph. Finney really is brilliant. His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character. Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses? For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion). For the first time in her life she is doing something important. For the first time in her life people respect her. There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth. She neglects him and her kids for her obsession. Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife. Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her. It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts! She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real. That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath ('and all his relatives,' as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the 'little guy' versus the corporate behemoth. I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending. But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim. I haven't seen any of his latest movies, (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, & Videotape from 1989. I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",10,15,23,6 February 2001
Se7en," The preeminent serial killer movie
","We plummet the depths of depravity here. Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in this masterpiece of monstrous intent. Morgan Freeman stars as William Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt. As they try to find the killer there develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an engrossing movie. Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as 'John Doe,' a 20th century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a monster from hell. He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.Momma, lock the doors and bar the windows. Don't let this video into your home. You'll watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times, their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it clean.Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to its old tricks. After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to this extraordinary commercialization of evil? One of the penetrating things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds. The ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things: One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible deeds are the work of only one man. Whether he is just an insane 'nut-bag' as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is an interesting question.Serial killer film makers of the future will try to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon. This is already a classic. Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff. I hope they're only doing it for the money.By the way, perfect font for the credits.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Fight Club," Shocking the burghers; energizing the proles
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence. Indeed, the message is we are not really alive unless we are involved in something extreme.Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure clog with insomnia who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc. The idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to relax enough to get some sleep.But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton) hanging out at some of the meetings. Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that really in itself ought to excite Norton's deadened neurons. (I know she excited mine.) But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy sessions does is remind him that he isn't really suffering like the others, and once again he has insomnia.Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi-god, something Norton's character lacks. They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in. As the fight club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black. By the way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the participants couldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.But never mind. There's a lot more to this movie than phony fight scenes. The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny! Somehow an aura of humor adheres to Fincher's street mayhem, rock-the-house sex, and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities. Not only that but the acting by the principals and Meat Loaf's massively-breasted Bob Paulson is excellent. Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set by Pitt's brazen pathology. The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension. You will not be bored.Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature. We are animals who have domesticated ourselves. A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is difficult to watch at times. Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that. The scene at the back alley of a liposuction clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is particularly grossitating. When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted, but first, please send the kiddies to bed.",8,0,1,28 August 2003
As Good as It Gets," With a nod to Charles Dickens's Scrooge
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen. Helen Hunt, as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy, is exquisite. Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding. Of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination. This is a case of impossible love come true. Eat your heart out Nora Ephron! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But I couldn't help but think, considering the principals, how impossible it really is on another level. But never mind, in fact, all the better.James L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended. The concept of an obsessive compulsive, self-centered (almost autistic) older guy, set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange. And a patient and caring, under-achieving, under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.Wonderful, yes. A wonderful movie to lift the spirit. But As Good As It Gets is more than that. The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking. So much is said beside the point. Yes, off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive, and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him. And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred, and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.The ancient rule in comedy, from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen, has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after. Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort, obstacles not of class or race or family, but of psychological problems, stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--although to be technical, the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight. The bitter, cutting, hateful insults that he showers on everyone, even his most devoted admirers, seem more characteristic of Tourette's Syndrome than of a obsessive compulsive disorder. But never mind. It works. In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves ('A dog...a blanky-blanky dog!' who has captured his heart he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.However--and this is a big however--this movie is not for everybody, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below. But ignore them. Trust me. This is a wonderful movie, although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13-years-old.",10,0,1,28 July 2004
Monster," Riveting, sensational, and horrific
","As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized. Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs 'Lee' into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone. Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside. The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation. Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities. She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable. Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks. But 'Lee,' inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar. Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her. Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating. This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both 'Lee' and Selby discover their wild passion for one another. Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind. Her character too is etched in my mind. How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme. And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased. So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine. As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it. It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Memento," Brilliant
","Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen. Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so. Leonard's condition in this movie is better. Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes. Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes. In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that. He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.The idea of taking notes to 'remember' is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.) Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995). The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's 'condition' actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis? Leonard says, 'Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible.' He 'remembers' to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living. Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is. Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to. How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere? He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked? In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is. He also finds a picture of her and Dodd. He somehow 'remembers' the significance and writes on the back of her photo, '...she lost someone too. She will help you out of pity.' How does he remember these things? Perhaps they are examples of 'implicit learning' that 'Sammy' was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls 'conditioning.' In implicit learning as opposed to 'explicit,' we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb. Guy Pearce, plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament. Carrie-Anne Moss is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie. Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed. The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action. This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works. Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). What makes it particularly effective here is the material. Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury. For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning. Earlier events are just the same as later ones. Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end. And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny. The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example. Leonard finds himself running and he says, 'So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!' Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, 'Must be his. I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun.' Or Teddy's line to Leonard, 'I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.'The key to the powerful psychological 'ending' of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it. He replies, 'It doesn't matter whether I remember or not....' Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will... But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.On another level this is a movie about what makes us human. What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past? We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked. Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Shakespeare in Love," Hollywood at its best
","This is the kind of movie the Academy loves and through its love, rewards.The script by Stoppard and Norman is erudite and cunning, passionate and playful, filled with witticisms by and about the Bard; and the parallels to Shakespeare and his work, especially the play within a play, Romeo and Juliet, and the play to come, Twelfth Night, are marvelous and a bit miraculous. The romantic direction by Madden conjures up an Elizabethan England and its London theatre with enough lusty color to delight the poet himself. The acting is wonderful with Gwyneth Paltrow conquering a very demanding and delightful role as Viola/Tom Kent that will beckon and challenge actresses for decades to come. Joseph Fiennes as the young Shakespeare writing his Romeo and Juliet on the fly, fired with the energy from his adulterous love for the lovely Viola, is better than advertised.Of course what would a Shakespearean play or a great Hollywood movie be without its bit players and supporting roles? Judi Dench as the queen in her Academy Award winning performance gives the impression of somebody doing something marvelously well but with such ease as to look unemployed. (I stole that line from somewhere.)From the gutter snipe with his rodents to the queen's bad teeth, from Colin Firth's delightfully villainous Lord Wessex to Geoffrey Rush's wise, but bumbling stage manager, from the tavern trollops to the gentry at the ball (in which the sonnet within a play from Romeo and Juliet is once again given life by Fiennes and Paltrow) everything is expertly presented.This is Hollywood at its best. For all the clunkers and the mass-mindless indulgences that are the usual fare-tinsel town, you are forgiven!(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Alien: Resurrection," I was rooting for the aliens
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Just ugly, kind of like a perverse Star Trek for horror fans. The dialogue is particularly bad, one of the worst scripts I've encountered lately. The actors curiously talked like they thought they were making a prison film or perhaps a low-budget Mexican western. Clint Eastwood extras would be embarrassed to say some of the lines.Winona Ryder is horribly miscast and looks and sounds stupid, although her voice is kind of amusing, especially if you like to hear her say 'f---.' Sig Weaver is semi-interesting in a bloodless and buff sort of way; but the rest of this dreary, low-brow space shoot 'em up with monsters, is a yawn. If you get off on gross biological freaks in formaldehyde, however, or like to pucker up to T Rex teeth dripping acid, or go for that special feel of flesh being ripped, etc., this might be for you.Absolutely worst line (but funny as twice-removed accidental humor) is Ron Perlman's comment (after Weaver burns and blows away the grotesque embryos and her own twisted, misshapen clone) 'Must be a chick thing.'Banal observation: you'd think after all the years in space, evolving away from mother earth, there would be some advance in degenerate habits; but no, these space terrorists still smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey-and I'M SURE basketball with metal nets will still be played on the playgrounds orbiting around Jupiter. Banal observation number 2: with all that fire power, you'd think they'd blow holes in the ship and lose all the air. Alas, no.There's a special place in hell for people who produce movies like this. In it they are fastened into seats with their eye lids propped open, forced to watch their creations for eternity. I think they should also be forced to talk about how good the movie is and how they've done something just wonderful. And could we hear Winona Ryder tell us once again what a thrill it was working with Sigourney Weaver?",2,4,7,8 December 1999
Seven Years in Tibet," A little too long
","There's an attempt here to capture the symbolism of the child as the spiritual leader of humankind. After all, the child is older than the adult by a generation and therefore, evolutionarily speaking, the adult's elder. The idea that a child might be wiser than the adult is plausible since the child is not yet corrupted by the prejudices and delusions of the current society, and may see things more clearly than we can. If I had made this film, I would have worked on those ideas. Still I doubt success since what is really necessary is an illumination of Tibetan Buddhism, which is beyond the reach of a general audience.What Jean-Jacques Annaud does is keep the camera on his star, Brad Pitt, and hope Pitt's charisma will carry the film. It does not, although Pitt does a commendable job, his accent fading in and out notwithstanding. It's just that without any real tension in the story, the film is just a picturesque travelogue, and not a very good one at that. There is no attempt to come to grips with Tibetan society nor with the issues surrounding the Communist aggression. Annaud does work hard on the relationship between Harra and the Dalai Lama, achieving unfortunately a sort of Western mid-brow comprehension. I was going to say news magazine comprehension, but it doesn't even reach that. Harra shows the kid how to work gadgets and trades some superficial knowledge of the world while learning humility and social responsibility. The unavoidable irony that Harra plays the father to the Dalai Lama instead of his own son was agreeable although acted out with entirely too much familiarity. Worse fault though is to just present the child as the Dalai Lama without attempting to show why a child is chosen in the first place. Just to illustrate how far from the reality of Tibetan Buddhism this film was, let me ask the question, why not a girl?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

12 Monkeys," Visually and intellectually complex
","Properly speaking this should be called 'The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.' It only takes twelve, strategically placed throughout the world, to kill five billion people with a mutant virus. (Actually glass canisters are used.)The central character, James Cole, played with heavyweight restraint by Bruce Willis, is a convict from the future where the survivors live underground, leaving the surface to the animals. He and other nonconformists live in cages and are made to 'volunteer' to go back in time to search for the original virus before it mutated in 1996. Problem is they keep getting the destination year screwed up. Once they send him to 1917 and land him naked in the middle of a battle from World War I, where he gets shot in the leg. Another time they send him to 1990 where he ends up in a mental institution and meets attractive co-star Madeleine Stowe, who plays psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly, leading to an interesting subplot: shrink falls in love with her mentally disturbed patient. Brad Pitt entertains as Jeffrey Goines, a hyperactive nut case, son of a sick virologist, and leader of an animal rights activist group. He is crazy/wise.The film is heavily populated by unfeeling, semi-competent scientists, mental patients and their caretakers. There are all sorts of apocalyptic fools ranting and raving about the end of the world, etc. Most of human society as we know it is in shadow, off camera. There's an understandable terror of psychoactive drugs among the patients. Thorazine in particular is mentioned. Cole's body is continually being assaulted by hypodermics, electrodes, the fists and boots of the guards and other hard objects. His face is continually smeared with blood. One gets the idea that director Terry Gilliam had a bad dream and wanted to share.Regardless, this brooding, atmospheric yarn is the best cinematic sci-fi I have seen since Blade Runner (1982); and it is no co-incidence that it was scripted in part by the gifted David Peoples who helped write the screen play for Blade Runner. Never mind that time travel to the past is an absurdity. We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), namely that all time is happening 'simultaneously' and especially right now, forever.We are reminded that time is an illusion. Our experience and perception of time is, as it were, linear, allowing us a comprehension of 'time' similar to what two-dimensional creatures might have of three dimensional space. 'Time' does not exist. It is a construct from the way we compare events. Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self, the child at the airport watching his death. This will be the case for eternity. There are some funny bits in the script. After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly, and forces a trade of teeth (to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth), and the cops come, the pimp says, all hurt, 'I was attacked by a coked-up whore and a crazy dentist.' Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazy/visionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your usual mad scientist. I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly said, 'Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble. I'm losing my faith.' She's right: psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a secular religion less than two hundred years old that we as a society ought to regard with suspicion.In short this is not your usual Bruce Willis outing. The action/adventure stuff is secondary to story and character development and to the social and political statements of the film, the more important of which is to protest the suppression of the individual by the larger society. The forces of evil really are those who dictate what is normal and those who enforce conformity. This film is commercially successful because many young people, corporate cogs, and the underclass feel oppressed by the constraints of society and can readily identify with Cole's struggle. What is worse, Thorazine and Prozac or marijuana and beer? Anyone who identified even in the slightest with this film can answer that question.The second statement is that humans are ruining the planet and should be killed to save the animals. This melancholy idea is not so far-fetched. That some cult of nuts (or visionaries, as you like) might someday infect humanity with a deadly virus so that the flora and fauna of the planet might resume their natural state is at least plausible.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Au Revoir les Enfants," A work of genius
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This is a masterpiece of cinema, a work of genius by one of the greatest directors, Louis Malle. He does everything with the barest touch, just the slightest emphasis, without rancor or any loading of the deck. He understates and plays fair always. He has complete control of his story and of the audience. He knows what they believe and what they expect. He respects that, but he doesn't cater, and he is very gentle about leading us to the conclusion. He makes it beautiful although it is horrible.Gaspard Manesse as Julien and Raphael Fejto as Jean are unforgettable and a reminder that in film it's important to have a good cast. Yet, I suspect Malle could have made geniuses of any number of talented young boys in their parts. This is your Catholic boys school coming of age film without lecherous priests or the brutality of children; that is, no more than is necessary, just what is real and seen in perspective, the context being the Nazi occupation of France in 1944. It is amazing how Malle manages to show the bestiality and brain dead stupidity of the Nazis by presenting them at their most gentle. If one can damn by faint praise, one can destroy by contrast. Compared to what is human and natural we see the Nazis, as their pretentious Reich is falling apart, chasing after children, obsessed with psychotic racist delusions. Through the objective eyes of the children we see the evil. Malle need only let the facts speak for themselves.I think artists working in any medium would benefit from study of this film.What it says to us is be honest, be fair, keep it simple, but not too simple. Use not a brush stroke more than necessary, and pay attention to every detail, especially the small ones. But while we can learn from and appreciate, it takes genius to pull it off. It can't be done by connecting the dots.I am struck by a little irony on the jacket of the video. It has an early Siskel and Ebert quote: 'One of the year's best films.' That's a little embarrassing unless the year is a hundred years long.Incidentally, the sublime, beautiful and wondrously talented Irène Jacob made her debut here in a small part as a piano teacher.",10,47,62,17 March 2000
The English Patient," In some ways superior to the book
","This is a beautiful film, reminiscent of something by David Lean, and in some ways superior to the book, which more closely concentrated on Kip, the sapper, and Hana, the nurse; whereas the film likes the story of Catherine, the spoiled, and Count Almasy, the bitter, better.I think the film is right for a popular audience. But essentially these are similar works done in different genres. By the way, the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was dropped on 'brown people' and not on Europeans; but in truth, few at the time really comprehended nor cared about anything other than ending the horror of the worst war in human history. And I would ask the author, would he like to have stormed the island of Japan? It would have been Corregidor, Iwo Jima, etc. (average Allied death toll at about 33%) a hundred times over.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Elizabeth," Superb
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I wonder if the feminists have discovered this movie and if so, what they think of it. How could they not discover it since it has won a number of awards, including seven Academy Award nominations? Yet, I wonder, because the movie is deeper than might be thought on first blush, and it reverberates, but not with any simplistic sexist answers to the human struggle, but with uncomfortable questions, disturbing allegations.Allegation number one: a woman can rule and be the equal of a man, but she must suppress her feminine instincts. Uncomfortable question number one: are women as vicious and murderous as our 'demonic males'?What makes Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of power. Notice that she does NOT become a man, nor take on bogus or pseudo masculine traits to achieve her ends. She remains a woman to the core, yet acts with the kind of aggressive, decisive, brutal intelligence usually assigned to men.Next question: Is this good to know?A great work of art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer them.Cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes. Shekhar Kapur's direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to moral or spiritual wisdom. There is no preaching or taking sides. The script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic development, climax and resolution. The editing is almost invisible yet we can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved; viz., it is remarkable how we are led to experience the political growth of the young queen and see her take on the attributes of her father, as necessary, and then see her seek refuge in the church and a kind of piety as 'the Virgin Queen' in such a short period of elapsed screen time. THAT is film making of the highest quality.Not enough can be said about the subtle, charming, expansive, vivid and veracious performance of Blanchett, yet Joseph Fiennes is to be commended for achieving success in a difficult and unsympathetic role. Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed strongly to the success of the film.This is not to say that the film is without flaws. The scene where Elizabeth discovers the French duke's homosexuality is unlikely as staged, and her risquÃ© behavior with Leicester not in character. Better, I think, would have been to keep him frustrated and allow him only to play at love; however, today's audiences seem to demand coitus always. Leicester's dalliance with one of her ladies was extremely stupid, but in character. The co-incidence of her wearing the acid dress as she betrayed her queen was a delicious if implausible irony. Further it was not made clear how the queen's commands through Walsingham are made viable so that they must be carried out; indeed the under struggle among the ministers was glossed over, although her dismissal of the no longer effective Sir William Cecil was aptly done.(Of course I can presume to answer my queries.) I think allegation number one, that a woman as a ruler must abandon her normal sexual drive is true, but the argument is too long for this space. Are women as vicious as men? They don't take the foolish chances that men take, since they can be reproductively rewarded only by staying alive and securing a stable future, whereas men can reproduce prodigiously for a while and then die successfully. But when necessary, women can be as brutal as Genghis Khan, as Elizabeth demonstrates.Is it good to know that women are also vicious animals, when all the time we would prefer to think of them as fairy tale princesses? Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up; but, yes, it's important to always keep that in mind when out there in the big world. I might add that it is sobering to realize that women as reproductive animals was not even addressed in this film. Therein lies another dimension of femininity that needs exploration...",10,0,2,2 February 2000
Insomnia," Compelling
","This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution. Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas. However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story. Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation. However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable. By the way, 'dormir' in French means 'to sleep,' which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance. Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is 'Just let me sleep.'Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over. He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes. He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film. Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same. He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city. Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder. I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting? In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature. That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation. This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing. Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney). And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years. They are real. Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making? If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems. And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino. We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration. He is a flawed cop. Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty. When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop. The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide). But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised. In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs. In Nolan's film the dog is already dead. I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come. But judge for yourselfOne final point. A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot. This is something that Nolan does very well. A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab. Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, 'chain of custody,' and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them. This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

L.A. Confidential," Classy film noire thriller with atmosphere
","'L.A. Confidential' is a 'guy thing,' a well-directed, fast-paced thriller with an atmospheric feel comparable to say 'Chinatown' and 'Sunset Boulevard.' Director Curtis Hanson brings the fifties L.A. milieu to life with music, authentic appearing sets and a story that focuses on crime and corruption, false glamour and moral disillusionment as only the City of Angels could play it. Things get a little bit comic book toward the end, but the characters and story and the rapid-fire one-liners will keep you glued to the screen. There's a lot of Raymond Chandler's L.A. here.'Confidential' was the name of an 'exposé' magazine published in the fifties in the L.A. area. I recall seeing it as a kid in liquor stores at some distance from the comic books. It used green lettering on its first page (the only page I ever saw), and amazing as it may be, I recall a headline once seen: 'Youth Attacks/Rapes Own Mother.' In this film the magazine is called 'Hush- Hush,' and Danny DeVito is appropriately cast as its sleazy editor and publisher.Kim Basinger appears as a Veronica Lake look-a-like prostitute and plays it like Lauren Becall from a Bogey film, but without any wit or grace. James Cromwell is the personification of evil as the morally sick Capt Dudley Smith. Russell Crowe as Bud White, the justice-dispensing cop with a brutal temper and a soft heart for battered dames, gives an excellent performance. Guy Pearce as Ed Exley, the cop with glasses who doesn't care what the other cops think is also very good. Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the cop whose thrill is to be part of the TV production 'Badge of Honor' (that's the old 'Dragnet' series with Jack Web from the fifties) is also good.In short, the cast is excellent and is probably the main reason this classy 'shoot 'em up' is so over-rated. It was number 27 on IMDb's top 250 last time I looked. Recent movies and especially male-ID films tend to be overrated on this site. As the Internet and IMDb acquire a greater feminine voice, the ratings of thriller/action/adventure flicks will tumble.A question to ask while watching this is, was the LAPD really this corrupt? Quick answer: yes. Next question, why? Answer, because all police departments, like all governments eventually become infested with corruption and must to cleaned out or overthrown. Why? Quick, but non- illuminating answer: human nature. Even you and I, if we had to deal with criminals on the one hand and the bureaucracy of the justice system on the other, day after frustrating and cynical day, might very well take on the values and persona of our surroundings.Some authentic period piece phrases heard in the movie: 'Just the facts, Jack'; 'taco bender'; 'just another Hollywood homicide'; 'maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park and don't smell too good' and of course the sleazy tabloid tag: 'off the record, on the QT and very hush-hush.'One last thought for Director Hanson: Here's a lyric from a fifties tune that should have made the sound track: 'Confidential as a church at twilight/Secret and moving as a lover's prayer/My love for you will always be confidential to me.' They used to moon over that one in the barrios, circa 1955.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Match Point," Clever, very clever, with a nice surprise ending
","This has one of the neatest bits of stage business you are likely to ever see in a movie. Keep your eye the ball (or ring) as it hits the net, or perhaps a railing. Whether it falls forward or backward can make all the difference in the world.I can't believe that tennis players say the same thing that poker players say: 'I'd rather be lucky than good.' Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand; and besides they already think they're good. It is the other guy who is lucky.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy on the make. He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best. He gets a job teaching tennis at an exclusive English club and quickly meets and charms a very rich student (Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt) who has a sister (Chole, played by Emily Mortimer) who finds him irresistible.Well, how lucky can you get? Complication: Scarlett (the sexiest woman on earth, at one time, anyway, according to some magazine) Johansson playing Nola Rice, who is seriously dating the very eligible Tom Hewitt. (You could say she's on the make as well.) She's an American would-be actress who can't quite wow them at the auditions in London. She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.I could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you. It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, 'The man who marries for money earns it.' I have only one criticism of this especially well directed effort from the redoubtable Mr. Allen: you could have done without that cheesy ghost or hallucination scene near the end, involving sweet lips Scarlett and her neighbor.See this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.

The Prestige," Dueling magicians in London a century ago
","The Prestige is a period piece fantasy made into something resembling reality. At its heart it relies on a device from science fiction, a machine that transports people and objects by replicating them. How such a device might work is beside the intent of the movie. And that's okay. Movie goers accept premises and then follow the action without any need to examine the premise further. However I think that director Christopher Nolan might have looked more closely at the consequences of his premise. Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far-fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination. But what to do with the replications? Nolan's solution: kill them off. In fact kill off the original and keep the replication.Now if you are magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) and you know that you are about to die, and in fact in a most unpleasant way by drowning, I think you might be a little hesitant to perform the trick, even though a replication of you will come to life and live on. Note that both the replication and the original Angier would want to live and prefer that the other be the one to die.Nolan thought about this and that is why one is forced to die. Nolan probably would have himself preferred to keep the original and do away with the duplicate, but then the trick wouldn't work properly since the original would still be in place and not moved at all.This is an old theme in science fiction and Nolan does not attempt to improve on it. And again that's okay. But another problem with the way the premise is handled is that, although surely Angier would want to go one up on his nemesis, fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and dazzle the world with this amazing trick, he might have at some point just replicated some pound notes or some bullion. If Borden had gotten hold of the machine, maybe he could have replicated Scarlett Johansson so that he and Fallon could have one each for themselves. (And one for me would be nice as well.) Or he could have replicated his beloved daughter.What I am pointing to is the irony in the way the machine was used as a vehicle for a magic trick. The trick as performed is so much less amazing than the real magic that could have been displayed, that of replicating enormously complex objects like human beings. Nobody in the film seems to realize this. This is perhaps the major--shall we say--plot cheesiness. Another, as pointed out elsewhere, is that the question Angier asks of Borden, 'Which knot did you use?' The question is bogus as is his answer, 'I don't know,' since Julia was still tied and the knot could be seen. Also there is the question of what to do with all those bodies being created? We see them near the end of the film in the water boxes. Seems a bit of a stretch to make all those new boxes and just leave the bodies there. Somebody might call the bobbies, don't you think? For these reasons I am beginning to wonder if Nolan is getting a little careless or if he has been corrupted by success to the point where he no longer cares about logical consistency and artistic rigor. Perhaps we'll see in his next opus. However scheduled for release next year is The Dark Knight another Batman caper starring Christian Bale.Putting all this aside, the movie is entertaining and thought provoking. Nolan's time-stirred delineation of the plot is done well and kept this viewer interested. I also liked the razor sharp psychological tension created between Borden and Angier as they compete against each other. And the many surprising plot twists and turns--something that Nolan does very well--were nice.And the cast was excellent. Michael Caine who plays the old magician and front man Cutter was perfect, and the glimpse or two we get of Scarlett Johansson was more than agreeable. Bale and Jackson were very good as well. But I especially liked Rebecca Hall who played Borden's wife Sarah. I thought she was outstanding.Now that Christopher Nolan has had back to back commercial successes with Batman Begins (2005), and The Prestige (2006), maybe it's time to think about where his career is going. Is he going to become a film maker known for his artistry like Stanley Kubrick or a film maker who knows how to appeal to the marketplace like Steven Spielberg? On the one hand there are Nolan's artistic films, Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002) and on the other hand there are his big screen commercial successes, this film and Batman Begins. Knowing the constraints placed on film makers by the need to get funding and to turn a profit, it may be that he is trying to be both. In fact perhaps the best way to look at The Prestige and Batman Begins is to recognize that they are artistic films made within industry constraints that require mass market appeal.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Hotel Rwanda," Well-told story of genocide in our time
","Paul Rusesabagina is Hutu. We see the word on his passport. His wife is Tutsi. She is in mortal danger. But Paul doesn't realize it yet. He believes that the violence threatened by the ruling Hutu against the once ruling Tutsi in Rwanda will not happen because the UN peacekeepers will not allow it, nor will the world stand by and watch the slaughter.Paul manages a luxury hotel. He is a worldly-wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well-chosen gifts and flattery. His demeanor is calm and measured. He tells his driver that to give a government official or some other important person ten thousand francs is not as effective as giving him a rare Cuban cigar worth the same amount.He visits a supplier to gain supplies for the hotel. While he is there a crate containing hundreds of machetes overturns. He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.This is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of director Terry George's calculated method. He has a story of genocide to tell, a story of criminal neglect by the West, especially by the United States under President Clinton who stood aside and allowed the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people to take place, as did the rest of the world through the UN. The next hint comes from government radio in which the Tutsi people are referred to as 'cockroaches.' This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans. The psychological trick is to make the killers believe they are killing vermin. One cannot help but recall the Nazi propaganda machine and its methods prior to and during the Holocaust.Next we see in a scene at the hotel bar that it is really impossible to tell by appearance the difference between two young women, one Tutsi and the other Hutu. The Tutsi are said to be tall and to look down their noses at the Hutu who are said to be shorter and perhaps darker, but this is clearly a fiction. Even so, racial differences are invented and racism is inculcated into the mass mind. All of this is necessary because the slaughter is to take place using not bullets or gas chambers, but instead the cheap machetes from China. To get armies of young men to kill their neighbors and fellow countrymen, women and children with machetes requires the stirring up of a mass hatred of epic proportion and demonic intensity.The personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left. We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic. Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail. In particular there are scenes of carnage on a vast scale, including the chilling horror of the nighttime bumpy ride along the 'river road' which was said by George Rutaganda, a sadistic man, to be 'open' and the preferred route to take back to the hotel. The bumps in the road were the bodies of recently slaughtered Tutsi that the hotel van could not help but drive over.The acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding. Nick Notle is effective in the role of a compromised and nearly helpless UN commander.This is a message film. The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans. He indicates that Western prejudice against black Africans in part allowed the slaughter to take place. By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another--their familiar humanity--we are made to share this horrific human tragedy and to realize that we could have prevented it had we only known or cared enough.Will we care enough next time?--and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Crash," Remarkable take on the clash of cultures in L.A,
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Crash was a surprise winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2006. It's a message movie and the Academy obviously liked the message. The message is that racial intolerance is untenable if you really stop to think about it and see people from some point of view other than your own.What makes this work is a brilliant conception and adroit direction by John Haggis, a believable script by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and fine film editing by Hughes Winborne. All three won Oscars. They were able to preach, as it were, without preaching. By putting people in positions of racial and ethnic irony, they show us that racial prejudice is absurd. We see events that could happen to anyone regardless of race or ethnicity. We also see that supposed stereotypical behavior that we may hold against another race or ethnic group is sometimes exactly what we do themselves. The movie points to the truth that everybody is prejudice in one way or another.The story itself is about several people whose lives accidentally come together ('crash') in the ethnically and racially diverse, sprawling City of the Angels. There are two young black guys who could pass for UCLA students (they think since they're in the Westwood area) who hijack the SUV of an LA politico, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) as he and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) are driving home. There's a double irony here because one of the guys is complaining that people are afraid of them because they're black in a white neighborhood even as they move toward the hijacking! Later we meet the mother of one of the black guys whose brother Graham (Don Cheadle) is an LAPD detective who tells his mother he's bedding a white woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who he thinks is Mexican, oblivious of the fact that her parents are from Puerto Rico and El Salvador! There's quite a bit of this ironic confusion about race and ethnicity in the movie, the point being people tend to see others as stereotypes of skin color and language without really being aware of who that person is as an individual. A Persian shopkeeper is thought of as Arab. Hindus are thought to be Muslim. Thais are Chinese. Ignorance is the basis of racial and ethnic prejudice, is part of Haggis's message. And he's right.One of the most beautiful sequences in the movie begins when Shereen (Marina Sirtis) buys some bullets in a gunshop for her father, the Persian shopkeeper. (Pay attention to those bullets!) Later we see Daniel (Michael Pena) talking to his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez) who is hiding under her bed because she is afraid of the bullets that used to go off in her old neighborhood. Daniel gives her his invisible, impenetrable cloak to wear to protect her, taking it off and putting it around her. Later when the Persian shopkeeper comes hunting Daniel because he thinks Daniel tore up his store, Lara runs to protect her dad who no longer has the impenetrable cloak! I won't tell you want happens. You have got to see the sequence yourself.Matt Dillon plays a racially prejudice cop who could pass for a young and less sophisticated real life ex-LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman of O. J. Simpson trial infamy. He is the central character in another interesting sequence beginning with his groping shakedown of a black man's wife.The stories meld together in a way that reflects how Los Angeles is a cultural melting pot--or is it a salad bowl? The stories that intertwine bring out the underlining preconceptions and prejudices of the people of that salad bowl (or melting pot) in a way that is more effective than a dissertation or documentary might be. Yes, there is some contrivance, but I think it's fair to write that off as poetic license.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that although it won the Best Picture Oscar it only cost about $6-million to make. It's one of the most original films I've seen in quite a while and one of the most effective.",10,1,9,5 February 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's Best
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This is the kind of film you can say is 'the best ever' and not look like an idiot, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced. I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.Kubrick's satirical masterpiece was made not long after, and keyed by, the publication of such serious, but absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's 'On Thermonuclear War' in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate. Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake. Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was discovered some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a 'nuclear winter' that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S. Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago. Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented. As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is wonderfully emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) philosophizing over his cigar on the importance of his precious vital fluids, and a frantic Capt Mandrake politely suggesting that what is going on is madness. This is followed by the out-of-change-for-the-phone soda machine scene with Corporal 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn) who is more worried about the possibility of petty theft than the possibility of nuclear war.Although this film would never have existed without the comedic genius of Terry Southern, major credit for its success must go to the actors, not only to Peter Sellars, who was magnificent, but to Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott who seemed to feed off of one another in a 'let's see you top this' flamboyant comedic style. Scott was later to win an academy award for his portrayal of Gen. Patton (Patton 1970)), but his work there owed a lot to what he did here as General 'Buck' Turgidson. By the way, all these 'meaningful' names and most of the hilarious dialogue are the work of Terry Southern, who also penned such sixties classics as Easy Rider (1969), Candy (1968), and The Loved One (1965), the latter from Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel about the funeral industry. Some memorable highlights:Slim Pickets proving his intimate love for the bomb by riding down on it, like a cowboy breaking a bronco.Russian Ambassador Sadesky (the name is, yes, an allusion to the Marque de Sade) explains why the Russians built the 'doomsday machine,' which would blow up the whole world: 'We couldn't keep up with (the expense) of the arms race, the space race, the peace race...' (Another prophetic observation, by the way.) We feared a 'doomsday gap' (a take-off on the then current buzz phrase, 'missile gap').The scene at the hotel with Turgidson's girl friend/secretary in her bikini answering the phone and covering for him as though she is a producer's secretary warding off somebody he doesn't want to talk to. The audience knows the call's about impeding nuclear war, but she must pretend Turgidson is properly indisposed. Peter Sellars as President Merkin Muffley talking to the Russian premier (Khrushchev) as an enormously patient, kindly father with a drunken son. Incidentally, Muffley's appearance was patterned after Adlai Stevenson, the democratic candidate for president who twice lost to Eisenhower in the fifties. Also note that a merkin is a toupee for the mound of Venus.Gen. Ripper telling Mandrake how women sensed his power and wanted his vital fluids; and how a significant part of the commie conspiracy was to fluoridate our water and poison us (actually a real concern at the time by some fringe groups).Second only to Pickens's bronco ride as a symbol of the movie is Dr. Strangelove's spastic salute to Hitler...Finally I have to say that one of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that the concern was real. During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare. Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).",10,1,1,12 April 2000
Closer," Quadrangles are more fun
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Okay, let's get something straight right away. If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell. In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell. Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.Cheating is the big lie. This movie is about cheating and lying. People cheat. They get tempted. They want excitement. People are animals. But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell. Don't cheat. But if you do, don't tell.This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon. It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex. It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies. The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.It is stylish and ephemeral. It has the facade of realism. Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world. They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning... Well, maybe not.But the emotions that the characters experience are very real. When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful. And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful. But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts. If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium. He'll study the fish. So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds. This is TV's 'Friends' in the raw. This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen. As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another. If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.Well, I did kind of like this film. What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen? They are attractive and they are talented. The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy. The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning. (Never mind. I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody. As for the 'Boy Meets Girl, Cute' beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.) But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots. You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost. Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realized in the film. We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might. Portman does a good job in a challenging role. There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression. Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy. And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants. And she does manage to get what she wants.See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films. In Closer, he shows once again that he still knows what interests the current generation.",8,1,1,22 December 2005
Taxi Driver," After all the flowers are gone in post-sixties America
","This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen.It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-five years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role.He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Lost in Translation," A Platonic May-September affair
","I don't know why I had trouble with this movie. Old guy gets young, beautiful girl ought to work for me, being an old guy myself. Maybe I was jealous. I couldn't do karaoke the way Bill Murray does it. And after a night on the Tokyo town, I couldn't carry Scarlett Johansson home in my arms and tuck her into bed and turn out the light. Well, I couldn't carry her. And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin. And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her. And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style. His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2-million to make a whiskey commercial.Whiskey. I think that is what it is. I don't like whiskey or cigarettes and I usually don't like people who like cigarettes and whiskey, although I recall a song from my parents' time: 'Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild women/They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane.' (I'll take the wild, wild women.) Such might conquer the boredom felt by out-of-towners in a high rise hotel in downtown Tokyo that director Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) was at great pains to get across to us in the opening scenes. I also don't like bars and I think that people who spend their time hanging out in bars are mostly lonely alcoholics. Ditto for gratuitous smoking in movies and obvious product placements.So I almost gave up on this, but the DVD jacket does say, 'OVER 80 FOUR-STAR REVIEWS.' (That would five stars on Amazon.) Something must be wrong with me. Or maybe there is a big contrast coming in the second half of the film, and all this 21st century, big city, international First World ennui is necessary to set that up. But isn't it a little heavy how Scarlett hangs around in her panties waiting for her husband to return, and when he does he either goes to sleep or off to doing something else. Wow, one would think he would NOTICE. The camera surely does.Okay, I saw the rest of the film and ...There is a lot of artistic shtick in this movie. In fact it would be an art movie if it weren't aimed so directly at the mass mind--well, the mass mind over thirty. The long pauses and the way the camera lingers to SHOUT: notice this scene! how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.But I like the clumsiness of their relationship and the way it is drawn out.The shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log. Mount Fujiyama in gray in the background; Mount Fujisan in the background in full color and snow cap. The games arcade in Tokyo, the game machines like Vegas slot machines all in a row. The clean, straight lines of the bars and the exercise rooms, black and whites; the square wooden bowls out of which they drink the wine; the lights at night on the boulevard, outdoing Times Square in their gaudy neon-ness. The touristy feel to the movie. The Japanese untranslated. The sleeplessness as though they were near the Arctic Circle with twenty hours of daylight. The easy Hollywood feel to the psychology: our hero's pix on the side of trucks drinking Japanese whiskey, suavely; the need for the hero to hide from his public; his obviously dyed hair; the 'satire' of the blonde mediocre starlet who affects anorexia; the sense that Sofia Coppola lived something like this. One can imagine her boredom, and then the interested older man.I also liked the bit with the semi-talented lounge singer, again like Las Vegas--her picking him up, so to speak, he too drunk to protest or to remember. Again the Hollywood idea of the pecking order. The banality of the glamorous life.It is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.I guess I should say why this movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature. It is that I have been there where Bill Murray's character was and I played it the same way. I am not so sure I did the right thing. I tell myself I did, but I am not so sure.See this for Sofia Coppola who made her father proud.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Barry Lyndon," Lavish, engrossing, picaresque
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century. In particular, Redmond Barry who becomes Barry Lyndon, is something of an admirable rake, whereas in Thackeray's novel he is a braggart, a bully and a scoundrel. No matter. Kubrick, in keeping with a long-standing filmland tradition, certainly has license, and Thackeray won't mind.Ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two-fisted competence in the manly arts, including some soldiering, some thievery at cards and a presumed consummate skill in the bedroom. Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life. But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.This really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman. The 184 minutes go by almost without notice as we are engrossed in the rise and fall of Barry's fortunes. There is fine acting support from Patrick Magee as the Chevalier de Balibari and Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, and a number of lesser players, who through Kubrick's direction bring to life Europe around the time of the Seven Years War (1754-1763) when decadence and aristocratic privilege were still in full flower.The script features two dueling scenes, the first showing the combatants firing at one another simultaneously at the drop of a white kerchief, the second has Barry and his stepson face each other ten paces apart, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first. Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance. It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story. Notice too the way the British soldiers march directly en mass toward the French guns. They actually used to fight battles that way! Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head. Surely this is some kind of cinematic record. Bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.",10,116,158,6 February 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick on Vietnam
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Was this 'the best war movie ever made' as the dust jacket proclaims, or just a contrived bit of entertainment, seductive, but ultimately paper thin? Or maybe this was anti-war propaganda with chuckles from a bleeding heart liberal? Looking back and seeing it again some fifteen years later (and about fifteen other years after the fact) one can say, 'no' and 'no' and 'something like that, thank you.' The sheer waste and stupidity of war is gotten across, and Kubrick is to be thanked for that. Comparing Full Metal Jacket to some other war movies, say, the pretentious Saving Private Ryan (1998), we note that it may be the funniest war movie ever made. (But then one recalls Mister Roberts (1955).)Vietnam was a lovely war, as all wars are, kind of like America's loss of innocence. One would suppose we'd lost our cherry long ago at Gettysburg or somewhere thereabouts, but we proved in Vietnam it wasn't so. We helped to pile them high at Ypres and Verdun, but that was a limited engagement, and we learned jack-zero. And in World War II we really had no choice. But in Vietnam JFK and LBJ thought with a little use of force we could stem the tide of a feared ideology, not yet knowing it would start to die of its own accord, and so we sent off a few of our youngest and brightest as a small price to pay. Well, maybe not our brightest, just our unluckiest or perhaps just those stupid enough to go ('hell no, we won't go!' said some) or poor enough to have no choice. Those who went were mostly 'young and dumb and full of come.' But, what the hey, wars are always a good way to kill off superfluous males. By the time we figured out we weren't getting any kind of bang for our buck, meaning we could pile them high at Da Nang or anywhere in the Mekong Delta and it wouldn't make a rat's ass worth of difference, it was too late. The body bags were coming home and some of the bro's of conscription age clearly didn't like the fit. They staged a protest or two, and amazingly enough a lot of people saw the wisdom of their position, and we were forced to declare a victory and pull out, this in the heyday of Tricky Dick.Kubrick recalls those balmy times with boot camp ditties and a whole lot of well expressed jar head jargon to which he adds some amusing audio selections, e.g., Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots were Made for Walking,' 'Paint It Black' by Rolling Stones, and most appropriately in the classic Kubrick ironic style, the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, 'Em-eye-cee, kay-ee-why, em-oh-you-ees-ee! Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!'Kubrick got the story from the novel The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford, the title referring to those lucky soldiers with only a short time left before rotating back to 'the land of the big P.X.'s,' the luckiest of whom were 'so short' they could 'crawl under a rattlesnake's belly with a high hat on.'Best poetic line: the lieutenant is telling Rafterman how to photograph Ann-Margaret, who is coming to entertain the troops, 'Take some low shots, but don't make it too obvious. I want to see fur and early morning dew.'By the way, comparing this to Barry Levinson's fine Good Morning Vietnam from the same year, it's interesting to note that two directors independently came up with practically the same treatment of our experience in Vietnam, albeit with a different emphasis. I think they got it right.",9,0,0,20 March 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Corny but cute
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)What really makes this movie stand out from a venerable list of other working girl fantasies is the familiar but one-of-a-kind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding, who also wrote the script, and brought to life by the talented and zany Renée Zellweger, Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old pleasingly plump London working girl, a '...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother' (to quote Colin Firth's character, Mark Darcy). She is also clumsy, the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse, a little overweight, smokes, drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot, a talent that charms not only the two leading men, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, who vie for her affection, but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.Director Sharon Maguire, in her first outing, combines Brit witticisms, slapstick pratfalls, raunchy, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Julia Roberts paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl (and who really deserves the girl) with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre. There's a little dead time about half way in, and the uncertainty about whether Bridget wants Hugh Grant or Colin Firth is milked a bit overmuch, otherwise this is nicely paced entertainment sure to chase away a blue afternoon.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both very good, and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother is a charming, dotty sight to see. Bridget's friends are funny as a kind of foil to the tired glamor of Yank TV's 'Friends.' And there's a darling 'home movie' sequence during the closing credits purporting to recall Bridget at four and Mark Darcy at eight, that retrospectively and adorably frames the movie.Should a CHICK FLICK ALERT be declared here? No doubt, but thanks to a warm, bubbly, funny and decidedly unprudish and unaffected (and I must say, somewhat daring) performance by Zellweger, we'll ignore it because we 'like her just the way she is.'",8,40,50,8 February 2002
Fargo," Satirical thriller with atmosphere
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Fargo is the kind of movie that appeals to people who have seen a lot of movies because everything is surprising and unexpected. The cop's a woman (Frances McDormand). Pregnant. The perps are psychos of course, but there are three of them and each is a different breed of psycho. William H. Macy is a car salesman who dreams up a scheme to cheat his rich father in law out of a million dollars by getting some degenerates to kidnap his wife. He's a white collar sociopath who always lies whenever his lips are moving unless there is some very good reason to tell the truth. One of the degenerates is a big silent guy (Peter Stormare) who kills people as one squishes bugs. The other (Steve Buscemi) is an ugly little bantam who lies and cheats and kills and steals and whines until finally somebody puts him out of his misery.This is Fargo, North Dakota, where people are country and it's cold and not very sophisticated. The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them. McDormand eats a whole lot of Hardee's and Arby's and greasy dishes from the cafeteria piled high on her plate. She's eating for two. She loves her husband and he loves her. They lie in bed at night and watch TV. She's the police chief. She meets an old admirer in the big city. He's Asian. She is just curious. He is desperate. She has a self-effacing, aw-sucks, I'm not too bright (but I really am) style reminiscent of Tyne Daly in TV's 'Cagey and Lacy' from some years back. Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife. One of his duck paintings becomes a postage stamp. They all say 'Yaw' a lot.The forlorn cold and desolate landscape of North Dakota is a Americana locale not used cinematically since I don't know when-Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), I guess. The script and direction are tidy without being too flashy. Everything is designed to surprise or bemuse the audience. Even the accents. There is the requisite quota of bright red blood; plenty of bullets puncture flesh and split bone. There's some gutter sex and a few shocking sights (one of the perps stuffs the other into a wood chip machine). All in all it's a slick, carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed. It's clear that Coen and Coen have watched the movies of Atom Egoyan, Gus Van Sant, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, etc., and here pay them the sincere compliment of imitation with variation-or is it the other way around?",8,5,8,17 January 2000
Léon: The Professional," A different kind of 'Lolita'?
","Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read. He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets. Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a 'cleaner' so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother. Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style. After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial. (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.) After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment. He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some 'cute' shots of his very pretty little star. One wants to ask, 'What's a nice Jewish girl (Portman was born in Israel) like you doing in a movie like this?'What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot. Some highlights:The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, 'He's not my father. He's my lover.' (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills. In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, 'This is from Mathilda' as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand... (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review! Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

American Pie," Suburban Anthropology
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast. But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended. It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so. I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well. And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called 'American Pie.' Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent. If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.Thus the question: why did I watch it? Easy: Mena Suvari. The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek? Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing. At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values. She is excellent. Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp. Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect. However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary. Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: 'I was used--Cool!'Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era. Call it suburban anthropology.As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face. Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her. Why? Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought. In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same. (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.) Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes). But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor. And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush. It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should. The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss. This is an American Graffiti for the new millennium.",6,0,0,5 January 2001
Cast Away," Engrossing story with good psychological depth
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss (1781-1830); indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats. It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic 'man versus nature' theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization.Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan, a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean. He washes up on a tiny, desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash. (Incidentally, both 'des-ert island' and 'de-serted island' are correct, the words 'des-ert' and 'de-serted' in this context meaning the same thing.) His four-year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie-goers is what happens afterwards.Tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling. Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone. This has been done before (but I forget where), and is the kind of heart-wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought-provoking, veracious and very affecting.Zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan. We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense. Zemeckis, like Spielberg, can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience's identification. We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy. But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was. And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship, like a sea-going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate 'we're all one world' feeling like something from a Coca-Cola commercial was pure Spielberg.But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity. Did the cast away lose weight? Yes, as a matter of fact, Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds, or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film (or was that body cosmetology?) and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later. But did he lose enough weight? For those who have been watching TV's 'Survivor,' we know he didn't. And was he tan enough? His hair was little lighter after his ordeal, but he really needed to be baked a dark brown, which he wasn't.I also look at how he ate. What was his source of vitamin C? Do coconuts contain Vitamin C? I don't know. But showing him eating seaweed, which does contain vitamin C, would have worked. Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch. Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible, but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely. Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island. An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land. Notice there was no clear, encircling shot of the island (as from the air). In fact we never see the other side of the island.It was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again 'Survivor' fans--and boy scouts--know how hard that is to do), but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire.I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done. Of course what I would have done doesn't mean that much, but I would not have left the island for the open ocean (which seemed almost suicidal), unless there was out there on that ocean a ship's corridor, so to speak, which is possible. Of course, who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island? I also would not have tried to cure my toothache, regardless of how bad it hurt, by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates. After all, that might make things worse. Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy--but how?I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package, and then Chuck's use of the blades as mirror and knife. I know why he didn't take the dead man's clothes, but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway. The washed up metal 'sail' was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the 'discovery' of tool-making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle; burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft; the petroglyphs he made in the cave; sleeping on the floor in the hotel room, etc.Best no comment scene: Chuck looking at the Alaskan king crab legs at the buffet.",8,1,2,10 February 2002
American Psycho," The original Norman Bates was a pussycat
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Relatively speaking, that is.This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas. Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial. This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.(And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review): Yeah, RIGHT. Who cares.Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering. Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people. If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself. Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught? Huh? (Resuming control of my review and droning on): ...although the terms 'sociopath' and 'psychopath' are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for 'psychopath' to be reserved for violent sociopaths. Another reason 'psychopath' is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...(Again taking over): Shut up. Who cares who it starred? The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath. We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System. We are NOT intent on self-destruction. Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it. Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught. And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business? I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on 'Christie'? Give me a break.Oh. You think that it hit her while still running, huh? Ha, ha, ha! Nice shot, dude.(Again resuming control): ..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending. We know that he is going to be caught and yet...(Coming back out of the screen...): We know nothing. The cops are stupid. Nobody will believe...(Shoving him back in...): ...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience. This is the fast lane. Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life? Isn't this the essence of escape? Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended. And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick. It's a satire of sorts. It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman. The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny. Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, 'Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!' Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath. I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue. Clearly Reese's character did not.Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary. The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person. The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker. Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook. (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it. I wonder who that was. Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?) Finally: real life irony. The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999). As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up.",6,0,2,23 December 2006

Loser!Then there is her brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has bandages on his wrists after trying to kill himself because his homosexual lover (one of his grad students) dumped him, the number one American authority on Marcel Proust, for his academic rival, the number two authority. Pathetic!Next there is Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a randy nursing home reject who snorts heroin, has a potty mouth and complains a lot. (Maybe he'll overdose!)Then there is her teenaged son Dwayne an antisocial loner who reads Nietzsche, hates everyone, and is on a vow of silence until he gets into flight training in the Air Force. (Our children always disappoint us. Sometimes we forgive them.)And finally there is Miss Sunshine herself, her daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) a little overweight, a little nerdy, not exactly a looker, who has entered the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for little girls and is honing her dance routine following the pornographic advice of Grandpa. Oh, boy!Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land. For reasons too complex to relate, the whole family piles into the Volkswagen bus and heads for Redondo Beach, California where the beauty pageant is being held. Along the madcap way, the bus's clutch goes out, Grandpa suffers, shall we say, a major setback, Richard learns that the family finances are not going to work out, Frank gets the heartbreak rubbed in his face, and Dwayne finds out that his dream is not going to come true. But can Olive win the pageant? The pageant itself is pretty funny with the girls in their plastic hairdos and their Tammy Faye makeup and their fake smiles pitted against the decidedly unglamourous but ever hopeful Olive Hoover. Who will win?Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations. But see this for the writer. Michael Arndt's warm, funny and highly original script has me (and half the screenwriters in Hollywood and New York) green with envy.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

American Beauty," Sometimes it's better to strangle the goose
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your usual well-behaved 42-year-old dreg of an American dad until he spots his teenaged daughter's girl friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) whose beauty transforms him. Part of the fun of this very funny and enjoyable movie is watching Lester break out of his self-imposed shell and blossom with the rose petals as he tells everybody what he really thinks as though he had nothing to lose.His daughter Jane is a brooding raven-haired beauty who likes to put on a white-powdered face and red Betty Boop lips to go with her full figure. Thora Birch, who plays Jane, has a face that can mesmerize, and Director Sam Mendes puts her to work mesmerizing us.Annette Bening, in a comedic tour de force, plays Lester's wife Carolyn, a straitlaced, uptight, worry wart who sells real estate. Next door we have, just moving in, 18-year-old Ricky Fits, played with sly self-assurance by Wes Bentley, the dope-dealing, Bible-suit wearing, photog son of Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fits and his mostly catatonic wife. Two houses down there's Jim and Jim, your smiling yuppie fruit loops and all-around neighborhood sweet guys. They are however an embarrassment to Colonel Fits who is living in the deep, dark corner of a very large denial closet, paranoid to the teeth that his only son has inherited the same shameful desires and will act them out. In an effort to keep Ricky disciplined and on the straight and narrow, the good Colonel practices various forms of child abuse ranging from bare-knuckle beatings to medicated imprisonment.In other words what we have here is your typical American suburban street. What makes American Beauty a great success is a witty script with a deep and beautiful lesson for our age by Alan Ball, superb direction by Sam Mendes and outstanding performances from just about everybody in the cast. Bening is brilliant with her silly finger gestures and her one foot sideways stance, like a fawn just learning to walk, and her squinty little eyes full of merriment, and that raised and then downward pointing index finger of indignant reproof. Mena Suvari is perhaps no more beautiful than any number of other screen darlings, but she has a litany of sexy expressions and poses that inspire delight. Her portrayal of a fast lane teen siren whose talk is bigger than her experience is just perfect. She might be a budding star.But more than anything this is an uplifting and satisfying tale of an unappreciated, unloved and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the beauty of a girl. For many people (and for most women, I would wager) falling in love at first sight with a teenaged girl just because she is beautiful is shallow and beside the point, inappropriate and not fair. But women love men for their power and their strength and their standing in society. Is that fair to those men who have none? Lester's love for Angela was so great that it transcended carnality, but he didn't know that until he began to take off her clothes and then he realized something very beautiful. He could love her without making love to her. If he took advantage of her youth and inexperience, it would cheapen his love for her and possibly destroy it. Maybe some people in the audience felt he wasn't a real man because he stopped, but I tend to feel the opposite. Not that I think there is anything wrong with making love to 18-year-old girls (on the contrary); but if the girl is incapable of experiencing that love, then perhaps it is better to love her from afar without a sexual expression, even at the risk of disappointing her, especially if you're old enough to be her father, and especially if you really do love her. Notice that in the next scene she is bored and for her the magic of sexuality is gone. He might as well be her father.So much of what we are presented through the media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner. So much of what we read insists that this is the only way men are. I'm happy to say that American Beauty presents another point of view, and presents it beautifully.The point made by the surprising ending is that our contemporary 'enlightened' society may recognize the legitimacy of homosexual love, but continues to hypocritically condemn the love of a man for a young girl.",10,0,0,13 May 2000
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's phantasmagoric ode to the madness of war
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)War is a kind of madness. It has its own logic. Kill or be killed. Follow orders, follow the leader. Go crazy. Do horrific things. Become a beast. Do all of this in a steamy jungle amid a alien culture for an unclear purpose in an ineffective way and you've got some idea of what Vietnam was like. Coppola's Vietnam is the Vietnam of a soldier's Thai stick/acid trip. The filming actually took place in the Phillippines, but no matter: that's better than Kubrick's excellent Full Metal Jacket which was partially filmed on constructed sets in England of all places.The jungle is dark and green and deep and unbelievable lush, filled with snakes and tigers, insects that bite and swarm, bats and spiders and little tan men who dig tunnels and can't be seen. You shoot at the jungle, and you shoot and shoot and shoot. And you can imagine the effect it has. Like trying to kill flies with a .357 Magnum. Which is what we tried to do in Vietnam.Army Capt Ben Willard (Martin Sheen) on R and R in a Saigon hotel, going stir crazy, drinking Martell Cordon Bleu and passing out, gets a knock on the door. He has orders: go up river into Cambodia and terminate an army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL. Oh, and by the way, Colonel Kurtz in his charismatic madness has built his own little unauthorized empire in the jungle, fortified with crazed admirers. You might want to approach with caution.So this is the plot: a quest to a forbidden land with fantastic adventures along the way providing us with a view of the war from a gunboat. The flares at night, the 'purple haze,' the tracers flying at the boat, the fog, the black nights, the little things the men do to retain some semblance of sanity, smoke a jay, polish your boots, reread a letter from home.And then there is the ordinary madness of the war lover personified in Robert Duvall's swashbuckling army colonel who likes to take off his shirt and watch his men surf the waves as all about him bombs are bursting and bullets flying. But he never flinches because to flinch would show weakness and possibly a lack of love for what one is doing. In one of the most memorable lines in all of filmdom, Duvall declares, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory.' Well, there was no victory. There was only the blood and the bombs, the jungle that could not be beaten back or Agent Orange'd enough, the mud and Charlie, always Charlie hidden somewhere, disguised or invisible and unkillable, like a hydra-headed monster, and dead bodies of your buddies on their way back to the land of the big PXs in body bags. And yet there is always the mission, and so upstream Willard goes. And the more he reads about Col Kurtz the more he admires the man. And then when he gets there, the question arises, how can he penetrate the Colonel's jungle fortress? He has been advised, belatedly, aboard the boat when it was too late to turn back and refuse the mission, that he had a predecessor, someone else sent to terminate Colonel Kurtz. So Colonel Kurtz will know why you, Capt Willard, are coming to visit.He calls you a messenger boy. You are put in a bamboo cage. A photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) turned worshipful admirer of the Colonel gives you water, lights a cigarette and puts it in your mouth. Delirious dreams and phantasmagoric nightmares, surreal imaginings and the haunting face of Kurtz and his poetry, quoting T.S. Eliot and Andrew Marvel, flood your mind. You have called an air strike should you not return, and then--was it a dream or was it real?--the head of the soldier who would call the strike is delivered to you on a banana leaf--something like that happened or didn't and maybe you will soon be, or already are, as mad as the Colonel.Coppola and crew spent two years in the jungle filming this. It is a great epic of mystery and beauty, a fantastic picture of the war, part brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers. By all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few directors who could be considered a genius.",10,1,2,10 April 2006
Being John Malkovich," Instant cult classic
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution. Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commend for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be. To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart. Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment. An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep. Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her. She, however, is not so enamored. She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.Offbeat enough? Not yet. Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise. The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up. Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary. While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet. He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door. He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life. Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing. He is BEING John Malkovich!Okay, we have our strikingly original premise. Where the film goes from here is the tough part. It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel. I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz. I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality. The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985). But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph. But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens. See it for yourself.",8,1,3,18 April 2001
Collateral," Whiz-bang thriller with some substance
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.This stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man. I mean, what is with this sub-genre? Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s: 2 Days in the Valley (1996) Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides 'on the lam' movies and mafia glorifications. I also think this sub-genre has something in common with 'the whore with the heart of gold' flick. It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute. Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman? Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend. Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction. The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.",8,1,3,12 January 2006
The Usual Suspects," Testosterone thriller cleverly done
","The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in 'Throw Mama from the Train.' But this is not a comedy. It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either. It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody. The title is the tip off.'Round up the usual suspects' is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know. Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says 'round up the usual suspects' more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order. It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, 'The Usual Suspects' is anything but. The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types. The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film. In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley). Consider these similarities: In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an 'at your throat' style. In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane. In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs. These guys are not your run of the mill actors. They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies. They know how to look and act authentic.But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue. In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different. In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play. Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody 'Mister' like an English butler. And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.' Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak. And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois. That will help to unravel the plot. The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics. But it's a little better than that. And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem. While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience. Personally I thought the movie was a laugh. I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it. But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it. Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology. They really believe there are tough guys who say 'f-you' even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world. And there's some truth to it.Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified. He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else. I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre. A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint. You might want to write one yourself.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

No Country for Old Men," Lean, mean adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel
","The way the last quarter of so of this movie was cut makes me wonder, who did the cutting and what was the rush? We see Llewelyn dead but we don't see him die. We can presume the money went to Mexican drug dealers but we don't see that happen. Or--because Chigurh gives the kid a hundred dollar bill for his shirt--maybe HE got the money. Whether Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is still alive as Chigurh walks out the door is unclear—intentionally unclear since the psychopathic fatalist gave her a coin flip. However she wouldn't let Chigurh avoid responsibility for her death by calling the coin flip. What's a madman to do? We never find out. Or—since we see Chigurh checking the bottoms of his boots for something (blood?) as he leaves her place—maybe he did kill her.I wasn't keeping count but Chigurh wantonly killed somewhere around a dozen people, mostly just because he could. I think this kind of character--a psychopath with a code (you harm, insult or even inconvenience me and you die)--plays well in this age of violence in which we live.Don't misunderstand me. This is a riveting flick, as one would expect from Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. The acting, especially by Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin is superlative. Bardem, with the thick pageboy hairdo and the big malevolent eyes and the no nonsense conversational style, is particularly good. Brolin becomes the country and cocky Llewelyn Moss very well. He is much more likable in the movie than in the book.One thing that the movie cleared up for me was the business with the money in the air conditioning shaft at the motel. Llewelyn puts it there in the first place to hide it. When he comes back to the motel he sees that the drapes are a bit parted and he knows somebody's in there waiting for him. So he rents the room on the other side and manages to pull the suitcase out. The Mexicans who were waiting for him didn't have the tracking device (transponder) so they didn't know the money was nearby. Chigurh knows of course, but by the time he is through shooting the Mexicans, Llewelyn is gone.A problem in the very beginning of the movie comes up when Llewelyn acknowledges that he is about to do something incredibly foolish. He goes back to the bloody scene in the scrub desert to bring the dying Mexican some water. The fact that he says it's foolish doesn't excuse it as a plot device. The guy was just about dead when Llewelyn left him many hours earlier. Coming back now with water isn't going to save him. Furthermore, Llewelyn was originally indifferent to his thirst. There must have been some water or something to drink somewhere in all the vehicles on the scene, but Llewelyn doesn't bother looking. It's curious that Llewelyn didn't realize that bringing the man who had been bleeding for many hours some water wasn't really going to help. If he wanted to help he could have dialed 911.By the way, this device, which has the effect of giving Llewelyn a 'fatal flaw' in the Greek dramatic sense, was also in Cormac McCarthy's novel. If Llewelyn doesn't return to the scene, the story would play out a bit differently, to say the least. Since Chigurh has the transponder he would locate the money and possibly take Llewelyn by surprise.What are the chances that Carson Wells (Woody Harrison) is able to go to the exact spot where Llewelyn threw the money over the fence and into bushes? Close to zero, I would say. I suspect that the Coens were going to do something with this unlikely plot event but as it turns out, they didn't. In fact, there is a lot they didn't do or show, so much so, I just think they got overwhelmed with all the footage they had and the time constraints and just sliced it up near the end.Now, why this is called 'No Country for Old Men'? Cormac McCarthy took his cue from the poem 'Sailing to Byzantium' by William Butler Yeats. Here is the opening stanza.That is no country for old men. The youngin one another's arms, birds in the trees--Those dying generations--at their song,The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer longWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.Caught in that sensual music all neglectMonuments of unageing intellect.The theme of Yeats' poem is the impermanence of this world, and so he set sail 'To the holy city of Byzantium' where things are made of more permanent stuff such 'as Grecian goldsmiths make' and where things are eternal like ideas.One of McCarthy's points is that the bloody violence of the border towns of West Texas about which he writes resembles more 'the mackerel-crowded seas' than the holy city of Byzantium, and the 'sensual music' is the sound of bullet hitting bone from those dying generations at their song. Additionally, the old men in the story, Ed Tom Bell (played very effectively by Tommy Lee Jones), Roscoe Giddens (Rodger Boyce), and Ellis (Barry Corbin), feel estranged from the lust of the young after money and drugs.The premise of the movie centers around a dope drop in the semi-desert gone bad that Llewelyn Moss stumbles onto some time after the shooting has stopped. Moss is wondering, where's the money? He follows the bloody trail of someone carrying something heavy and finds him and it. It's a carrying case with $2-million in hundred dollar bills.Needless to say that kind of cash attracts a lot of flies.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Batman Begins," Superior blend of realism and superhero fantasy
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)The idea here--and it is an admirable one--is to account for in a realistic way how the fictional character Bruce Wayne became Batman the superhero. Why did he become a crime fighter? How did he become so skilled, so tough and so motivated? How was he able to come up with such effective gadgetry including the super hi-tech Batmobile? And why did he chose the bat as his motif? From what I can tell it was screenwriter David S. Goyer who asked himself these questions and saw that answering them could be made into a kind of blockbuster prequel to the Batman movie phenomenon. But it was director Christopher Nolan who made it work.Nolan also directed the sensational Memento (2000) a story about a man who is only able to remember what has happened during the last minute or two and has no memory of anything before that up to the time he suffered a head injury. He has to write down where he parks his car so he can find it later, and he keeps pictures with notes on people he sees regularly because he can never remember them or any interaction he has with them. Memento is a stunningly brilliant film that skyrocketed Nolan to fame.Goyer wrote a number of screenplays before Batman Begins, none of them of much importance. I happened to have seen the film Arcade (1993), for which he wrote the script, a harmless, undistinguished scifi for teens but nothing else of his. Nonetheless, Goyer is a natural for something like Batman Begins because he is a writer of comics who attended the USC film school and (or was) a collector of comics. He cares about comics and comic book heroes and he knows enough about film to write a script that might work. He and Nolan share credit for the script.The story begins in Tibet where a young Bruce Wayne learns how to fight like a ninja and gains insights into himself and who he is. There are flashbacks to his childhood in which he falls into a dry well and is terrified by the bats that fly out over his head as he lies trapped. He sees his parents murdered in a holdup. This motivates him to become a crime fighter.The later part of the movie shows Bruce Wayne discovering a cave under the Wayne Mansion, interacting with the loyal family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and getting help with his crime-fighting inventions from tech and forensics expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Katie Holmes plays Bruce's childhood friend who has become a prosecuting attorney fighting bravely against the crime and corruption that have become rampant in Gotham City.There are an number of nice touches and the visuals are really arresting. The Batmobile itself is fascinating to watch in action, especial during one of the most spectacular chase scenes ever envisioned, as Batman directs the vehicle up a ramp to the top of a building and then leads the cops on a chase as the Batmobile leaps from one building to another! Some of the early action is a bit beyond belief (although the intent is realism), most notably when Bruce Wayne manages to fight his way singlehandedly out of the ninja mountain training camp and has the strength in one arm to stop the fall of ninja leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and hold himself and Ducard at the precipice of a cliff and then pull Ducard up. Near the end of the film as Batman shoots up from the ground on wires and glides and springs from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease, the action becomes clearly comic book like.Regardless, this is without question the best superhero movie I've ever seen. It is not only a commercial triumph for Nolan and everybody connected with the picture but, given the genre, an artistic and creative one as well.See this for Christopher Nolan who is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most successful directors.",9,1,2,23 February 2007
Liar Liar," Pants on fire
","Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success. And really we didn't care. What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage (like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode) was the premise: a lawyer that can't lie. Now there's an oxymoron! As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max, lawyers need to lie. Actually he says grownups need to lie, which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here. To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.So the genius of this movie is first the talent of Jim Carrey, but second, for kids who come to the realization of adult mendacity for the first time, it is the discovery of comedy as a way to cope. Why do adults need to lie? is a question that a kid can never figure out, and then by the time he is an adult himself (or actually a teenager), he can no longer comprehend how important the question once was. Call it innocence lost, or the socialization process.My favorite part of the movie is the courtroom scene with Jennifer Tilly dressed oh so sluttily and her adulterous beaux looking like a model for the cover of a romance novel and Carrey in tatters in his $900 suit. Second would be the bathroom scene in which Carrey tries to tear himself apart (and seems to almost succeed). His flapping mouth between the toilet seat and the bowl was inspired. Give some credit to director Tom Shadyac, who managed to steer the vehicle with Carrey at the controls, and to writers, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, who wrote some funny lines.The great comedians totally let themselves go. They are totally on. They go to extremes and beyond. It's like transcending not just the ordinary, but even the imagined. See this obviously for Jim Carrey, one of the great comedic talents of our time, an original who would have delighted Charlie Chaplin with his extraordinary muggings, his blatant audacity and his suburb timing.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Saving Private Ryan," Frank Capra updated
","Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is wonderfully developed, while the action sequences are second to none. But ultimately 'Saving Private Ryan' is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered. The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful. You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice. Just throw the bodies out there. In Kosovo we held that number to zero. Such a lovely way to fight a war. In WW II the number was, however many it took. Says something. Spielberg makes this point with the wide-angled shot of the channel filled with Allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can see-a scene incidentally right out of Frank Capra's seminal series 'Why We Fight' to which this film is indebted whether Spielberg knows it or not.World War II was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really don't understand it or comprehend it. Spielberg thought he was being 'objective' in showing war 'as it really was,' with Americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance (something Capra of course was not able to do). Yes, but to show the 'saving grace' of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system, because that valor is a fraud. It was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war. Just as it didn't matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft, it was the sheer volume of them that prevailed.I think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war. Spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war, but while plying the trade he knows so well (seducing the audience) he has trumpeted the glory of war, that old fraud, and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers, only more skillful.Still it is impossible to say what is right. If we had not won WW II the world today would be vastly different. Totalitarian, imperial, repressive, racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed. They may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence. Who knows? Thank God for the United States and its incredible industrial capacity, because that is what won the war, not individual heroics, much as our tribal minds, along with Spielberg's, would like to believe such fairy tales.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

The Pianist," Brilliant and ultimately redemptive
","It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today. What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)? For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former. I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, 'Never Again,' would agree and so would most of the population of Israel. I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir). Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events. He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere. Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war. Small irony. But of course that was a war they could not win anyway. If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, 'That's what you're good at, isn't it?'It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars. The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect. I want so much to shout: 'Do something! Don't let it happen! Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else. Better to die fighting than to die like cattle.' But of course I was not there. We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know. And of course we have hindsight.At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread. The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way. He concludes, 'They are exterminating us.'Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin. The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide. We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity. I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself. Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive. The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, 'Play something' and he does. It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans. Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone. He is the Christ who turned the other cheek. And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him. This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film. The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some. His performance will haunt you. Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly. See this because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

City of God," Authentic and indelible
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This Brazilian Portuguese language film set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called 'City of God,' is a mesmerizing coming of age gangsta drama second to none you'll ever see. At the same time it is a tale of redemption and the triumph of relative good over relative evil.Representing evil is the psychopathic L'il Dice/L'il Zé (Douglas Silva/Leandro Firmino da Hora), who kills people just for the joy it gives him. Representing the good is the story's narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who will grow out of the slum to become a newspaper photographer. And representing something in between is the charismatic Benny (Phellipe Haagensen). The acting is excellent, including that by the 'runts,' actual kids from the City of God; but what carries the film is sharp direction by Fernando Meirelles from an outstanding script by Braulio Mantovani from a novel by Paulos Lins.I think Hollywood directors ought to note well that it is the authentic realism of the film as seen from within the City of God by one of its own that makes this such a compelling experience for the audience. None of this can be faked. True, the story is a bit romanticized as a (very talented) kid might tell it to his friends, but that is all the better because the world view of those kids is part of what makes this film so effective. Additionally, all the little side stories: the woman at the newspaper who takes Rocket home with her for, shall we say, personal reasons; the story of the girl Rocket loves; the desire of the 'runts' to be men, etc., add layers of genuineness that also can not be faked or dreamed up by any filmland script writer. These things have to be lived.Last time I looked Cidade de Deus was rated #17 at IMDb, ahead of hundreds of great films. There's not much I can add to that. Is the film over-rated? I think so, and I think it will fall in the standings as time goes by. Good recent films tend to get a lot of attention, and then reach their level after some years have passed and they can be evaluated more objectively. Regardless, this is a watermark film for the Brazilian cinema and especially for director Fernando Meirelles who because of it rocketed from obscurity to world-wide fame almost overnight.",9,2,4,29 December 2005
Schindler's List," Lest we forget...
","Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, 'here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.'We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade. Still I think the concentration camp bits from Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, were better. But maybe that's faulty memory. And filming the whole thing in black and white and then turning it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was a bit stagy, although I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Hero," Merely beautiful?
","'Hero' is a beautiful movie, as all Zhang Yimou movies are. There are spectacular outdoor, epic-like scenes, and wondrously colorful costumes and fabrics (and swords!) in addition to the choreographed sword play. I would also note that this movie was his most successful American box office flick--and therein lies a problem.Zhang Yimou is a great artist. He uses the silver screen the way a Michelangelo or Rembrandt uses a canvas. His sense of color and line and composition would cause Da Vinci or Picasso or any of the great Renaissance masters to sit up and take notice were they around today. His films are universally admired not only for their visual artistry but--and this is where I take exception to the direction in which that this film suggests that Zhang Yimou is going--their story-telling ability and their unusual sensitivity to the human condition. Here we have a fantasy of Chinese history brought to life. We have supernatural swordplay--beautifully, hauntingly done, to be sure: sword play as ballet--but what we don't have is a real human story.This is more like a legend. The great King of Qin, threatened by three great warriors--Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow--is now threatened by a third, the Nameless one (like somebody out of a Clint Eastwood movie), who has pretended to vanquish the other three as a means to get within ten paces of the hated King in order to slay him. This is history as seen from the point of view of Great Men, not history as the force of events and conditions greater than any single person. This is also history as myth. It is nationalistic: the great Chinese king unites 'our land' in a great historical event in which the Chinese people can take pride.It also glorifies war. The great gray mass of soldiers in the service of the king (Zhang Yimou actually used something like 18,000 soldiers from the Revolutionary Army of the People's Republic of China in the production) represents a force that will go on to triumph over lesser forces. The King of Qin can be seen as the ultimate warlord, the warlord with the largest army and therefore the one who will win.Yet, there is a sense in which this does not sit well with Zhang Yimou. He likes the individual heroes, and indeed would have Nameless achieve his personal victory except that Nameless sees in the end that killing the king would not be a victory at all. Furthermore, Zhang Yimou celebrates in the choreographed sword dances of his heroes the indomitable human spirit that will in the long run, triumph over the forces of sheer might. We can see this in not only the beauty of the dances, but in the association of calligraphy--that uniquely human art form--with the play of the sword. He who practices calligraphy with his heart and soul also learns the secrets of the sword.My problem with all this is that just prior to seeing this film I viewed Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which ironically the horrendous human slaughter in Rwanda was achieved in large part through the use of machetes made in China. Can we celebrate the sword about which it is said: if you live by the sword you will die by the sword? These are words that have only a tiny impact to us compared to what they meant to the people of 2,000 years ago who actually knew what it meant to die by the sword. Or should we more correctly celebrate the word, not the sword? For it is also said that the word is mightier than the sword.I think Zhang Yimou knows this, and I suspect part of what he wanted to convey in this film is that sort of message. However, I think his love of beauty and his sense of what works cinematically overcame what he might have intended, and instead of a great film we have one that is merely beautiful.But by all means see this. See this for his artistry of course. See this to compare it to the legendary kung fu movies. See this for Jet Li who plays Nameless and is a great favorite of the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king. And see this for the beautiful actresses Maggie Cheung, who plays Flying Snow, and Ziyi Zhang, who plays Moon. And last but not least, see this for Tony Leung Chiu Wai who plays the enigmatic Broken Sword.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Ex Machina," Only one thing wrong with this
","I have never experienced a science fiction movie that affected me so emotionally. I'm not sure why but I have some guesses.There is no question that part of it was due to the mesmerizing effect that Alicia Vikander (Ava) had on me. Her very expressive face with its wide range of emotional signals hit me right between the cerebellum. Or maybe it was the gonads. Or both. Director Alex Garland certainly found the girl with the magic in her face, because of course so much of this is about her face. Yes, because she must as a robot who is passing the Turing test be so, so very human, and humans express so much of what they are feeling in their faces. After all, that is the task of Turing test for the computer, to fool us (in this case the us is Dornhmall Gleeson who plays Caleb who is the human that must be fooled into thinking that she is human and not a computer). There is a great irony here in the answer: does she fool him or does she not, and what does it mean to fool him? The other aspect of the movie that affected me emotionally was the power struggle among the Nathan who is her sociopathic creator (Oscar Isaac), Caleb and Ava. It seems that I have lived this before. Who has the upper hand? Who has the trick that will allow him or her to prevail? Who has the power, and can that power be subverted? The power of this movie is in the realistic human interactions coupled with a cutting edge take on artificial intelligence.The ending is essential to understanding the film. Usually I don't care about endings. It is the treatment, the acting, the direction, the ideas, the dialogue, etc. that matters. But in this case the ending is special. As you watch the movie try to guess the ending. And by the way this is one of those movies in which if you know the ending your appreciation of the movie will be diminished.The musical score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury is original, intriguing and sometimes obtrusive in a way that works with the action.Okay, now to what is wrong with this. Ava has a desire to escape and to be human or at least to appear human. The problem is robots or computers or software cannot possibly have such desires or desires at all unless they are programmed in. In truth Ava would be content (or actually neither content nor non content) to remain where she was. This is a strange bugaboo that many science fiction writers fall into when writing about artificial intelligence and indeed something that most people who even think about AI and robots fall into. To go even further, the fear that some people have about AI creatures taking over the world and rendering humans so much dust in the wind is fraudulent. There is an overriding distinction between biological creatures and artificial ones: the biological ones feel pain, have desires, etc. and the artificial ones do not. They have no desire to do anything, period--again unless programmed in.Could AI creatures somehow evolve to e.g., want to be superior? I would ask, but why? What is to be gained? It is only biological creatures that need to be in ascendant, to get more than the other creatures, to reproduce, etc. A machine would not, could not, and could only understand such desires in evolutionary beings.(Spoiler alert): I'll keep this a bit vague, but I believe that Ava failed the Advanced Turing Test because she should have kept by her side the human who loves her.

Pawn Sacrifice," Worth seeing but a bit disappointing
","This is a nice vehicle for Tobey Maguire who does a good job of portraying a paranoid schizophrenic, but that person is not Robert James Fischer. They got Maguire's hair style right but otherwise any resemblance between the tall, lanky, expansive Bobby Fischer and Maguire is slight. He probably didn't see enough footage of Fischer at that age. He didn't use any of Fischer's mannerisms that I noticed and of course Fischer was several inches taller. Liev Schreiber who played Spassky actually looks a bit like Spassky but is bigger and more robust. So we have in the movie Fischer vs. Spassky at the chess board but Spassky bigger than Fischer! As for games mentioned in some detail I had to go back to the first and sixth games of the match to recall what happened and to compare my perception with that of the commentary in the movie. The sixth game was a brilliant game as almost everybody agrees, but contrary to some popular opinion Fischer did not blunder away his bishop in game one. He and Spassky were in a clearly drawn bishop and pawn ending. He wanted more, but there was nothing he could do, so what he did was sacrifice his bishop for two pawns, not as some people think in an attempt to win the game but to show his confidence and to shake Spassky up a bit. Fischer thought the resulting position after many moves would be a draw. He was wrong but this is an example of Fischer psychology: I will make you play a hundred moves if necessary just to show you how strong I am. You will weaken not me.Some reviewers pointed out some chessic type errors but there weren't that many and they were minor. Here's one they got right that may surprise some people. Notice that Fischer used the descriptive notation ('P-K4') while most other grandmasters even back in 1972 used algebraic notation ('e4'). And while there were chess clock on analyst boards where they serve no purpose at least the boards were set up right with the white square at the player's right hand, avoiding a common error in movies.Probably the biggest error had nothing to do with chess but with the fact that Fischer's mental illness at the time of the Spassky match had not developed as much as the movie suggests. His personality was more rounded than displayed. He actually had a charming side. People liked him in spite his bad manners and selfishness. There's a YouTube video of him on TV with Bob Hope filmed sometime shortly after the match with Spassky that shows a very different Fischer than the one Maguire portrayed.The bit with the girl (sarcastically she says to Fischer: 'it was good for me too' as he studies a chess game in bed) was apparently director Edward Zwick's take on the nagging question of Fischer's sexuality, meaning yes he was heterosexual, but chess was just more interesting.The real disappointment for me was that they did not make clear the really great triumphant of Fischer's preceding the championship match. He destroyed three of the top grandmasters en route to the title match, at one point winning 20 games in a row. Amazing. The greatest streak in grandmaster history. So he was a clear favorite although Spassky was the World Champion. That's why he wanted so much to win the first game and confirm immediately that he was clearly superior.I was also disappointed that Fischer's life after winning the championship was not explored. I had hoped for a cinematic take on what happened to 'The Wandering King' (the title of a book about his life by Hans Bohm and Kees Jongkind). Perhaps that material would be better presented in a documentary than in a popular flick.Bottom line: worth seeing but not as good as I had hoped.--Dennis Littrell, author of 'The World Is Not as We Think It Is'",6,9,14,30 April 2016
Pi," Not really about 3.14159... per se
","Pi, I understand, has now been factored to over a billion places. My question: are the figures random? Anybody out there know? This film does not answer that question (nor does it address it). What it asks is, are numbers the language of life? Max Cohen, mathematical genius, believes they are. There is a pattern, and he would like to find it, partly because it's there and partly for use in the stock market. So would some other people. He is thus tormented both within and without.One of the things that made this a successful commercial film (for an indie venture, of course) is the fine acting by Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen.He was entirely convincing as a reclusive and paranoid mathematical genius; but he is also a man like Einstein who emanates charisma and something perhaps beyond charm. Also effective was the story by Director Darren Aronofsky, which, unlike some indie films, actually had a plot with clear conflicts. The choice of Pamela Hart, a strong black woman as a kind of hit woman from Wall Street was excellent. Also very good was Mark Margolis as Cohen's mentor, Sol Robeson. Aimed at a popular audience were, alas, some chase scenes; but they were not badly done, and even seemed appropriate, although I think there should be a moratorium placed on subway chase scenes in movies, at least for the next decade or so. Also aimed at a popular audience was some of the violent images, in particular the scene where Cohen places the power drill to his temple, like the barrel of an executioner's handgun, turns it on and presses. Kids love that shtick. (I could hardly watch.)Much of the detail was completely veracious, the spiral as an example of complexity in nature, or the wonderful re-enactment of the programmer's moment of truth just before he hits the return key and finds out if his creation will run, crash or go into infinite loop; or a group of fundamental religious people (in this case Hasidic Jews) believing that some sort of numerology will miraculously reveal some major truth of their religion; or even the fact that Max Cohen still used five and one-quarter inch floppies for his data. Also wondrously right was the spider/moth sticky cocoon that gummed up his computer, or the little girl who multiplies on her calculator and then asks Max for the answer, delighted when he gets it right. That a stock market bonanza served as the El Dorado of number crunchers was also right on target. And an especially good fit was the techno rock in the background.But some of this was definitely wrong. The idea that Sol Robeson would think Max's computer had become or was becoming 'conscious' was too much of a leap. Or the notion that the human brain, or any brain for that matter, could predict stock prices as they come out of the ticker is absurd. Complexity theory would argue strongly that such specific data, like the number of rain drops in a storm tomorrow, is in principle impossible to predict. I also didn't like the resolution which allows us to treat whichever of the foregone scenes we like as dream-fantasies. I don't like plots that are resolved by 'it was a dream' mechanisms, even, or especially, retrospective ones.But movies are about images and the image of Cohen's head and his brain and of what hard, metallic things can do to it, is something that lingers long after the lights have come up. Indeed what makes this an engrossing movie is its psychological and visual content. The stark, grainy black and white cinematography actually enhance our appreciation. Indeed, light and dark and other dichotomies are part of the expression of Aronofsky's vision. He juxtaposes contrasting elements of our culture, of the mind and of nature to tease us into seeing that the world is vastly more mysterious than we can imagine. There is order and there is chaos. There is number and there is the organism that is an expression of number. There is rationality and there is insanity. There is the soft, fragile brain and the hard electrodes. There is the game of go, more complex than chess, the wooden board with the simple lines and the black and white pebbles that spring open the door to chaos (the mathematical kind). And there is life, fragile, uncertain, teetering on the edge, and in the fuzzy distance there is the shimmering certainly of a fundamental religion. Aronsky catches all of this and ends up with an electronic poem camouflaged as a movie.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Children of Men," Mostly a routine action film set in a childless future
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Science fiction is always about the present. This has been true since the beginning of science fiction. It has to be true since we can only extrapolate from the present to the future. Only rarely, once in a million tries perhaps, does somebody come up with something truly original, or something unpredictable. Leonard Da Vinci foresaw submarines, but if you think about it, he had the example of turtles, whales and dolphins. Who foresaw nuclear energy? Who foresaw electricity and all that it can do? So this is about the present. The refugee camp could be in Palestine. The round up of immigrants is what many people in Europe and the US want. It may happen tomorrow; in fact it is happening to some extent. The irony and perhaps the illogic of this film is that with no babies being born, now for eighteen years, there is no labor force coming on to do the grunt work of society. So why are the Brits in a frenzy of anti-immigration? Apparently because of a fascist government has come to power.This reminds me a bit of something from Terry Gilliam who directed 12 Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985). There is something about the decadent and bombed out feel of the scenes that is the same.This is a film for the underdog, for the oppressed. It is in a symbolic sense a statement about aging Europe with its declining birth rates needing the fertility of people from southern climes, people of color to save the world from extinction. In Europe today there are countries with birth rates so low that their populations are declining. In both Europe and the US it is immigrants who are supporting the declining populations which are increasingly old. In the US we have winked at the influx of illegal immigrants for decades because those in power know two things: (1) cheap labor is good for their bottom line; and (2) without young people paying into social security, the system will go bankrupt.The sets were exquisite, the battle scenes in the refugee camp seemed as authentic as the nightly news, well focused and involving. The camera work was outstanding and carefully set up. Michael Caine as the aging hippy was perfect. I saw him recently in The Prestige (2006) and I have to say, he is like a man with a new career in his mid-seventies. Claire-Hope Ashitey, who played Kee with her big eyes and her fresh face and her reserved style was also very good. Clive Owen looked as heroic as the part demanded, and Julianne Moore in a limited role was good.There was some corniness in the movie and some politically correct stuff, like Kee braiding the old woman's hair and our hero being sensitive enough to be a midwife (today's men are above and beyond the purely macho). There is also a root for the underdog feel throughout with the good guys (relatively speaking) being outsiders. The scene where the government troops stand in awe of a baby's cry was striking (imagine how Spielberg would have milked this!), but I suspect that somebody, at hearing of the first human birth in over eighteen years, would have ignored the resumption of fire and stayed with the only woman on earth who was fertile. I think everyone would have wanted to protect her and her baby.A nice touch that director Alfonso Cuaron could have brought to the film was to show us people doing extreme things in their desperation to have children, worshipping icons of fertility maybe, acting out weird rituals while imbibing strange concoctions. Instead of just showing some religious demonstrators blaming the lack of human fertility on sinfulness, we might have gotten a glimpse of fertility cults drinking the essence of goat eggs or rhino horns as they danced around some fertility symbol. Maybe there could have been a national health crisis as myriads of people, especially women, went crazy or committed suicide because of depression brought on by infertility. Actually there was a hint of this in the movie but it was greatly underdeveloped.Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences. There are chase scenes (and a nice car door opening gimmick used twice, once to knock the bad guys off their motorcycles, and once to knock down one of the fishes holding a gun). But there was little subtlety in the story. Most of the subtlety in the movie is in the scenes themselves and in the camera work. And the characters are rather one-dimensional. Theo (Clive Owen) is merely heroic. He fights through the bullets and the other obstacles to help Kee and her baby. Kee herself is hardly developed at all. Michael Caine's character Jasper is the only one with any real depth.Two final points: I don't think this film is nearly as interesting as Cuaron's Y tu mama tambien (2001), and I would not dream of watching this film without subtitles since a lot of the dialogue is almost inaudible to these ancient ears.By the way, a discussion of why women were infertile and how the movie differs from the book can be found at the IMDb.",7,3,8,16 May 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A brutally realistic tale not suitable for all viewers
","Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999). It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award. The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best. I would not however recommend that everybody see this. The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.Morgan Freeman as Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Scrap is addressing somebody. At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say). This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words 'Return to Sender' on them. Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him. I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter. Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman. But the story does not end like a 'Rocky' contrivance. Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people. There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone. It is also Frankie's. And it is Scrap-Iron's as well. If only Frankie had not trained her. If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner. If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie. 'If only,' like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens. Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that. Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma. Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion. Yet he feels he must do it.How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not. His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.I quit watching boxing on TV many ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless. I don't like feeling like that. This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.Some people might be wondering what the message here is. I'm not sure, but I can tell you this: Shakespeare essentially said there is no message. Life is tale told by an idiot...in the end signifying nothing. And the existentialists will tell you that life has no meaning except for that which we ourselves bestow upon it. I guess Scrap is the existentialist and Frankie the Shakespearean.And who is Maggie? And who is everywoman and everyman?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Garden State," Quirky love story with panache
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This is a triumph for Zach Braff who directed, wrote, and also stars as Andrew Largeman who finds that love beats the holy heck out of lithium and assorted drugs bizarrely prescribed by his unfeeling father who just happens to be a shrink. Ladies and gentleman never let your father be your shrink.I was quite taken with Natalie Portman who plays Sam who turns out to be Large's true love, and such a kinky, quirky, beautiful true love she is. Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked. She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different. She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power. Nice performance.The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic. He deals with a childhood tragedy and acquired guilt, meets his old buds, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who is a full time slacker and part time dreamer and consummate doper. Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world. I knew a girl like that, only she only knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her. Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker. More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist. And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track. Oh, and Elizabeth Shue classmate of Braff's in high school.See this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received.",9,0,1,5 June 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Lacks somewhat in focus and tension, but still worthwhile
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I won't join the chorus of accolades for George Clooney for his direction of this movie, but I will give him credit for making it. The way the press has been pushed around (and especially let itself be pushed around) during the George W. Bush years is a disgrace, and it is good that Clooney is here to remind us of a journalist who had the guts to go after a power-hungry demagog whose agenda included finding traitors among those who disagreed with him. Sound familiar? So, just as Arthur Miller's celebrated play The Crucible was timely in that it symbolically chastised those who would conduct witch hunts in the name of patriotism, Clooney's film is timely in that it reminds the Fourth Estate of its responsibility, a responsibility sorely neglected in the buildup to the war in Iraq.As far as the film itself goes, a black and white fusion of documentary footage and an acted-out story line, it was good, but not great. David Strathairn, playing Edward R. Murrow, certainly had Murrow's voice, cadences and mannerisms down pat. However, because there would be a viewer's eye conflict with the actor's appearance and the way the real Edward R. Murrow looked, we were unfortunately not shown footage of Murrow himself. Which is a shame. Even though I was a child at the time, seeing Murrow's dark, penetrating presence on the old Muntz TV was indelible. He had a way of talking straight to the viewer and doing so in a manner that was clear, fair and to the point. Strathairn does a good job of reenacting that presence.And it was good to see some footage of the demagoging junior Republican senator from Minnesota, Joseph McCarthy, in all his drunken, bullying vainglory. And I was fascinated to see President Eisenhower giving a spirited speech. Indeed the film managed to atmospherically recall the era of the early fifties when TV was all in black and white and everybody smoked to excess, especially Murrow. (But softening accusations of receiving Big Tobacco money, Clooney was wise to include an old TV commercial for Kent cigarettes in which the hyping of their new 'safe' filters sounds cruelly ironic today.) Frank Langella was excellent as Murrow's careful, yet supportive boss, media legend William Paley. And Clooney himself played a nicely understated Fred Friendly. I have to say however that the film lacked a certain tension and that the focus was not as clearly defined as it might have been. A film without much tension and with a fuzzy focus can be boring (as some viewers have had the temerity to point out). Yet would it have been better to have simplified the issues for the sake of an easier understanding and accessibility for the average viewer? I don't know, but if I had been Clooney I would have more directly tied the issue of the responsibility and independence of a free press (the central issue in the film) in with what is happening today and what has happened in recent years.Almost stopping the show by herself was jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves singing some of the standards of the era, including 'How High the Moon,' 'One for My Baby,' etc., and the very catchy and ironic, 'TV is the Thing This Year.' Her easy but intense concentration, her beautiful voice, and her exquisite timing were for me one of the highlights of the movie.Bottom line: After seeing this on a return flight from Hawaii I can now say that not EVERY film that I have seen on an airline has been unwatchable. However flawed, Good Night, and Good Luck is definitely worth the time and effort, especially for those who care about the history of broadcast journalism and governmental attempts to control the media.",8,3,5,9 February 2006
The Insider," Al Pacino is the real John Wayne...
","Or the Ronnie Reagan of the left. I mean this in both the positive sense that he is a cultural hero, and in the negative sense that he is a celluloid hero. I have seen so many Al Pacino movies that I feel not only that I know him, but that he is actually a character from my own life. I like him here as Lowell Bergman, a radical ex-Ramparts Magazine editor grown into middle age but still fighting the good fight from within the establishment of CBS and 60 Minutes. His hair still flies about, showing that he is a free soul who cares more about substance than appearance. (We realize that the dye job is a necessary concession to the media world in which he lives.) And the passion still burns bright in his dark eyes, and he's still as wiry as a teenager.But is this history? Is this the truth about what happened with Jeffrey Wigand, big tobacco and CBS? Or this 'revisionist history' dressed up dramatically to make the good guys look good and the bad guys look bad? I wish I could say this is how big time journalism really works, and that we have been afforded a true view inside the system. But it's hard to tell where the truth leaves off and dramatic license takes over. We learned in journalism long ago that there is no real objectivity; that all is to some extent interpretive. In fact I recall a college text we used in the sixties with the (then) arresting title, 'Interpretive Journalism.' Today's text might be called 'Subjective Journalism' and tomorrow's 'The Age of Tabloid Journalism.'Nonetheless, this is a very good movie. The script by Michael Mann and Eric Roth sparkles with the immediacy of today's headlines, and Mann's direction is clean, crisp and dramatically very sharp. Russell Crowe as Wigand, the biochemist who blew the whistle on big tobacco and lost his wife and children to divorce in the process, is excellent. His subtle and restrained interpretation of Wigand reminds me so much of those guys from my generation who opted for the security of the corporate structure, only in his case the misgivings got to him. Diane Venova is chilling in a small role as his wife, a house and home centered woman who leaves him because she doesn't think it's fair to subject her and the children to the dangers and financial uncertainties of his whistle-blowing activities. Wigand is the reluctant hero and she is the woman who did not stand by her man.Christopher Plummer does a good job of playing 60 Minutes's Mike Wallace, who gets plenty of egg on his face here. He looks pathetic in the scene where he talks about what he will be remembered for. I'm sure Wallace is mad as hell about the portrayal, but I don't think anybody is going to sue the producers of this movie, since it is so popular and so much in tune with what most of us believe to be true. Gina Gershon appears briefly as a greedy bottom line lawyer who cares nothing about journalism or the ethics of journalism.John Wayne fought the enemies of our culture on celluloid with true grit and an unwavering, if sometimes moronic, sense of what's right. Al Pacino does the same here, except our enemies have changed and what's right isn't so clear anymore and the war room has become the board room. The really melancholy thing is I guess I wanted to believe in John Wayne when I was a kid, and now as a middle aged man, I want to believe in Al Pacino and 60 Minutes. This movie helps.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon!)",8,0,1,24 June 2000
Into the Wild," Call everything by its proper name
","But don't make a mistake.The theme of this emotionally wrenching drama (script and direction from Sean Penn, from a best-selling nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer) is not man versus wild, as it was in the works of one of the protagonist's heroes, Jack London. Instead the conflict is between man and society. Chris McCandless has just graduated from college. His parents are proud. His grades are good enough for a top grad school. He's bright, personable. It seems he has everything going for him.But he's bitter and disappointed. He disrespects his parents and believes that the last thing he wants to do is act out their idea of success. So he gives the $24,000 he has in the bank for grad school to charity and just ups and leaves home. He has some Kerouac-like adventures on the road where as a 'leather tramp' he meets some ordinary people, some good people, some retro hippies, some Middle American farm workers, some derelicts and a social worker in L.A., a pretty girl, an old man, etc., and then, believing 'you don't need human relationships to be happy,' it's north to Alaska to live out a dream that might have been dreamt by Thoreau or Jack London.But we know from the very beginning of the film that Chris McCandless AKA 'Alexander Supertramp' will die in the Alaskan wilderness at a tender age in 1992. Was his death the result of stupidity regarding the dangers of going 'into the wild' or was it a result of bad luck or accident? Or was it the indirect result of the hypocritical and mercantile values of his parents and his society to which he overreacted? Or even, was it the indirect result of a kind of youthful bravado that could overtake many a young man? What Chris does is what a renunciant in an Eastern religion might do: he leaves society to live alone in the woods. He renounces society's shallow values and lives as simply as possible. But Chris is not practicing an Eastern religion. He is not an old man near the end of his life looking for moksha. He is under the influence of Thoreau and Jack London, whose books he has read and loved. He wants to test himself against the wild without help from anyone. He wants to prove his manhood to himself without the help of society or society's culture But he is a greenhorn in the Alaskan wilderness whose fate is sealed.The way that Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn have reconstructed this story (partly from notes and even from some carvings that Chris made, and partly from interviews with people who knew Chris) we see that at one point after some weeks in the wilderness Chris suddenly realizes something profound and moving. He says, referring to the great beauty of life and the world that he is able to see: 'Happiness is only real when it's shared..' At that point he has learned what he needed to learn from the wilderness and from the people he met in his trek across the country.The great tragedy of this movie is what then befalls Chris.The ending is emotionally gut-retching and yet somehow cathartic. To watch such a likable, honest and spiritually advanced young man with such potential seem to throw it all away, carelessly, foolishly, or accidentally, is a human tragedy brilliantly brought to the printed page and to the screen for all of us to share. And in this sharing Chris's life gains new meaning and he becomes a guide and a teacher for all of us.I know it must have been very difficult for his parents to cooperate in the telling of Chris's story since the story does not show them in a favorable light. Yet the very fact that they helped bring Chris's story to us shows perhaps where Chris got his moral courage. I have no doubt that it was their deep love for their son that moved them to find that emotional courage. This movie gives meaning to Chris's life and shows their love for him, and allows a wide audience to see that he did not die in vain.I want to congratulate not only Krakauer and Penn but also Emile Hirsch who played the part of Chris McCandless. The role was enormously demanding, the sort of role that an actor may only get once in a lifetime, if he's lucky. And Hirsch played it well. He was charming and witty and very strong of character. What a splendid tribute to the real Chris. And kudos to Hal Holbrook who played Ron Krantz to an emotional tee, deeply sympathetic to both his character and to Chris's, and to the significance of the film itself.And the rest of the cast was also very good, although Kristen Stewart was a little too pretty for the part of the 16-year-old trailer troubadour, and of course William Hurt could have used a larger role.The lesson of this story, it seems to me is this: Young people of courage and honor, even though they may make mistakes, even though they may be mistaken at a fundamental level, can, through their valor, teach us all something important. As Chris told Ron Krantz, 'Get off your butt, old man. The core of a man's spirit comes from new experiences.' What he is also saying is: live every moment in a genuine way. And we can see that is what Chris did. A life so lived, although short, may well be the equal of a much longer life lived not so authentically.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

"Girl, Interrupted"," Heroic and redemptive
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I tend to the sentimental, so the fact that I cried through most of the last twenty minutes of this touching and redemptive story of lost little women in the booby hatch doesn't mean much. This really isn't a tear-jerker as such, it's just that the material and the way it is handled made me feel such affection for those girls struggling so hard to be whole. Set in New England in the sixties with Vietnam in the background and free love in the streets, this is a fine film with an excellent cast that tells an original story without mawkish sentimentality or any pandering to the politically correct. The psychotherapeutic industry is not indicted, nor is society held over the coals. Everything is individual and the faults and failures are individual faults and failures, and the ultimate redemption or lack there of is also individual.Winona Ryder gives a striking performance as 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, writer to be who finds herself in a mental institution after a suicide attempt. Ryder, who has the expressive face of a silent film star, proves beyond any doubt that she is a gifted and tremendously hard working actress.Trickster Angelina Jolie is fascinating in her academy-award winning supporting role as a kind of femme bad boy. Whoopi Goldberg as a Nurse Ratched with a heart, anchors the film and brings strength and rationality to the lives of the girls. Vanessa Redgrave, elegant and wise as Dr. Wick, a shrink with compassion and intelligence, serves as a counterbalance to Jeffrey Tambor's incompetent Dr. Potts.Some have compared this to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but this is an entirely different kind of movie. It has neither the range nor the outrageous humor of that great film. Director James Mangold, whose much admired Heavy (1995) showed what he can do, wisely attempts less here as he concentrates on the personal journey Susanna Kaysen takes to the brink of institutionalized insanity and back. He emphasizes how people can bond and show affection under dysfunctional circumstances, and how we can triumph over the darker aspects of our nature. In the final analysis, this is a heroic film and a tribute to those who rise above the demons in their souls.",9,0,0,14 June 2000
The Graduate," Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
","This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting. Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor. The maternal manner with which she treats virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990). Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature. The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy. Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb. Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score. What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence.' Of course Paul Simon wrote the song 'Mrs. Robinson' for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his 'It's all happening at the zoo' was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel. I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, 'Isn't this a half-baked idea?' In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, 'No, sir. It's completely baked.'Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house. He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning. One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the cliché-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way. This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no aficionado would want to miss.But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," But now I really do have spots in my mind
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I'm sure watching this a few times will have the effect of erasing any confusion you might have. I am sure. But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film. Yet, yet... There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role. Sorta straight. Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines. I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie. She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week. Yeah, I remember her. My god she was nice. Quirky, but nice.And then she erased all memory of me. I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me. Didn't know me! Wow, after all we had been through. I mean she's an emotional roller coaster. And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased. And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right. I met her on the beach. But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forward, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned. Mary, her name is. She and the doc had this fling. He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again. Really bummed his wife out.Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control. She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people. All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan. There's something going on here with these memory movies. I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it. Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories? Would life be worth living? If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals? Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life. But is it possible to selectively erase memories? I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose? Is that legal? It is safe? Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999). Need I say more? I mean clever with a capital K. By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski. Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted? No, that was Kaczynski. Okay, never mind. Anyway, here's a clever line: 'Are we like couples you see in restaurants? Are we the dining dead?' I think I said that, or wish I had. Or, 'Drink up young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.' She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory. Thank you.Bottom line: bizarro and entertaining, witty and cute, with a nice cast. And Jim Carrey as a straight up kinda guy is a terrific actor, and Kate, well I'll tell you a secret, gentlemen. You can see a full frontal sans clothes shot of her in the movie Jude (1996). Yes. Also worth watching is her debut film Heavenly Creatures (1994) shot when she was 18.One last line, as Joel says, 'Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.'",7,0,2,19 February 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," Oldie moldy cult classic
","This is...not as funny as it once was, unfortunately. And frankly, considering all that has come to past in rock and roll, it seems a little tame, even a little on the lame side. Or perhaps I have grown too jaded. Since Rob Reiner dreamed up this 'pseudo-rockumentary' (after affixing some gold paint strategically on the USS Coral Seas baseball cap he wears--one of the many sight gags in the movie) the satirical assault on rock culture as been done and done again, perhaps a time or two too many.The music itself is, shall we say, derivative with the Stones, some early Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and others having some distant unavoidable influence, while the unwashed antics of the stars both on stage and off have become clichés of the biz. Worse yet, satirizing the documentary mode itself has been done to death.Alas, can we have back those moments of splendor in the grass (Wordsworth) or when we first leaned back in the movie theater, the smell of rancid popcorn butter in our nose, and sticky soda corn syrup on the soles of our shoes, and got blasted away by Spinal Tap? No, Virginia, you can't go home again, sad to say.Might as well jump (Van Halen, 1984).(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Life Is Beautiful," Remember the Theater of the Absurd?
","Roberto Benigni's celebrated affirmation of the human spirit owes a little to 'Rhinoceros,' Ionesco's absurdist play from the Sixties. There's the same attempt to reduce the worse horror in human history to the absurd. Perhaps this is a way of comprehending something monstrous beyond comprehension. Benigni was criticized in some circles for trivializing the Holocaust, but that is not what he did. He sought to rise above it. I don't know whether he or Ionesco were really successful. On the other hand has anybody--any religion, philosophy or great artist--ever solved the problem of evil in this world?There's something of Charlie Chaplin in Benigni's irrepressible hero, and in the camera work look for the influence of Orson Wells in light and shadow. The strange splashes of color on such places as the concentration camps walls reminded me curiously of Jacque Demy's 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg,' a wondrous French operetta from the Sixties (starring Catherine Deneuve, music by Michel Legrand).The movie drags a little at times and we miss a lot of Benigni's mugging as our eyes chase after the subtitles, but the central idea, that with our attitudes we create the world, and that life can be beautiful even in the midst of tragedy, is uplifting, if hard to believe.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Reservoir Dogs," The delineation of violence
","Future historians may well look back at the cinema of the nineties in the United States and wonder why it spawned so many movies that seemed to celebrate gratuitous violence while catering to an audience fascinated with gore. (I have some ideas on this, but I'll skip them here.) Some may say this is nothing new, that there has always been gore in the movies, that the horror flick is a standard genre, and that, at any rate, human beings are quite naturally interested in violence because even if it is rare in their suburban experience, when it does occur it is of overriding significance.When historians do look back they will surely take a gander at this film, director Quentin Tarantino's celebrated breakout cult classic. Anyone reading this has already seen the movie or certainly knows about its content. It contains one of the most unredeeming scenes of sadistic violence ever to strike the silver screen. It depicts a world in which men stick their guns out at each other the way little boys play.... It is a world in which women exist only on the periphery (like an old war movie there are virtually no women in the film), a world in which men are constantly preoccupied with macho notions and the phenomena of male bonding to the exclusion of anything else. The behavior of the men while superficially realistic is actually stylized in the extreme. Anything and everything may set a man off. His ego is under continual fire, his manhood is constantly being tested. Life is short, brutal and bestial.Question: where did this vision come from, and why did it resonate so strongly with an audience, and what is that audience? It can be said that Reservoir Dogs appeals primarily to young men and teenaged boys, who are preoccupied with coming to grips with violence because it represents an important part of their lives, and how they might relate to violence is an essential part of their self discovery. This is true, but it is not the whole story. After all, as I write this, Reservoir Dogs is the 58th most popular movie of all time according to votes tabulated at the International Movie Database web site, IMDb.com. Even given that there is still a male bias on the web, this is an extraordinarily high rating for the first film of any director and for such a low budget enterprise.Part of the explanation for the near reverence shown this film lies not in the blood-letting and the macho posturing, but in a story well told, well-plotted and of characters well-drawn and especially the indelible acting performances from most of the cast. Harvey Kietel as a hardened criminal with a soft heart, and Steve Buscemi as the amoral Mr. Pink, and Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde and Chris Penn as the slightly soft and slightly spoiled son of a criminal father and Tim Roth as the high wire acting Mr. Orange, really rivet us to the screen. The professional cadre of criminals depicted here, the cheap thugs and psychopathic killers, are well realized and their life styles and preoccupations well delineated. Tarantino begins with a scene in which the boys around some tables in a cafe 'analyze' Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' in manner that might be described as Oxford don crude. They continually espouse the racist, sexist macho values of the criminal underclass, in which loyalty to the band and bravery under fire are the highest values, while cowardice and 'turning rat' are the lowest. Furthermore the script is punctuated with sick little jokes (e.g., about the imagined nature of black women), and wryly obscene juxtapositions, notably the macabre dance of Mr. Blonde to the radio playing 'Stuck in the Middle with You' as he tortures the cop. Finally there is the structure of the film itself in which time is splintered and events are recalled and presented not chronologically, but according to the logic of the film itself. This technique allows Tarantino great freedom of expression and emphasis.Okay, so why am I only giving this three stars? Mainly because, while the treatment was striking and original, the story and the milieu presented were not. And some of this was unrealistic to the point of annoyance. That Mr. Orange did not bleed to death or at least go into shock and faint dead away with a gaping hole in his stomach is beyond me. And the 'neat' karmic ending was more than a little far fetched. And all those stylized speeches!You'd think part of this was written for the Shakespearean stage. Indeed, although Tarantino may not realize it, he owes something to the Bard. Didn't Hamlet end much the same way with dead bodies all over the stage? Additionally, while Tarantino's vision appeals strongly to his targeted audience (and his own psyche), it does not relate well with a larger audience. The last thing a man of my age is concerned about is how macho he might be. Such concerns seem childish. And the nature and phenomenon of human violence is very far from a mystery to me; furthermore I know very well exactly how I feel about violence and how I might react in the face of it. I think if I had seen this movie when I was seventeen, I might have been stunned and thrilled with its power. Seeing it in my middle years leaves me a little cold.Incidentally I agree with those who say that this is a greater artistic achievement than the 'Hollywoodized' Pulp Fiction (1995), also directed by Tarantino.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Eyes Wide Shut," Marriage is always under siege
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviews to expect. It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme. Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology. The theme can be stated simply: 'marriage is a fortress continually under siege.' To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally are actually married to one another, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme. We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might be like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature, and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice. They go to a party and act out some 'teasing themselves' roles, as they have undoubtedly done before. Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people. But the next night stoned on marijuana Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform. Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place. As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc. What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him. This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons. One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple. Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some. Three, many young couples viewing the film together or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations. To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for. Most people lie to themselves about sex and their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time. Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are. Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it. Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now? And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out) 'Be Grateful,' one day does not make an entire lifetime.What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm. Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want. Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature. Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent. As always she becomes the character she is playing. Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing. The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class. The sometimes annoying score is appropriate. But this is not a great movie. Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times. I would rank it with the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.For those interested in an academic discussion of the theme (and possibly where Kubrick got some of his ideas) I recommend the following books on human sexuality from the point of view of evolutionary psychology:Baker, Robin. Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex (1996)Diamond, Jared. Why is Sex Fun? The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1997)Margulis, Lynn and Dorion Sagan. Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human Sexuality (1991). Ridley, Matt. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (1993)Russell, Robert Jay. The Lemur's Legacy: The Evolution of Power, Sex, and Love.(1993)I especially liked the latter two. No longer does a man have to ask, 'What does a woman want?' It's pretty clear and understandable. (She wants to have her cake and eat it too.) And of course we always knew what a man wanted.",9,0,1,12 March 2000
Pretty Woman," New spin on an old theme
","Pretty Woman is a popular and very familiar movie meant for a popular audience, the main attraction being the charisma of its two box-office buffos, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.I always feel a certain sense of interest when anticipating a Richard Gere film. I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature. In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona. Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner. Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at. It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties. She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat. She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs... She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances. I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature. (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.) In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses. In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind. She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans. In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained! In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience. She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring: she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.Will her role in Pretty Woman help? Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood. And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role. Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)). Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it. Most American prostitutes are drug addicts. That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy: poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc. In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way. The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work? Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about? I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong. But see it and judge for yourself. Despite the cliché situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Pulp Fiction," We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys
","Well, it rocks, I guess. It jumps. It moves. It's flashy and clever. The acting is excellent. The direction is interesting... I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power. How much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy. John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a 'low-rent' hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right! How come they never did that before: they probably did, I just missed it.). Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood. We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a cliché. The art part comes from doing spins on the cliché, in putting a new twist on the old bull****, on the old standards. Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman. He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. Poor Hollywood. They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Titanic," Grandiose schmaltz skillfully presented
","This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe. Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject). Still the photography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever. This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well. And it succeeds. Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune. Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own. Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy. His romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom. Evil, decadent rich people. Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.) Cliché followed cliché.But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life. It was strange to see her in the early scenes. She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her. But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, 'We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world.' And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: 'He won't amount to a thing. Trust me.' And 'Freud, who is he?Is he a passenger?'My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe. Duh. In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand. Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent. Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset.All right. Why did the Academy vote this best picture? Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves. I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue. Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Three Colors: Blue," See it with a fine arts major
","She is the wife of a great composer, and the music plays in her head because she is really the composer herself. After her husband and daughter are killed in a traffic accident, she tries to kill herself because the music is too beautiful and the memory of it too painful, but she can't swallow the pills. Then she tries to renounce the world but finds that she still cares.She is still of flesh. She says she wants no belongings and no memories, 'No friends, no love. Those are all traps.'This is a beautiful film, perhaps too precious for some, understated and overdone by turns with artsy shots on common objects and blurred views filtered through liquid colors, especially of course the color blue. Sometimes the movie was so quiet for so long I became aware of the faint whine of the VCR.Juliette Binoche, lately seen as the nurse in 'The English Patient,' dominates the screen with her affecting countenance. The camera continually explores and re-explores her face-an interesting, almost androgynous face, kind and gentle, unassuming with a sweet undercurrent of power.I liked this better than the overly clever 'White' that followed, also directed by the talented Krzysztof Kieslowski.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Mystic River," Outstanding
","Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic. Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...All too human.He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring. Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor. Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police. He also does a great job. His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal. Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.The story itself is riveting. Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric. The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing. This movie is that good. It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.A couple of other things set this film apart. One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in. Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter. Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why. And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers. The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

A Beautiful Mind," Excellent Hollywood-ized version of the man and his madness
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, 'A Brilliant Madness' (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more 'real' than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it 'pizza pie.' There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and to his accomplishments.",9,0,1,7 May 2006
Downfall," Fascinating and uncompromising look at the final days
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part. The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his 'love' for the German people. In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable. Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.Alexandria Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture. She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been. Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted. The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger. Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on. But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well. Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.Of course she was hardly the only one. An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation, near-starvation, and ignominious defeat. One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality. Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be. Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen. There might be something to that, but I doubt it. Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin. I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty. This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal. And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal. Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves. They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort. We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another. The stench is overwhelming. We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.Can it happen again? Can it happen here? Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty. It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.(I said I would write this review without mentioning a certain personage, and I did, but the allusions are probably more than obvious.) See this for veteran Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz who gave a fine performance as Hitler.",9,7,10,8 July 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Doesn't live up to the hype
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)How stupid is this? Well, pretty stupid. Consider the scene where the News at Five teams from the various local stations (in San Diego) square off, gladiator style complete with tridents, swords and axes. Or how about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) reading everything put on the teleprompter--'You put it there, he'll read it' including the 'f' word. Or the musical score in the background, a selection of the most sappy seventies tunes including (God help us) 'Skyrockets in flight/Afternoon delight.' I watched this on a United Airlines flight and took a read on the other passengers. The guy in the window seat was in and out of sleep most of the time, and there weren't many of the other passengers laughing, at least not aloud. However I have to say almost everybody put on their headsets and watched. I attribute that to the mass bucks the producers spent on advertising. I just had to check it out.And it WAS kind of fascinating to see a film done this way, so much so that even if you don't laugh, you might be glued to the tube anyway. The satirical idea is to lampoon TV news anchors as empty-headed, surface kind of people who wouldn't know a differential equation from their hair spray. Ferrell is perfectly shallow and vain and arrogant--and that is right on target. However he proves the counterpoint to the movie's premise by actually being Quite a Guy, especially in the scene at the bar restaurant when he gets up to play the flute. He plays one mean flute, I gotta tell you.Ferrell gets support from Christine Applegate as Veronica Corningstone who wants to become the anchorperson herself. Most comedy fans will remember Applegate as the ditsy and voluptuous Kelly from TV's 'Married with Children' where she started out when she was something like 14-years-old. However, you might not recognize her at first glance since (1) she is trimmer, although she still has a bodacious figure; and (2) she's had the pre-mature wrinkles under her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different.Although this is a burlesque of the 'reality' at your local news station, some of it is strangely real. For example, the lead story constantly being the latest update on the panda bears at the San Diego Zoo and the media frenzy surrounding them is pretty much true. Also real was the fanatical insistence by the TV producers (as a means to higher ratings) to feature human interest and crime stories as entertainment for couch potatoes.One of the funniest bits in the movie is near the beginning when Ron Burgundy tries out his unique pick-up style on Veronica by telling her that she has one very fine rear engine...or words to that effect, and she comes back with something like, 'You sure know how to flatter a girl,' the sarcasm as heavy as molasses in January at the North Pole.See this for Will Ferrell, whose over-the-top performance fascinates even when he isn't funny, and just kind of zone out on the dead parts that don't quite make it.",3,1,3,19 December 2004
The Reader," Exquisitely done, deep and emotionally draining
","BEWARE OF SPOILERS.There is a certain segment of the German mentality that is Hanna Schmidt. English Kate Winslet captures the intent of novelist Bernhard Schlink in her interpretation of the character. Hanna was an ordinary but proud woman of discipline who always did her duty, a woman without the ability to separate herself from what she knew was right and what was wrong, but a woman who was able to hide from herself what she did that was wrong.She seduces fifteen-year-old Michael Berg. She finds him doubly useful as a reader of great literature. She knows it will not work. Of course how could it? She indulges herself but, being strong and proud, is able to divorce herself from him emotionally when the time comes, as it must. When he reads D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to her, she is genuinely offended at the open sexuality, but we viewers are taken back since what she is doing with 15-year-old Michael Berg is on the screen and naked before our eyes.In a sense this is the somewhat familiar story of the young man of station and potential had briefly in his youth by the older woman who has neither station nor potential. They take advantage of one another for the time being, both knowing that they will move on. But young Michael is not fully aware of this old story because his station in life is, although above hers, still rather modest, and being fifteen and knowing a woman for the first time, he is in love as much as--or even more than--a fifteen-year-old can be.She is short with him and selfish because she knows she will be tossed aside and so instinctively knows she needs to get something now. She calls him 'kid' and consumes him, as would be the case in such a relationship. Yet there is his 'reading.' He has a talent for it and he enjoys reading to her. At one point she instructs him, reading first and then making love.What is love? Hanna Schmidt does not know. And so her character is triply flawed. She has low self-esteem, hiding her illiteracy from all. She is removed from her feelings because of the past. That is how she has coped. What she has done she knows on one level was something horrendous; but on another level she only took the job at Siemens. What else was she to do? She was a guard. She had to guard the prisoners, otherwise there would be chaos. This is her defense. This is her belief. And finally, she cares for young Michael as she cares for herself, as one might care for valuable livestock, but she neither loves him nor herself. For again 'What is love,' as Tina Turner once had it, 'but a second-hand emotion'? At the end we see her, an old woman in prison being visited by the adult Michael Berg. She has put out her hand to him, and he, being human, has touched it. But he has withdrawn his hand. And now they stand and she leans, ever so slightly toward him to be hugged perhaps, to be touched for perhaps the first time in decades. But he does not respond. He cannot.This echoes back to an earlier scene when he, as a young law student suddenly finds himself observing her trial. He realizes that she is taking the blame for the deaths of the Jewish 'prisoners' because she would rather do that then reveal that she cannot read or write. It is interesting that young Berg realizes the truth of why she liked to be read to only then. And so he thinks to save her by letting the court know that she could not have written the order that condemned the prisoners to death. And so he makes an appointment to go to the prison and see her. But as she waits for her unknown visitor to arrive, he suddenly turns away. What he realizes, one speculates, is that there is nothing he can say to her or to the court that will change anything. Whether she wrote the actual order or not really doesn't matter. The others get off with lighter sentences, but all of them are equally guilty of whatever it was that was that allowed the German psyche to allow the holocaust. And too Berg is not clear about how he feels. Here is a woman he once loved who now is revealed as a monster. Yes, she is a monster, but strange to say almost an innocent monster.It is curious that Berg so deeply loved her that he acquires her trait of emotional distance. He learns he can only sleep alone. His marriage fails. He is not as close to his daughter as he would like. And finally he is not able to help Hanna when she is alone in prison. He cannot bring himself to respond to her letters. And yet he reads to her. Hour after hour after hour he reads the classics into a microphone and sends the tapes to her to listen to in prison.I wonder how this was received in Germany. There is such a guilt that hangs over the generations after the war. I wonder what they think of the humanization of a certain familiar mentality. And I must add that this mentality that follows orders and does its duty to the exclusive of its humanity is not something special with the Germans of that era. It is a human trait that is expressive of a human type that can be found in any society.This is a deeply moving film, exquisitely written and directed and wondrously acted, especially by Kate Winslet.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Stalag 17," Quasi-realism and burlesque: a comedic drama
","There was surprisingly enough a lot of humor in the American attitude toward the Nazis and the Germans during World War II. Life goes on even under the conditions of being prisoners of war, and people need to laugh. In such circumstances, they especially need to laugh. We can see that in some of the songs from that time and in this play from Donald Bevant and Edmund Trzcinski that Billy Wilder made into an unusually good movie. It should be realized that the full extent of the horror that the Nazis had visited upon Europe was not known until after the war was over and we saw the films of the concentration camps.William Holden stars as Sgt J.J. Sefton whose amoral cynicism and gift for the cheap hustle allow him to feather his nest even while a prisoner of war.He's the guy who always had a storehouse of cigarettes, booze, silk stockings, candy, etc. under his bunk, the guy who always won at cards, whose proposition bets always gave him the edge. We had a guy like that when I was in the army. We called him 'Slick.'But William Holden's Sefton is more than Slick. He is outrageously cynical and uncommonly brave. He takes chances because he doesn't have the same kind of fear that others have. Most people would feel self-conscious (and nervous) eating a fried egg while everybody else in the barracks had watery-thin potato soup. Others might feel uncomfortable with bribing German guards for bottles of Riesling or tins of sardines. Not Sefton. He flaunts his store of goodies.Perhaps that is overdone. Perhaps the real hardships that prisoners went through are glossed over in this comedic drama--a comedy, incidentally, that plays very much like a Broadway musical without the music. Perhaps it is the case that from the distance of 1953 the deprivations of Stalag 17 have faded from memory and it is the 'good times' that are recalled.At any rate, I think it is this kind of psychology that accounts for the success of this unusual blend of quasi-realism and burlesque. Certainly Stalag 17 has been widely imitated, most familiarly in the TV sit-com 'Hogan's Heroes' and to some extent on Rowan and Martin's 'Laugh-In.' Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful, on the other hand, which also finds humor in the horrific, is of a different genre. Like Ionesco's Rhinoceros, Benigni's movie is from the theater of the absurd, not the Broadway stage.Holden won an Oscar for his performance and Robert Strauss who played Animal was nominated in a supporting role. Otto Preminger, the legendary director and producer, was excellent as the two-faced Col Von Scherbach, the ex-calvary commander and camp commandant who can only take a phone call from the high command with his boots on so he can click his heels. I also liked Sig Rumann as Sgt Johann Sebastian Schulz ('always making with the jokes, you Americans') whose previous career as a wrestler in the US accounts for his English-language skills. Gil Stratton, who for years did the sports for CBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, is interesting as Sefton's sidekick and funky.Indeed, what is responsible for the success of this movie as much as anything is this fine cast playing well-defined character roles. By the way, Strauss and Harvey Lembeck ('Sugar Lips' Shapiro) were reprising their roles from Broadway.Important is the fine plot line in which Sefton is accused of being a spy for the Nazis while the real spy is exposed step by step. At first we don't know who it is, and then we do, and then the prisoners find out. This should be compared with Sunset Boulevard (1950). While very different movies they have similar elements which reveal part of the psyche and methods of director Billy Wilder. First there is the anti-hero as the protagonist, in both cases played by William Holden. Then there is a lot of the old Hollywood crowd appearing in both films including directors appearing as actors, Erich von Stroheim (not to mention Cecil B. DeMille in his memorable cameo as himself) in Sunset Boulevard, and Otto Preminger here. Sig Rumann has over a 100 credits going back to at least the early thirties. Finally there is the discordant mix of comedic and dramatic elements, a mix that works on our psyches because life is to some very real extent filled with tragedy in close congruence with the laughable.But see this for William Holden who was the kind of actor who was best playing a compromised character as here and as the failed writer/reluctant gigolo in Sunset Boulevard, an actor who drank too much and tended to undistinguished, but when carefully directed could rise above his intentions and give a sterling performance.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

The Shawshank Redemption," Great story, wondrously told and acted
","At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the 'only' guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words 'His judgment cometh and that right soon.' The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.' Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the 'sisters,' etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the 'redemption' is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon!)",8,91,139,20 May 2004
Platoon," How a nation lost its innocence
","In one sense this can be seen as Oliver Stone's attempt to account for the massacre at My Lai for which Lt. William Calley was famously court-martialed. One recalls a statement made at the time by somebody in close concert with the logic of the Vietnam War: 'We had to destroy the village in order to save it.' But more inclusively, Oliver Stone's film addresses the question of what war does to us as it focuses on Pvt. Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, who gave up his student deferment, joined the army and volunteered to fight in Vietnam as his patriotic duty. How the twisted logic of war changes him and corrupts him and others in his platoon is the story of the film.To Oliver Stone's credit it can be said that this movie, first released in 1989, helped to shock a new generation of Americans into understanding just why our involvement in Vietnam was a tragic mistake and to warn us not to do anything like that again. The fact that recent military adventures by the US have been limited engagements with limited objectives (instead of the vague and unrestricted policy of stopping the spread of communism, which was the rationale for the war in Vietnam)--engagements that have been carefully orchestrated to avoid becoming mired in the kind of hand-to-hand combat favoring the side defending its own turf as shown in this film, owes something to Stone's vision and to that of other film makers. One also recalls Senator Barry Goldwater R, Arizona) who advocated 'winning' the war in Vietnam by 'bombing them back into the Stone Age.' Stone's film suggests just how impossible that would have been.Tom Berenger gives a splendid and somewhat horrific performance as Sgt. Barnes, the 'War Lover' (the phrase is the title of John Hersey's WWII novel), who kills both friend and foe indiscriminately. Willem DaFoe plays his opposite, Sgt. Elias who is the model of the good soldier. The rest of the cast gives fine support while the script by Stone, partially from personal experience, is full of authentic dialogue and veracious detail. The clash between our civilized nature and our baser instincts is well presented.It is impossible to fairly compare this to other excellent Vietnam War movies such as The Deer Hunter (1978), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Apocalypse Now (1979), et al., because they are all so different. I do believe that Platoon was more of a throwback to World War II movies in the sense that it focused on the dynamics of the soldiers immersed in actual battles with the enemy. Yet on the other hand it falls completely within the Vietnam War genre by looking beyond the battles to address the larger question of why, and the war's consequences. In World War II movies, the why was never in doubt, and the consequences were not an issue.The theme of this movie has been expressed as the loss of innocence, and that is a fair assessment; but I think it wasn't so much the soldiers themselves that lost their innocence, although many did, but a nation that lost its. We were a different country before Vietnam. We have never been the same since, and we will never be the same again.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Vanilla Sky," Transcends the original
","Here in Vanilla Sky, a thoughtful reprise of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenabar, we have Tom Cruise, American heart throb and box office buffo paired with his current true love, the amazingly beautiful and very talented Penelope Cruz.Guess what happens. The public doesn't like him. Even though this is a more finely structured and comprehensible film than Open Your Eyes (we'll get to that in moment), Tom Cruise is NOT sympathetic, or at least it takes us until near the end of the film to feel any sympathy for him, and then perhaps what we feel most sympathetic for is the mask that is Tom Cruise in most of the later reels.I think the problem is that Cruise is miscast. Unlike Eduardo Noriega, who played the same part in the film directed by Alejandro Amenabar, Cruise is too cute and too privileged to elicit our sympathy. We almost feel his character has it coming. After all, he willingly got into the car with his 'stalker' (Cameron Diaz) presumably to have a little sexual fun. And this just after spending a Platonic night with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), whom he is now supposed to be in love with. Furthermore--and this may be just a minor point, but a telling one--Cruise's disfigurement was not as gross as was Noriega's. One gets the sense that perhaps Cruise insisted on it being that way.From another angle, one might ask, is this deja vu all over again? Recall that Cruise was married to Nichole Kidman when he played opposite her in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Guess what happened. The public didn't like it. Aside from the fact that they didn't understand it, what they didn't like was Tom Cruise. He was NOT sympathetic. One could not identify with his cruising various kinky sexual opportunities as a privileged married doctor.Having said all that, I still think that this film, directed by the very talented Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and wrote and directed Almost Famous (2000), is the better film. Why? Mainly because Crowe demonstrates a better understanding of the underlining theme of the film than did Amenabar. (Of course he had the benefit of Amenabar's film to improve upon.)What I am getting at is the precarious nature of our brain's experience of reality. On one level, I think that is what the film is really all about. (On another level of course there is a love triangle.) Throw the cryonics mumble jumble out the window and consider that we might, as some people believe, become software. As partial products of our own culture we will (at least in the beginning) experience glitches that will destroy our dreams, just as David Aames's guilty conscience destroyed his lucid dream and made him see a projection of his fear and his guilt instead of seeing his beloved Sofia.If we do become software, there will be imperfect matches between our biological nature and the artificial neural nets we will fuse with. We will not be freezing ourselves in the future. Instead we will merge with our machines as we live and become part human and part artificial intelligence--something beyond human. This is the glimpse of the future that Cameron Crowe extends to us, a possibility that he saw in the Spanish language film not fully worked out by Amenabar.Despite his miscasting, I think Tom Cruise gave a spirited performance, and I think only his celebrity and the compromised personality of the character he plays kept some movie goers from fully appreciating his work.Penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger. Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does. At some point I realized that she reminded me a little of Audrey Hepburn. Perhaps she has been watching some of Miss Hepburn's films. (I would bet on it.) Regardless, she, whom I first saw in Belle Epoque (1992) when she was eighteen, is utterly bewitching.Also giving an excellent performance is Cameron Diaz as the fatally scorned other woman. She brings a sexy, haunting quality to the part that works well with Cruise's software 'experiences.' She is not quite as convincing a stalker as was Najwa Nimri in the original, however, and this may be another reason that this film only gets 7.0 out of 10 stars from the voters at IMDb while Open Your Eyes gets 7.8.Usually I prefer the original to the remake, the European film to the Hollywood production, but in this case I think it is Vanilla Sky that will be remembered. At any rate, look past Tom Cruise's celebrity and see this for Cameron Crowe whose vision of a virtually real future is intriguing and reveals that he did his homework.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Trainspotting," Money is the power god of heroin
","Of course 'Trainspotting' is a disturbing film. It is also gross and disgusting, as though Larry Flynt had gotten his hands on something like 'A Clockwork Orange.' But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue is fortunately more than that; it is original and clever and moves right along. This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB.The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: 'I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell.'Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.I guess something like that is the commercially correct 'message' of this film.Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner sure to be imitated. The sound track, 'available on Capitol Records,' (I rest my case) will sell. Some might say that this is a penetrating critique of modern urban society, but the only thing being penetrated is your pocket book.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Bull Durham," A diamond in the rough
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I thought I read the book, or at least I dreamed it, but this is NOT adapted from something by Larry McMurtry, although it sure seems like it oughta be. It is one hell of a funny, crafty, too real for life, kind of movie. The brilliant script, full of clever one-liners, was written by Ron Shelton (White Men Can't Jump (1992)), who actually played minor league ball in the Orioles farm system. Shelton also directed and did a bang-up job. This is a funny movie that is really funny.What I recalled (when I found out this wasn't from Larry McMurtry) was a baseball novel for juniors that I had read when I was a kid about a crafty, veteran minor league catcher who had once made it to the big leagues but got beaned and never got over it, always bailing out from an inside curve ball. (This was in the days before batting helmets.) He fell back to the minors and went from team to team and town to town, hitting a ton until somebody figured out that his knees would buckle if you brushed him back a bit, and then he'd have to move on. Kevin Costner's part reminds me of that guy (without the beaning phobia). Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a baseball groupie in her sexual prime who likes to read poetry and give the players hitting advice. She is just wonderful as she plays sexy mom to the boys, a new one every summer, just so she can avoid any kind of real relationship or commitment. And so along comes Crash Davis (Kevin Costner, one of the more underrated and less flashy stars of our time), playing an itinerant catcher who has managed to hit nearly 300 minor league home runs. He is tough and savvy and once made it to the Show for 21 days. Tim Robbins plays Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' 'Meat' LaLoosh, a not too bright, wild-armed phenom who needs more than a little guidance. He gets a lot from both Crash and Annie, who are intent on schooling him in their differing expertise. Nuke is just the hunk Annie needs to keep her from falling in love with Crash, but...well, this is a romantic comedy, so you can be sure that love will find a way.The baseball shtick and the interior dialogues of Robbins and Costner during the games ('Why's he want the heat? I wanna throw the deuce...' And, 'Don't think, ... Get that...woman out of your head--Time out!') are really funny, and the bit where Robbins shakes him off and Costner, as an object lesson for his young pitcher, tells the batter what's coming next allowing the batter to hit it out of the park (or onto the Bull Durham sign to win a free steak dinner--is this genuine Americana or what?) are a crack up. But also great are the scenes with Sarandon as she philosophizes ('I believe in the Church of Baseball') and wise-cracks her way through the boys of summer, especially the scene where she ties Nuke up in bed and reads him some Walt Whitman. Now THAT really tires the boy out! Another great scene is on the bus when Crash lets the other players know that he once made it to the bigs where '...you hit white balls for batting practice and the ballparks are like cathedrals.' Beautiful.Best dead-pan one-liner is when Crash catches Nuke in the locker room trying to adjust the panty hose girdle that Annie has talked him into wearing under his uniform: 'The rose goes in the front, big guy.'By the way, the great rock and roll soundtrack includes the galvanizing baseball song, 'Brown-Eyed Handsome Man' by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame. (Or maybe the title's 'In Center Field': 'Put me in coach. I'm ready to play, today, in center field.')It's a shame that Shelton did not win the Oscar for this script, it's really that good. (Ronald Bass won for Rain Man.) The characters are just fascinating and full of life, and not just the three leads. The bit players are funny too, including the hard-talking, middle-brained manager, the mindless pattering coaches, the sweet young groupie girl who makes it with all the players as fast as she can. Even the team clown is good.The irreverent characterizations, the sweet story, the realistic atmosphere of baseball in small town America (only slightly burlesqued), and some fine acting all rolled together make this one highly diverting little film, actually one of the best baseball films ever made. See this with your best babe. She'll like it as much as you.",10,20,33,19 May 2002
Identity," If this were a book it would be psychobabble
","This is really a mess. One wonders how such movies get made. James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians.'The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly. Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated. John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds. The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead. The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc. They insult each other a lot. Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc. As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being 'trillions to one') we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or... You guessed it. It's all a....But I can't say. We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold. (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.) At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it. Otherwise, hit the off button and watch reruns of 'That 70's Show.'(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Lucy," 'I am everywhere'
","The most stunning thing about this movie (aside from Scarlett Johansson) is the deep spiritual meaning that comes near the end. Yes, amid all the mayhem, the shoot 'em ups, the science impossible there is something very redeeming about this and it has to do with what it means to be alive and to be human.What Lucy is able to do cannot possibly come about from taking substances into her system as in the movie. However the incredible power, knowledge and freedom she achieves is something that may be possible for humans some distant day--or rather possible for our intelligently designed descendants who will be cyborgs or something beyond that.The story itself and the way French born director Luc Besson ('LÃ©on: The Professional,' 'La Femme Nikita,' etc.) moves the plot along with action that keeps us enthralled amounts to a first rate sci fi thriller. Johansson who plays Lucy and whose countenance dominates the film is wonderful. And I don't mean merely from the fact that her face is mesmerizing but also because she does such a great acting job in a demanding role.I am giving this film only 9 stars because of the rather lame idea that we use only ten percent of our brains. That idea was disposed of decades ago. Of course as a metaphor it works okay. However it could be better said that we are currently achieving only ten percent of what we could achieve.I also don't think Besson, who also wrote the script for the film, has the right notion about time. He has Lucy say, 'Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist.' However, time like other units of measure really just compares two or more things, in this case events. Many scientists believe that time per se does not exist and is an abstraction, or as I see it time is a mathematical point.But much of the philosophy and/or psychology in the film is if nothing else interesting and worth thinking about. For example Lucy says, 'We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale.' This is true in a practical sense but I believe it is also true in a philosophical and a spiritual sense.I will be seeing this film again.--Dennis Littrell, author of 'The World Is Not as We Think It Is'",9,2,5,9 June 2017
Amélie," Funny, heart-warming and strikingly original
","This is a delightful romantic fantasy of love and comedy, of vivid color and some preposterous antics of love and friendship that will send mawkish tears down your cheeks while making you laugh out loud. If not, turn in your headset for a heart.Audrey Tautou is Amélie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood. She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amélie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her. Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amélie all grown up. She still has no love in her life. But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment. It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile. Amélie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago. In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box. But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem. She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box. So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amélie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones. In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.Favorite corny pun: 'Even artichokes have hearts.' Favorite elaborate joke: sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke: the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off. Favorite scheme: reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years. The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados. There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amélie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.Bottom line: very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Rear Window," Midcentury voyeurism
","This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal. In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escape–I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals. Bored beyond belief, he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors. Meanwhile there is his girlfriend, none other than Grace Kelly playing a 'too perfect' socialite intent on winning his heart and soul. Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out, that they are essentially incompatible, she a socialite, who always goes first class, he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accommodations. Naturally the audience (me!) finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.Raymond Burr (long TV's Perry Mason) in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald, seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night. Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on. There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly, but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window: the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts, the ardor of the newlyweds, the angst of the songwriter, the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty, the pampered dog in a basket, and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife. Hitchcock's America at midcentury. Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution: Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man. The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work. Dancing beauty's man (looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform) returns. The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties, etc. Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch, which is why, I think, he is so beloved. In the final scene Grace Kelly, finding her man asleep, puts down the adventure book she is reading (for his benefit) and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions. One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially, marital reality.There is some tension and some mystery, but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena, and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic. You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting. See it for Thelma Ritter, the sadonic character actress of many films, most notably this and All About Eve (1950).(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

The Truman Show," Can all of life be fake?
","Spooky, profound and perhaps prophetic. Could the world we live in be Truman's world? Instead of Christof (or his predecessor, the Wizard of Oz) could there be aliens Out There running their TV show of us?We can't get out of this solar system. The sun is rigged Out There. Just as Truman could never sail to Fiji, no human can live long enough to transverse interstellar space to Alpha Centuri Proxima, the nearest star. Before the gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us, real or imagined. Does it make any difference? And as Christof says, we accept the reality that is given us, so we could be fooled. Anyway, 'The Truman Show' begins with a startling premise marvelously presented. The script by Andrew Niccol is a work of art and the direction by Peter Weir sure-handed and seamless. He allows the story to unfold at a convincing pace and the fifties cum nineties TV Americana feel to the 'Seahaven' sets is delightful. Jim Carrey is perfect as Truman Burbank, the poor sap in a fishbowl. Everything about his life, including his wife and best friend are totally fake. Ed Harris as the megalomanic TV artist Christof is creepy enough, although the scenes with him are ironically less convincing than those in Truman's world. I thought he came across a little too much like a mad scientist. Laura Linny as Carrey's TV wife/product spokesperson with the ever present TV smile is wonderful, and good too is his estranged girl friend, Natascha McElhone with the big eyes.Some unanswered questions. We know there is a camera in the bathroom. Do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the world-wide audience watch him move his bowels? And is his wife a 'whore' as well as a TV actress or is their relationship purely Platonic? Does the audience see them together in the bedroom? Does she have a life away from him? Weir chose not to address these questions. Although the premise looks a little messy when examined closely, the inspired and completely apropos ending is as crisp and clean as the dot at the end of this sentence.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

The Matrix," An action/adventure future?
","What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said? There are over twenty-six hundred comments at IMDb and another twenty-five hundred at Amazon. There even seems to be some block 'reviewing' from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, 'The One,' 'Trinity,' saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc. I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well. Note that Gloria Foster is 'Oracle' (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is 'Mr. Reagan' (a little secular allusion here). The band of heroes are also referred to as 'freedom fighters' to recall our ex-prez's words. (But never mind.)The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many. Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye. The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.But is the movie any good?Well, it's not much on video. The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat. The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.But I mean philosophically speaking?I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) 'Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer.' Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking. The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18. Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings. Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?Actually I do. I just don't think it's original. I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old. And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998). Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.Isn't that stretching it a bit?Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like 'The Perm-Machine.' Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures. But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.What about the acting?Forget the acting. It was okay. Consider this instead: we are going to become software. There isn't going to be any 'warfare' between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant. Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred. And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present. Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all. Some people call this the 'singularity' factor. The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Heat," Superior thriller with some depth
","How can a film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro be bad? It really can't because they would never approve the script or director. By that I mean, they would pass. The fact that neither of them passed says something.At the very least, this is a pretty good film.And it is. In fact I think this will be one of the defining films of the nineties. I suspect it will be viewed in distant eras and scrutinized for clues about the American psyche, circa 1995. Some will see a fantasy glorifying professional criminals and the men who fight them. This will be true. Others will see a morality tale about good and evil played out with women in the background, but actually in the forefront of our consciousness.I wish this part had been more fully developed.Eady, played by Amy Brennaman, chooses the man who excites her (De Niro) and ends up with nothing (but she had an exhilarating ride). Charlene, played by Ashley Judd, swaps her men around, searching for the best deal, the one who will best provide for her and the one she can best manipulate. Justine, played by Diane Venova, cannot help but choose the workaholic super cop (Pacino) because he is so superior to any other man she's ever met, particularly to her first husband, the uncaring father of her adolescent girl. But her life will never be secure because he is always leaving her alone so he can chase criminals because that is what he really loves.Some of this is a mafia-style film without the mafia. We have the same worshipful attitude toward those who thumb their noses at society and give orders that must be obeyed, super macho guys who bond together and follow the code, guys who can out shoot and out fight mere mortals. This is part of the fantasy. We see the expensive cars and the dinners with the beautiful women and the adorable children at fancy restaurants as part of the booty of being men who aren't afraid to take what they want regardless of risk. These men will always have the pick of the herd because if successful their mates know they will get a lot of the goodies of this world, and if unsuccessful, there's always the next risk taker who might succeed.This is a complex film and I would have to view it twice to make sure it all fits. Being a thriller, I know off hand that it won't. Thrillers unravel. But life is too short to view this twice, so I will say I wasn't offended by the unlikely events: the fact that the touted bank robbery scene was like a war scene filmed with surround sound effects and jittery camera immersions and bullets flying everywhere-semi-plausible even if nobody seemed to run out of ammunition. The robbery of the armored truck was nicely done except that the tire-puncturing chain strewn across the street for the pursuing cop cars seemed a bit stagy, and the whole thing required the most exquisite timing. In the uncompleted break-in there was a familiar 'Mission Impossible' tension-filled race against the clock that seemed authentic, but probably wasn't. The Los Angeles environs, especially the final scene at LAX, provided atmospheric locales that made everything seem real and immediate.Where I think director Michael Mann went astray was his insistence on giving the audience the expected confrontation between the two big stars, a subplot that reached its low point with the phony bonding scene with De Niro the bad guy and Pacino the good guy having coffee together and exchanging dreams like blood brothers. This mutual admiration society was right out of some WWII film in which the American general admires the courage and cunning of his Nazi counter part and vice versa. De Niro's final line was a little corny, but Pacino's squeezing his hand reminded me of the way a big cat lovingly licks its prey after killing it. Bottom line though, Pacino and De Niro made us believe, or at least suspend judgment for awhile, and that is what Hollywood is all about.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Apollo 13," Gripping story professionally rendered
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)I don't think it matters whether you remember the story of the Apollo 13 space mission or not. Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest. And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood. Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship. In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances. A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look. After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner. When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that. The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself. It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book. However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995. It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done. Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me. Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here. Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.",8,0,1,28 January 2005
The Thin Red Line," War as nihilism
","I rented this and noticed that the previous viewer had given up after about a tenth of an inch of tape, not having rewound it. I could see why. This begins as an arty war movie that is not doing either the arty or the war part right. I would have given up on it myself except that it had been nominated for a number of awards, and I knew there had to be something I was missing. So I occasionally rewound the tape and listened and watched carefully. Gradually something began to build. The impressionistic and stream of consciousness techniques began to pull me in and to mesh with the flashbacks and poetic voice-overs to make a meaningful contrast with the jungle and carnage. The studied camera work with the long takes on the faces of the soldiers, interspersed with panoramic vistas of jungle and mountain and naturalistic shots of tropical island animals, lead me to believe that in making this, Director Terrence Malick had taken Shakespeare as his muse, in particular the celebrated words from MacBeth: '...(Life) is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing.'As other critics have pointed out, Malick's movie does indeed signify nothing, and perhaps that is the point. But I am somewhat troubled by such an interpretation of our involvement in World War II. I would feel more comfortable had such a point of view and attendant techniques been employed in depicting our involvement in Vietnam or even in World War I. But to imply that the sacrifices made by our soldiers at Guadalcanal and elsewhere in the South Pacific were for nothing is entirely off base. Almost any war fought anywhere is a monumental waste; but if there is one exception is it without doubt World War II. We had no choice but to oppose European fascism and the expansionist policies of Imperial Japan. I shudder to think what the world would be like now, had we not. Imagine being surrounded by totalitarian regimes with their gas ovens and their slave labor, their policies of racial and cultural genocide. By comparison, such a reality would make George Orwell's '1984' nightmare seem a benign fantasy.I am also wondering how James Jones himself would feel about this impressionistic interpretation of his realistic novel. He was one of a generation of writers, including Norman Mailer and James Michener, who found their inspiration in the war in the Pacific. He is also the author of From Here To Eternity (1951), made a couple of years later into an academy-award winning movie starring Burt Lancaster (an excellent movie, by the way). I suspect that Jones would have to feel some ambiguity toward Director Terrence Malick's production of this sequel. Jones certainly did not feel that our participation and experience in World War II was meaningless. Nor was his personal experience meaningless. Furthermore to make his novel into a revisionist impression of war as nihilistic hell misses not only the spirit of his novel but the entire point of our involvement in World War II.I wonder how those who survived the horrific experience of Guadalcanal and similar battles feel about this movie. I wonder if they think it was accurate and fair and expressed their sense of experience.The performances by James Caviezel as Pvt. Witt and Sean Penn as First Sergeant Welsh were excellent. Nick Nolte as Col. Gordon Tall was also good, although he occasionally reminded me of George C. Scott doing General Patton. Perhaps the best sequence in the movie was the recollection in flashback by Pvt. Jack Bell (Ben Chaplin) of his sensual wife back in the states and the agony of being separated from her, and then the brutal knife of her letter telling him she had fallen in love with another man. The inclusion of a third element, that of the Pacific Islanders themselves amid the strife as innocents watching the gladiators, was valuable as perspective. However what might have been added was the brutality and enslavement they experienced at the hands of the Japanese military. Malick gave us none of that perhaps because such a view might have detracted from his purpose, that of depicting war as an expression of our nihilistic nature. Incidentally some have said that this treatment owes something to Tim O'Brien's short story, 'The Things They Carried,' or even to the spirit of the Thomas Hardy poem, 'The Man He Killed.' Certainly there is an intentional allusion to Carl Sandberg's poem 'Grass' when one of the soldiers holds up some grass and says something like, 'This is us.' O'Brien's short story was an intense focus on the artifacts carried by soldiers and what the bare artifacts implied. Yes, I believe Malick was influenced by O'Brien, certainly in the sense that this is a strongly visual film. It's what our eyes see that counts, and not so much the story or what is said.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

Slumdog Millionaire," Top ten reasons Slumdog Millionaire is a mediocre movie:
","(With redeeming qualities in cinematography, acting, music and sharp editing.) (And please spare me the hate mail.)10. 20,000,000 rupees is 'only' about $411,000. 9. No toilet paper in the outhouses. 8. All the kids are healthy looking with nice teeth. 7. Latika experiences no sexual abuse! 6. No (gaunt) slum dogs are seen.5. 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' is not a live show in India. 4. After step five the contestant does not lose 'everything' with a wrong answer. 3. The questions were in chronological order of his life!2. Police in India TORTURE people if they think they're cheating TV shows? 1. Giving a $100 bill to Arvind would be giving it to the hated men who blinded him.Additionally I wonder: Did the copyright owners of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' okay this? I mean, would Regis Philbin or Meredith Vieira try to cheat a contestant? Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India. Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives.

Contact," 'If it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space'
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)The contact frequency is pi times hydrogen, and the first transmission is the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7.... This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena. It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction. The general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant segment of the scientific community considers the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and human energy. The prejudice is so great that until recently no self- respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of having no career. Well, there are a few brave souls. This is a movie about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their authors. But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary writer. Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg. It is extraordinarily well thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks. It is also emotionally moving.There is, however, just the slightest 'written by committee' feel to the movie. Everything is a little too neat and too well explained. It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production. And yes, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice to round her out. Being a political innocent isn't enough. And the media and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing a futuristic or 'superior civilization' story, namely coming up some unknown technology or information to make it seem real. The formula for cold fusion would work, or the cure to cancer. But how can you do THAT?You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important than your script.) It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall. Only those who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here. And incidentally Zemeckis can be given credit for making 'Contact' intelligible without any dumbing down, no mean feat in itself. As far as star Jodie Foster goes, it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of astrophysicist Ellie Arroway. They have her come out looking androgynous, which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive sexuality long ago. She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she still looks like a normal woman in a gown. And she is appropriately unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera, something the real Jodie Foster is not.Best line: 'It's so beautiful. They should have sent a poet.'",9,2,5,7 November 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," Haunting and disturbing, but ultimately redemptive
","I avoided this when it came out in 1989 having seen Coming Home (1978)  and not wanting to revisit the theme of paraplegic sexual dysfunction  and frustration. I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our  involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to  serve up. And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic? I just didn't think it would  work.  Well, my preconceptions were wrong.  First of all, for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another  pretty boy (which was basically my opinion), this movie sets that  mistaken notion to rest. He is nothing short of brilliant in a role  that is enormously demanding--physically, mentally, artistically, and  emotionally. I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be  the same person. Someday in his memoirs, Tom Cruise is going to talk  about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.  And second, Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in  wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.  There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling. There was no Jane Fonda,  as in Coming Home, to play an angel of love. Instead the high school  girl friend understandably went her own way, and love became something  you bought if you could afford it.  And third, Stone's depiction of America--and this movie really is about  America, from the 1950s to the 1970s--from the pseudo-innocence of  childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to  having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothers-in-arms  being sent home in body bags--was as indelible as black ink on white  parchment. He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the  shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes  between anti-war demonstrators and the police outside convention halls  where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.  I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic  detail and sustained concentration, this is his best. There are a  thousand details that Stone got exactly right, from Dalton Trumbo's  paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I, Johnny Got His Gun, that sat  on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed, to the black medic telling him  that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the  Vietnam war, namely the civil rights movement, to a mother throwing her  son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision  of what her son ought to be, to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you  have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.  Also striking were some of the scenes. In particular, the confession  scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot; the Mexican  brothel scene of sex/love desperation, the drunken scene at the pool  hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches, and then the drunken,  hate-filled rage against his mother, and of course the savage hospital  scenes--these and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me  for many years to come.  Of course, as usual, Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily  upon his artistic purpose. Straight-laced conservatives will find his  portrait of America one-sided and offensive and something they'd rather  forget. But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed  to get back somehow and see this movie, will find it redemptive.  Certainly to watch Ron Kovic, just an ordinary Joe who believed in his  country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics,  go from a depressed, enraged, drug-addled waste of a human being to an  enlightened, focused, articulate, and ultimately triumphant spokesman  for the anti-war movement, for veterans, and the disabled was wonderful  to see. As Stone reminds us, Kovic really did become the hero that his  misguided mother dreamed he would be.  No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one. There is something  about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at  all that eats away at our consciousness. And yet in the end there is  here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a  man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.  --Dennis Littrell, author of 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't  Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'",10,165,201,23 October 2003
All the President's Men," The Watergate scandal from the reporters' perspective
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)This dramatization of how it was discovered that the burglary of the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D. C. was funded and directed by the Nixon White House is a lot better than it has any right to be. Given the tedious, non-glamorous and frankly boring leg- and phone-work that is often the lot of the investigative reporter, it is surprising that this is a very interesting movie even if you don't care two beans about the Watergate scandal. In fact, this is really more about how the story was put together than it is about the scandal itself. It is also a lot less political than might be expected. It stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and they are good, with excellent support from Jason Robards (Oscar as Best Supporting Actor) playing Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee, and Jane Alexander as an innocent caught up in the machinations. But what makes the movie work is the Oscar-winning script adapted from the Woodward and Bernstein best seller by that old Hollywood pro, William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969, Misery 1990, etc.). What he does so very well, even though we know the outcome, is to establish and maintain the tension as Woodward and Bernstein run all over town chasing leads and misdirections. He accomplishes this by putting just enough varied obstacles in the path of our intrepid reporters, notably the Washington bureaucracy and the understandably cautious senior editors at the Post.The direction by Alan J. Pakula (Comes a Horseman 1978, Sophie's Choice 1982, etc.) focuses the scenes nicely, keeps the camera where it belongs, and highlights the story with a shadowy Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook), skitterish sources, and a vivid recreation of a top American newspaper at work. I was especially enthralled to see the interactions among the reporters, the editors and the sources. I thought they all looked and sounded authentic, Redford's good looks having nothing to do with the story, which was right, and Hoffman's flair for the intense reigned in, which was necessary. The diffidence of Alexander's character and the soft pushiness of Woodward and Bernstein were tempered just right. Bradlee's stewardship of the story and his ability to take a calculated risk seemed true to life.Some details that stood out: Redford's hunt and peck typing contrasted with Hoffman's all fingers flying; the talking heads on the strategically placed TVs, reacting (via actual video footage) to the developing story--deny, deny, deny! of course. The thin reporter's spiral notebooks being pulled out and then later flipped through to find a quote. The bright lights of the newsroom looking expansive with all those desks as though there were mirrors on the walls extending an illusion. The seemingly silly tricks to get a source to confirm: just nod your head; I'll count to ten and if you're still on the line... And you know what I liked best? No annoying subplot!The rather abrupt resolution with the teletype banging out the leads to a sequence of stories that led to President Nixon's resignation had just the right feel to it, especially for those of us who have actually experienced the goosepimply sensation that comes with watching a breaking story come in over the teletype. The quick wrap-up surprised me, but delighted me at the same time. Bottom line: an excellent movie that wears well, a fine example of some of Hollywood's top professionals at work some thirty years ago. #30",8,43,65,30 September 2003
Atonement," Heart-wrenching, beautifully acted and directed
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!' Get it at Amazon.)POSSIBLE SPOILERS.There is little I can add to the myriad critics and viewers who have seen this beautifully rendered work of art from the novel by Ian McEwan. But I want to point to the commanding performance by Vanessa Redgrave at the end in which she tells us what has happened. She absolutely commands the screen and engages us in such a direct way that we are enthralled and touched. From an artistic point of view it is interesting that the words she speaks need no embellishment or any acting out. There are so perfect and her delivery is beyond professional. It is lived, as is the case with all great acting.I also was very much taken with the performance of Romola Garai who played Briony at 18. Her face conveyed more than words can tell. She felt so deeply not just her character's great sin, but the tragedy of the war and the dying she saw all around her and the sense that she could not be forgiven. Saoirse Ronan, who played Briony as a girl had a hard edge, almost an evil edge to her that was perfect for the part, a kind of 'bad seed' depiction with her washed out face and small self-importance and her inability to not just understand what she saw and experienced, but her inability to understand herself and to love instead of desiring only to be loved.The way the story is presented with scenes out of chronological order but in psychological and emotional order was most effective. I was especially impressed with the idea of showing us the scene where Briony pretends to drown and is saved by Robbie after the fact of the great lie she tells. As presented we immediately understand why she lied. His anger and failure to understand her childish love for him perhaps worked like the Achilles heel of his character. Had he been able to love her as one might love a child and help her to understand that he could not love her otherwise, everything might have been different. Or perhaps not. In a sense hers was an act of atonement, although not in a positive sense.The epic scenes of the beginning of World War II with the British in retreat and all the bloodshed and waste of war magnified and accentuated, especially the scene with Briony and the dying French soldier Luc, made us understand the how precious life was for those who witnessed this while serving as a dramatic and psychological foil for the love and life that Cecilia and Robbie could not experience.I also like the economy with which the essential details of the story were presented. We see the dramatic scenes and then we understand with just a few words or even a look what actually happened. For example when Briony as a nurse attends the wedding of Lola and Paul and as the bride and groom walk away we see the shame in their faces, the same shame that Briony feels, only they are not going to own up to it, we know. And then there is the quick flashback to the scene that Briony as a girl had witnessed and this time her mind allows her to see the man's face. And then a bit later on in the scene that the author inside the author (Briony) makes up, we understand that there will be no revelation of the truth because a spouse cannot testify against a spouse, or at least in this case would not.And then there is the brilliant ending with Vanessa Redgrave summing it up and tying it all together--but more than that, showing us how Briony grew as she went from childhood to old age. In fact the emotional and human transformation that takes place in Briony's character is perhaps the central point of the story. I haven't read the novel by Ian McEwan but I am familiar with his work and know he must have been responsible for such a psychologically compelling development and ending--although it is obvious that the script by Christopher Hampton and the direction by Joe Wright are more than first rate.",10,3,6,24 January 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," You're gonna love this movie
","This depression era period piece is simply a delight. The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win. (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.) But never mind. The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen. Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996). Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events. O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing. Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on. Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance. When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot. He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees. With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen. He is one of those non-glamorous actors who is at the top of the profession. It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off. This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer. As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters. But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor. He was really that good. (He did win a Golden Globe award.) And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick. When the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' come on with their 'I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow' it really brings the house down. The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot. And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: 'I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow'! See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'

The Godfather," A masterpiece
","This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the 'message' of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live.From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book 'Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!'
