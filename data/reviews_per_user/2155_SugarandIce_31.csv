Insidious: Chapter 2," Interesting, but fails in all other regards.
","The strongest aspect of Insidious Chapter 2 is the storyline, as it unravels to show the ghosts, the plots, etc. Unfortunately, an interesting narrative isn't enough when your horror movie falls painfully short in the actual horror department. There were only two or three scenes that were actually creepy. The acting was also quite strange. The way the scares are presented all look odd. Perhaps some scares would have worked better if executed by a different director using different angles and lighting. My point is, every shot was over saturated in color and filmed at unscary angles. It also lacks proper atmosphere, and thus proper tension. Worst of all, as soon as I saw the main ghost, the movie fell apart for me, as she didn't look particularly scary (the black bride is a bit better). There are also a lot of unintentionally funny moments, mostly due to the odd acting and weird dialogue. In the end, Insidious Chapter 2 isn't among the worst horror films. Unfortunately, its mysteries and twists aren't enough to carry the film.",6,0,0,15 April 2014
The Avengers," One of the best, if not the best, superhero films of all time.
","The promotional material looked like it was setting me up for disappointment. Then I saw it and found myself uncontrollably falling deeply in love. Joss Whedon was able to flawlessly bring these characters together and give them some excellent interactions. A sign of his genius is how he took Black Widow, my least favorite character from Iron Man 2, and made her one of my favorite Marvel characters. He was also able to give us the best portrayal of the Hulk. Loki also had some great scenes and some great lines. In fact, I think he was the strongest element of this movie. The music is, for some reason, quite average though. This is a movie one can rewatch again and again. It's an all around enjoyable film with great, unique characters, great dialogue, a cohesive plot, and fantastic action. At this point, with its universal acclaim, there is no point in me recommending it at all. Let me just add this then: for once, the hype is completely justified.",9,1,3,9 December 2013
The Expendables 2," Mindless Action Movie 2
","I really didn't have my hopes high going in, I'll admit. The first expendables did not impress me one bit. I was hoping that Nan Yu's Maggie would bring some fresh air to this testosterone line up, but her character wasn't utilized very well. In the end, Expendables 2 winds up being a pointless clone of the original. It's a generic action flick with an all star cast. The end. There isn't one character in here worth remembering. There isn't one action scene that has any thought or effort put into it. If you just want to see such heroes come together, there's no need to see both movies. Oh and for the record, adding more famous action stars does not make a movie any better.",5,0,0,9 December 2013
Gravity," A visual feast.
","First off, if you haven't seen this film, go see it on the big screen today, preferably in 3D. Gravity has excellent CGI which it uses to bring us breathtaking shots of planet Earth and the silent tranquility of space. Sandra Bullock delivers a fine performance in this. The film is highly tense, especially earlier on. There are some nice emotional themes in this film that moved me.Alright, so this film has received a lot of universal acclaim. However, I will say it is overrated. Yes, it is beautiful and fairly solid. But it suffers mostly from two factors that keep it from greatness. First, is George Clooney's character. He might as well have been a charismatic robot because his characters was utterly unrealistic. Second, around the last half of the movie, Murphy's Law apparently decides to set the universe against Sandra who miraculously doesn't die on several occasions. Willing suspension of disbelief takes some serious blows.",8,1,3,9 December 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars has hope.
","Many people are under the impression that Star wars must have a certain feel and contain certain clichés. Particularly, if they don't feel like the original trilogy, these Star Wars products are inherently bad. The thing is, Star Wars has always been much more and its various stories in novels and games have not only understood that but often succeeded because of it. I must admit it was surprising that Disney and Lucasfilm gave the go ahead on a rather unique addition to Star Wars's cinematic universe. Rogue One is not like other Star Wars films. It is a war film and contains very little of the Jedi and Force elements of earlier films. It brings back the tragedy and dark elements of Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes back, perhaps even darker than ever.This is by no means a perfect film. Its characters, while sufficient and not two-dimensional, don't get the screen time they deserve. Even characters I loved like Donnie Yen's character could have used a few more minutes to go over their backstories. There are also some plot holes and poorly executed scenes, much like Gareth Edward's last film, Godzilla. What this film does right however is take chances and largely succeeds in its efforts. It is far more ambitious than any side-story cash grab has a right to be. This film isn't afraid to show the dark side of the Star Wars universe with multiple character deaths and violent massacres. The Empire feels dangerous in this film. The world building is also fantastic, the cinematography is spectacular, and this film has possibly the best space battles we've ever seen in Star Wars. If TFA (while not a bad film) made me wonder if Star Wars had become afraid to evolve, Rogue One has made me realize there is hope for this beloved franchise.Critically, I rate this film 8/10 and 9/10 for personal enjoyment.",9,1,9,2 January 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Falling in love with Thor
","What the Russo brothers did for Captain America, Taika Watiti has done for Thor. In place of a Shakespearean hunk, we get a humorous, likable, and compelling hunk. I also love all this film did for Hulk and Loki in characterization. And I must mention its badass and stylish new villain Hela who is a favorite Marvel villain of mine. This film is not lacking in any one thing. In its comedy, it's by far the funniest Marvel film ever. So much is ad-libbed and all else reeks of Taika's genius. I should also mention Taika voices Korg who is the funniest character ever written in a Marvel film. As for the action, this movie shows Thor at his best, far more badass and powerful than he's been in his prior films where his feats were often lacking. The soundtrack is excellent, even without the adrenaline-inducing Immigration Song. The visuals are gorgeous. Even a trash planet is a visual feast to look upon due to the color palette and cinematography. The film's writing is also subtle, with themes of colonialism underlying its plot. And for all its comedy, this film has consequences, twists, and emotional moments. This film is utterly excellent and insanely rewatchable. And now I want to rewatch again right this minute. it's just that good.",9,2,5,21 May 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel's first masterpiece
","After letting Avengers age a few years, I no longer can see it as the masterpiece I did, even if it remains a fine film. However, Winter Soldier continues to be my favorite Marvel film even after five years. This film is masterful in how it vastly improves the characterizations of Steve Rogers, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and other characters. It also introduces some truly terrifying villains, excellent twists, great character moments, and witty, smart dialogue. The fight choreography also remains the finest in any Marvel film with one duel that rivals films like Ip Man and the Raid 2. And I stand by that opinion. I really want to gush about how much it made me love the Winter Soldier and become an even bigger fan of Black Widow, but you can see that for yourself. I will close this review off by saying that this film's grounded story does it huge favors as it explores topical subjects of politics and freedom, relevant to our political climate. This is not just a great Marvel film, it's a great film in general. And for that, I believe it remains the strongest of Marvel's films.",10,0,2,21 May 2019
Interstellar," Intelligent, beautiful, and uneven.
","Nolan surprised me in that he's taken a special interest in adding emotion and heart to his latest film. This serves to humanize a very scientific plot. Unfortunately, the power of love does not mesh well with the concepts being presented here. Much of it is overdone. It also could have benefited from a trim down (especially on the Earth sections). This film overstayed its welcome, despite running out of time to tell its story. Let it be known, I have no problem with long films. I grew up watching Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings extended editions. Yet, the length was a bothersome factor here. I also lament that it didn't give us enough time to enjoy the beauty of the cosmos. We get glimpses, nothing more.That all being said, this is still a well-crafted, intelligent film. In beautiful simplicity it educates the audience of theory and consequences. There are also some genuinely heartwrenching scenes, some breathtaking sequences, and some heart-pounding moments. This film is one heck of a ride. The acting is a positive, as is Hans Zimmer's lovely score. Attributes and vices considered, Interstellar is a cinematic journey worth partaking in.",8,1,5,22 March 2015
Pacific Rim," One of the most enjoyable film experiences in a while.
","I went into this film expecting a big, stupid monster vs mecha movie. I had no desire to see it as the trailers had failed to impress me. The very first scene however, took my breathe away. It had been so long since a film totally immersed me in its world. I felt a chill down my spine as the jeager and kaijus first took screen. The CGI is outstanding and undoubtedly deserves the Oscar for it.The action? My God, the action. Transformers, take notes. If you want to make a tense, exciting battle scene, actually show what's going on and make the enemy actually dangerous. These Kaiju meant business so every skirmish was a heart pounding experience for me. The fact that the CGI was so convincing only enhanced this.Let me get this out of the way. I do not think this film is as stupid or badly acted as many other people do. In fact, I quite liked the leads, especially Mako. I felt this film did a good job developing their characters and building their friendship. The story is of course not spectacular. I'm not saying the acting is stellar either, but it's by no means bad. But this movie has heart. It has heart in its characters, it has heart in its theme about teamwork, and it has heart in its battles. There are few films I can give such praise to.",9,5,7,9 December 2013
Ant-Man," A breath of fresh air
","After Age of Ultron (a good film) left me fatigued with the superhero genre, Ant-Man proved to be just the antidote I needed. The movie is small in scope, which is a refreshing change to the large stakes of the Avengers. It's a slick, cute film with hilarious moments and great visuals. Our lead Scott Lang is charming and likable. Dr. Hank Pym and his daughter Hope are quite compelling. The only weak link in the cast is the villain, something Marvel has always struggled with (other than Loki). I left the films feeling very positive about Marvel's future. If they can balance their big blockbusters with creative films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, then the next several years will prove to be a delight for the movie-goer.",8,2,9,11 August 2015
Man of Steel," Superman is back, but not for the better.
","There are things to like in Man of Steel. Hans Zimmer's score is excellent. The cape looks great. The CGI is good and the first battle is well choreographed. The movie introduces a powerful threat I, not being versed in Superman lore, was interested to see. The acting is, for the most part, decent. So one could safely leave the theater thinking it was a good superhero film, that is until they go home, undress, get into bed, and look up at the ceiling. Then as the movie begins to sink in, they roll their eyes and mutter with disgust 'Snyder...' What am I getting at? This is a movie that is one third great, two thirds mediocre. There is some strange dialogue and acting that is hilariously bad. Superman is far more careless and destructive than he ought to be. The final battle is boring, dumb action. The story telling is disjointed and incoherent, as it constantly flashes back to random parts of Clark's life. Superman and Lois are also not particularly memorable, and Zod is busy acting like a ham most of the time. Jonathan Kent's scenes are by far the worst as his actor gives emotionless deliveries spewing words like 'the world is not ready' that really hold no meaning here and were shoved in simply to invoke a cheap sense of drama. The infamous Tornado scene is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.But at least Faora is awesome. Watch the movie, if just for her.",7,0,1,9 December 2013
The Revenant," Masterful directing and boorish storytelling
","The Revenant is a film I wish I could have seen in the theaters. It's so nice to get big films like this which make a historical setting and all it entails... feel real. You feel like you are in this time period. Everything about this film looks amazing and is shot masterfully. Leonardo Decaprio's acting is amazing, as is Tom Hardy's own performance. There's several stirring sequences and themes that are hard hitting. However, this film drags on and outstays its welcome. It's sluggish pace goes past world-building and into excess. By the time, the final confrontation is happening, you just wish it would be over. At least, I did. It can also be ridiculously over the top. It's first battle which is a one-take would be impressive it it wasn't just one person getting backstabbed and then backstabbed by another for five minutes straight. The terrifying grizzly bear sequence just keeps going, and so does the last fight scene. Movies need to know when to end and how to pace themselves. And this film does not. Despite those gripes, I feel giving this film anything less than 8 is a disservice, even if I didn't not much enjoy it. The director, the cinematographers, and the actor's truly made this film.",8,1,1,21 May 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best Spider-Man film in decades
","I never imagined that Spider-Man 2 could have an equal or even be surpassed. Even more, I didn't expect a better superhero film than Infinity War to appear in 2018. Yet, this animated flick by Sony, of all companies, managed that.This film is near flawless. It's a fantastic origin story for a new Spider-Man. Its utterly stylish with great character designs, comic book aesthetics, and great use of colors. The score is fantastic. The villains are scary. Did I mention it's a fantastic origin story? Newcomers to characters like Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen have a lot to enjoy with their portrayal here. That said, the older Peter Parker is extremely likable as well and shows that our original Spider-Man will always be relevant.Every element the film displays has a purpose, whether it be establishing character motivations or setting up for the climax' culmination of plot points. This film is masterfully crafted in writing, storytelling, characterization, visuals, and sound. It truly is passionate about Spider-Man, and sharing the integral message that Spider-Man has to share: Anyone can wear the mask. Anyone can be a hero. Anyone can be Spider-Man.",10,1,2,22 May 2019
Aliens," One of the best films of all time.
","Alien is an excellent horror film. Cameron, wisely decided to take the sequel in its own direction and with that, he created a mind bogglingly entertaining film that still manages to preserve the atmosphere of the first movie. Arguably, the elements he bring actually top what the original offered. This is a movie that is iconic in every aspect: in scenes and in dialogue. It holds up extremely well despite being nearly thirty years old. The effects are amazing, perhaps the best animatronics I've ever seen. The final battle with its buildup and shock, pays off and blows you away. Its lead, Ripley, remains one of the best female characters (and just plain characters) of all time, but the rest of the cast are memorable and interesting too. In my opinion, this is a film that belongs extremely high up in any scifi fan's top ten.",10,4,6,8 December 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Winter Soldier + Avengers = Marvel's Finest
","Civil War is not only an excellent follow-up to the Winter Soldier, it is a far better Avengers film than Age of Ultron. This film adds the stakes Marvel has been struggling with, and it does it with a nuanced but compelling villain. It adds fantastic characters like Black Panther. It takes Tony Stark and Steve Rogers' characters to new heights by bringing them to new lows. It manages to utilize dozens of characters and still does them all justice. It brings up interesting moral dilemmas and political questions. The action is also fantastic in this movie with several cinematic fight scenes being better than in the previous Avengers, but also close-quarters duels that sport excellent choreography and weight in the emotions behind them. This is a near flawless film and perhaps the best film Marvel has released. After seeing Endgame, I must say Civil War's consequences still feel relevant and it remains one of my personal favorite superhero films.",10,0,2,21 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Saving the best for last
","Everyone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be 'Where will Marvel take us next?'",9,2,4,22 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Far better than I could have imagined
","Even with the Russo brothers directing Infinity War, I was never certain a film could work on this scale. So many sci-fi elements, so many characters... it was so far from the grounded film the Russos made before and Marvel was going into even more bombastic territory than GOTG or the Thor films. What would decide if this film could work was going to be its villain and its usage of its characters. I'm happy to say that it succeeded in all fronts. The pacing in this film is quick and impeccable. Every character gets something to do, albeit some more than others. Its villain, Thanos, is likely the MCU's most compelling villain and the core of the film. He is not only intimidating and dread-inducing, but also sympathetic. This film is also incredibly dark with violent deaths, a grave tone, and writing that lacks much hope. This film has an emotional core, shocking themes, and amazing action. The CGI is fabulous, the score is masterful, and the visuals are eye-popping and wonderful. Infinity War is the best of the Avengers films, and will be remembered for decades as the masterful pinnacle of this cinematic universe, a decade in the making and well worth the wait.",9,1,3,21 May 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," No more tales, I beg you.
","Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent trilogy with three solid films. For those that doubted the sequels' quality, I give you this film to show how far the franchise has sunk. This film is a zombie with no understanding of how to portray its world nor its characters. It brings in new characters to fill the shoes of Will and Elizabeth and both are anything but interesting. Jack Sparrow is at his worst. While the film justifies it as him literally being at his lowest, they forget to bring him to his highest too. Johnny Depp is clearly phoning it in throughout the film. The film seriously seems to think Jack Sparrow is a loser and truly stupid too. It thinks pirates are all stupid. Those cunning swashbucklers from the old franchise? Gone. The new villains are boringly overpowered and yet lack any of the fright possessed by Barbaossa or Davy Jones, their ships, or crews. The only saving grace in this film is Barbossa's subplot but it still felt far too rushed. All mystery has been lost in this franchise' world and at this point, any world building feels tacked on and often contradicting of previous lore. We've already seen the heights of this franchise. A time of a compelling Jack Sparrow, formidable pirate nemesis, and exciting adventures waiting on the horizon. That time is over. Now, it's time for it to fade into legend. Let your ship rest, Disney. I beg you.",6,0,0,21 May 2019
Brave," There is charm and beauty to be found in Brave.
","It may not be Pixar's best work, but Brave is one my favorites by them. For a lot of people, Merida's abrasive nature, the tried and done formulas, and the lack of major conflict bring the movie down. For me, while this is often a glaring detractor, I felt this movie still worked since Pixar knows how to handle such things. The movie isn't the masterpiece it could be, don't get me wrong. However, this doesn't mean it isn't a really great movie. I really enjoyed how much of the film focused on Merida and her mother. Unlike some of the other elements, I think mother/daughter relationships aren't explored enough in cinema. The visuals are absolutely fantastic. The crown jewel is of course the hair, specifically Merida's. The detail put into the environment is also stellar. For what it's worth, I really enjoyed Brave.",8,2,4,9 December 2013
Logan," The Last Dance
","Why is it that so many of the best superhero films are the ones where the superhero elements feel secondary? Where the characters feel human first and super second? Where the story is down to earth and barely a comic-book film at all? Winter Soldier, Dark Knight, and now Logan... In truth, Logan may be better than both of those. It may be the best superhero film ever made. Then again, it's hard to say. Is it it even fair to call it a superhero film? It's more like a gritty western. This film is the perfect conclusion to the X-men films, and to Wolverine's tale. If X-men 3 ruined X-Men in the worst way, than Logan killed off the franchise (for me) in the best way possible. It broke my heart again and again. The characters I loved are at their absolute lowest and worst. The action has never been more spectacular and violent. Wolverine is at his absolute finest in brutality and in Hugh Jackman's performance. The inclusion of a new young girl mutant also brings in a great new character. This film left me in tears with all that occurred from beginning to end. It's so hard to sit through this film but I can't dislike it. Of all the X-men films, this one truly has the most heart.",10,1,3,21 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," It's no game changer, but it's worth your attention.
","I can't love Age of Ultron like I loved the first film. Some of the appeal of seeing our heroes together for the first time has left. The jump cut action is a bit unsatisfactory this time around. The narrative has lost its streamlined perfection and yet feels incomplete. This film is filled with misfires in characterization, tone, action, and storytelling. And yet while a flawed film, it is worth a ticket price. Age of Ultron still has plenty to offer. It gives us several new characters like Ultron and Scarlet Witch that add new life to the cinematic universe, and Josh Whedon continues to avoid overwhelming the audience with his massive assemble. In the end, this is a fun, big action film with plenty of likable characters and moments. However, it also suffers heavily from unevenness of the execution. As such the sequel failed to outdo the much slicker original film.",8,1,4,27 May 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," Beautiful and captivating. Well done Dreamworks.
","Ah, How to Train your Dragon... Dreamwork's surprise masterpiece. And if you've seen it, the next surprise is that it manages to take elements which could have made this movie clichéd and disappointing and do them right. This movie has excellent execution and pacing. Its characters are all likable and memorable. Its nonhuman main, Toothless ranks up there with the best silent animal leads in film. The CGI is absolutely breathtaking and the music even more so. The only complaint I can think of is that the reveal near the end doesn't make total sense. But in the whole, this is an excellent film for all ages. Dreamwork's has arguably been in a slump since its early Shrek days. With this, they show they can contend with Pixar in storytelling.",9,0,0,8 December 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," They play ELO so this film is automatically amazing
","I mean it. Other than its choice in music (which is even better than that in the first film), GOTG 2 improves so greatly on its predecessor. Characters I didn't much care for like Gamorra and Nebula get some much needed character moments. It brings in a compelling villain. It brings in fun new characters like Mantis and Ego. Even more, this film is driven by emotions and can be incredibly moving to the point it had me bawling my eyes out. Other than its excellent emotional core, the film is also hilarious and visually beautiful. GOTG brings some much needed color and visual beauty to Marvel's drabber palette, a trend future movies smartly followed. The film is a comedy first, but it knows when to be serious. Other than a few jokes that don't land, I don't have much criticism over it. I suppose the action is rather dull in the last act, but I enjoyed all else about it. Excellent work James Gunn. So glad to have you back. <3",8,0,0,21 May 2019
The Shape of Water," Strange but beautiful
","I have yet to see a film by Guilermo Del Toro I didn't enjoy. The Shape of Water certainly has a questionable subject matter with its interspecies romance but then again, why should that be a bad thing? This film is beautiful in every way. In its lovely soundtrack and cinematography. In its realistic practical effects and squeamish violence. In its likable, compelling characters, especially our leading lady and the main villain. It explores topics of love, ambition, authority, and abuse through a cold-war setting. It also is well-written with several fantastic plot twists and developments. The only flaw I can think of is the lack of characterization for our beloved fish man. While I consider him fully sentient, more scenes of characterization would have helped sell the authenticity of their romance.",9,2,7,21 May 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Excellent movie until you stop to think about it.
","I walked out of the theater thinking this movie was just about as good as the Dark Knight, but I still felt the Joker just couldn't be beat. I admit, hearing the criticisms is first and foremost what brought this movie down for me. But because it's an enjoyable film and faithful to the previous Dark Knight films, it's still totally worth watching. It focuses on Batman again, Catwoman is great, and Bane is a good villain. Unfortunately, there is also a ton of plot holes for the sake of the contrived, convoluted storyline. Some problems I have with it: The villains' deaths in this movie are shamefully nonchalant. The fight scenes, for all the emotion behind them, have extremely sloppy choreography. Other problems include Blake knowing Batman's identity, Bane's hilarious voice, the underwhelming prison, how Bane finds out the truth of Harvey Dent, anything with the police... How could Nolan mess up this much? Alright, while I am harsh on it, I still believe this is a conclusion not to be missed.",8,0,1,9 December 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Hastily-Done Match Up: Dawn of Mediocrity
","Batman v Superman's flaws derive not solely from script or directing, but from the movie's production. So eager to have their own Avengers, the DCEU decided Man of Steel was enough build-up to bring in Wonder Woman and Batman out of the blue, all for the sake of a battle that wasn't properly built up to. The fact of the matter is that this movie needed to be set up by another film or two for its plot to feel earned. The actual film isn't terrible, but it's ridiculously flawed. Lex Luthor is a joke of a villain. It's other villains are even bigger jokes and much of the film's last act makes the rest feel irrelevant. Even worse, the last minute of the film makes the last act feel irrelevant. There's a lot of stupid in this movie from 'Jar of Piss' to the infamous 'Martha' dues-ex plotpoint. This film thinks it's an intellectual and mature superhero film like the Dark Knight but it's just a dumb action film playing with themes it neither understands nor uses correctly. The only reason I don't rate it lower is because I liked Batman a lot in this film, especially his amazing fight scene which makes me not regret seeing this in theaters.",6,4,5,21 May 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Loki: The Dark World
","For the Dark World, eight stars seems a bit high, however seven stars is definitely too low. Let me put the weakest elements of this film out first. Emotionally, this film rarely connects as much as the first film. Thor does not receive any noticeable development. Characters like Siv were underutilized and the villain was forgettable. The comedy dosage is a bit too high as well. In these ways, it falters behind the first movie.In other ways, in most other ways, this film is actually an improvement over the first. It's an all around solid film with good pacing and memorable scenes. I'm sure many people were glad to see a fully powered Thor for so much of the movie. The main attraction though is Loki, who, in tradition, steals all the scenes. In fact, Loki's character is written better than ever in this film. The rest of the movie which is at least good, pales in comparison to any scenes with him. There is a noticeable spike in writing quality when Loki is on screen. Thor is also at his best when interacting with Loki.",7,0,1,9 December 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Catching Fire is an exceptional sequel.
","The original Hunger Games was very good, if only a bit forgettable. In retrospect, it appears to have been more of foundation to write this film upon. Kudos to the director, for the noticeable rise in quality. It improves upon the original in every way. The world itself, from its politics to its districts, is more fleshed out. The after effects of the first Hunger Game are really explored well here. PTSD and blackmail are powerful themes it uses well. Rue's death is actually more heartbreaking in this film. Consider the fact she died in the previous movie and you can see how shocking this is. The director really understood emotion and how to portray it. There are some truly moving scenes, and some equally horrific ones. The jabberjay scene especially comes to mind. In conclusion, this movie is chokingly dark.The characters really shine this time around having been properly fleshed out and given memorable personalities. The new characters are welcome additions as well. Props to Jennifer Lawrence for acting the hell out of Katniss, and props to everyone really. I left the theater feeling extremely moved. I was by no means an enthusiastic fan, not reading the books and only mildly enjoying the first movie. But Hunger Games, you've earned yourself a fan.",9,1,18,9 December 2013
Godzilla," Gareth Edwards captures the magic of the original film.
","Of all 2014's films, Godzilla was my most anticipated. In some ways, it let me down. In most, it satisfied me.Let me first speak of the cons. For all this film's darkness, its 'infant immortality' shows it's not quite as gritty as the classic film. I also was disappointed Godzilla did not return to his villainous roots. Finally, the characters and their stories were not as interesting as they ought to have been.The pros far outweigh the cons though. Gareth Edwards loves his monsters and it shows. He treats the kaiju with respect. Godzilla and the MUTO are well-designed, have great roars, behaviors, and flawless CGI. The movie utilizes buildup and suspense to bring a climax that pays off massively. The film also has a constant dark atmosphere, that never once crosses into cheese. Every angle in this film is masterfully shot, end of story. Bryan Cranston's performance was breathtaking and scenes with him have the most emotion and heart. While the character stories did not pay off, the characters (and the acting) all sufficed. While short of a masterpiece, this is one of the best monster movies you will ever see.",8,13,27,17 May 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Stylish and Kick Ass
","John Wick, you sexy man, how you entertain me. Seriously, the John Wick films have such excellent action that it makes the choppy, plainly shot fight scenes in other films so much more dissatisfying. John Wick 2 takes the best parts of the first film, namely its simple plot and beautiful fight scenes, and takes it to the next level. This film is gorgeous. The choice in colors, the club music, the environments that battles are fought in, even the guns and suits are just impeccable. This film is aesthetically flawless and its gritty but fancy fight scenes are to die for. With its better take on action and visuals, I favor this one a bit over the first film. Perhaps it's only flaw is it does not give our main character many moments of characterization. This is mostly fine but I wish it had a few more tender moments for him like he got in the first film for Keanu Reeves to show his acting chops.",8,0,1,21 May 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Better than Revenge of the Fallen, but that's not saying much.
","The first Transformers can at least be called a decent action flick. It had nearly all the elements which Revenge of the Fallen would go on to run into the ground. Dark of the Moon somewhat rectifies this, but still leaves a rancid taste in your mouth. The humor is still obnoxious and overused, Megan Fox's replacement is only somewhat less annoying, and the Decepticons have only regained some menace, but still remain paper machete targets for the Autobots and military. The camera work makes battles extremely hard to watch, not that you're missing out given Decepticons are simply punching bags these days. This movie really can't decide if it wants to be a Saturday morning cartoon promoting Hasbro toys or a series of raunchy jokes followed by scenes of robot organs being ripped out. Still it has some perks. The CGI is better than ever and there were two fights I actually enjoyed. If you want to see giant robots battling it out, see it if you must, but you're better off watching the first film or Pacific Rim.",6,1,3,8 December 2013
