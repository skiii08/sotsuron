Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," just a great movie!
",I liked this movie a lot. The special effects were great and the conversations between the characters was something I liked too. My only problem with the movie was that there were TOO much special effects in it sometimes. The movie would also be great without all the huge actors en effects. my rate: 7,7,4,6,14 July 2000
The Patriot," a bit disappointing, but okay
","Since I'm a big Mel Gibson fan I wanted to see this movie the minute it came in the cinema (which is  here in Holland last Friday) I had already seen Braveheart (which I love) and was comparing it with this movie. It was not what I expected. mel wasn't as great as he was in Braveheart. Maybe because he didn't direct this movie, I don't know. Besides that the movie was okay and nice to see when you're bored. The story was pretty good. What really bothered me was that there was SO much blood. Maybe the fans like it, but I don't. my rate: 7",7,0,1,3 August 2000
Titanic," the best!
","When i vote for a movie, I always comment on it. I want to do that now too, but I don't know what to say except the usual 'This is one of my favourite movies of all time' and 'it made me cry' This movie is just too beautiful to put into words. The director worked on it for five whole years and his work paid of: oscars, great reviews, everybody was (and still is) in love with this movie.my rate: 10",10,2,3,16 August 2000
The Sixth Sense," a beautiful thriller without blood!
",I saw this movie in the cinema with some friends and I held in my breath a couple of times because of the tension. The little boy in the movie acted great. I also liked that it was a thriller without so much blood and other awful things. The ending was very unexpected too. my rate: 9,9,0,0,14 July 2000

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," so funny!
","I saw this movie and I just couldn't stop laughing! It really proves that you can make a good (and funny!) movie without a big budget. I thought it was very funny, but I can imagine that some people don't understand the humor. my rate: 8",8,0,0,14 July 2000
Braveheart," beautiful
","this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time! It has everything: romance, action, humor and drama. Mel Gibson did a great job acting and directing this movie. He is not afraid to show blood and torture. The music is great. The ending leaves you with a dramatic feeling. my rate: 10",10,2,4,14 July 2000
