Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Make Your Trailer George!
","15 years later this is still the most disappointing film on my list. I gave it 1 star, but my review focuses on what Lucas (almost) did right. In my mind there are four franchises that transcend all the others: James Bond, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and Star Wars.Of these, Star Wars is the most difficult one to work with. It has numerous interconnected characters and story lines, and specific rules and events to work around. This is in stark contrast to Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and James Bond which are a series of independent stories. Few side characters are carried forward, and the overall objectives and enemies are every changing. Occasionally even the actors are replaced and nobody seems to mind. Even if you mess up the formula in these franchises and make a bad film, the fans forgive you and move on to the next one.Star Wars doesn't offer that kind of flexibility. It was also the first of the franchises to attempt a prequel, which compounded the problem. From the very beginning (Episode Four) backs stories were referenced. There was clearly a collection of exciting events that had taken place which viewers wanted to know more about. Lucas even teased us with it, making the eventual reveal of the truth all the more effective.But when it came to the prequels, Lucas took an existing problem and made it worse. With the viewers already knowing the eventual outcome, and existing characters involved, Lucas extended his obligations to include nearly the entire cast and plot lines from the original trilogy. Even characters like Chewy, C3PO, R2D2, and Boba Fett, were needlessly included.Lucas mistakes in the prequels were many, but his excessive plot commitments to the old trilogy, made them uncorrectable going forward. He boxed himself into a corner with a story line that was both predictable and over-complicated for the next two films.Personally, I never really liked the decision to anchor everything around Darth Vader. He'd already made too many modifications to that character as it was. Many great movies are anchored around mysterious villains. But that mystery gives the villain their power. Vader was at his most powerful in the opening scene of New Hope. We didn't know who he was, what he was, or what he wanted, but he scared the crap out of us. He clearly could not be messed with, and had powers that we had only begun to imagine. He was the Empire's bogey man. By the final scene of Jedi, Vader was a vulnerable and human character. He'd been robbed of all his emotional power, but it didn't really matter because the story was complete. With the prequels, Lucas is trying to turn back time on that entire transformation. He wants to make Anakin lovable and endearing, and then freighting again. Even if such a re-transformation were possible, it was executed so poorly the audience was laughing by the end. Vader is a winy lunatic now, neither loved nor feared. It was a mistake and I don't think any writer could have corrected it.But giving Lucas the benefit of the doubt in crafting the prequels as The Anakin Trilogy...let's look at the four things he (almost) did right.1. The forbidden/doomed love aspect was very compelling...but it was absent from this first film. The fact that Padme was older than Anakin, and had no real connection to him from the start, made it all the more awkward when it was forced down our throats over the next two films. If anything, we leave the first film with Padme engaging in a motherly relationship with Anakin. How were supposed to come back from that? Lifeless dialogue and creepy moments aside, Lucas could have successfully rode this storyline to Anakin's downfall, but only he does so from the start.2. Darth Maul was fantastic...but dead. Sure it was a recycled character, but it worked. Darth Maul was the Darth Vader of this film. He was a mysterious and sinister villain that the audience actually connected with. In fact he was probably the most memorable new character from the prequels. The problem was he is killed off, and that connection dies with him. Things were setup for a powerful revenge subplot between Obi-Won and Maul which could have carried the next two films. It also presented Anakin with a future vision of himself, a chance to witness how powerful the dark side really was, but this avenue is never explored. Bottom line, Maul's death set in motion a perpetual cycle of villains to be introduced over the next films, with lesser effect. 3. The Young Obi-Won. Obi-Won Kenobi was a very stoic character in the original trilogy, but he always carried this smirk which seemed to say, 'son, if you only knew...' The splash of color on Obi-Won's character and past was probably the biggest thing fans craved from the original trilogy. Lucas flirted with this, but never really went with it. Obi-Won is just a supporting character engaged in a variety of minor side-plots. He loses some friends, kills a few bad guys, but in the end we don't know much more about him than we did before. 4. Give Us The Evil Empire! The trailer was great because it completely packed with sinister looking characters, epic space battles, screams of tragedy...exactly what we always thought rise of the empire must have looked like. What Lucas actually delivered was a fake empire, a fake death star, and tragic death of one guy we just met. The rise of the empire should have been so much more. The fact that it all amounted to a few legislative votes, trade disputes, and military projects was the most uninspired approach Lucas could have come up with. And he still took three films to do it.",1,1,4,3 August 2015
Citizen Kane," Model T of Movies
","To argue that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever is like arguing that the Model T is the greatest car ever made. There was a day when it was true, but if you are arguing now, you are just being silly.That isn't a knock against the Model T. If you see one driving down the road, it is certainly worth a look. But if you honestly ask yourself where it ranks on cars you'd like to have, it is pretty far down the list.Film buffs want their art to have timeless capacity to it. It would be comforting to folks in Hollywood to know that Citizen Kane is being appreciated and enjoyed 400 years from now along the lines that the Mona Lisa is appreciated and enjoyed. But I don't see it happening.This film will have some lasting historical value. But movies are valued much more on their storytelling than their artistic achievement. The story of Citizen Kane is only above average.",8,1,3,23 June 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Completely worthless plot
","What made the resident evil series interesting is that it is the thinking man's zombie movie. It offered a typical sci-fi plot but it kept things based around certain rules, threw in some twists, and maintained at least reasonable premises.This movie strays from having any remotely rational plot and feels no need to offer explanations when it does. As a result it is a huge disappointment if you slow up looking for anything more than hacking up zombies for 94 minutes.(SPOILER ALERT) Here are just a few of the needlessly ridiculous premises you are asked to just accept without any further explanation...1. T-virus has spread and essentially wiped out humanity. Surprisingly, this caused all plant life to die and the earth turned into a desert. Take that greenpeace! 2. Alice is now a jedi and can use the force to move rocks, bikes, and flaming gasoline at will.3. Zombies are incapable of climbing the 8 foot chain link fence surrounding Umbrella headquarters, but can easily scale the Eifel Tower and with surprising stealth.4. Olivera shoots a zombie which is clearly munching on LJ but thinks nothing of it. The entire group has apparently adopted a don't ask, don't tell policy regarding infection.5. Zombies have been functioning without any actual need of food or water (according to doctors) and will continue to for, and I quote, 'DECADES.' No further explanation given.6. Too much T-virus antidote turns you into an octopus.7. After reading an incoherent diary in Utah, the group decides to drive to Alaska, but opts to gas up in....LAS VEGAS! (damn these Umbrella maps) Umbrella anticipates this move and has an ambush waiting at the exact casino they stop at.8. Umbrella installed an on/off switch in Alice and cameras in her eyes but apparently did not find those things useful in tracking her the past 7 years or in confirming her identity when they spot her via satellite. Either that or Alice has no bars in rural Utah.9. Umbrella is cloning Alice and finds the best way to extract her blood is through repeated unnecessary and exotic deaths. Unfortunately cloned blood isn't as 'magic' as regular blood and they only end up piling up Alice corpses in the back yard like lawn clippings.10. Umbrella is developing a nation of domesticated zombies for use as Walmart photographers.11. Umbrella is developing an army of extra angry zombies and goes to the trouble of putting them in matching uniforms.12. In the event that society falls, mormon hillbillies will opt to lure innocent people into their lairs to feed their zombie dogs. Remember that then next time a missionary stops by your house.13. Eating infected meat causes crows to get infected...but not really. It also causes them to go blind...but not really.14. Zombies rule the earth and Umbrella is essentially trapped underground but the primary challenge the company is facing is the shortage of cheap labor.15. Food, water and fuel are almost gone, humanity is vanished, zombies are everywhere but the primary challenge facing survivors is...Umbrella Corp.",1,27,41,22 May 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Overrated and not funny
","This is another one of those films that contrarian snobs love.If you are the type of person that lives to praise films that most people would hate just so you can feel like you that much deeper than the masses, then enjoy yourself.Bottom line is that outside of a couple of funny moments by Peter Sellers (which are readily available in any Peter Sellers movie by the way) this movie is a snooze fest.It is not funny. It is not entertaining. Its satirical poke at the cold war and the arms race isn't anywhere near as clever as you'd expect it to be.Kubrick is hit and miss. This was a miss.",1,63,155,14 October 2007
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's finest work until Captain EO
","Easily on the short list of most overrated films of all time.There were items of discussion brought up after this film so it wasn't a total loss but I didn't see how this is 'the most honest account of the futility of war.' A better description might be 'The Most Schizophrenic Account of the Futility of War.' This film was an ambiguous fantasy and people were free to read into it any way they wanted.Another word for it might be acid trip.This film reaffirmed my belief that Coppola is the most overrated director of all time, but man he can assemble a cast.",1,15,31,31 July 2008
No Country for Old Men," Outstanding.
","I watched this film 3 times back to back to back on a long flight and absolutely loved it. Most people I recommended it to came back lukewarm though.Something to bear in mind is this is not an action film. Go into it expecting something more along the lines of Seven or Silence of the Lambs.This film will leave a lot of questions in your mind and it won't spoon feed you the answers. You are expected to think and come up with some of your own conclusions. And you won't necessarily be happy with them (again I think this rubbed people wrong).Overall though, this is just a great suspense-thriller with some of the best dialog I've heard in years. Anton Chigurh is easily a top 5 on screen villain.It will keep you thinking with you for days if you let it.",10,3,5,10 June 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Wow. What did anybody hate about this movie?
","If you loved the other ones, I see no reason to dislike this one at all. I thought it really refreshed the series and made the entire plot line deeper and clearer.Full of action, tension, and clever twists.I think people didn't like that the went a little heavy on the sci-fi plot angle and was heavy on special effects, but the series did that two films ago.Great stunt work as you expect with every Bourne film.Maybe people feel it is a little redundant with James Bond films these days, I don't know. But I hope they make a sequel.",9,4,8,7 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," How did this script get past storyboard?
","I think it is the consequence of most of the best gen-X storytellers coming from TV/Netflix world (Breaking Bad, Lost, Game of Thrones, etc). They have some really good ideas, twists, character journeys in their head. The downfall in this situation is that they are giving each creator a two hour window to do it. It doesn't work.It is extremely hard to have a continuous storyline in a movie franchise, it is simply too long between films, and too brief telling. Its ok to give a wink to a past event or allow your characters to develop over time, but the majority of the most successful franchises (Indiana Jones, James Bond, etc) are just the same enjoyable characters having a new adventure. Any actual continuity is mostly in our heads.This could have been a really great TV series. As a single film, its a jumbled mess. Too many climaxes, rollercoaster character arcs, and no time to enjoy any payoff we might have experienced along the way.Feels like I just binge watched 8 episodes of a TV show.",1,2,3,22 December 2017
The Dark Knight," Got a 10 from me
","It got a 10 from me. Is it the #1 movie of all time? Hard to say but I think people are approaching the question all wrong.Folks are really sensitive to whether or not The Dark Knight should replace The Godfather as #1 on IMDb. It reminds me of a scene from the Simpsons where the barflies at Moe's are arguing non-sensibly.'Mohammad Ali in his prime was way better than anti-lock breaks. OK, but what about Johnny Mathis versus Diet Pepsi?'The Dark Knight and Godfather are almost incomparable films but both achieved exactly what they were striving for.-Immortalized very different characters and actors. -Tremendously enjoyable, on very different levels. -Beautifully crafted, in very different ways. -Will come to define their genres, very different genres.BOTTOM LINE: YOU CAN RANK BOTH MOVIES 10 AND YOU ARE NOT INSULTING THE OTHER.Thoughts I had after seeing this movie: -I was prepared for how great a performance Heath Ledger was going to give but I was really blindsided Aaron Eckhart. The character of Harvey Dent will stick with you after the film as much as the Joker.-Acting and script across the board was noticeably better.-As much as Batman Begins attempts to bring the series into the scope of believability and realism, this one takes it another step further. No element of this film felt cartoonish or campy.-I was pleased that the previews did not spoil the story (as I saw them probably 30 times). I don't think we were shown an image from the final third of the film.-I was pleased that the filmmakers went the extra mile to tell the complete story. I was waiting for them to cut us off and finish with a 'wait for the sequel' ending. THIS IS A STAND ALONE FILM, WHICH IF ANYTHING, MAKES ME THE MOST COMFORTABLE GIVEING IT A 10.",10,9,19,31 July 2008
A Clockwork Orange," Worst Movie Ever Made
","I knew what I was getting into with Kubrick, and I've either strongly liked or disliked every movie he's made.This was a whole other experience.This film was total garbage. To enjoy any aspect of this film you have to completely walk away from the concept that films should be enjoyed.If when you pick up a movie, rather than popcorn, you prefer to buy a bag of broken stained glass from a orphanage window to eat while you watch it...than this is probably the show for you and ignore my post.As for me, I like popcorn. And I like movies that are enjoyable on some level. Inspite of what appears to be a ton of movie critics want to tell you, this movie is not enjoyable, educational, or even deep.First and foremost, it is long. Really long. Ridiculously long for as little as it ties to accomplish. And just when you think 'my god, this film has been on for a week and half, surely it has to be over soon,' it keeps going. Of the six people who came to my house to watch this movie, I was the only one that didn't walk out.Most of the aspects of why this film sucks have already been discussed at length. I will tell you why I hated it most.It wasn't the violence, I can handle that. I found it poorly incorporated (which was remarkable as it is the primary focus of the entire film).It wasn't the artsiness. I can usually enjoy that in films.What bothered me most was after I watched this film, I read a ton of reviews and internet analysis of this movie thinking that there has to be more to this than what meets the eye.There wasn't. I actually got it. There was little depth to what this movie was trying to say other than the kiddie pool deep discussion of the definition of morality, conformity, and behavior that a 4th grader could have picked up on.I am not anti-violence. I am not anti-creative. I am anti-worthless. And this movie is worthless in every level I can relate to you.The only people who will like this movie are those stuck up, smarter than thou, I am so much deeper than you that I urne to find stuff the rest of the world hates, snobbish pricks who have no friends and probably work at the video store you rented this from.",1,37,82,13 October 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Huge disappointment
","I am a huge Tarantino fan. Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bills are easily in my top 10 all time.This movie sucked. The story is boring. The script lacks wit. The acting was subpar for the caliber of actors they rounded up.It isn't an emotional crime drama. It isn't an exciting action movie. It definitely isn't a funny-cool dark comedy.I don't know what it is, but it isn't as cool as it should be.Give Quinton a pass as he was basically a first time director and enjoy his later work over and over again. But don't watch this one. It won't meet any expectations you have coming into it.",1,9,23,14 October 2007
Rocky," Shocked this movie might drop out of the top 250
","I'm shocked that this film may drop out of the top 250. Kind of a similar story to Superman or Star Wars in that its reputation was spoiled by a bunch of cheesy sequels.Had Rocky been a lone film it probably would rank above Raging Bull at #73.Bottom line is this is one of the more (re)watchable movies ever made. Entertaining, exciting, and uplifting (and without the spoon-fed Hollywood ending the series is synonymous with).Anybody who did hasn't been motivated to run around the block by this movie or its soundtrack must be paralyzed in body or spirit.",8,0,1,23 June 2009
Joker," Not sure this was meant to be a joker movie
","Fairly certain this project started our life as a remake of The King of Comedy until some assistant said, 'you know if we just put Joaquin in clown makeup and called this 'The Joker' we would probably make another $500 million...'",10,2,4,5 October 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Bane had so much potential! I'm disappointed in where it went with him.
","Great movie, but nowhere near as good as #2. The Joker and Harvey Dent were such powerful characters, they made #2 what it was. This film was missing a character like that.It was an interesting take on Bane. The voice was interesting. I would have gone with something more morphed and unnatural. The haughty accent took away Bane's potential to be truly frightening, but it also made him a bit more cerebral and human, which is what I think Nolan wanted. It definitely made him a more distinct character than just another half cyborg-vader type.But Bane had so much potential. They built him up into a really cool villain. Rather than a brainless roid raging thug, he was built up into this evil neo-political sociopath...then he kind of just disappeared. He just sat there watching his little ant farm, you couldn't tell what he was wanting to happen. The final fight was a major letdown. All of the fights seemed a little like drunken brawls, just punching and broken ribs. But after all they had done to center the movie around Bane, they killed him off like he was just a sidekick henchman. He was too important for that. All of the good guys (Batman, Kyle, Blake, Gordon, Fox, Foley) were balanced out only by Bane, and he was pulling it off, but he needed to be 'nuked' at the end. To just downplay him, kill him, and try and replace him with the weak Miranda character didn't work for me. Her objectives and evil side were never clear enough.That was the hardest thing to accept: what did Bane/Miranda want? The original league of shadows was an anti-crime terrorist group. The goal was simply to destroy Gothom almost Punisher style. The Joker was an agent of chaos. His only goal was mayhem and destruction. Where did Bane/Miranda fit? They almost wanted them to be both, but it made no sense. What did they seek in letting Gothom exist for those 5 months? Was it a suicide mission? They never planned to escape the bomb. Why did they want to die with the city? Overall I really liked it, but it could have been better. The size and scope of these films was truly epic, but it overwhelmed the characters in the end. Batman almost struggled to find his place within this film.",8,1,2,28 July 2012
Rear Window," Hated the ending
","****MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS**** This movie could have been about a 9 but they built it all up to the most stupid and predictable ending ever!Where was the twist? What was the message? Just because you are paranoid doesn't mean your neighbors aren't trying to kill you...? Really disappointing. Hitchcock had it primed to deliver a powerful ending with Stewart's paranoia either destroying his own life (getting his girlfriend jailed, his best friend fired, and losing his own mind) and/or destroying his neighbor's life for no reason (getting him arrested for murder even though his wife was still alive, or killing him/suicide out of fear).The era this film was made demanded a much more wholesome ending. As a result we were forced to accept that despite all logic and evidence to the contrary, the paranoid crackpot murder theory of a shut-in depressed photographer was dead right from the beginning.This film should be remade with a much more intelligent and thought provoking ending.",7,33,70,31 July 2008
Goodfellas," Most overrated movie ever!
","Maybe I was so disappointed in this movie because I'd already seen the Godfathers and the Sopranos, but this movie couldn't have disappointed me more.I don't even know where to begin. The plot was dull and predictable. I realize it is based on a true story, but it was still boring.For the caliber of actors in it, I wasn't moved by any of the performances.The pace was choppy. The final half hour felt like an entirely different film.Very disappointing mob saga and one of the most overrated film of all time.",1,50,128,14 October 2007
