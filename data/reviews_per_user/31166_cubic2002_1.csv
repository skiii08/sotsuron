Alien 3," Stop comparing with Aliens!
","I cant stand all you ppl out there who immediately start cursing this film, by saying he spoiled it all by killing off Hicks & Newt. So what, does it not make Ripley (when she mourns Newts death) more human on a planet of killers?So its not sentimental, not all sugar coated happy ending, isn't nearly every movie like that? At least the the director had the balls to make that decision. I realise this is not the film that he wanted to end up with, but this film does deserve better than its got.Its got gritty realism, the atmosphere reeks of death, and the thing is as soon as everyone realises what they up against they also know that they are going to their deaths, but somehow we sympathise with killers and rapists.Weaver gives her finest performance in the Alien series, tough and uncomprimising, yet her feelings (love/distress) show much more than in previous films.What did u all want, another blast them up, sugar coated ending? Variety is the spice of life, and i think anyone who dislikes this film does not really understand the concpt of the fear that the Alien brings, did anyone feel tense or slightly jumpy in Aliens? Stop comparing and take them as individual films.",6,1,5,29 December 2003
