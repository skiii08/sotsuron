Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good, but few will be happy with this Sequel
","I think that many fans of Kill Bill vol.1 will be disappointed, as vol.2; though its a good film does not display the originality of story telling techniques, which the first film did so creatively. My prediction is that fans of QT films will enjoy vol.2 the most, but for the average cinema viewer they will feel as though there are not enough action sequences. Me as a huge fan of QT and Kill Bill vol.1 was disappointed in the lack of 'that something special' which defines his other films, however throughout the film I was steadily entertained. My favourite part of the film was the wedding scene at the start and fight with Elle (Daryl Hannah). My worst parts Bill's death  and Budd and Bill being brothers seemed pointless. Great ideas: when we find out her name and a clip shows her in class. Referring to the movie adverts at the start. Score 7/10",7,0,1,23 April 2004
