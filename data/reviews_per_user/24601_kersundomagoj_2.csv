Scarface," Best gangster movie ever!
","The movie is about a guy called Tony Montana and hes rise and fall in drug business.Al Pacino is stunning in the role of Tony Montana and he is so good that he actually makes you cheer for a guy who would kill you without a doubt if you cross him over. Also, Al Pacino made Tony Montana in one of the most iconic if not THE most iconic mobsters in movie industry.Little about Tony Montana and hes personality.Tony is a ruthless man who will do anything to raise to the power. He is cunning and he will rather do hes business alone then hire somebody to do hes dirty work. Tony also has over-protective relationship with hes sister Gina. Tony's best friend is a guy called Manny and later he is married to a women named Elvira. It is hard to believe but Tony has some morale in him. He does not kill women and children.My favorite scene in the movie is the dinner scene (say good night to the bad guy scene).This scene perfectly shows Tonys fall. Hes wife Elvira hates him, she can't giving him a child because Tonys life made her in a addict, hes days are becoming more and more the same, he lives in the mansion who is more of a prison then home, he is becoming more and more paranoid, etc... Elvira said it perfectly 'Can't you see... what we're becoming, Tony? We're losers. We're not winners.'.The movie ends with Tony being killed and he falls in the pool and above that pool is a replica of the World and on that replica it says 'the World is yours' showing the irony of hes life IMO.The acting from the whole cast is awesome. Atmosphere of the movie is phenomenal.IMO best gangsta movie ever. 10 out of 10!p.s. Scarface is actually a remake of the movie from 1932, called Scarface.",10,1,2,13 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Just another overrated hero movie!
","As the title of my review says Wonder Women is just another overrated hero movie. Wonder Women follows the same line of story as any other hero movie. You have a hero A who fights the villain A because villain A wants to bring chaos, agony or what not to the World and with that formula of to conveyor belt to produce million hero movies per year so Hollywood can make money from mediocrity and low intelligence of the viewers.Side note...I did not pay any money to watch this movie. I do not support crap.Acting is nothing special, last battle is the definition of clich√©, plot twist is lame, in some scenes they are trying to be funny but they are failing, it is full of PG-13 crap so no blood, bad language or any sign of maturity that can attract smart movie viewers, etc...Plot twist is that they are presenting some German Officer to be the bad guy and it is then discovered the true bad guy is some dude who was helping them all the way and OFC he wants to bring chaos because he is a 'badass' bad guy, wow, omg! Plus it is predictable as hell.Another plot twist is that Amazons are saying Zeus left them a weapon to fight a bad guy. It is supposedly a sword but from start you know that is Wonder Women and not some rusty sword or whatever, wow, omg again. Here I raise another question. So if Wonder Women was the only one who could defeat the bad guy so at the start of the movie why did her mother object about her training? They know the bad guy is alive and will return so why refuse to train the only weapon they have against the bad guy? Awesome writing I guess...#SarcasmOverall Wonder Women is really one bad movie like any other hero movie. Today hero movies don't offer anything special in the term of story and they only switch names of the heroes and bad guys like I said at the start of the review. They produce what I will say a cancer genre to movie industry. Hero movies are destroying the movie industry with their dumb ideas and lame stories.2 out of 10 only because Gal is beautiful women but mediocre actor.",2,5,12,12 November 2017
