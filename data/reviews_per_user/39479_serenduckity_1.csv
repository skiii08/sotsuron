Miracle," You ain't seen nothing yet!
","Kurt Russel as Herb Brooks is awesome, the whole movie is great, and the cast of young unknowns is also wonderful. This movie holds a special place where as my Girls Water Polo Team went to see it on the eve of one of our biggest games, our C.I.F championship, and immediately fell in love with the story. The part that was most closes to home was the relationship between the coach and his team. The coach was a real jerk, and worked his team till they could not take anymore. And the scene where he made them stay after the game that they lost to Norway, and had them do sprints felt like watching someone die... But it held true in our hearts when it wasn't that common for our coach to end our tough practices with sprints, only to watch each of us break down. But in the end both our teams were victorious, especially when everyone doubted us, and at times we did too.",Null,0,0,17 April 2004
