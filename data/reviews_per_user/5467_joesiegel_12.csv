Hereditary," Ari Aster is definitely one of the most promising names of his generation.
","Maybe you just are not understanding it, it may sound pretentious but Ari Aster's Hereditary is a story that is told metaphorically beyond the literally, I had to read about this film to receive details that I could not capture before, the film would not leave indifferent to nobody, breaks with the conventions of the genre and shows something totally different from the current horror movies, this film must be seen with an open mind to interpretations of all kinds to various scenes and history as such.A great achievement of the movie is to avoid all kinds of cliches from current horror movies as religious symbols like back crossings or five-point stars, bible verses or priests, Hereditary creates his own totally different symbol world.First-time director Ari Aster plays with the camera and refuses to make a film with conventional shots, preferring to have subjective and risky shots that show the situation of the characters and surreal and dreamlike scenes that explore the mentality of the characters that goes in decline with the passage of the film.Like 'The Exorcist' this film has great skeptical potential, fear and doubt to believe what is happening, in 'The Exorcist' the priest covers himself diagnosing possible mental illness from the girl's attacks, in this film We are told that throughout family history there has been an endless number of mental illnesses that have terrified the family, this makes us doubt everything we are seeing. Can everything be the product of Annie's damaged mind? and his children begin to suffer the consequences, the end of the film is ambiguous and does not answer this question.As in 'The Exorcist' Peter's character jumps out the window as the priest did at the end, Peter dies and Paimon enters In his body, the latest revelations of the cult that was staying in the tree house suggests that Peter is no longer there, Paimon has possessed him, all these pieces fit perfectly at the end of the film, as because Joannie and Annie's mom knew each other from before and what was their relationship, or the reason for the grandmother's irrational affection towards Charlie and because she always preferred a boy, the grandmother only wanted a male body so that Paimon could inhabit it.Hereditary easily scrolls through so many genres, from a family drama to a terrifying tale of human insanity, Ari Aster is definitely one of the most promising names of his generation.",9,2,2,13 March 2020
The Irishman," A mafia movie that takes the time to talk about different topics in life
","Martin Scorsese grew up making gangster movies, for over 40 years he became the mainstay of modern gangster movies, along with Coppola marked a before and after in the genre, Scorsese immortalized gangster movies with Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino, films full of moral dilemmas, corrupt and proud characters and the typical final act of the film of the descent into misery. The Irishman brings all these elements together in a more existentialist and reflective way, despite being a movie about the mafia it feels more two-dimensional than most crime movies, especially because it is a very personal story told by Scorsese himself, unlike most mafia movies, The Irishman takes time to reflect on the passage of time, repentance, devotion, loyalty, and oblivion, all these doubts drown Scorsese and the main actors of the film who they have reached old age and are reflecting on their own lives.The Irishman has all the features of the Scorsese cinema, long shots, sharp and precise dialogues and dynamic camera movements, every time there is a shooting Scorsese manages to make it look more stylized than the previous one, we all know that the scenes of the Scorsese movies where the violence overflows are excellent, except for the scene of Frank kicking a man in the wax, De Niro's performance is quite disappointing considering that he is a 78-year-old man playing someone in his thirties. Like any Scorsese film, the story is marked by one betrayal after another, the mafia world is not the best to trust other people, loyalty is ephemeral, except that of Russel and Frank that is maintained until the end, when someone makes mistakes the mafia has no other solution than death, Frank was on the verge of making mistakes on multiple occasions but Russel was always there to rescue him as a sign of his true loyalty.The Irishman has an unconventional epilogue for the Scorsese films, we are used to seeing a spiral descent by the characters into madness or misery, or in both directions as is the case with Goodfellas. The Irishman for his part presents a reflective, emotional, sad and cold epilogue, Frank is alone in an old age telling us his story but continues to remain faithful to his ideals, this is demonstrated when he prefers not to tell the police about Jimmy Hoffa even after that all the mafia he knew is dead, that is his loyalty to his religion, the mafia.There are several peculiar scenes in this epilogue filled with a strong emotional charge, the ending leaves a strange feeling of mixed feelings, nostalgia, euphoria or confusion, but above all satisfied when seeing a film that refreshes the current cinema as only Scorsese could have done.",9,11,16,1 April 2020
About Time," A time travel movie without the fun of time travel
","When I watch time travel movies I hope to be stuck in a story full of paradoxes and that it is difficult to rationally follow the film due to the constant change of time flow, About Time by Richard Curtis is a time travel movie, but the conductive thread of the story is the romance between two young Britons, Tim fulfills his whims thanks to his ability to travel through time by locking himself in a closet and closing his fists as if he were going to hit someone, on one occasion Doc Brown said that if they were going to travel in time they would do it in style, traveling in a Delorean, obviously About Time is not very interested in the science that time travel, temporary fluctuations or paradoxes entail, the most serious thing that caused Time travel in Tim was that his children to change genetically. I was waiting for the moment when the film reached another level of depth, however it always remains on the same level, in fact I realized that one of the big problems of the movie are the female characters, Mary looks like a blank board, no It is a character that undergoes major changes throughout the film, it is a device of the script but it does not work like a real character, the same goes for Tim's mother, however Tim's sister is a very well explored character and she It gives the necessary dramatic touch that the film lacked so much.At the end of the movie Tim says goodbye to his father, but can really continue to visit him without breaking the rules, Tim's father tells him specifically that he cannot travel before the baby is conceived , so if he travels during pregnancy he would not pass nothing, I'm probably wrong with this, but it is undeniable that at the beginning of the movie it is clear that it is impossible to return to the present once you have returned to the past, however this law is constantly breaking in the film without any reason.",7,0,1,17 February 2020
Burn After Reading," Style of Coens at its best
","The Coen brothers are one of the best comedy writers in the cinema today, this film has all the components of its history; characters that are complete idiots and losers whose lives are altered as a result of a crime, Burn After Reading seems to be a silly film at first sight but it is not, in fact it has a very intelligent and well thought out story that works like a satire of American adult society, the film presents complex and deep characters very well written with the characteristic seal of the Coen.The hilarious performance of Brad Pitt and his character is one of the best things about the movie, by the time Pitt made this movie he was over 40 years old, however here he looks like a twenty-year-old gym instructor in very good shape, the character of JK Simmons, although it almost does not appear, is one of those powerful characters that the Coen put in their movies for a short time but their weight in the plot is surprising, every word they say leaves their mark.The violence in this film is not stylized or aesthetic, there is a half-way murder that is depicted as dry as it should be and something very common in the Coen films, the film's comedy is limited to physical comedy and witty dialogues, this is probably the weakest work of the Coen brothers so far, but even a lazy Coen movie ends up being interesting and not disappointing at all.",7,1,3,21 February 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," An sharp and clever comedy satire
","Little Miss Sunshine manages to balance comedy, drama and satire in an incredible way, all that balance gives rise to a high-level dark comedy, which manages to talk about many themes that define american culture, it is a film with uncomfortable comic situations, is a sharp and dangerous comedy, but incredibly smart.This movie plays with the premise of the dysfunctional family, a premise that has been exploited to the point of exhaustion in Hollywood, but let's remember that what matters is the way you tell the story, Little Miss Sunshine is original and raw, unlike other movies about dysfunctional families this movie gives a different portrait of what we already know as the basic american family, each of its members is at the same level of depth and personal conflict, they face suicide, obsession, failure, to despair, frustration and death, throughout the film each of them deals with their own fights but by the end of the story, they are fighting as a family, it doesn't matter if you don't have a good relationship with your family this movie is probably not going to fix it but it is a lovely portrait of family ties.Like any good satire, you can notice the social comment that the film makes on different topics, whether it is from the hypocrisy of society and the bad education that is given to children in a quite stressful scene in which little Olive is shown Under the pressure of deciding between her beauty or enjoying his ice cream, this enters a different context when we analyze that Olive is a 6-year-old girl in full development of learning.This movie feels like a real journey, a journey through American culture and finds a way to satirize it all, beneath the laughter hides a charming depth.",8,0,0,17 March 2020
Being John Malkovich," We are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.
","This is the kind of movies that I have been looking for all my life, a metaphysical, surreal and philosophical journey that explores different issues of human nature, this film has docile dyes of comedy, but has all the potential of being a dark and grotesque thriller, nevertheless that is what gives the touch of originality to this film released in 1999, that year all the films wanted to look like Seven, the theaters were mined of dark thrillers, both good and ridiculous, Being John Malkovich does not need to be dark and Grotesque to talk about complex and deep issues.The story is so difficult to explain with words that I'm going to skip that part of the reviews and go straight to the point, Being John Malkovich is about of people's desire to be someone else, the feeling of not feeling comfortable with them himself and this film portrays a society that does not feel comfortable in their bodies, a society in search of satisfaction that cannot be achieved by being themselves, people who need attention, most of us want to be a movie star or at least live a life so.The central issue of the film is the loss of identity of people, we realize in a moment of the film that there is a long line of people wanting to be John Malkovich, wanting to forget who they are for 15 minutes, but that does not mean That is the only thing that this movie is about, since it is a gallery of topics related to the human mind, there is even a chimpanzee that takes its own identity and even seems to be aware, Craig in an early scene of the movie he say that animals don't have conscience, this is one of the dialogues of the movie that caught me the most.Curiously Maxime is the only character that does not enter the head of John Malkovich, she does not want to be John Malkovich, it is because she is the strongest and controlling character in history, all who enter John Malkovich end up losing their minds, Maxime He only takes advantage of the characters throughout the story, even at the end when he confesses to Lotte that the son he expects is from her, a certain tone of manipulation can be noticed in her, perhaps she lied only to get away with it.Being John Malkovich is a story with the most notable features of Charlie Kaufman; Depressive characters and an existentialist vision of the world, we are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.",10,4,5,23 February 2020
Gone Girl," Fincher's weakest movie
","Gone Girl compared to the rest of thrillers created by the hand of David Fincher, is an uneven comparison, Gone Girl as the story progresses does not have the same captivating rhythm of Fincher films and revelations throughout history are not as consistent and surprising as its other thrillers that are made up of amazing revelations after revelation.The story really is not so difficult to follow or understand, it is not a story so twisted to have to see several times to understand if you are attentive, as is the case with Fight Club.Some internal logical failures of the script make the movie lose a bit of strength and emotion, however here are all the resources used by Fincher in his other films and that is why I like it so much, the atmosphere of the film is mostly uncomfortable, dark and captivating, like every good Fincher movie has a unique style full of neo noir cinema inspirations, such as Brian dePalma, Paul Verhoveen and the most obvious Alfred Hitchcock.The climax of the film is the most unsatisfactory of the thrillers that David Fincher has made, constantly the endings of his film are surprising and suffocating, although the end of Gone Girl works, it extends so much that it seems stupid and loses strength, the last 10 minutes of the movie are an explanation of everything that has made us understand the movie, it's as if at the end of Fight Club they had interviews with Marla and The Narrator.Gone Girl is suffocating most of the time, intelligent both to develop her story and to give a different and uncomfortable portrait of marriage, the best thing about this movie is that there is no hero, all the characters here are morally wrong, an essential characteristic of the thrillers.",8,0,0,1 March 2020
Mission: Impossible," dePalma save this movie, not Tom Cruise
","Most user reviews say that Tom Cruise saved the movie, however I think Brian dePalma is the one who deserves all the credit, the style of the filmmaker makes this movie does not fall into cliches of action movies, there are some that other scenes full of cliches of spy movies like the initial scene but technically no movie of this genre has such a good direction as this movie, dePalma creates sequences that remind the thriller master Hitchcock, and thanks to this the movie has some scenes that overflow the suspense and intrigue, but as I said before it is thanks to the skills of dePalma and his stimulation of our perception with dynamic shots that disturb our senses.The story is difficult to follow with the naked eye, however the more you think it is the less complicated it is, I guess I only have to see it one more time to get some details to overlook. The film's title is true to its history, totally impossible, 100% of the action scenes are impossible to perform in reality, I read in the book by Robert McKee about the script that all films must comply with the rules of their own established universe, this movie is set in a universe where these things are possible so I don't see any problem there, the biggest problem of the movie is that the scenes of the movie without action are empty, there is no interesting story to tell and it seems impatient to jump to the next sequence of action so that the film entertains us again.",7,3,6,26 January 2020
When Harry Met Sally...," A portrait of the problems of adult love relationships
","Probably the question that approaches this film with the naked eye is can men and women be friends without a sexual attraction involved? However, this film addresses a couple of other questions that I have realized are going unnoticed in the reviews of most people, this movie also talks about the gap between love and friendship, how easy it is to pass from one point to another without knowing it, Harry and Sally probably knew that they were in love from the beginning but refused to accept it and here another interesting subplot opens that addresses another question, or rather the issue of unrequited love affairs.WHMS is an open book on problems of adult life related to love and portrays how women and men face it in different ways, this film, like most, states that men do not pay much attention to this and spend their days having forced relationships without any connection or compassion, just thinking about pleasure, while women cry and suffer thinking about loneliness, it is probably a real portrait, however when Harry discovers that he loves Sally he begins to face these problems more mature way and begins to imagine a life without Sally, Harry goes into shock and runs to look for Sally, this is the moment when Harry really matures, in an early scene Harry tells Jess that he is maturing because now he can having a friendship with a woman without sex in between, however, this is when he discovers that the true way to mature is to have a woman and love her without the sex in between, and this is exactly what he feels for Sally.This movie is a gallery of deep and well-written characters and each one with its well-detailed personality, occasionally Sally's character took a different direction from the original configuration of the script but these problems were only momentary so it practically does not spoil at all the experience and history that apart from talking about sexuality and adult romantic relationships presents other problems of age such as fear of loneliness and becomes the main cause of depression for many people.WHMS also presents a a different portrait of relationships and love, with an existentialist and depressing tone in the style of Woody Allen, full of interesting dialogues that also has many similarities with the epigramatic and sharp dialogues of Woody Allen that evoke extensive discussions on seemingly banal themes.",8,3,3,13 February 2020
Parasite," It's so metaphorical
","'It's so metaphorical' is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that 'It's so metaphorical' obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.'It's so metaphorical' This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.",9,80,138,30 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," The reason why the public is loving this movie is the same reason that the critics are hating it
","The critics were very hypersensitive and had a very closed mind when reviewing this movie.JoJo Rabbit is a satirical vision of the Second World War, when dealing with an issue like this in a satirical way you have to be very careful not to seem so insensitive, Waititi uses the necessary touch of satira and social issues to create a kind of criticizes to the neo-nazist movements and the use of the naivety of children to take him to political issues, Waititi knew how to get there and does not explore the theme of nazism in a deep and somber way, however the movie gives a heartbraking scene whose protagonist is the feet of Scarlett Johansson, incredibly Waititi created an emotional scene involving feet better than Tarantino.The film has a scene that involves the Nazi greeting that makes us laugh intelligently, that scene more than a criticism is a mockery, That no neo-nazi see this! Sincerely Waititi had never convinced me, however JoJo Rabbit is his best work Until now, Waititi cinema is full of satirical comedy and this film is its best and boldest demonstration, a sentimental story about the hate instilled in children irrationally, JoJo is a boy with little mind of his own and everything he knows It is practically things that his imaginary friend has put in his brain that turns out to be a child representation of Hitler, but it is obvious that this representation of Hitler is like that since it is the product of a child's mind and this reinforces more the naivety and JoJo's good heart.",8,3,3,18 February 2020
The Social Network," As complex as a David Fincher movie can be, and probably the movie that defined this decade.
","When this movie ends tells us that Facebook has 500 million users, this was the figure in 2010, 10 years later this figure was tripled and now there are more than 2 billion people registered in this social network, it can be said that this film talks about the theme that defined this decade of 10s 'social networks' although its height began in the 2000s, it is obvious that its frenetic growth happened during this decade, it could also be said that The Social Network defined the decade, as Fight Club defined the decade of the 90s, touching issues of importance and relevance of the time, both making an accurate and deep portrait of their respective generations.David Fincher creates a film as intelligent and cold as his main character, although the story can be reliable and not yet, since Mark Zuckerberg himself has said that the most accurate of this film is the use of his character's clothes , the other characters in the story and even Sorkin and Fincher indicate otherwise, The Social Network is not a documentary, it can be taken as a work of fiction that recreates a situation of betrayals and pure frivolity, does not give us information that we should take as totally correct since it has a certain tone of the famous Rashomon effect; which is that several people testify to a fact until the original version is so eclipsed that it is impossible to find a truth among so many points of view.This movie is undermined by pure irony; Harvard's least associative boy with no knowledge about human relationships creates the greatest source of communication between people today, and the film ends with the creator of Facebook himself waiting that his friend's request to be answered. The direction of Fincher and the script of Sorkin make this film look like a thriller, a dark thriller, when in one of its many layers it is a film about envy and teenage immaturity, one of the greatest qualities of the films of Fincher is that they are very complex, and can cover as many topics as they want.The Social Network with Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac joins the list of masterpieces created by the hand of David Fincher, one of the artists more prolific of the seventh art.Although I almost never talk about such repetitive themes as the interpretations in my reviews, since it is obvious when the performances are good and not, and most of the reviews say the same about that, but this time the young actors who keep this movie afloat deserve a line of recognition or more.",10,6,8,27 January 2020
