The Avengers," The Best Superhero Movie of All Time
","The theatre in the town where I live isn't exactly pleasant, so I decided to wait until the Avengers came out on DVD to buy it. Now, understand, I am a huge Marvel fan - I've seen all the 'Avengers preludes', I've read comics, I've watched cartoons, I had the action figures as a kid. This movie meant a ton to me, and I was hoping it would be great. And as I pressed play, and the villain, Loki, appeared, I knew I was in for an event.The Avengers exceeded my expectations by far, cementing it as one of my favourite movies of all time instantly. You could say that I'm shallow - that the Avengers is nothing more than a CG extravaganza that pales against the likes of the Dark Knight. But you're wrong.The Avengers has a heart that other superhero movies, or, even, other movies don't. It's funnier than most comedies I've seen. It succeeds in not taking itself so deathly seriously that it loses what makes a superhero movie a superhero movie - it relishes the implausibility of what's happening. At the same time, however, it's technically fantastic. It's well-acted. The characters are well-fleshed out, likable, and receive a lot of development, and Joss Whedon expertly juggles every single hero Marvel threw at him. Everyone feels like they belong on the team, even Black Widow - who I was worried was going to be 'the female character', ended up being a standout in the movie. The dialogue is fantastic, and I was very impressed with the pace. Even when the team was on the Helicarrier for quite a while, I was completely engrossed.At one point, I 'stepped back' from the extreme battle going on, and I realized that I was smiling during the entire movie up until then.Absolutely fantastic. 10/10.",10,3,8,30 September 2012
The Incredible Hulk," It was good, but...
","...that was it. These days, with so many superhero movies coming out, you gotta make your movie stand out. And The Incredible Hulk really didn't stand out for me - there were certain moments that did, for sure, but the movie as a whole was kind of bland.Edward Norton as Bruce Banner - great choice. His physique, especially, made him a great pick - Ed Norton's a skinny guy, and, compared to the Hulk, it makes the transformation even more grave. Liv Tyler didn't stand out to me, either (at least she didn't annoy me) - neither did Tim Blake Nelson, or William Hurt. Tim Roth was cool, though.There were certain elements that I really liked about The Incredible Hulk - mainly when Bruce Banner is just Bruce Banner. I honestly wasn't interested in the parts where he Hulks out. I don't know why - I was just so enveloped in his search for a cure that I just got bored of the action scenes and wanted them to be over.Overall, I cared more about the guy way more than the Hulk, and I think that's where this movie failed - it didn't strike a balance. It's worth checking out, though.",8,0,1,20 July 2012
Spider-Man," Spider-Fun
","I'm gonna say it right here, I'm a HUGE Spider-Man fan. He's my favourite superhero of all time. So, being such a big fan, I, of course, had to watch the movie adaption. Surprisingly, I didn't actually see it in theatres - I wasn't old enough at the time, or maybe my parents just didn't take me to go see it. Who knows.So, finally watching it, I gotta say...it is SO an early 2000s movie. There's this one scene, where it's just a shot of Spidey (played by Tobey Maguire, which was an interesting choice) from just a bit below his shoulders and up. He's against a bright New York Cityscape sunset. And he raises his hand and does the websling motion......and it looked so BAD I burst out laughing. You know, that laugh where you feel kinda bad for laughing? Yeah? That one. It looked SO dated, it was humorous. Most of the other special effects were pretty decent, if nothing special.This is a fun superhero movie. It's nothing more than that, to be honest. And it did have some problems with it. First off, the dialogue between Spidey and his big villain, Green Goblin (played by Willem Dafoe) was just so cheesy and forced. There's a part where Green Goblin sings 'Itsy Bitsy Spider'. I'm serious.My second problem with it is that so much about Spidey was changed in the movie. Looking back, now knowing more about Spidey than ever, I see so many problems. First off, where's Gwen Stacy? Part of me just thinks the writer was scared to kill her off, so she wasn't put in. Oh well. Secondly, Spider-Man's webslingers. Or, rather, his lack-there-of. Spider-Man NEEDS his webslingers - it's an integral part of his character, showing the intelligence of Peter Parker. That's a big problem in this movie - Spider-Man doesn't seem smart, at all. This continues into the other films, so be warned.I thought the suit was fine, but the white webbing as opposed to the black was kind of strange. Come to think of it, what else is Red, White, and Blue? A flag...of a country...a very powerful country...That's right! France! Subliminal messaging, people. Subliminal messaging.Anyways, if you like Spider-Man, be sure to check this out. It's great fun.",8,0,1,20 July 2012
Drive," Amazing.
","Drive is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. A lot of times, I call movies...well, movies. I'd hate to sound pretentious, but Drive really deserves to be called a 'film'. Why, you my ask?Because it's insanely good, that's why.I think this film very much benefited from not being complicated - at its core, it's a very simple (although EXTREMELY violent, if you don't like violence in your movies, you're probably gonna be freaked out) story. Our Driver (played by the fantastic Ryan Gosling), does getaway driving for criminals and is also a stunt driver during the day. He meets Irene (played by Carey Mulligan, who did a fantastic job) and her kid, and a love story begins. However, there are...complications.This film definitely trades in quantity (in this case, story lines), for definite and total quality. The soundtrack of this movie is just fantastic. It's very retro, which gives this film a very 80s vibe. The cinematography is just absolutely gorgeous. Every single shot was perfectly framed. The views of the city were stunning, and the shots of Ryan Gosling just driving around L.A. Something this film did that was very, very well was the different set pieces. It really paid attention to the character's personalities. Driver's apartment is very sparse, and it doesn't look very lived in at all. Irene's apartment is full of life, with lots of paintings and little details. The movie has very little dialogue, but I was just so entranced by it. It felt very natural - nobody ever said anything very witty. There were no one-liners. The dialogue felt very real.The action scenes are quick and brutal, which is something I appreciated. The director didn't make any of them go on for any longer than they needed to - nothing seemed very 'this is a movie, we need to entertain our viewers with violence' about it. It was violent because it was needed for the story.Overall, I definitely recommend Drive. It's great.",8,2,6,19 July 2012
The Dark Knight," Certainly Dark
","Oh, jeez, I'm quite late, aren't I? Okay.I recently reviewed 'The Avengers', so I'd say it's time to review the other movie commonly regarded as 'the best superhero movie ever'. It's been praised to Kingdom Come, it's a phenomenon. And what do I think?It's not.Christopher Nolan is a good director. There's no denying that - Inception was fantastic. Technically, this film is fantastic. Heath Ledger (R.I.P) delivers an extremely haunting performance as the Joker, practically redefining the definition of a good villain. Aaron Eckhart, as well, stands out for his portrayal of Harvey Dent. Michael Caine is, of course, awesome and Morgan Freeman certainly isn't too shabby either. Christian Bale's a great Bruce Wayne and a pretty darn good Batman for what he was given to work with. The effects are pretty good as well, particularly when Joker blows up the hospital. Cinematography is good, and the score is actually great.So, where did this movie fall apart for me? I'll break it down:1) The pacing. This movie is very long - about 2 and a half hours. I don't have a problem with long movies, but the movie really started to feel more like the last stretch of a marathon rather than entertainment.2) The writing. Okay, this is a big one. People praise this movie as perfect, but I think they're overlooking some major plot holes. How did Batman and Rachel survive after they fell at least 30 stories and landed on a taxi? What happened to Joker after he got into Wayne's penthouse? The first one is just weird, but second one is a major point that's never addressed in the movie.3) Rachel Dawes. She's extremely unlikable, boring, and enforces a huge misstep in most works of fiction: she dies so that the male hero can have something to fight for. It's terrible, but I felt nothing when she died.4) Joker. I mean absolutely no disrespect to Heath Ledger's memory when I say this. In fact, it saddens me to it. I've had 4 years to reflect on what Christopher Nolan's Joker is, and I've come to the conclusion that he just feels like someone who dresses up LIKE the Joker and infuses his own philosophies into it. He's not funny, he's just extremely terrifying. Nolan made a huge misstep with this character.5) The tone. This movie is dark. It's violent. And it's overtly so. Some say it's to reinforce how 'realistic' this Batman's world is supposed to be - I say it's a 14-year-old's idea of what mature is. And a lot of the time, it misses the mark on what a superhero movie is supposed to be - entertaining. The Dark Knight forgoes this and becomes a philosophical cop drama that takes itself too seriously.In conclusion, this is a technically excellent movie hampered by plot holes, an overtly dark tone, and other flaws.",7,1,4,30 September 2012
Thor," God-darn fun
","Thor's a great example of a superhero movie - good acting, good action, and all around good fun. I very much enjoyed Thor, and it's my second-favourite 'Avengers prelude' movie (the first being Iron Man).Despite being a prelude, however, I think Thor stands on its own with the likes of Spider-Man and Batman Begins. The special effects in this movie are very good, and I really enjoyed seeing Asgard and the Frost Giant world, because they were beautifully created. I thought the lore behind Asgard was all very well done and I was really interested in it.The action was well-directed, and it really made Thor seem as though he was a powerful warrior. Speaking of Thor, I thought Chris Hemsworth did a great job with his portrayal, as did the other actors and actresses. Tom Hiddleston, especially, stood out as Thor's brother, Loki.I did have a few minor problems with Thor, which deterred me from giving it a 9/10, and it mainly had to do with the supporting characters. Kat Dennings's character, Darcy Lewis, (who, of course was funny), I felt was pretty much unneeded. It's not like I didn't like her, it just seemed like she was there because of comic relief. Basically, if she was left out of the movie, I don't think it would've been any worse (or better).Also, I wanted to see more of Thor's friends - the Warrior's Three and Sif. I thought they were really interesting - overall, I wanted to see more of Asgard in general. However, Thor learning how Earth customs work made for some great humour.So, I would definitely recommend Thor.",8,0,1,20 July 2012
X-Men: First Class," Redeemed the X-Men
","X-Men: First Class, to a lot of fans, was gonna either make or break the film series for them after they were disappointed by X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Me, I'm not a big fan of the X-Men, and I never have been.This movie, however, was enough to make me interested. X-Men: First Class is an origin story for the X-Men, obviously, but the internal conflict in it makes it soar above other superhero movies. Charles (played by James McAvoy, who was great) and Erik (played by Michael Fassbender, who is fantastic in everything he's in) are both mutants, leading a team of other mutants - but at the same time, their personal philosophies differ so greatly that it gives a lot of tension to the film.The performances in this film are all great - Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, and Nicholas Hoult all stood out to me especially. The movie has great action and great dialogue as well. However, I thought certain moments were rushed, leading to some either awkward moments or really abrupt ones.Overall, definitely see X-Men: First Class! I give it a 9.",8,1,1,20 July 2012
Casino Royale," I developed a BOND with this movie
","Okay, that was bad. This movie, however, was most definitely not! I'm saying this as a guy who had never seen a Bond film before - sue me. I knew who the guy was though - who didn't? I went into this movie expecting a pretty good spy film......And finished in awe of what it had done. Okay, first off, let's talk about Daniel Craig. First thing I said when I was told Daniel Craig was in this film? 'Who's Daniel Craig?' Nevertheless, he was fantastic in this film. Eva Green, as well, was very good (I had never heard of her), as was most of the cast. Mads Mikkelsen...funny name, great actor.The best thing about this film, in my opinion, is the TENSION. Every single poker match, I was on the edge of my seat. If I had a knife...well, I wouldn't want to cut my TV, so I wouldn't try to cut the tension, but you now what I mean. I COULD if I wanted to. The action scenes were also very well done.I thought it was a great film, but I did have some minor issues that kept me from giving it a 10/10. I thought the pacing was strange - it was very good pacing, the film went along at a good pace. However, it was just a little odd, and I questioned the needs for certain scenes. I also thought a few certain moments happened a bit too fast and abruptly, but perhaps that was the style of this film.However, definitely go see it - not if you like action films, or if you like Bond films, but if you like movies in general! It's great.",9,2,4,19 July 2012
