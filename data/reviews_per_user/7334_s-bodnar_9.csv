Casablanca," very good
","In my opinion this was a very well made film. Although I was not much intrigued with the plot following Rick Blaine and his attempts to help a former lover escape pre world war two Europe, I still found that other aspects of the film outweighed this shortcoming. The photography and cinematography are outstanding, especially during shots within Rick's Café. During these scenes, the use of contrast, hard, and soft lighting along with the visual effect of shadows stands out to the viewer. The director also creates a sense of realism within the café. The acting is also notable, especially that of Humphrey Bogart who plays the lead role of Rick. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested older films, despite the weak plot, the quality of movie making shines through.",Null,1,2,9 May 2014
Citizen Kane," different but good
","This was a very interesting film. The story looks into past life of a wealthy newspaper publisher Charles Kane, and reveals the story of his success and downfall. While the film does seem to drag on occasionally, I never found myself separated from the overall experience of the film. However, this effects was somewhat intended by the director Orson Welles, who purposely filmed many long and uneventful takes. In my opinion, the choice to include long takes makes the film more believable and highlights the actor's skill. In this case, the lead role of Kane is played by Welles himself, which goes to show off the talent of the filmmaker. This film may not be for everyone, but for those who can enjoy the slow pace will be delighted by Welle's effective film making.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Taxi Driver," great movie
","Taxi Driver This is an excellent movie. It is a great example of New Hollywood and the era of counter culture it is connected to. Robert De Niro does a fantastic job at playing the vigilante fed up with society and what it has come to. His acting is extremely convincing throughout the film, and helps add to the overall rebellious atmosphere of the work. The photography in the film is also notable, making use of interesting camera angles and positions. The music featured in the film was also popular during the time period being portrayed. The film also revolves around counter culture subject matter such as prostitution, vigilantism, and radical ideology. I would recommend this film to just about anyone. Scorsese's work is bold, unique, and clever.",Null,0,0,9 May 2014
Apocalypse Now," fantastic
","This is an excellent look at the Vietnam War by Francis Ford Copolla. While this work demonstrates great content and form, it is also a window into history, as it accurately portrays the setting and actions performed during this war. The story follows Benjamin Willard into the depths of Vietnam as he searches for a colonel who has apparently gone insane. The lighting is notable in this film as Copolla makes effective use of contrast, hard, and soft lighting. The music featured in the film was also popular during the time of the films events, which adds to a more authentic quality. My favorite aspect of the film was Marlon Brando's acting as Colonel Kurtz. The viewer not only gets to witness the man's insanity, but also his intelligence and leadership skills. I would recommend Copolla's film to anyone interested in war films or Marlon Brando.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
The Graduate," great movie
","The Graduate is an interesting film in that it is a great example of a New Hollywood film. The plot follows a young man who is seduced by an older acquaintance, and then falls in love with the woman's daughter. The film is dramatic, comical, and even a bit suspenseful near its resolution. Dustin Hoffman does a great job acting as a college graduate, who is relatable and down to earth. The film also effectively keeps the viewer engaged. There were few moments when I found the acting or plot to be lackluster. The Graduate is definitely worth checking out. The acting, content, and form are all presented at a high level.",Null,1,1,9 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," excellent musical
","I highly enjoyed this film.Gene Kelly does an amazing job directing and choreographing the musical scenes of the film, which are interwoven into the plot of the film.In my opinion, the plot is not the focus of the film.The musical set pieces are the highlight of the film, which demonstrate the directing and talent of Kelly along with his cast.Each set piece is unique and contain their own musical qualities, along with their relevance to the plot.While this film may not appeal to some, it will definitely spark an interest to anyone who enjoys musicals and just music in general.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," Great Tarantino film
","This was a very unique film. Tarantino's work is told in a series of flashbacks that are not in chronological order, which causes some confusion, but not enough to ruin the experience of the film. The story is interesting in that it follows the 'bad guys', a group of men who work for a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace. The film is also divided into sub parts, which are indicated by a break in the filming. These sub parts tell the individual stories of those who are connected to Wallace and how they connect to one another. The acting throughout the film is also top notch. While Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play the most prominent roles in the film; some of the best acting comes from the side characters in the film such as Uma Thurman. I would highly recommend this film to all movie lovers, as it combines several film elements such as violence and comedy and ties them together in unconventional ways.",Null,0,2,9 May 2014
Psycho," great Hitchcock film
","This movie is definitely a classic. Hitchcock's work is notable for its infusion of horror and mystery and its great form. The story follows a young woman on the run who had recently embezzled a large sum of money from her occupation. When she finally winds up at the vacant Bates Motel, her journey takes an unexpected turn. The film features excellent photography at times, while at others the camera is used to create a claustrophobic and jarring sense. Hitchcock also makes effective use of diagetic and non diagetic sound, particularly during the climax of the film. This is a must see for horror and mystery fans, or to those interested in different genres of film.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Amazing
","I truly love this film. The Wizard of Oz in my opinion is a timeless classic. From the simple yet fantastical plot and setting to the catchy and well done musical sections, this film fully delivers. Dorothy's venture into the land of Oz focuses on the imperfections faced by humans in life, and shows how people are similar in this way and have the ability to unite and search for the answer to their imperfections together. The 'creatures' Dorothy encounter throughout her journey are all diverse and interesting in their own way, yet they are relate-able in a sense that they all seek something in common. The land of Oz itself is also defined, as the viewer is shown the bright and positive settings and locale as well as the dark and malicious. I recommend this film to just about anyone. In my opinion, it is a film that sticks within your mind days after it is watched.",9,3,5,13 March 2014
