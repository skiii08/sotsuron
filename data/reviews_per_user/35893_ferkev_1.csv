Antz," It's Alvy Singer, as a bug.
","Who'd have expected an animated feature about ants that opens with a Woody Allen monologue expressing his ant angst? While kids will love the effects and there may be enough action to keep them awake, this is classic Woody down to his ant character's hand-wringing gestures. Adults will also be happy with the in-jokes supplied by Sylvester Stallone as a friendly Rambo ant, Dan Ackroyd and Jane Curtin as WASPs, and Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken playing their classic villain roles. The plot is a small step above the typical good guy vs. bad guy routine with social commentary that you can actually talk about with your kids afterwards. But remember, if you do bring the kids, this isn't Disney kitsch; it's more for the grown-ups.",Null,1,1,17 September 1998
