The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," errr........what was that?
","Well, as a person who has not quite made up her mind of the franchise yet, i'll let you know how I feel after I get this review out of my system(contains spoilers)So the movie starts off with Lautner running off (shirtless) into the woods after seeing the wedding invitation. My fella, who was sitting beside me, gave me one of them looks as to say 'why did you drag me here'.So after that we finally get to see Bella and the Cullen clan setting up the wedding. Also Edward comes to visit Bella before the wedding to show us a glimpse of his past. Err thank GOD there was actually something vampire related in this movie. Heck, I thought they were faeries the way they all glittered. But we actually see some neck biting and blood in this movie. (Unknown at the time that this was only breaking us in until the end)So the wedding happens, the dress is nice, she looked nice and damn even her woodland wedding was nice. Stewart plays Bella well and no one can say she doesn't. The emotions are there. The feel of the movie was refreshing, different. I know for a fact it won't appeal to everyone. I hated the first movie, thought it was so...clich√© and Bella and Edward scenes were over the top. It's refreshing to see the characters grown up and acting mature. Including Bella. So the honeymoon. Bella's frantic human moments having a breakdown of the underwear Alice packed. It was good. The sex bit was a bit of Edwards back, a headboard of a bed breaking and Bella completely in the clouds. Afterwards my fella turns around and goes, 'is that it?'. Men, I had to remind him of the PG-13 rating. So at this point it seems to go downhill. Bella learns she's pregnant, Edward is determined to get the 'thing' out of her. Bella makes arrangements with Rosalie because she doesn't want to get rid of the baby. By this point my fella was snoring beside me.When the camera's went off Bella and Edward. It's where the film seriously lacked. Even though in the book it tells a few chapters of Jacob, I really wanted it to return to Bella and Edward. The whole fight between the Cullens and werewolves was so pointless (that wasn't in the book)The birth, well it's definitely not a let down. I was worried last year they couldn't do it under a PG-13 rating. It was going to be rubbish and I would be disappointed. No, it's good. The way Bella's back breaks actually made me squirm, Rosalie cutting Bella's body open, the screams. Edwards teeth. Argh! geez, Bella looked awful and hopefully will put 13 year olds off having a kid for a while! One thing I just hated...Why CGI THE BABY! she looked ....strange that's for sure, I was going to let them off with the CGI wolves but the baby just looked...freaky. I get why people are like 'Jacobs a peado' But I think they could have explained that better in the movie where it's not how it sounds or looks.Bella's transformation into a vampire...Can I have one of those injections please? So my verdict, crap when the camera's are off Bella and Edward. Good when they are on. The story is definitely fan appealing, for those who haven't read the books will be horrified and confused. They need to sort out the animation and the CGI freak baby. Go and see it if you're not expecting much.",10,14,33,18 November 2011
