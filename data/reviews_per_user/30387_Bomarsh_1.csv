Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent Movie!
","Anger, sadness, humor, jubilation, this movie hit 'em all for me. One of the few movies I have actually clapped after. It's definitely not a movie to 'monitor' as some people do, pay attention! And don't be late. Like any sound construction project, you need a good foundation and in this movie it is laid in the beginning. The acting performances by all were wonderful, but I give special recognition to both Ben Kingsley and Josh Harnett. I've always enjoyed Mr. Kingsley's work, but I was never blown away by his performances until this one. Wow. I personally feel that this may be Josh Hartnett's best work to date. He shows some real acting maturity and range in this film. If you like movies where you actually have to follow the plot, you'll love this film.",10,0,6,11 April 2006
