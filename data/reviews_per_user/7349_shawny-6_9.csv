The Ring," Very Scary !
","I just watched The Ring. This is the only horror movie that sent chills down my back. There was no person running around with a mssk over his head, no blood, just a very good put together horror movie.The ending will be remembered for a long long time. very freaky.rating 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
Scary Movie 2," Its ok....
","Hi, I just got back from seeing Scary Movie 2. I didn't go into the theatre thinking that it will be better than the first (i read most of the reviews).Scary Movie 2 wasn't as crude as the first one, but it still had its moments. The opening scene was great, they made fun of alot of movies. I lost count 1/2 way through the film.
Its worth checking out. shawn*** out of 5",Null,2,5,4 July 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Its Ok
","I went into T3 thinking it cannot top T2. I was right. Terminator 2 ended off so perfect, why the sequel????I watched T2 again just to refresh my memory. There is no comparison between the two. The Terminator series after the 2nd should've been laid to rest. No wonder Cameron never wanted to do it.The action scenes were impressive, special effects were good, but it still cannot match the 'liquid metal' effect in part 2. it lacked something a movie needs 'storyline' 
but overall it was good eye-candy.rate 7 out of 10",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
Spider-Man," Awesome!
","Hi, i just finished watching Spiderman, and it was awesome. Good story line, great characters, great special effects, awesome fight scenes. Tobey Maquire was pretty good. He makes a good spiderman!!!!!! I can't say anything else, just go and see it.
9 out of 10 rating.

Ocean's Eleven," Very Good!
","Oceans 11 is a very stylish movie. From acting, to wardrobe, to directing skills, its just a great movie. All the characters were delevoped very good. What can i say, its awesome.I like the ending, when all of them are standing in front of the water works. that tells us that if worked together in sequence, in precise timeing and precision, (like that heist) good things will happen.highly recomended. my rating is 9.5 out of 10shawn",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
The Transporter," Not Very Good.
","Hi, I've just finished watching The Transporter.One question. Why would Jason Stathan sign up for this? I know he is capable of much more (e.g. Snatch).The movie was horrible from start to the end. The chinese chick just put the icing on the cake. She was very annoying. Someone or something should've killed her way before. What about plot? You ask, what plot? Exactly. There was no plot. Rating 1 out of 10. wait for PPV.",1,7,9,17 October 2002
Rules of Engagement," Awesome
","Hi. I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie. I seen it last night, i thought it was put together very good, right from start to finish. The battle scenes reminded me a lot of Saving Private Ryan. I thought S. Jackson and Tommy were both at there best, like they always are. I was confused though when the marines would not take out the snipers?????? But its still a worth watching movie.I gave it 9.5 out of 10",Null,0,1,27 April 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Yuck.
",Hello. I will say that Kubrick did make an awesome war picture masterpiece (full metal jacket) and The Shining sure was chilling. But Eyes Wide Shut was boring. I could have turned off the T.V. for 1(one) hour (with VCR still playing) and still not miss a single thing. The movie moved along like it was tied to a cement pole.I guess i expected more from this director.Disappointed movie fan bye,Null,0,1,17 April 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Good Eye Candy !
","Matrix Reloaded is good Eye Candy.I was not impressed with the story line, its getting way to complicated. Why did the Matrix need a Sequel anyways? I thought the 1st one ended off perfectly. But now the writers have bit off more than they can chew. Everything that Morpheous believed in, is a lie or a hoax.The Special Effects were amazing. But its nothing we haven't seen before from the fist movie. Ie. slow motion 360 degrees, bullets coming to a halt.Car chase scene was done very well. fight scenes were great. but i could pick out the fake neo and the real neo. The 2 characters that I really enjoyed was The Twins.
PS. Was that Rap music video really nessessary? And all the smooching between neo and trinity got boring quickly.Rating 7.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,18 May 2003
