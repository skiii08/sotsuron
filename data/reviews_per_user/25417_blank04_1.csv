The King's Speech," Great movie on overcoming difficulties in ones life!
","The King's Speech was a movie about King George the VI and how he came to be king and his struggles along the way. Faced with a life of public speaking, as part of the royal family Bertie, played by Colin Firth, has become an embarrassment to his family and people. He tries many types of treatment, which all fail, until his wife Elizabeth (played by Helena Bonham Carter) finds a therapist she wants him to try. The therapist Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, uses many different tactics to treat his patients, at first Bertie balks at his treatment and leaves. Over time Bertie and Lionel come to become great friends throughout the course of his treatment, the movie shows you that with hard work, and sometimes not using the standard course of treatment, anything is possible.One of the better highlights of the movie is the argument between Lionel and Bertie in the part when Lionel borders on treason when he suggests to Bertie he could be King. Bertie is terrified of becoming King due to his speech issues. He is also very intimidated by his family, shown a couple times throughout the movie, like when he has to confront his brother during his brief rein as King Edward VIII (played by Guy Pearce) and this brother makes fun of his stammer. Shown also when his father, King George V (played by Michael Gambon) is forcing him to give a Christmas letter to their people over the radio which is unable to do with his father there screaming at him to just say the words. Every time he had to give a speech they zoom in on his mouth and the clicking noise, I thought this added a good touch to feeling his frustration in his inability to get out his words. A very good example of his speech issue and excellent sound work by the director was the opening speech with the echoing of his stammer to an entire stadium of people where you can see the pity in each person's face.The film did well in using good costume and props, such as vehicles, housing, etc. to show the time the film took place. The costumes Bertie's mother wore showed great wealth and position, his wife Elizabeth dressed in longer mid-calf length dresses that were common in 1940's. Another period piece about positions in England is The Duchess with Kierra Knightley, she too is watched my many and her actions are what speaks of her character. People didn't approve of her actions both in politics and of course her affair, yet they loved her vibrancy and love of life. Elizabeth in The King's Speech is also very well-liked by the people. She plays her role as a support to her husband, and later the King, quite well.As he works on his speech with Lionel he has no choice but to face the demons that caused his stammer. In the process he learns to have faith in himself and builds a great friendship. Bertie in the end delivers a grand speech and earns the respect of his people and his family.",9,0,0,30 April 2011
