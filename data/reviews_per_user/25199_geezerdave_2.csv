The King's Speech," Couldn't Stop YAWNING!
","The King's Speech' is simply one of the worst films I've ever seen and a sure bet that you'll fall asleep when you watch it! I've never seen worse acting than that of Colin Firth as a wreck of a successor to the throne and especially Geoffrey Rush, the friend, confidant and speech therapist who was nothing but plain boring.There was nothing in this film that was interesting and the music was also boring.But to add insult to injury this nonsense won Oscars.The powers that be in Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves and I often wonder if some things are manipulated into wins or even paid.Nevertheless,nothing exciting or nail biting happened at all in this poor attempt at history and all things considered it was a total letdown.",1,7,21,7 October 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," The weakest Batman movie!LAME
","Well,managed to get through the two hours and forty five minutes!Not much of batman in it....... not for those that had to pay to see it.And Robin? Where was Robin?In this version of a very popular comic book hero Robin spends the movie as a cop.There was not really any plot,the acting was below standard and even for a batman flick a lot of the scenes were totally unrealistic.Also the bad guy Bane was lame.Is that all Hollywood could come up with?A bloody joke and a waste of money.This has been the way of many movies over the last few years.As the viewing technology gets better and better,what comes out of Hollywood gets worse and worse.$250,000,000 to make Batman?.....that has to be a typical Hollywood exaggeration,What a load of rubbish!For a movie with some great special effects it was boring.",3,9,19,19 November 2012
