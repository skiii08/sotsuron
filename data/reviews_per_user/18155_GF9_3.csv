The Blair Witch Project," Petrifyingly Clever
","I watched this movie in the front row of the cinema, possibly making it all the more scary for me.  I was sucked right into this desperate situation which left me feeling completely helpless and confused.  What and where is the enemy?  I think the most intriguing aspect of this picture was the marketing.  As soon as I read the poster - 'Three students went into the woods and never returned, and now their video has been found' (or words to that effect) - I had an urge to watch this film.  It never implies once it's fictional, and the style it was shot backs this up, and that for me makes this movie what it is - pant soilingly scary.",8,0,2,31 October 2002
MASH," Pure Comedy Genius
","As comedies go, it doesn't get much better than M*A*S*H! Script, direction, casting, music and acting are all at their very best in this satirical take on the Korean War - ironically, there is no army action played out during the movie, just the escapades of Elliot Gould, Donald Sutherland, et al where they are stationed to take in casualties of war.From the opening shots we feel the slow mood of the film, yet if we look a little closer, we see comedy and havoc all around. This is in my opinion, Altman's finest piece - the film is superbly shot, showing fantastic long shots, typical of the era. Elliot Gould has never been so cool, and Donald Sutherland's dryness is sublime. The cast as a whole are the driving force behind this movie - the actor's clearly have taken time to learn their character's, and it really shows, right down to Radar's communication with the field Marshall (or whatever he is). It is very much a character driven movie.The football game just shows what these people are really like - fun, scheming, lovable cheats - but it pays off because the opposition is so loathsome. Beautifully written, shot, acted and the rest. Without a shadow of a doubt this is a 10 out of 10 and one of the best comedies around.",10,28,49,3 January 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The standard 'not as good as the book' applies here.
","I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like Tom Hanks in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  Robert Langdon should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to Hanks occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.  The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - Paul  Bettany is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  Silas to utter perfection. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  Audrey Tautou is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played Bezu Fache - Jean Reno was made for the role.  As you'd expect from a Ron Howard Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. Langdon's 'Godspeed' caused me to  awake in the night sweating!   I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation.",6,672,1076,17 May 2006
