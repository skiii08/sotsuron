Ford v Ferrari," Auto-action delivered with great technicality and heart
","Providing a monumental tribute to British sports car racer Ken Miles, 'Ford v Ferrari' delivers with high-powered action and superb sound and video editing. Albeit heavily handed on the action side, actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale manage to leverage the tension with pure hearted performances that speak volumes about human drive and passion.",9,0,0,7 May 2020
