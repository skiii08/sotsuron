Blade Runner 2049," Hated it that much I left after 90 minutes
","It's not often I have felt the need to leave a cinema before the end of a film but after 90 minutes my patience snapped. It felt like I was watching the coursework of someone studying special effects at film making school. Scenery is only entertaining for so long and I was longing for something to happen but it seemed all of the action was over in the first 5 minutes. There wasn't even any tension to keep me on the edge of my seat, just a lot scenery, Ryan Gosling's blank face and NOTHING happening! I loved the original and this film did generate the same environment but they didn't need to keep showing me that over and over to convince me. It needed more to keep my attention and after a couple of 5 minute reprieves I broke and left the cinema. For anyone mildly interested I was watching the IMAX 3D version so had paid considerably for the experience of being bored out of my brain but the realisation this time would never come back stirred me to leave and go home where I knew there were some decent films waiting for me.",1,22,47,10 October 2017
Skyfall," Not for Bond fans!
","I have never been a James Bond fan but as I had some free time on the first day of release took the opportunity to see this film and decide for myself before any critics ruined it for me. So I took my open mind and my partner to the cinema and what a treat we had in store. From the first scene I was hooked into the story. Judi Dench was fabulous as M, showing both steel & vulnerability and Daniel Craig gave a stellar performance as the flawed hero. There was plenty of eye candy for me and action for us both and I was impressed with the pace of the story and the quality of the dialogue. My only minor complaint was the amount of product placement in the first 15 minutes made me feel like I was still watching the pre-film adverts but I would definitely say this is a film for any action film fans, not just James Bond fanatics!",9,5,20,26 October 2012
Molly's Game," Fabulous chemistry and frenetic story telling
","I saw this in my local cinema as a mystery film being screened before general release so had no idea what to expect and was completely open minded. I hadn't heard anything about this film so had no preconceptions or already formed opinions and I absolutely loved it. The chemistry between Jessica Chastain & Idris Elba was sparkling. It felt like a two-hander most of the time and the other actors were thumbnail sketches, albeit it cleverly drawn caricatures of real people. The theme throughout was speed, stories told in rapid flashbacks and narrated by Chastain as the eponymous Molly. The dialogue was quick and the explanations even quicker. There was even a little bit of poker tuition which interested me as I have only recently learned to play but a knowledge of the game isn't necessary to enjoy this film and I certainly did. It's not one you can sit back, relax and turn your brain off for. Keep your wits about you, buckle up and enjoy the ride. It will leave you breathless and wanting more, like all the best roller coasters.",9,3,10,29 November 2017
