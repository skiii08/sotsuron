Requiem for a Dream," I was awestruck ! - a master piece from Aronofsky, hats off to you.
","You don't actually come across movies like this often, its a rare breed and one of those kind which is hard to find. After watching this movie(9 years after its release) i was just wondering how did i missed this movie. One thing thats really special about this movie is its BACKGROUND SCORE. This sound track composed by Clint Mansell is mind blowing, even after the movie ends u keep humming or thinking about the sound track. This track was also used latter in many movies including Lord of the rings.The director Aronofsky is innovative and uses techniques such as hip hop montage and Snorricam, which sets a benchmark.The editing and acting is extraordinary all along the movie. Also its got a strong message. There is something about movies with the message i.e., they usually miss out on plot or usually the movie will be stretched testing your patience, just to win a award or two. But this movie defies all the rules and it is commercial and also has award winning stuff. I can guarantee you that you'll not get bored not even once watching this movie.After watching this movie for the first time i was awestruck. Its a reply to all those big budget movie which has a ridiculous plot and nothing to offer. They can learn a lesson or two after watching this movie and for those who say its not good i can only say this either you must be blind or you can 'go f*** yourself'. No harm though but people must have a heart to appreciate others work.I can watch it 1000 times still i won't get bored and every time i hear the the music it makes 'MY HAIR STAND ON IT'S END'. If you haven't still watched it 'what are you waiting for?'.",10,0,1,27 July 2009
Watchmen," One of the worst superhero movie I ever saw
","First of all this is the superhero movie in an unprecedented way the heroes doesn't have super powers, and they don't save people but each and every one starts killing people and one of them does a mass murder in the heart of U.S to save the war b/w Soviet and US that never happened! Only one of them seem to have a super power after an accident and he is more reluctant to wear any clothes showcasing his genitals and sometimes appears with an underwear to the mercy of the people watching it!! Lets play the cause and effect game First the till peaceful Soviet union assembles an army near the US border in the wage of a nuclear war Cause: One of the super hero in order to save U.S! Effect: the Soviet doesn't wage a war but the superhero himself kills most of the people in U.S AND you know what happens the Soviet union cannot stand the sight of their own pathetic people killing themselves and lends a helping hand!!!and through out the movie the director have shown the people and the so called superhero of America in a very bad light. For God sake if u don't like America get the hell out of here and for the sake of good god don't make movies like this because its only a matter of time that people are tolerating this.I'm still surprised how it got such good ratings in IMDb it should have got 2stars(max) just for graphics of jon's genitals! the plot is so bizarde that u wish u couldv'e stayed at home even after an hour the director is yet to give introduction to all so called superheroes.you know what this movie has superhero raping,killing people,and one of them manages to have sex with the daughter of his friend! i mean she is their only hope so they take turns in having sex with her first jon and next the other guy!!!!,and superheros killing their fellow superheros.You know when u wish that the movies is over soon then it is extended like something for 2hrs45min, this only kills u slowly. I was waiting till 2hr 44th min hoping that something will happen and nothing happens!. i think the director is trying to hide behind the fact that people who haven't read watchmen comic doesn't understand this movie so what do u expect to read comic book before going to this movie i mean so many superheros movies have emerged and movies like spider man made a huge impact what do u think everybody read spider-man comic book before going into the movie!! in an era like this where movies like darknight is made please don't make movies like this its a disgrace to all other SH movies.Taking about the SH'S One of them wears a mask which has some kind of animation on it (bec the director might have thought ordinary masks are old fashioned) but he has nothing to hide behind the mask i mean people would kill him for his deeds but his only identification is his mask still he wears mask every time!!!! and the jon guy he can see the future, teleport and do hell a lot of things go to another universe but can't see one of his friend planning all these things and a bizzard explanation for this. the other guy is busy falling in love and one of them killed in the beginning itself and most of them dead. bad! worse!! worst!!!GOD SAVE America AND DIRECTORS LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,8,16,8 July 2009
