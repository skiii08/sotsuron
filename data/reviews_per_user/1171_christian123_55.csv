The Benchwarmers," Jon Heder: the new name in bad comedy
","Three losers (Spade, Schneider and Jon Heder) who can't seem to do anything right, decide to form a three-man baseball team in order to take on other Little League teams.The premise is obviously very stupid but sometimes these films can be entertaining. A stupid comedy is never a bad thing as long as the viewer doesn't take it too seriously. Unfortunately, The Benchwarmers isn't a funny film. The movie is a weak collection of annoying and unoriginal jokes. I'm not too surprised by this though. The script was handled by one of the writers of 8 Crazy Nights and Malibu's Most Wanted. However even with a generic script and direction, the film still had some potential to be mildly funny. One person completely ruined that chance though.The Benchwarmers fails because of John Heder. His timing is horrible and his jokes are so lame. He tries way too hard and he just annoyed the hell out of me. Napoleon Dynamite was a one joke comedy that got old fast yet it somehow earned a lot of praise for being 'original' and 'hilarious'. Since the film stars Jon Heder, it has a very little chance of succeeding. He sinks an already mediocre film with his performance.Rob Schneider was okay, his performance was really just routine. He still had a few funny lines though. David Spade gave the best performance which is kind of scary. The supporting actors were un-notable and they aren't worth mentioning. Despite the presence of Jon Heder I still gave the film a 5. The reviews were brutal so I was expecting the worse but the film was pretty harmless. I didn't like the film but it did entertain a little so it wasn't too much of a waste. In the end, The Benchwarmers may register as a rental but it's still not really worth watching.

Walk the Line," Fantastic Biopic
","The story of country legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is told through his ongoing romance with fellow singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and how they get through tough times, from Cash's pill popping addiction to Carter's own marital troubles until finally agreeing to marry Cash.Walk the Line is an excellent look into Johnny Cash's life. It didn't shy away from telling the truth and most of the film was accurate. Before seeing Walk the Line, I didn't really like Johnny Cash's music. By the end of the movie though, I couldn't get enough of it. I still think Johnny Cash was an unlikable person but his music was fantastic. Even if you don't care for his music, the film is still worth checking out. James Mangold did a pretty good job behind the camera but it wasn't Oscar worthy. He moved the movie at a decent pace and it was hardly ever boring.The screenplay was good but it wasn't completely realistic. For example, they portrayed Vivian Cash in such a negative and selfish way. In the film, she didn't really seem to care about Johnny and his music. She also didn't really help him during his drug problem but that was completely untrue. The writing followed a pretty basic biopic formula and it wasn't hard to figure out where things were going. Also, the majority of the movie was depressing yet I still enjoyed the film. At least the ending was a happy one.The acting was fantastic with a couple of Oscar worthy performances. Reese Witherspoon was excellent as June Carter Cash. In some of her previous films, she was clearly just looking for a paycheck and she just phoned in her performance. In Walk the Line though, her singing was strong and her emotions never felt forced. While I think Felicity Huffman did a better job, I don't mind her winning the Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was just as good as Reese. His singing was good and he had an engaging chemistry with Reese. Unlike Jamie Foxx's performance, they didn't imitate their characters, they became John and June Carter Cash. Ginnifer Goodwin was okay, a bit weak during the emotional scenes. Robert Patrick gave a decent performance, nothing special. In the end, this wonderful film is worth checking out. Rating 9/10",9,5,8,10 September 2006
Miracle," An Enjoyable Film Even If You Don't Like Hockey
","In 1980, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a former Olympics hockey player cut from the winning 1960 U.S. team, put together a ragtag band of college hockey players, taking them to the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid to face the seemingly invincible Russian hockey team, winners of four successive gold medals. Miracle tells the true story of how they worked together to defy the odds working against them. Everyone likes a good upset especially when they can cheer on the winning team. Miracle gives you that story and its a nice film to watch with your family. I don't watch hockey because I don't really like it and its just not very appealing to me. But there's things that non-hockey fans can enjoy from this film. I liked the determination from the team and the inspiration the coach gave to them. Kurt Russell does an awesome job as Herb Brooks, probably his best performance in a long time. Patricia Clarkson does a good job playing his wife and all the players on the team aren't bad either. The one actor that was bad was Noah Emmerich, he just showed little to no emotion and didn't really put in a good effort. This wouldn't had been a problem if he had a small role but he was the assistant coach. Miracle is directed by Gavin O'Connor and he does a good job. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool. The focus is on mainly on Russell and while you learn some stuff about the players it would had been nice if they had shifted some of the attention on them as well. The screenplay may be filled with clichés but the film does it right even if it feels like you have seen it before because you probably have. The film is 135 minutes long and for me it started dragging a little and getting kind of boring. The movie is also predictable so the ending game as well as the entire movie isn't really suspenseful. The focus is more on beating Russia then actually winning the medal. When they do play in the final game and win the medal, they only show them scoring the winning shot. After that Kurt Russell starts talking saying how they won the last game by coming up from behind. While we know the outcome to the whole thing it still would had been nice if they had added a few more scenes. Its also better then The Mighty Ducks but that's not a hard thing to do. Rating 7/10 a treat for hockey fans and a film that a normal movie-goer can enjoy.",6,14,23,3 April 2005
Mission: Impossible III," It's way better than the second one and it offers many exciting and tense moments
","Agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his Impossible Missions Force (IMF) are back, this time trying to take down a ruthless arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who kidnaps Hunt's fiancé (Michelle Monaghan), in an attempt to use that against him.Mission: Impossible was a good film that actually made the viewer think although the action was only mediocre. Mission: Impossible 2 was a textbook example of style over substance. There was plenty of eye candy and action scenes but everything else was very weak. Mission: Impossible 3 combines the strengths of the first two and it pays off. This latest installment is the best in the series. It offers plenty of action, suspense and thrills. Sure, the film isn't entirely original and there are a few corny moments but it's still a solid action film especially in a decade that hasn't really had a lot to offer from this genre.The screenplay was an improvement over the second one yet it still had a feeling of 'been there, done that'. The whole mask twist actually worked again despite the repetitiveness of it. One thing that didn't work was the twist with the second bad guy being a member of I.M.F. They have already used this idea and using it again made the ending kind of weak. Also, the character was really lame and not very effective. The majority of the dialog was good except for some stupid one-liners but this is really just nitpicking and it didn't subtract from the quality of the movie. I really like the way director J.J. Abrams handled the pacing and action sequences. He started the film off with a bang and he never really let it slow down. He created many wonderful and entertaining scenes like the bridge scene and the sequence at The Vatican.The acting was good and it marked an improvement over the second one. Tom Cruise was very good as Ethan Hunt. To put it mildly, he has generated a lot of negative press though he is still a terrific actor. Phillip Seymour Hoffman created a scary villain. He was effective without going over the top and he was a good match for Tom Cruise's character. Michelle Monaghan couldn't have been more boring. Also, her scary resemblance to Katie Holmes was a bit distracting and she was clearly a miscast. Her bland performance didn't hurt the film too much though. Kerri Russell was also a miscast. I didn't really buy her as an agent although she didn't get a lot of screen time. Both Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers gave okay performances though they didn't get a lot of screen time and their characters weren't developed very well. Lastly, Billy Crudup gave a mediocre performance, nothing special at all. Overall, I recommend checking out Mission Impossible 3. Once in awhile, a good entertaining film that doesn't require too much thought is what a person needs and this one fit's the bill. 8/10",7,0,0,28 November 2006
50 First Dates," Hilarious
","50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.",7,39,54,24 January 2005
Friday Night Lights," Great Sports Drama
","Friday Night Lights is a very entertaining sports drama that captures the real life energy of football. The town of Odessa, Texas has seen better times, struggling with closing businesses and poverty, but those problems seem to disappear every Friday night, as the community rallies around its local high school football team, the Permian Panthers, as led by Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton). Friday Night Lights follows the 1988 season in the Panthers' quest to get to the State Championship. The plot sounds pretty good and the execution is also very good. Even though you have heard the story a bunch of times, this film still manages to keep you interested. I don't know how the story happened so I can't comment if Hollywood changed a lot of things. Even if they did, the film is nicely executed and very entertaining to watch. The acting was very good as they captured the energy and effort the real life players put into the game. The best was Billy Bob Thornton as Gary Gaines and he played the role very effectively. Tim McGraw was great as Charles Billingsley and I wasn't even expecting him to be that good. Derek Luke does a good job playing Boobie Miles and makes up for being in Spartan. Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez and Lucas Black all play players on the team. They each play their roles well and I think the best out of them is Lucas Black. Peter Berg does a good job of directing, making the movie feel and look exciting. He also directed The Rundown which was pretty good as well. The film is full of clichés but that has become unavoidable for all sport movies. Its also kind of short for this type of film at only 118 minutes long and that goes by fast as this is a very nice film to watch. The ending was also unexpected since usually the underdog wins but not in this film. The character development wasn't very good either. I still felt for the characters since I was very into the film but it may be hard for others. This movie is also better then Miracle and Remember the Titans. In the end, this is a very nice sports drams that's defiantly worth checking out. Rating 8/10, not only for football fans but for the average movie goer as well.",6,5,9,2 May 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Fun Remake
","In this remake of the classic 70's zombie movie, a mysterious virus has turned the population of Minneapolis into flesh-eating zombies, forcing a group of survivors to hole up at the local abandoned mall, where they are surrounded by thousands of the blood-crazed savages. Can they survive, let alone escape, with the odd so set against them? Dawn of the Dead is a fast paced, horror film that will actually scare you. It's gory, scary and a lot of fun to watch. The original film is overrated in my eyes. It was corny and dull though that's probably because it is outdated. So, the remake surpasses the original film in pretty much everything. The original had a good chance to tell a really scary story and it kind of blew it. The remake does a better job at telling the story and it adds more characters. There's more suspense and a lot more action. The zombies also run in this version. I know some people will complain that it goes against the whole point but it was a lot scarier. Watching thousands of zombies run after humans just sounds scarier and it looks scarier as well.The acting was also pretty good and convincing with the best being Ving Rhames. He can change his emotions easily and gave a really good performance. Sarah Polley also gives a good performance without going over the top. Mekhi Phifer gives an okay performance, nothing special. The rest of the cast are made up of unknowns but they all do a good job. Most of the characters are interesting to watch and you want to root for most of them to survive. It's been a while since I have actually cared about the characters in a horror film.The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously. It can be serious and scary when it wants to be. It can have a funny side as well and that keeps the film from becoming boring. There's hardly a dull moment as everything is pretty interesting. This is Zack Snyder's first movie he has directed and he should get more opportunities to direct in the future. He keeps the film tense and scary the whole time. He really does have a good eye for suspense and horror. Would you believe the guy who wrote the screenplay for the Scooby Doo movies also wrote the screenplay for this remake? He does a pretty good job and I can't wait for his next movie. This is by far the best horror film of 2004 and it's a must see for horror fans. In the end, this very bloody and entertaining remake is worth checking out. Rating 9/10",8,0,0,21 November 2004
Two for the Money," Al Pacino is always worth betting on.
","Mathew McConaughey is Brandon Lane, a former football star recruited by Walter Abraham (Al Pacino), the head of a sports consulting firm to help them set the line for their sports betting business. Lane's ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy, but it soon becomes apparent that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.Two for the Money is a forgettable, generic thriller that doesn't really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But, the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily, Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good, over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally, sports betting isn't that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let's be honest, the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It's so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.Al Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn't very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can't keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino's wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It's hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn't really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end, if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot, if you don't then just skip it. Rating 6/10",6,55,66,2 April 2006
Lords of Dogtown," A decent film with a few engaging scenes and characters.
","In the mid-70's, a group of teen surfers from Venice, California formed a skateboarding team known as the 'Z-Boyz', turning a fad into a sport by introducing a number of wild surfing-influenced moves that had not been seen before. But the fame and fortune that came along with their newfound notoriety eventually leads to friction between the friends.I don't really like skateboarding so I thought this film was going to be boring but it turned out to be enjoyable. The characters were realistic and the drama was intense. Also, the skateboarding scenes were pretty impressive even if a couple of them ran longer than they should have. The screenplay was pretty routine and predictable but it was still engaging. It was written by Stacy Peralta who just happens to be one of the characters in the movie. Unsurprisingly, Stacy Peralta was the nicest character in the film and he was also one of the best skaters in the film. I wonder if it really happened like this or if Peralta was just making himself look good. They should have asked all of the original 'Z-Boyz' to pen the script even though there's a documentary on the same story.The first half of the movie was kind of slow and dull. It took awhile for things to get going. However, the second half picked up and it was a lot more exciting. The ending was really nice even if it was a little cheesy. It was my favorite part in the film since it was more than a little heartwarming. Catherine Hardwicke did a horrible job behind the camera. She moved the camera rapidly with quick editing and I guess she was trying to get a documentary feel to the film. It didn't work out very well. It was messy and it seemed like a desperate attempt for drama and excitement. Also, the dialog was exaggerated and annoying. I know skateboarders really do speak like that but only to a point. They really went overboard with it and it was very unnecessary.The acting was pretty good with Emile Hirsch giving the best performance. His character was the most developed and interesting one. He handled the role well and he should become a big star one day. Victor Rasuk was also pretty good as Tony though a little annoying. John Robinson was okay, a little dull though. Heath Ledger was pretty funny as Skip and his character was a good idol for the young skaters. Rebecca De Mornay gave a horrible performance that was completely fake and unbelievable. Michael Angarano played Sid and his performance was pretty good. It was sad to watch at times because of the illness Sid had and what it did to him. This is why I really liked the ending because it was just the boys skating with Sid watching them. The majority of the film was on the forgettable side but the ending was really touching. In the end, Lords of Dogtown is worth checking out for skater fans otherwise approach with caution. Rating 7/10",4,8,13,31 July 2006
Hostel," A Stylish and Scary Horror Movie Lacking Substance.
","Two American college buddies backpack across Europe and wind up at hostel in a Slovakian town, which is advertised as a nirvana for travelers. There, they encounter all sorts of exotic women willing to do their bidding, but there's a darker aspect of this place that they only learn about too late.Hostel is your typical sadistic horror film offering enough gore and scares for the audience. The premise is pretty creepy and the execution is very effective. Eli Roth is really good at directing horror movies. He doesn't mind going over the top and he's pretty good at building suspense. His story telling skills are a little weak though. The first forty five minutes or so was a good opportunity to build on the premise. However, Roth just inserted dull dialog and idiotic scenes that didn't really have a point. If anything, it just made the audience hate the main characters. After the really slow start, the movie picks up and becomes more exciting. The death scenes are ridiculously over the top yet still very scary to watch.While these torture scenes are occurring, there is still no sign of a story. It was really just a bunch of torture scenes strung together without a story but with a lot of style. I still liked the movie but it was kind of pointless. The characters are pretty weak as well. They were your typical college students, annoying, loud and rude. Still, it was hard not to feel sorry for them when they were being murdered. Very few people deserve to be murder that way so it was easier to root for their survival. Some people may have difficulty in doing that though.The acting is okay, nothing special. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson play the two Americans and they both give decent performances. The rest of the actors were a bunch of unknowns and no one really stood out. Despite the movie's vacant story, the film still showed some scary real life situations. The whole torture chamber thing is probably a stretch but the fact that people are willing to pay to kill other people is a pretty sick thought. It shows that some people may appear harmless yet have a very twisted side to them. Also, near the end of the film, Paxton (Hernandez) is portrayed as a hero for saving a girl and for getting revenge on a bunch of people. After escaping, he could have just left and forgotten about the people who put him there but he went after them. It shows that someone without a disturbing side can still murder after being near death themselves. Or maybe I'm just looking into the movie too much. In the end, Hostel is worth checking out for horror fans just don't expect a lot of substance. Rating 6/10",6,2,3,1 June 2006
The Girl Next Door," Funny Movie
","Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a teen over-achiever from a well-to-do community, who falls for the super sexy girl watching the house next door (Elisha Cuthbert). As they get closer, he finds out that she is secretly a porn star, something that he must try to come to terms with as he suddenly finds himself wit a lot of new male friends.The premise sounds pretty good and the film turned out to be pretty funny. The story isn't very original though. It's similar to Risky Business as every film critic has bothered to point out. That didn't bother me though since The Girl Next Door is still an entertaining comedy. Some of the jokes were kind of lame and the movie is a little forgettable. After about a week, only a few scenes really stuck with me. The movie remains consistently entertaining during the running time but it doesn't have a long lasting impression on the viewer nor does it have a good repeat value. It's just a harmless teen comedy and it should be approached as one.The movie works pretty well because of its two appealing leads. Elisha Cuthbert is cool and confident as Danielle. She plays the character pretty well and she's also very pretty. Some people are complaining about Elisha playing the role of a porn star because she is not pretty enough. I strongly disagree, she looks stunning in the movie. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance as Matthew. His character is likable and somewhat interesting. Tim Olyphant plays Kelly and he gives a pretty funny performance, kind of annoying though. Chris Marquette was just annoying as Eli. His character was supposed to be your stereotypical horny teenager but he just tried too hard to be funny.Director Luke Greenfield is not that reliable as a director. He was behind that horrible movie called 'The Animal' though he surprisingly does a decent job with this movie. He could have shortened the film a little though. 109 minutes was too long for this type of comedy and especially this story. They ran out of ideas and they seemed to be recycling the old ones. The ending was also kind of weak and not as funny as the beginning or middle. Despite this, I still don't understand why this movie bombed at the box office. It wasn't great but it was a fun way to spend two hours and it the movie does keep the audience entertained. In the end, this is one of 2004's best comedies and it's worth checking out.

Constantine," A Very Entertaining Film
","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a die-hard cynic with the unwanted childhood gift of being able to see angels and demons that walk the earth. When a police detective (Rachel Weisz) comes to him for help finding out why her twin sister committed suicide, the duo is thrown headlong into a war between heaven and hell.Constantine is a very enjoyable and exciting film to watch. The execution of the premise was done pretty well. I found the film to be engaging even though I was unfamiliar with material. I liked the way director Francis Lawrence handled the movie. He made it stylish but he also added plenty of substance to back it up. The majority of the first half was just talking and the film did a decent job of introducing the characters and story. Actually, the first half featured a bit too much talking and it was a little dull. However, the second half was very nicely done with a lot of cool scenes and dialog.At first, the running time of 121 minutes seemed to be really long but the second half was wonderfully paced and the film just zoomed to the end. The script was a little weak but that wasn't the movie's main draw so it wasn't a major flaw. The script wasn't too original but I wouldn't say the entire film was derivative. Also, there weren't too many characters so it wasn't hard to figure things out. The special effects were awesome though and it was the best thing the film had to offer.I think Constantine worked so well because of Keanu Reeves. A lot of people have blasted him for being a bad and boring actor. However, I think his mundane personality suited the role perfectly and he did a fine job. Rachel Weisz also played her role well and she's kind of underrated. Shia LaBeouf gave an awful performance as Chas. He was just annoying and over-the-top. I liked Tilda Swinton's performance and I think she's also a pretty underrated actress. Surprisingly, Gavin Rossdale gave a good performance. It wasn't amazing but it was much better than I expected. I think Constantine is a love it or hate it type of film. The movie will either wow the viewer or bore the viewer with it's story and effects. In the end, Constantine is a pretty good movie that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",6,17,31,9 May 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Some great destruction scenes but not much else
","The Day After Tomorrow is entertaining during the first half of the film but by the second half of the movie it starts to drag. Global warming and the greenhouse effect have devastating effects on the earth when a series of hurricanes, tornadoes and tidal waves kick off a second Ice Age. Professor Adrian Hall (Quaid), a leading scientist studying weather patterns, must try to save the world as well as find his son (Gyllenhaal) who was in New York City when it was struck by the sudden weather catastrophe. This type of movie has three factors that it needs to have if it wants a wider audience. First, Are the destruction scenes thrilling? Judging by the trailer alone you can see that they are. Second, Is the science sound? In this case it isn't as global warming is a big issue and making a joke out of it will upset some people and turn them away. And third is the dialog good or will you laugh out at some of the scenes? Well there are some unintentional funny moments when they are trying to be serious but it sounds too stupid and its hard to take seriously. If you want the last two factors in this film then I recommend you don't watch it, however if the destruction scenes are good enough for you then its worth it. Roland Emmerich has a good eye for destruction and he makes this movie very action packed but left out everything else. The cast is good for the most part with the best being Dennis Quaid who really made up for The Alamo and does a good job in his role. Jake Gyllenhaal was good and I am kind of surprised he isn't more popular in Hollywood since he is a very good actor. Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Ian Holm all play their roles fine and try their best with a unrealistic plot. The first half of the movie is great with tons of action and with a lot of great scenes like the tornadoes in LA, though I think they should have destroyed another city. The second half starts getting boring and there's not much action also it has a very cheesy ending. Rating 6/10 it was a decent destruction flick and it was very entertaining in the beginning but loses steam by the end.",5,12,27,24 January 2005
Ocean's Twelve," The script is weak but the stars make up for it
","Oceans 12 is an entertaining sequel but the original is better. Terry Benedict {Andy Garcia} has hunt down Danny and his crew and he wants his money back with interest. Since they are too 'hot' to work in the US, they travel overseas to try to get his money back before the deadline. Ocean's 11 was a very entertaining heist film and while the sequel is good its not as good. A lot of people are complaining that the plot is complex but if you pay attention then you should be able to follow the story pretty well. Some of the scenes are very unrealistic but the film is still fun to watch. The cast is all back with a couple of new people as well. My favorite is Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan, he had a lot of funny lines. Matt Damon has a bigger role as his character wants to be more involved with the heist. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Isabel the cop who's on the tail of Danny and his crew. She is very pretty but her acting talents aren't that great. George Clooney plays Danny, he does a good job but wasn't very memorable. Julia Roberts isn't in the film very much in the beginning but by the end she plays a big role. Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Eddie Jemison and Shaobo Qin are all back. If you enjoyed these characters in the first film, then you should like them here. The one exception is Bernie Mac. His character is eliminated in the beginning and he doesn't reappear until the end. Bruce Willis also has a small and funny cameo. I think the best comparison too this film is The Italian Job but Oceans 12 is better. The stars seem to be having a lot of fun and there are some really funny scenes especially one near the end with Julia Roberts. The dialog is smart and funny. The direction is pretty good as Steven Soderbergh seems to know what he is doing. The film could had been better if they had worked on the script a little more since the heist wasn't as good as the first. Also their given a short deadline so it seems a little unrealistic they would had been able to pull it off. In the end, Oceans 12 is a an enjoyable film that's worth checking out now that its on video. Rating 7/10, if you expect something like Ocean's 11 you will probably end up disappointed as this ones more unrealistic. So just try and have a little more fun with this one.",7,1,1,15 April 2005
Final Destination 2," Very entertaining and better than the original
","Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.",5,48,85,17 May 2005
Closer," A nearly flawless film that holds your attention
","Closer is one of the best films of the year and was defiantly snubbed from the Oscars. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen play four strangers in London who fall in love, and then betray their partners with each other in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his own award-winning 1997 play. I had heard of the play before and it sounded really good so I saw this film. In one word this film is amazing, The acting, writing everything is top-notch and this is a must see for any movie fan. Its a thoughtful look on adult relationships and the result it pretty good. I thought the best actor in the cast was Natalie Portman, her performance is so good and its probably better then you would expect it to be since she's so young. Julia Roberts is the worst out of the four but that doesn't mean her performance was bad. I usually don't like her that much but she certainly surprised me. Jude Law is a good actor and gives a great performance as well. Last but not least is Clive Owen, I haven't really heard much about him but after this film I will defiantly be checking out his other work. Mike Nichols does a great job of directing and he was certainly snubbed from the Oscars. The dialog is great with a lot of sharp lines that may have turned some people off. The film is somewhat depressing and its hard to feel sorry for the characters but the film doesn't expect you to. The movie is only 104 minutes long and its not hard to follow the story either. The film is not completely realistic though, like I had some trouble believing some stuff but I wouldn't look too much into them. Rating 9/10 a very fine film and one that's worth checking out.",7,1,1,26 March 2005
Capote," Difficult to watch but still an excellent film
","In the years between 1960 and 1965, author Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) formed an unlikely friendship with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), a killer on death row accused of murdering a family of four in Kansas. His conversations with Perry and research into the murders would form the basis of his greatest literary work, 'In Cold Blood.' Capote is a terrific film that succeeds on every level. It was difficult to watch at times but it was still an emotionally engaging experience. Capote himself was an interesting person even if he did act a bit pretentious. In the film, he did have a few annoying moments like when he said 'I have 94 percent recall of all conversation. I tested it myself.' That line sounded like he was bragging and he was very much in love with himself, as other characters pointed out. At the same time, I felt sorry for him when he was talking about his childhood since people would make fun of him. He said, 'Ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged, because of the way I am, the way I talk. And they're always wrong.' As an adult though, he got the respect of most people. I think Philip Seymour Hoffman did a fantastic job as Capote and he deserved the Oscar. Some people called his performance an imitation but I think he did more than just talk like him. He actually became Capote.The main thing the film focused on was the relationship between Capote and Perry. At first, it was hard to tell if Capote was just using him for his book or if he actually cared for him. As they continued to meet, a friendship developed and Capote was looking past his book. He didn't want to portray Perry as a monster despite his crimes. He actually wanted to portray Perry correctly. The scenes between Capote and Perry were interesting to watch and they were done very well. The ending was particularly memorable and I think it was the best scene. I have to give credit to Clifton Collins Jr since he gave a very good performance as Perry. It was a shame that he wasn't nominated. I also have to give credit to director Bennett Miller because he managed to capture Capote's research and relationships pretty well.There were a few other people in Capote's life that were portrayed in the film. Harper Lee accompanied Truman to Kansas to help him with his research. Their relationship together was nice to watch but I think Catherine Keener should have gotten more screen time. Her performance was fine but it wasn't really Oscar worthy. I don't think there was enough of the character to really warrant a nomination. Alvin Dewey was portrayed by Chris Cooper and he did a decent job, nothing special though. Jack Dunphy was Capote's boyfriend and he was portrayed by Bruce Greenwood, who did a decent job. I didn't really find this relationship very interesting. Their conversations were kind of dull but Greenwood didn't get a lot of screen time so it didn't hurt the quality of the film. In the end, Capote is an excellent film and it's worth checking out. Rating 10/10",8,0,0,29 August 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Surprisingly enjoyable with strong performances by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep
","Fresh from college, Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) comes to New York in hopes of being a journalist. Instead, she accepts a job as a personal assistant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of the fashion magazine Runway, who forces Andy to compromise her ideals if she ever wants to make it in publishing.One of the most pleasant surprises of the year, The Devil Wears Prada is a wonderful comedy that will work for everyone. The screenplay is simple yet still engaging and it really relates to anyone who has had a mean boss in their lives. If you don't like fashion, that's okay since fashion is really just the backdrop to the story. The first half of the film is consistently good with many funny lines and scenes. It then slows down a bit and it becomes more serious. The sudden shift in tone is unexpected yet it is still handled well. The ending is kind of disappointing but not in a alarming bad way so it doesn't subtract from the quality of the movie.Director David Frankel did an okay job behind the camera although he did keep it safe so the movie was pretty predictable. There were also a few things I didn't like about the film. The relationship between Andy and Nate was handled poorly and the two of them did not go well together. The ending wasn't very good because of the outcome of their relationship, it just felt unnatural and they should have just been friends in the end. The other thing was the message of the movie. It kind of felt like they were saying, 'if you can't beat them, join them'. I don't think the film really showed that you can be yourself and still succeed at any job unless that wasn't the point. However, I still think that was the point since the screenplay actually had some depth to the characters and I'm hoping it wasn't a shallow film.The acting was great with Meryl Streep being the highlight of the movie. She was fantastic as Miranda and she deserves an Oscar nomination. Anne Hathaway was also pretty good and she manages to keep up with Streep. Honestly, some of the performances were a bit over the top and Hathaway had to give a subtle performance in which she delivered. Emily Blunt was good as Emily although I don't think she deserves a Golden Globe nomination. It was a funny performance but a little too over the top and not a role that demanded too much from the actress. She was better in My Summer of Love. Simon Baker was just creepy and I didn't like his performance at all. Stanley Tucci was great and it was refreshing to see that his character wasn't just an annoying stereotype. Adrian Grenier was alright although he didn't look too good with Hathaway. Overall, I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. It was very entertaining and it's worth checking out.

The Aviator," Expertly Made Biopic
","The Aviator is a flawless and powerful picture that leaves an impact on the viewer. The life of the late Howard Hughes is realized by director Martin Scorsese and his star, Leonardo DiCaprio, in this biopic that shows the millionaire's eccentric ventures into Hollywood film-making and breakthrough feats of aviation by breaking speed records. Before I saw this film, I had never really heard much about Howard Hughes so I wasn't really excited to see this film. However, he turned out to be quite an interesting man and this biopic did a good job of telling his life. He had many dreams and actually worked to try to complete them. He did some bad things and he also nearly died from a plane crash. I had never really had an interest for really old Hollywood but this film made me look up some things. Leonard DiCaprio did a great job portraying Howard Hughes. He would sometimes go over the top but rarely. Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn and does a pretty good job. I usually don't really like her but this movie is an exception. Kate Beckinsale also did a good job as Ava Gardner. John C. Reilly did a really good job though he wasn't a main character. He is also kind of underrated. Alec Baldwin isn't that great of an actor. I never really liked him but apparently Scorsese has a way to get the best out of everyone. Jude Law and Gwen Stefani aren't in the film very much, in fact I didn't really notice Gwen and Jude has like on scene. So very good acting from everyone. Martin Scorsese directs and I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar for this film. He made a beautiful picture and it was sometimes really moving as well. The running time is a long 168 minutes but it goes by so fast as I was defiantly hooked on the film. I find this film superior to Ray as it was better made. The characters were more interesting, direction was better and it didn't suffer from too many clichés. Jamie Foxx did a better job then Leo but not by much. This film also makes you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films more like this one. In the end, this is an expertly made film and defiantly worth checking out. Rating 10/10",8,6,9,12 July 2005
The Village," Some creepy moments but its not as good as it should have been
","The Village has some creepy moments but its not as good as M. Night Shyamalans previous work. A tranquil 19th Century village enjoys an isolated living surrounded by woods which are home to strange creatures. For many years, they remain segregated, but one day, the villagers discover that the creatures will no longer leave them alone once an impetuous young man (Joaquin Phoenix) bravely ventures forth into the forbidden territory. The plot sounds very scary and with a talented cast this should have been a lot better. The film runs for 108 minutes but it feels a lot longer because there's a lot of boring moments. The script needed some work as there were a lot of holes and stuff that didn't make sense. The ending was good and I didn't see it coming but it also didn't make a lot of sense. The cast is great with the best being Bryce Dallas Howard, she's very talented and should will easily find work in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver both do a good job and Sigourney might be one of the most underrated actresses today. The last main person worth mentioning is Adrien Brody who does a good job but his character was really annoying. M. Night Shyamalan also does a good job of directing making The Village look and sound creepy. Even with a great cast and director the movie just didn't work as well as it should have. I do think critics were a bit harsh on this movie though as it wasn't as bad as they were saying. Rating6/10, this seems to be a hate or love it type of movie as you will either like the ending or you will hate it and feel like you have been ripped off badly.",5,10,19,12 March 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A creepy and effective horror remake
","A family traveling through the Nevada desert are sent on a short-cut that puts them into the path of a deadly group of killer mutants, who have been preying on innocent travelers for years. The Hills Have Eyes is a scary and effective horror film that actually takes the time to develop everything instead of just rushing into the violence. For this type of film, there are really only two formulas that are commonly used today. The director could either develop the characters and story so the audience becomes familiar with them or the director can just do a quick introduction and just rush into all the murders. The Hills Have Eyes is an example of the former and it does a good job at it. The pacing is not too slow at the beginning and we get to know everyone as well as get a good look at the location. Then like a torpedo, the film just takes off and it manages to be memorable without being gory or over the top. Alexandre Aja did a good job behind the camera. He really set up a creepy atmosphere for the film and he used that desert location perfectly. He managed to create plenty of tension with horrifying villains and quick editing shots. He also produced a few inventive death scenes that didn't depend heavily on gore to be scary. He sometimes dragged a situation out for too long but as a whole, the movie was usually interesting and entertaining to watch. The villains looked pretty good as well especially compared to other similar films like 'Wrong Turn'. I would say that the dialog was largely bland yet the characters were still interesting because they were more ordinary and therefore relatable.Compared to the genre, the acting was better than the standard. Emile De Ravin gave a good performance. She could have played a shallow, spoiled brat but she had a little more depth to her. Vinessa Shaw was a bit of a miscast because she didn't strike me as mom to the baby, maybe more of an older sister. Dan Byrd was surprisingly good and I say surprisingly because I was expecting his performance to be really annoying but it was quite tolerable. Aaron Stanford was unlikable at first but quickly improved as the movie progressed. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levin gave adequate performances as the parents. Also, the actors portraying the bad guys did a pretty good job. Overall, The Hills Have Eyes covers some familiar territory but it still manages to be quite exciting thanks to the interesting direction and talented cast. Rating 7/10",7,3,5,11 April 2007
"I, Robot"," Decent action movie
","I, Robot is a decent action movie with some thrills but I wasn't very excited by it. Thirty years in the future, robots are everywhere, helping humans with their day-to-day menial labor. In this world, only one person, a paranoid, techno-phobic detective played by Will Smith, is suspicious of the robots. His doubts are given foundation when he investigate a murder committed by a robot, leading to a nefarious discovery about these supposedly peaceful and trustworthy robots. There are three robotic laws which all robots must obey. 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. The story is very interesting but I can't compare the book and the movie. The direction is pretty good and I think Alex Proyas is very underrated especially after Dark City. The films main star is Will Smith who makes a joke here and there, some are funny but he becomes a little annoying later on. Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin and she plays her role well and hopefully will continue to find work in Hollywood. Alan Tudyk is great as Sonny and ends up stealing the film with his performance. Shia LaBeouf has a cameo in this film and he is not really needed. There's plenty of action so if that's all you want then you will most likely like this film. The action to me wasn't very impressive, but the ending was really good. The special effects are top notch though and it's a beautiful film to look at. The movie isn't hard to figure out though since there's only a few characters. Rating 6/10 decent action, good story and good performances and worth watching now that its out on video.",6,0,0,30 December 2004
Van Helsing," An Action Packed Movie
","Hugh Jackman trades his razor sharp claws for razor sharp blades to play the monster-hunter, Gabriel Van Helsing, hired by the church to go to Transylvania to take on Count Dracula {Richard Roxburgh}, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster.The premise sounds very interesting and this film had potential to be a good summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, the film is very uneven. The CGI is great and the movie gets an 'A' on that part but the rest of the film was handled very poorly. Apparently, Stephen Sommers took some lessons from George Lucas and decided to fill his movie with just CGI. This isn't a bad thing since it is a summer movie. However, the film becomes very dull and the story is kind of weak. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept but the execution just wasn't very good. Sure, the monsters looked great but I was expecting a little more than that.The acting was okay, nothing special. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing well and he does make for a good hero. Kate Beckinsale was weak and very cheesy as Anna. I know the movie is supposed to be cheesy but she was a little too much. Her chemistry with Jackman was also non existent and this hurt the film. Richard Roxburgh gives the best performance out of everyone. He plays Dracula and he is very effective as the villain.A big problem with Van Helsing is the length of the movie. 132 minutes is just too long and it made the film very dull to sit through. The film was also too cheesy for me. Some of it was just so stupid and the story grew more and more ridiculous as the film continued. The first hour is actually pretty good and entertaining. The second hour is dull and not as creative as the first part. The ending was alright, nothing really special. Honestly, the main reason to watch this film is because of the combination of Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein in one movie. The story is weak, the acting is nothing special and the direction is poor. The film is very stylish though so the 160 million went to good use. Besides for these flaws, Van Helsing was still a decent summer blockbuster with some fun moments. In the end, now that it's out on video, Van Helsing is worth a look just don't expect too much from it. Rating 6/10",5,14,25,25 November 2004
She's the Man," Completely Corny yet Still Very Entertaining
","Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother, so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately, she immediately falls for her male roommate, who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.Combining the story of 'Just One of the Guys' and Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night may sound like a recipe for disaster but She's the Man is a funny, charming and cheesy movie. The original trailer looked really lame yet the film turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story is clearly nothing new but it still works fine. The fact that the screenplay is written by Karen McCullah Lutz explains everything. She's good for harmless, fun films like She's the Man, Legally Blonde and Ella Enchanted. Andy Fickman does a decent job as the director. He never lets the film become too serious or else it would ruin the movie's appeal. He does overload on a few lame jokes though. That was the major problem I had with this film. Some of the jokes just fell flat while others were just incredibly cheesy, even for this film.The acting was good for this type of movie and most of the actors were enjoyable to watch on screen. Amanda Bynes is full of charm as Viola. It was very hard to actually hate her and she's a much better actress than Hilary Duff. Channing Tatum was not as strong as Amanda. His performance was okay, sometimes his reactions were a little fake. Laura Ramsey plays Olivia and she gives a decent performance. Alex Breckenridge gives a pretty good performance as Monique. Her character was pretty interesting and she had decent chemistry with Amanda. The rest of the supporting actors are good except for David Cross. He plays the school principal and his performance was not funny at all.If you do give She's the Man a shot then keep in mind that the entire film is highly unrealistic. I was reading some of the posts here and a few people are bashing the film for that. While the movie is pretty entertaining, it's also easily forgettable. It was a fun way to spend 100 minutes but it won't stay in your memory for long. It's also not just a chick flick and a guy could also like the movie. In the end, She's the Man is worth checking out whether that be in the theaters or on video. Rating 7/10",6,10,13,18 May 2006
Collateral," The cast and crew make this an above average film
","Collateral is a slow paced thriller that lacks action but its still an entertaining movie. The plot is about a Los Angeles cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) who gets in over his head when he agrees to drive a killer named Vincent (Cruise) around Los Angeles to his various hits, an arrangement that is not so easy to get out of. The story is very interesting and fortunately the plot is carried out well. Tom Cruise is very good as Vincent and I was surprised he did not receive a Golden Globe or an Oscar Nomination for his role. Jamie Foxx is very good as Max and he sure makes up for that horrible movie Bait. Jada Pinkett Smith has a small role in the film and she plays her role well. Mark Ruffalo also plays his role as a cop well but he isn't in the film very much. Also on a side note Jason Statham has a cameo in the beginning. Michael Mann does an awesome job of directing and he should defiantly receive an Oscar nomination for his work. Collateral is more for mature audiences because it lacks action so the film has some boring moments. For the most part the film moves along easily because of its cast and the two hours are over before you know it. Collateral isn't a brilliant film though since the plot is a little unrealistic like I had trouble believing that everything in the film took place in one night. The ending is a little disappointing but doesn't bring down the film too much. In a summer with disappointing blockbusters Collateral is a winner. Rating 8/10 great performances and a great director save Collateral from being an average thriller.",8,0,0,24 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter is back for his best film yet
","The start of Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is threatened by the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Voldemort's murderous henchman who betrayed Harry's parents, getting them killed. Along with this pals Hermione and Ron Weasley, Harry must try to stay one step ahead of Black while dealing with the new school year and the horrifying Dementors, Azkaban's jail keepers that now surround the school.After two sold entries in the Harry Potter franchise, the third film really kicks things up. It's a fantastic film with gorgeous special effects and lots of entertaining moments. There's a new switch behind the camera and I like Alfonso Cuarón more than Chris Columbus. Alfonso Cuarón put a lot more 'magic' and soul into the project while Columbus made the first two films kind of bland. He is a very vanilla like director whereas Alfonso is more fast paced and exciting. This entry is a little more different since they leave out more parts from the book and it's more action. This didn't bother me because the film was more energetic but non readers of the book may be annoyed by this.The acting was pretty good and it was a lot better than the first two entries. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he's improving. He's still lacking a little in the emotional scenes though. Emma Watson plays Hermione and she's probably the best of the three. Rupert Grint was okay as Ron though he is the weakest of the three. There is a new Dumbledore in this film as Michael Gambon replaces the late great Richard Harris. He doesn't play the role as well but it's still pretty good. Emma Thompson plays Professor Sybil Trelawney and she does a pretty good job. However, her character isn't in the film that much which is too bad. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was okay, nothing really special.The only problem I had with the movie was that it went by too fast. They could have added some more scenes so the story was told better. Besides for that, the book's magic seems to have been captured. The dialog is all sharp and funny. The direction is great and the acting is good. The special effects are amazing and the film is just beautiful to look at. People who are bashing this movie are most likely just bitter book nerds. Not all of them are but it seems to me that most are. In the end, the movie is great and it's worth checking out. Rating 9/10",7,0,0,25 November 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Surprisingly a great movie

When he discovers a way to travel back into the body of his past self, his time trips start to cause negative results on his present. As he uses his powers to try to fix his past and present, the effect escalates, creating alternate realities, many of which are worse than the past that he is trying to change.The Butterfly Effect is a terrific thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The previews looked very intense and the whole film is pretty much like that. It held onto the audience right at the start and it didn't let go until the end. The plot is nothing new but the execution was very nice. It offers a bunch of interesting and unpredictable twists so it's hard to see where things are going. The whole film is like that, just one long engaging thrill ride.The acting is okay, some people did better than others. Ashton Kutcher is surprisingly good as Evan and he does a good job for his first serious movie. Amy Smart is very pretty and talented and she plays Kayleigh perfectly. The only person I didn't really like was Melora Walters. She was pretty wooden and unconvincing. Besides for her, the acting was pretty good and convincing. No one really did a bad job.This film was directed and written by both Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. They did make their mistakes but the film is still pretty good. The critics never gave this movie a chance. As soon as they heard Ashton Kutcher was in it, they all prepared to give it thumbs down. The movie moves around a lot that its hard to keep up but it also keeps you paying attention. Plenty of movies have gone back in time before but this one does it so more effectively that its almost original in that sense. The beginning is done well, the middle it starts dragging but it starts picking up and the ending is done extremely well. This is one of the best films of 2004 and certainly an entertaining one. In the end, this underrated gem is worth checking out. Rating 8/10",7,342,429,14 November 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Some cool scenes but mostly a disappointment
","Alien Vs. Predator has some cool scenes and some other entertaining moments but mostly the film is a disappointment. The fast-breeding creatures from the Aliens films take on the headhunting space colonizers from Predator in a battle for the earth, leaving a poor team of Antarctic archaeologist's and the rest of us lowly humans trapped in the middle. The plot does sound like it has potential and if it was rated R it could have been a lot better. The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting. The death scenes are lame as you can't even see what's going on. Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film. The acting is terrible but its normal for this type of film. The most notable person in this film you might recognize is Sanaa Lathan but she of course doesn't add much to the film. The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared. The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive. The dialog is bad and funny but in a bad way, which is always a bad thing. Yet even with all this negativity I didn't completely hate it. Some of the action scenes were cool and its a pretty movie to look at, especially the creature special effects. Paul Anderson shouldn't be blamed as Fox wanted to edit the movie and make it earn more money. The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though. Rating 5/10 I had some fun watching this but this film is for hardcore fans only and even they will probably hate it.",4,41,83,12 March 2005
Meet the Fockers," The critics are wrong, this movie is funny
","After convincing his fiancée's parents to allow them to marry, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) now has to deal with what happens when her ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) meets his own wacky ex-hippy parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.I really wanted to see this film when it was first announced. The original was very funny and it had a great repeat value. However, the reviews started coming in and they were all negative so I was a little discouraged. I still went to see it and it turned out to be very funny. The critics really need to lighten up since they turned away a fine comedy. Sure, some of the gags are old and tired but they still work. They use a lot of 'Focker' jokes and of male nurse jokes sob that kind of got annoying but it wasn't an overload either. The story is pretty much the same as the first one except now Greg's parents are thrown into the mix and nothing ever goes right. The writers came up with a bunch of different, funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new.The cast is great and they help move the film along nicely. The best was clearly Dustin Hoffman as Greg's dad. He was hilarious and fun to watch on screen. Ben Stiller was okay but his uptight character role is kind of getting annoying. Robert De Niro also gives a funny performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in Godsend. Barbara Streisand was surprisingly funny and bearable. I usually cannot stand her but she was alright in the movie. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance, nothing really special. Teri Polo was the only miscast in the movie. She just didn't fit or look well next to Hoffman, Stiller and De Niro. Owen Wilson makes a cameo and it was decent, a little unnecessary though.Jay Roach directs and he does a good job with the movie though it was a little too long. 115 minutes is kind of long for a comedy and because of the long running time, the film starts to bore around the end. They should have taken some things out to keep the film shorter and interesting. I also didn't like the character little Jack. He was the grandson of Jack (De Niro) and he was very annoying. The addition of the baby character was unnecessary and it kind of brought the film down. Compared to the original, the first one is funnier and more enjoyable. The second one is still pretty funny but it doesn't have a good repeat value. However, the film is still worth checking out in theaters. In the end, please ignore the critics and check this film out in theaters. Rating 7/10",6,152,249,22 December 2004
The Number 23," An unconvincing thriller that proves to be more ridiculous than thrilling.
","'Fate' leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled 'The Number 23' is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10",1,27,59,29 July 2007

","Hellboy is an entertaining comic book movie with plenty of action and its visually stunning. Based on Mike Mignola's cult comic book character, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a demon brought to earth by evil scientists and then put to use fighting the supernatural in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Along with his fellow agents, the man-fish Abe Sapien and fire-starter Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), Hellboy takes on an evil power that threatens a mankind that will always treat them like outcasts. I have never read the comic book but after watching the film I kind of want to. Guillermo Del Toro does a great job of directing and keeps the film moving at a nice pace. Even the non action scenes of Hellboy are nice because there's a lot of humor in the story. The action scenes itself are cool and are done well. The cast is pretty good with Ron Perlman playing Hellboy and I think he was perfectly casted for the role. Also there's Selma Blair and she does a decent job but she's not that good of an actress. The problem with Hellboy is that its hard to root for the main character because he isn't very nice. Also Hellboys enemies aren't very interesting and the movies running time of two hour plus starts to wear you down. However, the film should satisfy fans of the comic book and comic book fans in general. Rating 7/10, entertaining at most parts and its worth a look.",7,1,1,12 March 2005
Hero," It's a good film but not a great one
","Hero is a pretty good film but it's not as good as I would have thought. Jet Li plays the warrior Nameless, who has defeated three assassins sworn to assassinate the king of his region. As he tells the story of how he defeated them, it becomes obvious that every story can be told a number of different ways. The plot is pretty good and sounds interesting enough, while the execution was pretty good as well. Hero is visually stunning and it has a lot of breath taking fight scenes. The fight scenes are done well but the rest of the movie isn't really worth noting. I'm not saying its terrible but it's just not very interesting to watch and it was kind of boring. However, the film is only 94 minutes long so it didn't bother me to much. Its kind of hard to judge the acting but I did like Jet Li a long with the rest of the cast. Yimou Zhang does a decent job of directing keeping the film at a slow pace which can sometimes be annoying. I did like the way they carried out the story of how he told how he defeated everyone. The cinematography was amazing as well and if it had not been nominated for best foreign picture then I'm pretty sure it would have taken home some Oscars. Rating 7/10 a pretty amazing film at some points however not all of it is like that. Hero is still worth checking out though especially if you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",4,3,6,19 March 2005
Wimbledon," Enjoyable Piece of Fluff
","Wimbledon is an enjoyable piece of fluff but it does very little to try to distinguish itself from the other films in the same genre. In this romantic sports comedy, Paul Bettany plays Peter Colt, a tennis player whose bad luck changes when he scores a wild card entry into the Wimbledon tournament. There he meets and falls in love with American tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), but can his luck hold out for much longer? The plot sounds stupid but the two leads really help make this film more watch able. Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst have enough chemistry between them to make you care about the film more while your watching it. They make the film enjoyable to watch and have some funny scenes together as well. The only problem I had with them was their age. Peter is 31 but Lizzie's age is never revealed. The relationship seemed kind of wrong since she could have been 18 or something. The rest of the cast all give good performances as well and my favorite supporting character was James McAvoy, who played Peter's brother. Richard Loncraine directs and does a decent job but doesn't really try anything new either. There is really nothing wrong with this film as its executed well. Its just a film we have all seen before and we have seen it done better. This film is very by-the-numbers and its hard not to see where its going. Its not that long though as its only 98 minutes long so its not too much of a punishment to watch. If you don't like tennis then avoid this film as it will most likely bore you to tears. If you do enjoy tennis then this film might be worth checking out. I do enjoy playing tennis but I don't really watch it. Luckily, the tennis matches in this film are exciting to watch. In the end, this film isn't horrible but it really isn't very memorable either so if you enjoy tennis and your in the mood for a piece of harmless fluff then rent this film, If you don't, then its better if you just skip this film.

Million Dollar Baby," Not the best picture of the year but still pretty good
","Million Dollar Baby is one of the best pictures you will see all year. A young woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is taken under the wing of a crotchety boxing trainer (Clint Eastwood) and his long-time friend, a retired boxer played by Morgan Freeman, as she tries to become the women's boxing champion. The plot is nothing new but they certainly do a good job of making old material feel and look good. The story was just executed so well that I really got into the film. The screenplay may be full of clichés but the film is able to rise above those to pretty great heights. Some of the movie isn't very realistic but that's just a few of the scenes. The characters are all interesting but they could have done a better job with Maggie's family. The boxing scenes may not be as good as the ones in Rocky but they are still done pretty well. The acting is great and probably some of the best you will see all year. Hilary Swank sure makes up for The Core with this knockout performance. Morgan Freeman does a good job too but I'm not really sure if he deserved an Oscar for this. Clint Eastwood did a great job of directing keeping the film at a nice pace and he did a good job acting as well. The film is 132 minutes long but it didn't feel that long since the film keeps you interested. Even though most of the film is pretty predictable there are still a couple of twists that may take you by surprise. The ending is pretty depressing and it made me want to cry since she had gone all that way and went through all that training and wanted to die like that. It was a very emotionally powerful film that will pull on the heartstrings at some scenes. Rating 9/10 a very good film while it may not be perfect its still worth watching.",8,0,0,1 April 2005
Shrek 2," Better then the original
","Shrek 2 is a fun movie to watch for the whole family and it improves over the original. Shrek 2 continues the story with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) going with his new wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), to meet his in-laws, the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, which bears more than a resemblance to Beverly Hills. But are they ready for their new ogre son-in-law and their daughter's new look? The King (voiced by John Cleese) seems to have his own plans and he enlists the aid of the Fairy Godmother and Puss in Boots to get what he wants. They plot is good and the execution is pretty good considering that most animated sequels are pretty cheap. I thought the first Shrek was okay nothing special but this one was a lot more funnier. I think what makes this movie work better then the first is the additional characters. Puss In Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas is hilarious and I thought he was a good addition to the cast. Of course having Mike Myers as Shrek was funny too and Eddie Murphy is still to annoying and he was the only reason why I didn't give this movie a ten. Cameron Diaz is good too but I felt she didn't really do anything special. Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are all great additions to the cast and make this movie charming. The movie is quick and short but is able to leave so many funny moments you wonder why other comedies don't try this hard. Shrek 2 is the best kids movie I have seen this year and proves that even with a simplistic plot you can still let adults enjoy it. The story, the characters, the direction and the dialog are all smart and funny. Rating 8/10 perfect movie except for Eddie Murphy and everyone should watch.",6,24,50,25 November 2004
Saw II," Disturbingly Good
","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the methodical serial killer from Saw, is back! This time, he's pitted against a tough detective (Donnie Wahlberg), who must try to save his son and others from a house of horrors filled with deadly nerve gas, puzzles and death traps.Saw 2 is just as scary and suspenseful as the original. The death traps are very creative and some of the twists are unpredictable. The original Saw was a very suspenseful film that actually terrified its audience. The sequel is more or less the same except its much bloodier. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you but it was fine by me. There were more scary, over the top gory scenes in this film then in the original Saw. There were more characters as well and that kind of hurt the film since they were all one dimensional. Some of them didn't even share their story of why they were there. The acting was well not so good. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has seen the original film.Tobin Bell probably gives the best performance as Jigsaw. This guy is defiantly very scary and very creepy. You see a lot more of him this time around so it made the film better. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective who is trying to hunt down the people being tortured. He does a decent job though nothing special. Shawnee Smith plays Amanda and she also gives a decent performance. Everyone else was either too over the top or under performed. The worst was Beverley Mitchell but she's from 7th Heaven so that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. James Wan didn't direct this one and it shows. The original relied more on suspense to scare its audience while this one focuses more on disturbing scenes. There were disturbing scenes in Saw but that wasn't what the film was really about. So, the director for Saw 2 isn't as good as Wan. Also, the film is too short so the story feels rushed and its not as effective as it could have been. Like the original, it's hard to feel sorry for the characters because they do bad things and are so unlikable but that's just me. In the end, Saw 2 is a very gory and violent sequel that lives up to the original. Rating 8/10.",7,6,10,19 April 2006
Pride & Prejudice," A Delightful and Beautiful Film
","In this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel, Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennett, a rebellious young woman who refuses to marry the wealthy man her mother (Brenda Blethyn) has picked for her, although it would save her family from poverty. Meanwhile, her four sisters deal with their own suitors, including the mysterious Mr. Darcy.I'll admit that I have never read the novel and period pieces don't really interest me so I wasn't expecting much from this movie. However, Pride and Prejudice is a solid film with an engaging romance and strong characters. The best part about the film is probably the cinematography. The whole film just looks fantastic and it has a very engaging hook to it that just please the eyes. Director Joe Wright does a good job behind the camera. He captures the romance nicely and he moves the film at a nice pace. Sometimes, the film moves slowly but the actors get it out of the rough patches.Out of the entire cast, I would say that Donald Sutherland gives the best performance. It seemed a little simple but it was still pretty nice. Keira Knightley also gives a good performance though I don't agree with her Oscar nomination. Her character is portrayed as a different girl and not one that giggles at everything. In the beginning of the film, Keira is too giggly and it didn't fit the character though she gets better as the film progresses. Rosamund Pike gives a good performance even if her character is a little dull. Jena Malone gives an annoying performance but it fits her character so I would say that she did a good job. Brenda Blethyn gives a funny performance as Elizabeth's mother and she has some memorable scenes with Donald Sutherland.Matthew Macfadyen also gives a strong performance and he has great chemistry with Keira. The two of them make a predictable story engaging at times thanks to their performances. There were a couple of things that I didn't like about the movie though. There were a few cheesy scenes that were kind of unnecessary. For example, at the end of the film when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are kissing, there is this huge yellow sunset in the background and I felt that it was a little too much. Of course some things are just unavoidable in chick flicks. The screenplay is pretty good though I don't know how faithful it is compared to the book. The score is also pretty good and it's easy to tell why it got nominated for an Oscar. Most of the film is just top notch and it's defiantly a film for both girls and guys. In the end, this wonderful surprise is worth checking out. Rating 8/10",7,11,18,4 July 2006
Saw," A Scary and Effective Thriller
","Saw is one of the scariest movies of 2004 and its a must see for any horror fan. Two men wake up in a deserted basement chained to the pipes with a dead body between them, only to learn that they're trapped by a sadistic serial killer dubbed 'Jigsaw,' to play a deadly game of kill or be killed. Apparently, this maniac has been doing this sort of thing for a awhile and he an obsessed detective (Danny Glover) is hot on his trail. The plot sounds very interesting and for the most part the film doesn't disappoint. The main actor in this film is Cary Elwes who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon and plays his role effectively. Danny Glover plays the obsessed cop and also does very well. Monica Potter plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon's wife however she isn't in the film for very long. There are some truly horrifying scenes in Saw and one scenes that almost made me want to throw up. Saw is similar to Seven and even though it isn't as good its still worth a look. James Wan does a great job of directing and hopefully will have more opportunities to direct in the future. The ending is done very well and I didn't see all the twists and turns coming. However in the end you don't really care about the characters because they do bad things. I found it hard to have sympathy on some of them but that's just me. There are some stupid moments in the film though but not as many as the typical horror film. Rating 7/10 a very gruesome horror flick that's worth a look.",7,0,0,12 February 2005
National Treasure," National Treasure is not an Oscar quality film but it could make for a fun night at the cinema
","National Treasure is a fun movie to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. The story is that hundreds of years ago, the country's Founding Fathers hid the world's greatest treasure somewhere in the world. Centuries later, a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) tries to put together the clues in order to find and protect the treasure from his adversary (Sean Bean) while staying ahead of the FBI. Just getting the map, printed on the back of the Declaration of Independence, might prove to be his biggest challenge. The plot sounds ridiculous but once you learn who's behind it then it makes sense. Nicholas Cage stars as Ben and he is pretty good. Diane Kruger is very beautiful and she does a very good job in this film. Jerry Bruckheimer, for the most part, always makes entertaining films and this one is pretty good. The action is solid and the direction is pretty good. The dialogue has some lame lines but that has to be expected in this type of film. The film is 131 minutes long so there some boring scenes and the film is pretty predictable as there's nothing new. It has a PG rating so its a fun movie for the entire family. Rating 7/10 a pretty entertaining action flick that's worth watching if you can get past its high improbable plot.",6,2,2,24 February 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Pretty Good Summer Blockbuster
","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play husband and wife 'John and Jane Smith', a seemingly ordinary couple living in the suburbs, who each have a secret that they keep from each other: they're assassins for competing organizations. Their marriage is put to the test when they're assigned to kill each other, adding even more excitement to their romance.Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't the best film of the summer but if you're looking for some mindless fun then this movie should fit the bill. It offers enough explosions and romance to engage the viewer and the film hardly ever gets boring. The script is the only thing that keeps the movie back from truly succeeding. It is riddled with holes and some large ones as well. Of course, they didn't even occur to me until the movie had finished. This shows that the film is quite engaging if it can take your mind off the problems with the story. The screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg and he was behind Elektra and XXX 2. So, it's no surprise the script is weak since he probably only focuses on the action sequences and not the actual plot and character development.The acting is pretty good and the actors make up for the weak script. Angelina Jolie offers a very good performances and she looks amazing on screen. Her co-star also gives a good and funny performance. Together, Pitt and Jolie have more than enough chemistry to carry the movie and the film works so well because of them. Vince Vaughn is the highlight of the supporting cast and his performance is pretty funny. His role may not be very big but every time he appears on screen, he manages to keep the audience laughing. Adam Brody gives a terrible performance and he isn't funny at all. Luckily, his role is small so he doesn't hurt the film too much.Doug Liman does a decent job behind the camera but I was expecting a little more since he also directed The Bourne Identity. He does a nice job with the action sequences and the film has a very nice style to it. However, the movie still felt a little ordinary and I don't think he really took full advantage of this interesting premise. If you do give the film a shot, keep in mind that this is a summer blockbuster and not an Oscar quality movie. It entertains the eyes and it won't make you think. In the end, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is worth checking out in theaters. Rating 7.3/10",7,54,91,6 July 2005
War of the Worlds," With great expectations comes disappointment
","Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a divorced father, who is taking care of his two kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) for the weekend, when strange occurrences like lightning storms and blackouts pave the way for a full-scale alien invasion.If I had to describe War of the Worlds in one word it would be disappointing. It was a pretty good summer blockbuster but you would expect so much more from Spielberg and Cruise. It did get a lot of things right though. The special effects are amazing and the 132 million dollar budget was put to good use. There were plenty of moments of suspense and fun to be found here as well. The film was scary because it felt so realistic. It was just handled so well and Spielberg did a great job at that. He really knows how to build suspense and create a nice, spooky atmosphere.The acting wasn't as strong as everything else though. Tom Cruise gives an okay performance but he was a little annoying. Dakota Fanning redefined over the top with her performance. It just felt so forced and unconvincing. She usually is a pretty good actress but here she was really unbearable. Justin Chatwin was somehow even worse and his performance was very annoying. I was kind of disappointed to see him survive at the end of the movie. Tim Robbins deserves a Razzie (no that's not a hyperbole) for his incredibly bad performance. It was hard to tell if he was actually joking or not. Miranda Otto appears in the film for about 15 minutes but after watching The Flight of the Phoenix, that's probably a good thing.While Spielberg does a good job with most of the film, he stumbles badly at the end. The ending was too Hollywood and unrealistic. Up until that point, the film was pretty realistic but the ending killed that realism completely. The movie could have been better if it didn't have such a happy ending. The only thing that was missing was Ray (Cruise) getting back together with his wife. The second half of the movie isn't as strong as the first half either. There were a lot of dull moments that slowed down the film. Also, the movie doesn't have a very good repeat value. It's worth watching once and that's pretty much it, well for me anyways. In the end, I will always remember War of the Worlds as a good disappointing film and as a missed opportunity.

Wedding Crashers," Incredibly Funny
","John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are life-long friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions, where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies. Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a high-profile politician (Christopher Walken) go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter (Rachel McAdams) and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her familywho just happen to be completely nuts! Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly, the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together, Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay, nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does, it could have still been edited. Also, the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing, the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value, at least for me. In the end, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out. Rating 8/10",8,50,81,7 May 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," There are some funny moments but its still an average comedy
","Anchorman has some funny moments but their not a lot of them and in the end the film is a disappointment. It's the 70s and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the quintessential television anchorman for a San Diego television station, but his world is turned upside down when an ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate) infiltrates his territory when she tries to become the network's first female anchorperson. Will this be a battle of the sexes turn into all-out war or will love conquer all? The plot sounds really funny and I was really looking forward to watching this film since Will Ferrell is in it. But it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Anchorman feels and looks like an SNL skit that's extended to a feature film. The jokes are either hit or miss but the ones that are funny are usually very funny. I still enjoyed Anchorman since it has some of the funniest lines I have heard in awhile but it was a little disappointing. Will Ferrell did an awesome job and of course he is the best part about Anchorman. I think they should have casted someone else instead of Christina Applegate since she was kind of boring. The supporting cast is great including Fred Willard, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Out of all of them I would say that Steve Carell was the funniest and he makes up for the awful Sleepover. Adam McKay directs and he does a good job. He also writes for SNL so that's probably why the comparisons to SNL and Anchorman are so easy to find. The films running time is only 94 minutes so unless you find the premise really irritating you can easily survive though the film. There's also a lot of cameos and some scenes that are very funny and defiantly worth watching. Rating 6/10 not the funniest movie of the year but its worth checking out now that its out on video.",5,23,49,12 March 2005
Hitch," Often Very Funny and Worth Watching
","Will Smith is Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, a long-time bachelor who has become known as the New York City 'date doctor' who charges to help men get the women of their dreams. Although he helps all these other men, he somehow is not able to have nearly as much success with Sara (Eva Mendes), the woman he himself loves.Hitch is a safe yet funny and entertaining romantic comedy. The premise sounds pretty good and the execution is also pretty good. Yes, it is very predictable and kind of cheesy. However, that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I think Hitch is better than most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year because the characters are likable and Smith & Mendes have enough chemistry together to make the film work. Will Smith is very charming as Hitch. He plays the role well and he never gets annoying. It's also nice to see him in a film that doesn't involve a bunch of things blowing up. Eva Mendes also gives a pretty good performance and she is also very pretty.Surprisingly, the best thing about Hitch is Kevin James. His performance is funny and also pretty realistic. The only problem is that most of his scenes appear in the trailer and this lessens the effect. I never really liked him before but now I hope he makes more movie appearances. Out of the four main actors, Amber Valletta is the weakest. She gives an average performance and she just doesn't fit well with the other three. The rest of the supporting actors are also pretty funny, especially the customers that ask Hitch for help.The only problem I really have with Hitch is that it plays it too safe. If it was a little more edgier than the film could have been really good but it still stands an enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not really surprising that the film is safe since Andy Tennant is the director. He directed It Takes Two and Sweet Home Alabama. He's like the king of harmless, fluff films and Hitch is his best work to date. Another thing that bothered me was the running time. 118 minutes is too long for a predictable story and it does take a toll on the audience. I think it's bad since the story is by-the-numbers and the film takes awhile to reach obvious places. If it was a little shorter, than it would have been fine. In the end, Hitch is an enjoyable romantic comedy and one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Rating 8/10",6,41,62,29 June 2005
Ray," Nicely Made Biopic With Only A Few Flaws
","Ray is a well made picture full of great music and fine performances. Jamie Foxx plays the late great singer-songwriter Ray Charles in a bio drama from director Taylor Hackford. As he learns to cope with his blindness, Charles' career was plagued with drugs, discrimination and marital indiscretions, although his wife Della was there to help him through it all. Ray Charles sure is very talented and very interesting so making a biography as a film needed to be handled well. Fortunately, the film turned out to be better then expected. The best thing about Ray is Jamie Foxx as Ray. He gave a really good and moving performance. I used to think he was very average but he certainly proved me wrong. He really did deserve to win that Oscar for best actor. The rest of the cast also gave good performances. Kerry Washington plays Ray's wife and I think she did a fine job. Regina King usually appears in comedies such as Legally Blonde 2 and Daddy Day Care. Her performance in this film though was very good and it really surprised me. She should start picking better roles then appearing in Miss Congeniality 2. Those three really stood out from everyone else but the rest of the supporting cast also gave good performances. Taylor Hackford did a fine job of directing and makes up for making Proof of Life. Ray has all the biopic elements to make this film real and interesting. Ray covers overcoming hard times, drugs, relationship problems and everything else. There are some problems with the film though, like it does have a lot of clichés. The ending was moving and sad but at the same time it was kind of cheesy. The film is kind of sad to watch at times as Ray's life had a lot of tragic moments like when his younger brother dies. The music is great and its really nice to listen too. Its also nice to see how Ray came up with all songs. The running time of 150 minutes goes by pretty fast as the film does a good job of keeping the viewer watching closely and listening closely. While I like Ray a lot, I think that The Aviator is the better film of the two. In the end, this a strong film and its defiantly was worthy of its best picture nomination.

Music and Lyrics," An entertaining film thanks to the natural chemistry between Barrymore and Grant
","Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a has-been '80s pop star is given the chance to write a song for a reigning pop diva, but having not written a hit song in years, he needs help with the lyrics. Along comes Sophie Fischer (Drew Barrymore), a quirky florist whose knack for words makes her the perfect collaborator for writing a song that can help revive Alex's career.Generally, romantic comedies aren't my favorite genre because most of the time the two leading stars lack a certain chemistry to make predictable material seem interesting. Fortunately, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are great together and watching them on screen was pretty entertaining. The material was of course rather stale yet there were still plenty of interesting scenes and moments so the film never managed to get dull.The premise was actually pretty good and the music video that opens the film was great. I loved the way it spoofed all those cheesy styles from the 80's. Beyond the premise and the opening scene, things were pretty standard which is okay because the cast was strong. Director and screenwriter Marc Lawrence was just doing his usual tricks. If you have seen 'Two Weeks Notice' or 'Miss Congeniality' then you should expect the same type of humor. I kind of wish he would add a little more edge to the material but still quite a decent screenplay.Hugh Grant was giving his routine performance although it still worked fine. Drew Barrymore was also pretty good and she had many funny lines. Most people I know can't stand her at all but I usually find her pretty charming. Kristen Johnston was great and I hope to see more of her in the future because after her show was ended, she seemed to have disappeared. The rest of the cast gave acceptable performances except for Haley Bennett who was quite annoying and her character got old very fast. Overall, Music and Lyrics is nothing mind-blowing but it is a fun little flick that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",7,0,0,16 May 2007
Identity," Agatha Christie would be proud
","Identity is a very good thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Ten strangers with secrets are brought together in a savage rainstorm: A limo driver, an '80s TV star, a cop who is transporting a killer, a call girl, a pair of newlyweds and a family in crisis, all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager. Relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. The plot is nothing new but the film is still effective. There are some really surprising twits while others you can probably see coming. The film is also very scary especially since the setting is at some creepy motel in the middle of no where. The acting is pretty good with the best being John Cusack. He is kind of underrated though he has proved in the past that he can play any type of role. Amanda Peet is good though she tends to play the same character in every film. Ray Liotta does a good job as well. The rest of the cast include Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina and John Hawkes. James Mangold directs and does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right until the end. The film is only 90 minutes long so it won't take up to much of your time. Though because of that, the characters aren't as interesting as they would had been if it was longer. The problem I had with Identity was the ending as it was kind of stupid. Everything before the ending though is entertaining and all the twists are done well even if their not original. But the ending nearly kills the film and if it would if everything before wasn't good. Still Identity is defiantly one of the better thrillers of 2003 and it's a must see. In the end, this a pretty good film but the ending nearly ruins the film. Rating 8.3/10, worth checking out.",6,2,4,22 May 2005
Shall We Dance," Enjoyable but Forgettable
","Shall We Dance doesn't break any new ground but those who just want a good time will find it with this film. Richard Gere plays John Clark, a lawyer who feels the need to spice up his stagnating marriage (to Susan Sarandon, no less) by taking ballroom dance lessons from a beautiful and mysterious younger woman (Jennifer Lopez). The plot is okay it just sounds kind of boring. The movie for the most part isn't boring. Its actually quite entertaining. I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two but the original is probably better. I was expecting this film to be horrible as the trailer and early buzz weren't that good but they must have fixed the problems. The cast is pretty good with the best being Susan Sarandon. She does a very good job and she has a fair amount of screen time. Richard Gere does a good job playing John, nothing great but nothing terrible either. Jennifer Lopez's performance isn't very strong and the role didn't really seem to fit her. She gets by with an average performance though. The rest of the supporting cast are very funny and they keep this film moving. Out of all of them, Stanley Tucci was probably the best as Link. His performance of trying to be a young dancer was very funny. There are other interesting characters as well that are in the dance school and are fun to watch them. Peter Chelsom directs and he sure knows how to make this type of film work as he directed the very entertaining Serendipity. The only problem with this film is that its too predictable. Its very by the numbers and doesn't even try to stray away from the familiar path that most romantic comedies take. There was also a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Gere so there scenes together weren't very good or interesting. The running time of 106 minutes goes by fast. The dancing itself was actually pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. In the end, this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. Rating 7/10, entertaining but forgettable.",5,21,33,6 June 2005
Fantastic Four," So-So Superhero Film
","During a failed experiment in space, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Dr. Victor Von Doom are bombarded by cosmic rays, changing their molecular systems and giving them superpowers. Four of them become the superhero team, the Fantastic Four, while Doom becomes their new enemy. The Fantastic Four is far from fantastic but it does make for decent entertainment. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. This is good news and bad news. The good part is that the film doesn't take itself so seriously and the movie ends up being mildly enjoyable. On the other hand, it becomes silly and cheesy with laughable acting and events. Also, the movie is actually kind of dull. There are some fun spots (like the bridge scene) but there is really no spark to the film. The blame should go to Tim Story and his lack of imagination. He keeps the film bland and dull but he shouldn't get all the blame. He is working with a cheesy and weak script courtesy of Michael France and Mark Frost. If the writing had been a little better and the direction a little sharper then the film could have been better but it stands as a mediocre one. The acting is a mix bag with some good performances and a couple of bad ones. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm. He seems to be having a blast and his performance is contagious. It's also nice to see something different. Usually in super hero movies, the superheroes are moody and they just want a normal life, which isn't a bad thing. However Johnny Storm actually wants to show off and he considers his new powers to be a blessing and not a curse. On the opposite side of Johnny Storm, you have Ben Grimm played by Michael Chiklis. He is the exact opposite and he wants to give rid of his powers. His situation is pretty sad since his fiancé leaves him and it's hard for him to really live a normal life. Chiklis gives a good performance and it was a little heartwarming. Jessica Alba gives a bad performance as Sue Storm. She is unconvincing as a scientist and her emotions feel fake. Ioan Gruffudd is actually somehow worse and he can't really act. His chemistry with Jessica Alba is almost non existent. The only other person worth mentioning is Julian McMahon and he plays Dr. Victor Von Doom. I think he makes a good bad guy and he gives a decent performance. Despite the lack of quality in the film, Fantastic Four is pretty harmless. There is nothing here that should really offend anyone and it works better with kids than with adults or teenagers. The film has some things going for it though. The special effects are at least above average and the movie provides decent eye candy. As previously noted, there are some performances that stood out so the whole experience isn't a complete waste of time. However, The Fantastic Four is still a disappointment. In the end, the movie is worth a rental at the most, in my opinion. Rating 5/10",4,68,105,6 July 2006
Coach Carter," The Only Highlight Here Is Samuel L. Jackson
","Based on a real life story that made national news in 1999, Samuel Jackson plays Coach Ken Carter, the controversial high school basketball coach who benched his entire undefeated team due to their poor performance in their classes.I admire the message from Coach Carter but I did not actually like the movie. The story is your typical sports movie with all the clichés. The film is also based on a true story though I wonder how much of that truth was put into the movie. The film was very unrealistic at times and this brought down the quality. For example, the number of push-ups and suicides he makes them do every day is flat out ridiculous. There were a few other annoying parts but they didn't bring down the film too much. I also didn't like the way this movie handled abortion. Kyra (Ashanti) is pregnant and she is really excited about having the baby. Until, she breaks up with her boyfriend and she gets an abortion. She tells him this and all he says is, 'aw man you should have told me, so I could have been there with you'. This response was really stupid as was the whole subplot. This whole thing felt like MTV's approach to the problem, like it doesn't really matter.The acting is quite strong and it is the only thing Coach Carter has going for it. Samuel L Jackson was great as Coach Carter and he made the film. If it wasn't for his presence, than the film would have been worse. Everyone on the basketball team also gave good performances though no one really stands out. Also, none of the characters were very interesting. Ashanti proves she can act with a decent performance here. However, she doesn't get a lot of screen time.Sport clichés are pretty much unavoidable. It doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that there really isn't anything new. Miracle and Friday Night Lights were both clichéd yet both were good films. I can't really say the same for Coach Carter though. The film was just too long for a predictable story and it also lacked compelling characters. Miracle was also 134 minutes long yet it had interesting characters and it wasn't as dull. Even the basketball games in Coach Carter weren't very interesting and this hurt the film for me.The movie also pounds it's message into the viewer's head without really giving a good argument. Yes, school should come first but it would be different in this case because most of the players only have basketball to rely on. They come from a poor neighborhood and even if they do get their grades up, most will still not go to college. The end of the film kind of proved that as only six of the players actually went to college. Even if they didn't go to college, the fact that they still tried to make something of themselves is still a nice message. Though I think the players should have focused more on basketball if that was their stronger point. In the end, I would still recommend Coach Carter but it really didn't do anything for me.

The Pursuit of Happyness," Despite featuring a few heartwarming moments and fine performances, the film was uninteresting and forgettable
","Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is the type of guy everyone knows and most have been at one point in their life or another - the working poor. He's smart and diligent but unable to catch a break and falling further and further behind in his responsibilities to everything except his young son (Jaden Smith) whom he'd promised to always be around for, no matter the circumstances.The Pursuit of Happiness is heartwarming in parts but as a whole, the film wasn't very engaging or memorable. The whole thing just felt too manipulative and I think they tried way too hard to get the audience to feel sorry for the main character. For instance, the first half of the film was mostly depressing to watch because the 'hero' of the movie was in a bad state so it was hard to watch him suffer. We had to see all of these unlucky scenes and moments where Chris just couldn't catch a break. It got really annoying after awhile to have the film show all of this and it just proved that it was clear pity draining.The direction proved to be quite lame and it was a big reason to why the movie wasn't very appealing to me. The pacing was on the slow side and it was unbearable at times. This had to do with the fact that the main character himself wasn't very likable so it got tiring to watch him for nearly two hours. We were supposed to root for him which was easy to do because of his situation but I never really viewed him as an interesting person and he was actually pretty selfish. He took on a six month internship which didn't pay any money and he was surprised that his wife wasn't happy with that decision. Even though everything worked out in the end, I don't believe he should have taken that job because his family was in a bad situation already. I admire his determination to get out of the unfortunate situation but not the way he chose to do so.The most positive thing about the film was the relationship between Will Smith and Jaden Smith. I know that they are related in real life so filming these scenes was probably an easy thing to do yet they did have an appealing relationship and watching them together made you root for Chris a little more because you want the best for the kid. However, I don't believe Will Smith deserved an Oscar nomination. He was really good but there were better performances from 2006. Thandie Newton deserved a razzie for her performance. She was ridiculously over the top and very fake. She had no control of her emotions and was just generally awful. Overall, The Pursuit of Happiness features a few heartwarming moments but for the most part, it didn't really appeal to me. Rating 5/10",5,4,6,29 July 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Great sequel that improves on the original
","The Bourne Supremacy is a very entertaining action movie and even though it feels and looks like the original its still a great sequel. In The Bourne Identity, sleeper agent/assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) went on the run from his own agency, the CIA, when they tried to take him out of commission. Although he thought his troubles were over, he is forced back into the life when he is framed for a botched CIA operation, so he takes the fight back to them while trying to find out more about his past and the memories that haunt him. The plot is very good and it is carried out well by a talented cast. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat and you most likely won't be bored. The best new addition to the cast is Joan Allen and she gives a really good performance. Matt Damon is once again Jason Bourne and he gives a great performance. Brian Cox is also back and I like him this time around because he dies and you don't have to deal with him anymore. The last main part of the cast is Julia Stiles and she may actually have a future ahead of her in Hollywood. Paul Greengrass directs and he does a good job of replacing Doug Liman. The direction is really good and it keeps its audience interested and it keeps you guessing right until the end. Some people will complain that there's nothing new and its not worth the time to watch but its a lot more exciting then the original. Rating 8/10 a nearly flawless action movie that improves over the original. I recommend you see this movie it won't disappoint you.",8,23,36,6 February 2005
Hustle & Flow," A combination of strong acting, realistic direction, nice music and real emotions
","D-Jay (Terrence Howard) is a pimp from Memphis trying to do more with his life. When he learns that a hugely successful rapper, played by Ludicrous, is returning home to Memphis, he plans to become a rapper himself, writing songs about life as a pimp in hopes of being discovered. Hustle and Flow is an inspiring, engaging and intense film of becoming something. The majority of the film is realistic with relatable characters and situations. It shows the many struggles of life and it proves that hard work does pay off. The beginning of the film was a little tough to watch because of the living style of the main characters. It was a little scary to see what some people have to do just to get by. I think director Craig Brewer did a fine job at portraying these situations without making them seem too cheesy or over the top. The second half of the film focused on D-Jay and his struggles to find his right music. The music is surprisingly good and meaningful. I say 'surprisingly' because rap doesn't really interest me but the film actually made it tolerable. The lyrics don't hold back and they may be offensive to some. I thought they were okay and they had more to do about life rather than the usual stuff you hear in rap songs. My favorite scenes were the ones that took place in the recording room. As cheesy as this may sound, they were more inspirational and engaging. It showed different types of people working together and coming up with some nice material. The final act features D-Jay meeting with Skinny Black and hoping his songs get picked up by him. The conversation between Skinny and D-Jay was pretty good but it was also a little depressing. It's sad to have someone lie right to your face about how good you are and then find your music in the toilet. It just shows how tough the real world is and it makes D-Jay tougher for not giving up. The ending wasn't as strong as everything else. It was a little cheesy and unrealistic. However in some ways, it was nice to see a sort of happy ending.The acting is terrific and everyone gives a good performance. Terrence Howard plays D-Jay and he gives a very engaging performance. His character isn't very likable but it was easy to root for him. His performance was just that good. Taryn Manning is just as good as Terrence and she also deserved an Oscar nomination. I can't believe this is the same girl from Crossroads considering her performance is really strong. I don't really like Anthony Anderson but even he gave a good performance and it was easily his best performance ever. Taraji P. Henson and DJ Qualls are also just as good as the other actors. Personally, I think Ludicrous gave a better performance in this film than in Crash. While the film is pretty good, it's not for everyone. Most of the characters are unlikable due to their lifestyles and attitudes. Some people may find it hard to care about these characters if they think so low about them. Also, the women in this movie are mistreated and some people may be disgusted by this. The story is also unoriginal and it there were a few clichés. Personally, I thought that the acting and the direction were strong enough to overcomes these weaknesses. In the end, Hustle and Flow is a difficult film to watch at times but it's still a strong film that's worth checking out. Rating 9/10",7,6,8,28 July 2006
Cinderella Man," A Heartwarming Film
","The latest film from director Ron Howard follows the Depression-era boxing career of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), who retires after a number of defeats. Because he still has to support his wife (Renée Zellweger) and children, Braddock returns to boxing when he has a chance to fill-in for someone in a high profile match. His unexpected win over the #1 contender begins a series of victories that get the masses behind this true-life underdog.I love underdog movies. They're predictable and safe but still enjoyable and heartwarming. Cinderella Man is the perfect example of a good underdog story. It does feature a bunch of clichés but the film wins the viewer over by the end. I think Ron Howard is a very good director. He kept the film on a familiar path but he still kept it entertaining. He could have edited the movie though. It was overlong and the 140 minutes was not necessary at all. It didn't take away from the quality of the film too much though. Howard portrayed the good guy well, making him extremely likable. I didn't like the way the 'bad guy' was portrayed though. In real life, Max Baer was a nice person but in Cinderella Man, he's portrayed as a cold and vile man. It was an unfair portrayal and Ron Howard shouldn't have gone over the top with it.The boxing scenes were exciting and well done. Howard captured the danger, fortitude and skill involved in boxing. The first half of the film was a little slow but still nicely done. The second half was faster and not as depressing. The ending was nicely done and very heartwarming. The film wasn't perfect though. The family scenes were too melodramatic. They all fell flat and the actors portraying the three kids weren't very good. There were also a few other cheesy moments that slowed the movie down. I blame screenwriter Akiva Goldsman for this. In my opinion, he's a weak writer and it amazes me that he was able to win an Oscar.The acting was great and pretty much everyone gave a good performance. Paul Giamatti gave a very engaging performance as Joe Gould. It was intense, realistic and he put a lot of soul into the role. Russell Crowe played Jim Braddock extremely well. His off screen behavior is questionable but he still delivers some nice performances. Renée Zellweger was just as good as Crowe and it's surprising that neither of them received nominations. After seeing Craig Bierko in Scary Movie 4, it was a little hard to take him seriously as Max Baer. He gave just an okay performance. In my opinion, Cinderella Man was a strong and heartwarming film but it wasn't anything amazing either. It was far from bland but it wasn't best picture worthy either. In the end, Cinderella Man is a fine film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",6,6,9,4 August 2006
Dodgeball," Not Stillers worst film but he has better work out there
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is as stupid as the title sounds its also a not very funny movie. In order to save their favorite local gym, a slacker (Vince Vaughn) assembles a motley group of friends into a strong enough dodgeball team to enter into an intensive competition in Vegas against the superstar team assembled by the corporation taking over the gym, led by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). The story is kind of new at least the dodgeball part but the underdog part has been used a lot. The trailer was really funny but as it always happens all of the jokes are used in the trailer and that there were no new funny jokes in the movie. The movie is only 92 minutes but it feels like its two hours especially when the theme is dodgeball and all they do is throw balls at each other. After awhile, watching someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball loses it appeal. The cast doesn't really save this movie either, first there's Vince Vaughn who is mildly funny in the movie but he should have been a lot funnier. This is Christine Taylor's first role since the hilarious Zoolander and she doesn't really add anything to the film nor does she take anything away. This is Ben Stiller's fourth film in six months and is the third best out of the four. His character is really annoying and is not very but hopefully he can rebound with Meet the Fockers. What saves this movie is the supporting cast as they bring in the laughs the best being Rip Torn and Missi Pyle. Director is Rawson Marshall Thurber, this is his first mainstream movie and he did a decent job. Rating 5/10, not a very funny film even with the talent involved.",4,0,0,28 December 2004
