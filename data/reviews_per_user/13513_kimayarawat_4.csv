Blade Runner 2049," In the league of best sequels
","Honestly, I was dreading the sequel since I came to know about it cause it's been 35 years and the main hurdle was to justify the existence of the sequel, it was just impossible to surpass or even making as brilliant as the first movie directed by Ridley Scott, it was a hard act to follow but when Denis Villeneuve came on board as a director, I was building hopes for it, afterall the guy has directed some excellent sci- fi movies. I'm glad to say this that the director has done justice to the franchise and also to the Blade Runner fans.If someone hasn't watched the first movie yet, then they should cause you need to know who are the characters and what they do cause this is very much a continuation. It's not just in the same world, it is a much later chapter in the same story with an entirely new character â€“ Ryan Gosling as K who like Harrison Ford as Deckard, hunts replicants (synthetic humans) who have escaped their owners and are considered dangerous. Where that story goes, I'll let you find out on screen, but it reaches back frequently to part one.The sequel is over two and a half hours, still it's well-paced and manages to earn it's long run time. It's used to properly chew over huge ideas and to build a world so detailed you can imagine its existence far beyond the edges of the screen. Like first, the movie is a philosophical drama in a blockbuster clothing.The story by Hampton Fancher, writer of the original, goes much deeper into the theme of what it means to be alive and of humanity as obsolete hardware. This isn't exactly an action-packed movie. Neither was the first. It leaves you more shaken than most action movies do by plunging you into a world so fascinating and enveloping that to be ripped from it and thrust back into reality brings on something like the bends.Cinematographer Roger Deakins who is well known for his ability to frame a beautiful image, Blade Runner 2049 is a breathtakingly gorgeous film to look at and that's also in no small part. When it comes to the songs and holograms, they are mere facsimiles but the emotions they evoke are real.It's a triumph with really good performances by the cast, and the crew behind the camera. With this movie, Villeneuve has again confirmed himself as one of the best director currently working in Hollywood.",Null,6,17,5 October 2017
Dunkirk," Probably the most historically inaccurate war movie
","As a person who respect Christopher Nolan as a director, I was so excited that he is finally making a war movie, but Dunkirk left me disappointed. It is probably the most historically inaccurate war movie that has ever made.There is no mention of Indian soldiers who were also fighting in Battle of Dunkirk. Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, claimed that Britons stood alone against Germany once France fell,when, in fact, hundreds of millions of Indian soldiers were also fighting with them.They were led by Mr Dawson who answers the call for a civilian armada and sets across the channel in his little boat to take part in the great evacuation.There is no room in the film for the pluck of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers from undivided India who fought for the British in that war, the largest volunteer army in history. At least four companies of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps served in France during the campaign and three contingents were evacuated from Dunkirk and one taken prisoner by the Germans.One of the evacuated officer, Jemadar Maula Daud Khan even won a Distinguished Service Medal for showing magnificent courage, coolness and decision. When his troop was shelled from the ground and bombed from the air by the enemy he promptly reorganised his men and animals, got them off the road and under cover under extremely difficult conditions, but there is nothing about him in Dunkirk.Nor does the film have any room for the many lascars who operated the merchant ships that came to rescue the British troops stranded on the beach. By 1938, one in four crewmen on merchant ships were lascars mostly from South Asia and East Africa. Instead the only brown to be seen in the film is the tea that the Englishwomen offer the English soldiers scrambling aboard the rescue boats and ships.Even the Indian mules, some 2,500 were shipped from Mumbai to Marseilles, did not get a cameo.Like I said I respect Nolan as a director but now I have realised that making a war movie is not his forte. How I wish another director or director/actor who has proved himself in making a war movie and still currently active in the Hollywood would have directed it because Dunkirk was an very important part of history that I am sorry to say, have gone bad in the hands of Nolan. I hardly write a review but others were claming it 'the mother of all realistic war movies' and I couldn't just let that go so Dunkirk compelled me to write one. My rating is 1/10 for balancing out the unwarranted 10s full of biased reviews.",Null,7,14,2 August 2017
Sultan," On the league of Bajrangi Bhaijaan
","This movie is challenging 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'.. both in terms of positive reviews by the critics and praising from the public. People are comparing Sultan to Bajrangi, gotta say Salman once again has given the best performance in his career, movie has the repeat value like watching it again and again. The director has brought out the best from Salman....Anushka surprised me as a wrestler, she was amazing, brilliant performance from both of them. This movie has class stamped all over it. Sultan is a touching love story with emotions, comedy, action & a powerful message; Never let success get to your head, it is complete winner, everything is just perfect be it acting,music,emotions,direction,cinematography.",Null,32,61,6 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Probably the worst Star Wars movie ever!
","I hated it. Although, there are many reasons but the one I would like to point out is lack of character development for Snoke, no backstory and origin and then killing him just like that. Same thing goes for Rey's parents, for two years they were trying to tell us that who are her parents, then we found out they are basically nobodies. Casino scenes were so pointless. Leia flying scenes, wtf was that!? and slapstick humour every 10 minutes...I mean, there is a time and place for funny moments, but even serious scenes are getting ruined by so much jokes. It's like I was watching a parody of Star Wars and I like watching parodies but Star Wars movie should feel like a Star Wars movie, you know like dark and gritty. Overall, the movie in this trilogy felt like 'Attack of the Clones' rather than 'Empire Strikes Back'.",Null,3,5,18 December 2017
