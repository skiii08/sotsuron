The Blair Witch Project," There's not much more than great to say, but...
","When I left the theater, there were people who whispered words of disapointment, and yet, I had to wonder why.  Granted, the movie did not have the big-budget, special-effects, that you find in the current Horrors and Thrillers, such as Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  Other than that, it was so much more.  First off, this movie presents the unknown as the threat, not some guy in a mask.  Seeing that guy in a mask limits your imagination, while this unknown can be anything, and it is to each individual audience member.  Next, the acting was infinitely better than that in any big-budget box-office smash.  These people are real, and appear that way, unlike the unbalanced and weak characters in the Screams and I Knows.  The three main stars work so well together, that it appears to be a reality.  Also, with the cinematagraphy, it actually felt that the audience was right there with the characters.  I can not say enough about this film, besides that it is a refreshing break from the spoon-feed horrors that have been shoved down our throats the last couple of years, with its Hitchcock-ian style, a definite return to something that we have not seen in a long time.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
