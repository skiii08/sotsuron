Marie Antoinette," Terrible Portrayal.
","Kirsten Dunst never fails to fail. Her role as the Austrian Queen of France was acted with little effort, and carried with a heavy American accent. However it was not just Dunst's lack of talent that ruined the film; it was the lack of plot, the lack of historical consistencies, and the abundant amount of melodramatic shots of Marie walking down the middle of a walkway at Versailles with some pitiful depressing expression born of her own self indulgence. One of the only redeeming qualities of the movie was Louis 16's character which was physically accurate and well acted. The film was successful in portraying that Louis and Marie Antoinette were to young to reign, however that was done so with no plot, and no purpose. One star for effort.",1,13,19,14 October 2007
