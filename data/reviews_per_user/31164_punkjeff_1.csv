The Blair Witch Project," Unique film
","I have to give credit to the producers of the film for the creativity. But the movie is not as scary as I thought it would be. The whole plot for the movie is 'Getting Lost.' It's definitely an interesting movie, but as 'the most scary movie ever made', I don't think so. I would recommend the movie to people who don't watch it yet. If you want to see something new, not mainstream, you won't be disappointed, but if you go in there expecting to see the movie with the complicated plot, it's not like that. For people who have motion sickness, this movie certainly will make you sick, have headache. Bring some pain relieve pills with you, it will help.Overall, the film is unique in every mean, but not all that (like it's been advertised and promoted.)",Null,1,2,2 August 1999
