Resident Evil: Afterlife," 3D is not a substitute for a plot.
","There is no doubt that 3D technology has taken the whole movie- watching experience to an entirely new level. Directors like James Cameron proved themselves to be masters of 3D, taking us to an incredible universe with Avatar. But there are also directors like Paul Anderson, who seem to believe that 3D is a tool to cover up a complete absence of any vestige of a plot.I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil franchise or the video game, and I have not watched all the previous movies. But a movie should be made for everybody and not for one set of fans. Resident Evil: Afterlife falls flat on all counts: the plot is thinner than the cross- section of a human hair, the performances are plastic, the action sequences are poorly choreographed and in some cases look like straight rip-offs from The Matrix. There have been numerous movies on the same theme: a virus destroys most of humanity, and there's a small group of survivors trapped among the zombies, and they have to get to a safe house. This theme was brilliantly explored in movies such as I am Legend, adorned with Will Smith's masterpiece of a performance. But the Resident Evil series goes through it over and over again, offering nothing new. Then there are some pointless flashback scenes just to give an impression that this movie is part of some magnificent franchise. And on top of everything else, there are the added superpowers which the evil guy acquires, and the closing scene in which thousands of helicopters close in on the survivors' ship, paving the way for another sequel. Which i'm definitely not watching, nor recommending.The only bright spot of the movie is the presence of Wentworth Miller, if you're a Prison Break fan. Apart from that, the needless slow- motion stunts laced with an overdose of CGI (all in 3D) do not add up to anything resembling a movie.",1,7,16,23 September 2010
Life of Pi," A Visual Masterpiece
","How does one narrate a story like Life of Pi? And then, how does one make a movie out of it? Assuming you manage to pull it off somehow, how on earth do you find any scope for use of 3D in a movie that has no alien attacks, warring robots or swinging superheroes?Ang Lee delivers the answers to all these questions in spectacular fashion. I have read reviews comparing this movie with Avatar, and i feel it is an unfair comparison. Avatar was nothing more than a three- hour advertisement for 3D, whereas in Life of Pi, 3D becomes a part of the story itself, almost like a character in itself.The movie opens with debates on religion and spirituality, which might feel a little dull for Indian audiences, for whom these concepts are part and parcel of everyday life, but would fascinate Western audiences. Once the family of the protagonist, Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) sets sail for Canada, along with all the animals in their zoo which they plan to sell in Canada, it turns into a gripping drama. The ship sinks, and Pi finds himself adrift on a lifeboat, which he has to share with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan - and the star of the show, a Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker.The storm scenes are so realistic, and so superbly enhanced by 3D, that it would not be a bad idea to carry along seasickness bags into the movie hall. As we breeze through storms, shoals of bioluminescent fish, flying fish, exotic islands and so on - the technical prowess of the movie grips you with its brilliance. The screenplay and the camera-work, and above all, the CGI - the tiger is apparently a product of CGI - are all strong contenders for Academy awards. But the stronger point of the movie is not its technical details, but the emotional quotient. The entire drama is about the relationship between the tiger and Pi, which is among the most unusual relationships ever seen on the screen. Suraj Sharma delivers a memorable performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He showcases his remarkable ability to have you in splits with his comic timing, and at the same time moves you to tears. It's an extremely challenging role - of having to carry the entire movie on his shoulders - and Sharma does a stellar job.Towards the end, however, the movie sags down inexplicably, as if the director suddenly ran out of creative ideas and asked one of his understudies to complete the movie. Indeed, it is the last 20-odd minutes which caused me to rate it 7 rather than 9, but despite its shortcomings, Life of Pi remains a must-watch, and one of the favourites for Best Movie and Best Director awards.",7,4,8,25 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The greatest best-sellers in history deserved better movies!
","We are now just one movie (or half a book) away from the end of this franchise, and looking back at the entire series, I would say that apart from the first movie, Harry Potter has been a big mess on screen. The first movie was truly magical and the second was passable, but after that it has been a sore disappointment for most of the die-hard HP fans like me. The movies do not even come close to creating on screen the magic what J.K.Rowling has created on paper.The theme of these movies, especially part 4 onwards, has been to delete the best-described action sequences from the story. You could feel the adrenaline rush when you read the description of the Quidditch World Cup final, but where did it go in the movie? In part 5 they reduced Umbridge from an evil, devil-incarnate to a caricature merely providing comic relief, and the battle at the ministry was over before it began. Part 6 covered Dumbledore's 'classes' well but again, the students versus Death Eaters duels were cut out. All these are unpardonable crimes committed on the books, the author and more importantly, on the fans. Despite all this, I was excitedly looking forward to Deathly Hallows Part 1, because having divided the book into two parts, there was immense opportunity to transfer all the excitement of the book on to the screen, but the end result while being marginally better than the previous few movies, was still disappointing.Most of the movie was turned into an advertisement for British tourism, as we were shown endless vistas of the landscape as the trio wander across forests, hills and swamps. In the book, the period where Harry stays with the Weasleys is charged with emotion and could have been a true test of the director's abilities, but it barely lasted five minutes (including the wedding!). When Ron returns to rejoin the other two, Hermione looks mildly irritated, and not demented with rage as in the book. The Godric's Hollow sequence began well, but once Bathilda turned into a snake and attacked Harry, the action was cut out again, and there was no Voldemort appearing here! The ending was a sore disappointment as usual, because here was another opportunity for some more dueling and displays of bravery, but we hardly had half a dozen curses being cast. The Life and Lies of Dumbledore was just mentioned in passing. What gives the movie a 5/10 instead of a 1 or a 2 is the Tale of Three Brothers animated sequence, the break-in at the ministry, the graveyard scene at Godric's Hollow and marginally improved performances by the trio. I feel the best-selling book series in history deserved the best directors in Hollywood. Peter Jackson could have worked his LOTR magic here. Christopher Nolan could have best recreated the much-talked about 'dark, gloomy pallor' of the last three books. Even somebody who loves loud wham-bam action and overdoses of CGI, like Roland Emmerich of 2012, could have given us some breathtaking action sequences. But all we had was David Yates and I dunno who else. All of them effectively ruined a series of books which will be read and loved and worshipped for generations to come. I can only hope the franchise at least gets a finale it deserves. We will be finding out in July.",5,4,6,1 December 2010
Salt," what a let-down just a week after inception!
","Just a week ago, me and my friends were returning from a movie hall with our brains in overdrive, trying to decipher the numerous hidden details in Inception. This weekend, we were again racking our brains.....but this time, we were trying to make some sense of the plot which seemed to be heading here, there and everywhere.The first half of the movie was restricted to Evelyn Salt running, cops (or CIA or FBI or whoever) chasing her, running, chasing, running and chasing. While those stunts could have made hearts miss beats about forty years ago, there was nothing new about them.Just when you thought that's all the movie had to offer, it took a whole new look - suddenly it was all about assassinating heads of states, and even more amusingly, about nuclear holocausts. If this was what the movie was supposed to be about, why did we have to watch one hour of Salt-on-the-run stunts? It could have been made a lot better if the director had concentrated on the political thriller side of it.There also seemed to be a lot of impossibilities: Evelyn Salt getting into the underground chamber beneath the White House single handedly, making it look too easy. Ted Winter barely had to bat an eyelid to have the President hostage. I do not know what is the procedure to launch a nuclear attack, but if it was indeed the way it was shown in the movie, sabotaging it seemed to be a piece of cake, the way Ted did. And in the end, though Peabody helped Salt escape, it seemed highly improbable that somebody suspected of preparing to launch a nuclear war would be ferried in a chopper like a common criminal, with just one officer keeping watch on her.A rating of 5 is justified for the action sequences and the background score, but there's nothing else in the movie. Inception had left everybody hankering for more, but Salt has killed that desire.",5,8,17,26 July 2010
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Patience....
","I've never been much of a Bond movie fan. There had been about 20 offerings from the franchise, all containing the same core plot: some nut-job gets his hands on a nuclear weapon, and Bond saves the day just in time. Okay, maybe that's the way Bond movies are supposed to be. No complaints there.But then came Casino royale, packed with mind-blowing action sequences and Daniel Craig, and no nuclear bombs. It made me believe that maybe it's turning into a real action-movie franchise. No doubt expectations were running high long before Quantum of solace released. The opening car chase made me wonder if I was about to watch one of the best action movies ever.But hello, what was that, what followed? A string of 'action' sequences sewed together in order, with no credible storyline in between them to make them seem justified. The climactic scene turned out to be the bottommost point in the abyss: explosions, fire, collapsing buildings - all tailored just to give the movie an ending. And finally what did Bond achieve? Most of the top-level people in the evil organisation are killed. Done. Nothing else. Any idiot with a gun could do that. I would have preferred a nuclear weapon about to detonate and the world being saved in the nick of time, over all this mindless killing. The characters are all hollow shells: Bond is only grieving his dead love all through, and the two ladies come and go and do nothing in between their entries and exits. Eva Green, who had such a core character in Casino..., was sorely missed. Felix and the other CIA agent seem to be just a bunch of drunk punks meddling in terrorists' affairs. M seemed like a schoolteacher unable to rein down a naughty kid. The villains? Oh, please, Bond himself looked more menacing than those idiots. This better not be the theme for the Bond movies to come.",2,5,7,15 August 2010
