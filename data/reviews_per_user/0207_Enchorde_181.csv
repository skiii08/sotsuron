The Avengers," Brilliant movie!
","Avengers is a splendid movie, and that's saying after having quite large expectations. True, I liked most of the recent super hero movie (except Iron Man 2 which was a bust) but Avengers excelled and outshine them all. I feared that putting all the super heroes together would make them cancel each other out, but instead it let them exploit their individual strengths. For example, Iron Man's sharp comments and one-liners are better and sharper than ever.But above all, Avengers is an almost perfect mix of comedy and action. It says a lot when a movie running at 142 minutes never even feels long or have parts that loses tempo. Avengers is a non-stop action, without ever becoming repetitive, and spiced up with gems of humor, one-liners and jokes. Whedon should have a lot of credit for both writing and directing this with a good story but extreme care for the details. Such skill is rare and makes Avengers to an action movie masterpiece. To mention a few details I loved was Hulk's punch to Thor and Iron Man's nick Capsicle of Captain America. I only frowned when the chitauris spontaneously died when their mothership was blown up (felt too much SW 1 about it) as they were biological creatures, not robots. But that was a minor point, and the only I can recall.The casting is great and all the actors and actresses do their parts very well. An honorable extra mention to Tom Hiddleston (surprised) that in my mind makes Loki perfect, Robert Downey Jr for his brilliant one-liners and Mark Ruffalo that perhaps plays the best Hulk ever.I have to think back quite some time since I was so fully entertained by a movie. I hope sincerely there is a sequel (in the care of Whedon). There certainly is an opening for it.9/10",9,3,8,1 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," An experience
","Bladerunner 2049 picks up the story somewhat after the original Bladerunner. Replicant K is a police hunting older versions of replicants. At his latest mission he got word of a miracle, the start of a mystery that threatens the order of the world. There is talk of a replicant giving birth, which makes K question his loyalties, and his own identity.I really loved this. There is a feel to the movie, that is hard to match. I was impressed by the use of colour, light, framing and sound. Visually and audibly, this is stunning. The mystery plot don't lack much either. For once the story is given time, time to develop, time for the audience to reflect, think and feel, not just force fed action-scenes. There is time to give the pictures, the sound and colour, space to work. The pace is rather slow, making the movie rather long (almost three hours) but it is really worth it. There are some good action now and then, but the point of the movie is the mystery, and the questions of identity it rises. If you want it, there is depth. I really liked that, although it is long, no scene is unimportant. There is toughts, clues and developments everywhere. Even the reappearance of Deckard has a crucial part to play, and is not at all just a wave to fans of the old movie. I am utterly impressed by the work of director Villenueve , cinematographer Deakins and the other crew.Ironically, many of the main characters not being human, the acting is great. That Gosling and Ford are quality actors are established but both Hoeks and de Armas was pleasant new actresses. Funny that de Armas virtual character perhaps is the most human of them all.To sum up, this movie got it all. Watch it!",10,2,10,28 December 2018
Angels & Demons," A good mystery
","Recap: The Pope has died and all the world's cardinals has gathered in the Vatican for Conclave, to choose the next Pope. But the process is disturbed, four cardinals, the favorites for the election, has been kidnapped, and the entire Vatican is threatened by a batch of antimatter, with the equal explosive force of a small nuke. The Illuminati has risen again. Despite his previous works, the Vatican police bring in Professor Langdon, to help them solve a mystery heavy with mystery, symbols and hidden agendas.Comments: A sequel to The Da Vinci Code, but apart from Langdon and a few unimportant references it does not follow the previous, and can be easily watched without having seen the Da Vinci Code. What it kept is the feeling of mystery, the detective story and the intrigue. Because Angels & Demons is a very good detective story, and despite being over two hours long, the time flies by. The story is full of prime suspects, and the story is twisting its way forward. It is almost twisting too much, so that you come to expect the movie to try to fool you. Unfortunately that leads to the opposite result, the movie becomes quite predictable.It is a very well made movie, Ron Howard is a skilled and meticulous director. But what this movie lacks compared to the Da Vinci Code is the visual wizardry and the tangible historical connections. That gave that movie an extra edge, lifted it to a higher level, that Angel & Demons never reaches. Still it is a very entertaining mystery.If you, like me, likes stories that utilizes and builds on existing symbols and organizations, and puts them in a plausible but fictional story, you will enjoy this too.7/10",7,0,1,6 April 2010
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great feel good movie
","Recap: Rannulph Junuh is a promising young golfer who also has won the heart of the beautiful Adele Invergordon. But his experiences in the trenches of the first world war leave him a broken man, and he returns to Savannah a shadow of his former self, to afraid to resume his romance with Adele. Years later the depression hits and Adele's family's investment in a grand golf course and club is threatening to go bankrupt. As a last attempt Adele invites two of the best golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, to a two day competition with a grand prize of 10 000 dollars. To defend the local honor Rannulph is convinced to play, but he has lost his swing. Out of nowhere Bagger Vance appears and offers to caddie for him.Comments: A top notch feel good movie, with some romantic flair. There are some ominous feelings, mostly in Rannulph's war memories and the depression effects, but the most suspense are in the feelings between Rannulph and Adele. It's also the main point in the story, as Rannulph's play hinges on him sorting his emotions out.The acting of the three leading actors and actress is impressive and is the main benefit from the entire movie. Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very good as Rannulph, Bagger and Adele respectively. Damon's and Theron's characters are maybe the most interesting as they have their history and conflicting feelings together. But Smit's portrayal of Bagger is just stellar. He always has some wise advice to give but is also always so easy going, always with a smile on his face. There doesn't seem to be any conflicts within him, all the more impressive for Smith to make his character deep and complex.Maybe the best part is that there is no bad guys. It is too typical and too easy to have one of the competitors to be a real scum. But here both competitors are pure gentleman, and based on real golfers too. The entire movie is about to win the fight within yourself, so no exterior threat is needed. It is nice to see that they didn't take the easy way and introduced one.7/10",7,0,1,22 November 2009
Changeling," Very good drama with suspense, based on real events
","Recap: A mother, Christine Collins, stands before a horrible situation, her child, Walter, is missing. But after a few weeks of dread, the police says they found him. But at first sight, Christine knows that the boy that is returned to her is not her son. The police insists he is, and calls her delusional. The thing is, the police department is corrupt and needs a story to cover their deficiencies. If it would turn out that the boy isn't Christine's son, it would be very embarrassing. Christine continues to fight the police to continue their search, and the police throws her in a psychiatric ward to protect themselves. Fortunately Christine has allies, a reverend that has criticized the police, and rescues her. And eventually the police get a lead that may give them the truth.Comments: Based on a real story, it is hard to imagine how it would be to really experience a nightmare like that. As a movie it is interesting and quite suspenseful, especially if you don't know the real case by heart. It is well acted and directed, with a cast spearheaded by Angelina Jolie, a role she was nominated for an Oscar for. It is a little typical role, in a typical movie that plays well at the Oscars, but her performance is very good. She also got a good support from mostly Jeffrey Donovan as her characters opponent.It is rather slow in its pace, and seems to be pretty true to actual events, anyway it is very plausible. But it keeps an edge throughout the movie that keeps interest, it is hard to look away from. There is always something small, but maybe important, happening. And it is a very captivating story.Credit is due to Straczynski, the writer who has turned this real story to a good movie, supposedly from actual records from police and trial. Credit is also due to Clint Eastwood whom with his directing has converted the screenplay into a very good movie.But to be a top movie for me, it is in the wrong genre. It is not lacking much as a drama, but as a superior movie I need elements from other genres as well.7/10",7,0,4,13 March 2010
Scarface," Violent and raw
","Recap: Tony Montana arrives with many other refugees from Cuba to Miami. Uneducated with a history both in the army and in prison his prospects of a bright future in his new country is small. However, he has something going for himself, he has guts. Or as he says himself, he has balls, which is the most important ability in the world. He gets in with the drug dealers quickly working his way up through the hierarchy, often by doing the violent and dirty work. Soon he finds himself in a position to challenge for overall control of the market. But ambition and nerves of steel isn't always a good thing...Comments: A very violent film, almost seeming unrefined, but in a refreshing way. It seems true, it seems plausible and is very captivating. It is very long, almost three hours, but good a story and good acting makes sure it is never dull. There is always something happening, it simply takes long time to properly tell this story. Any shorter and pieces would probably start to fall apart.Yes it is very violent, and very raw about the action scenes. Some are quite gruesome. But this is almost a must, a reflection on Scarface's character. He is very raw, he is very violent. For him to be verbally very provocative and not follow it with action would make him feel false. For him to be credible as a violent gangster that works himself up quickly due to the violent deeds he does, earning him respect (and fear) in his environment.On the other hand, there is no unnecessary violence. There is no action or blood for the sake of being violence, or to have a shoot-out. The violence is no thrill to excite the audience. Every scene is an integral part of the story, important to paint the entire picture of Tony Montana.I also liked the attention to detail. Especially some small parts of the story, barely noticeable, to make it feel very plausible. For example look for when Tony cocks his gun in his fight with Frank. Not until Frank unknowingly has confirmed Tony's suspicion.Al Pacino does great work acting this character. Very emotional, very raw, it must have been hard not to go over the top with a character like that. I think he never does, not really anyway. Sure, he got good support from other characters and the story, but his acting is very impressive here. On the other side of the scale, but equally impressing is Michelle Pfeiffer as the stoned trophy wife that almost never shows any emotion. To only act with words. An early role, and pretty small, role for her, but impressive.All in all a very solid movie, especially if you like gangster movies. Many minutes, but not long. I can understand why this has become a classic.8/10",8,1,2,28 March 2009
The Incredible Hulk," As expected...
","Recap: Bruce is on the run. Desperate to keep hidden from the military he has fled abroad. At the same time he covertly tries to solve the riddle that he has become and rid himself from his curse. But his refuge is not to be long, and soon a team is on his trail, once again forcing The Hulk to appear. Banner returns to the States to cure himself, and in that process reconnects with Elizabeth Ross. But soon the military is upon him again, this time with a new weapon, a new threat.Comments: The Incredible Hulk contains absolutely no surprises. No twists or turns, no hidden agenda. But then, who expects that when sitting down to watch this? You get exactly what you want. Unlimited action. Special effects enough for a lifetime. A full pace from the first to the last minute. I guess that is what most expect out of this, I did anyway, and I wasn't disappointed.However, there is a drawback to this. There is little time to develop the characters. Little dialog that really develops the story. But that is not really needed, as most of us has at least a rough idea of his history and character, and if not what is needed is provided in a 0nicely done flashback introduction.It is an entertaining piece. Recommended for fans of the Hulk or fans of action movies. A little confusing though that it is mostly independent from the recent Hulk from 2003, with new actors in every role, the only remaining actor I think is Stan Lee and his cameo. Even if new, the cast is both well known and very good. Norton, Tyler, Hurt and Roth in the main roles. They all gives solid performances.But all in all this is a movie that delivers what it should, nothing less, but not anything more either. It is something to watch and forget and I was about to rate it at a 6. But then there was the ending. Really the end after the end, a scene that just as well might have appeared after the credits, I would have placed it there anyway. That elevated it all, actually. SoÂ…7/10",7,0,0,10 July 2009
The Monuments Men," Both funny and depressing
","A few selected men, picked for their knowledge in different areas of art, form a special unit that will try to rescue the art presently being looted by the Nazis all over Germany.As I said in the title, I found the movie both funny and depressing. But I could add to that, that it is interesting. It is based on real events. Although I get that many scenes and events had to be altered for dramatic effect, it doesn't change that the fact that many of the described pieces were in fact stolen and recovered. Not by a handful men as in the movie, but by a designated unit.The depressing part is that, as the movie shows, many pieces of art were lost and are still missing, their fates sometimes unknown. For example the Amber Room, which is still searched for. But perhaps the most depressing was a scene were the men find a barrel full of teeth gold. However depressing, this needs to be remembered.But with a cast that contain known actors with a comedian flair like Clooney, Murray and Goodman. And supported by accomplished actors like Damon, Balaban and Blanchett there is not much to want for in the acting department. And there are a few gems, a few scenes with a distinct comic touch to lighten up the mood.In all it was a very likable movie. A very different war movie. Some, but not much action, so if you expect grand battles, explosions and heroism under enemy fire, you will get disappointed. However, if you expect heroism of another kind, and a Little food for thought as well as Entertainment, this might be for you.7/10",7,0,3,9 April 2016
Mission: Impossible III," Not worthy of the legacy...
","** WARNING ** SPOILER AHEAD **Recap: Ethan Hunt has found the girl of his dreams and has left active duty at the agency. Now he only train new agents. When one of his former students get captured, Ethan resumes active duty. To his wife-to-be, who of course knows nothing of Ethan's past, he tells that he has to go out of town on a conference. The student, Lindsey Farris, has been captured by a black-market dealer, Owen Davian. Davian is obviously a man with no conscience and has more than a little sadistic twist. Ethan is of course able to rescue Farris, but only to have her die in his arms after Davian planted (during her capture of course), activated and detonated a small explosive charge in her brain.The mission a failure, Ethan gets a scalding from his superiors. To redeem himself he goes to Rome to capture Davian. This time the mission is a success, but he is about to learn that Davian has a connection to the agency's top level, a connection having lethal consequences...Comments: I'm not sure whoever took a coffee break here, the director, the writers, the producers, the studio... but somebody did. This is the third installation of the MI movie series. For med MI stands for technical ingenuity, brave plots and plans exercised masterfully keeping everyone (including the viewers) on their edge. This movie does not. The most technical ingenuity, the most MI:ish, I saw was wearing rubber faces and faking voices. I vaguely recall that being done somewhere else. Oh that's it! The previous MI movies!The problem with a sequel is that you have to top the previous ones. Be a little more clever, have some new gear, offer some new thrills. Evolve. MI3 does not do that. It doesn't even try. I remember the first movie when Ethan and Co broke into and stole from Langley. Apparently so does Luther Stickell as he before what could be the biggest heist yet says (something like) 'Langley was easy'. The movie makers does not, and instead of giving a thrillingly heist, they offer a big great anti-climax. All we get to see from the heist is Luther and the team sitting in their car complaining that Ethan is late. Not a single shot, view is shown from inside the building Ethan broke into. It is not even described, or for that matter, spoken of. That's the coffee-break people! MI _not_ showing a break in, a heist of epic proportions. COME ON! You got to do better than that... or at least try.To really rub it in, the mastermind behind the evil Davian is a mole inside the agency. What a shock! Wait a minute... now that too feels familiar. Oh yeah... haven't there been moles and rogue agents in the MI movies before? Ah well, both actually! Actually IMF, as the agency is called, must be the worst agency ever. Want to make the world a safer place? Your first step should be... must be to stop IMF. Obviously it is they who educates and sets free the biggest criminals in the world.I hope you get it by now. MI3 is not new, fresh and clever. It's old, everything has been done before, by themselves nonetheless!So what we get is a predictable story, decent action and some decent thrilling moments, but nothing new. Not MI, and that's why MI3 is not worthy of the legacy. It is just like any other action flick.5/10",5,17,26,17 September 2006
Sucker Punch," Very unconventional, but entertaining and beautiful
","First of all, Sucker Punch is a really controversial, odd movie, certainly not for everyone. It's an uncommon mix of spectacular high octane action and a dark grey psychological drama about a girl wrongfully imprisoned and abused at a mental institution. These sometimes sharp shifts between genres, and contrasts in storytelling, might not be to everyone's liking. If you expect a simple and purely entertaining action movie, you'll probably feel cheated and disappointed, because Sucker Punch certainly isn't that. Sucker Punch works on more levels than that.Babydoll is a young girl imprisoned and abused at a mental institution in a bid by her stepfather to get to a big heritage. To cope with the abuse Babydoll glides into a different levels of sub-reality in her own imagination. One is that the asylum is instead a brothel (hence the name Babydoll), and in next Babydoll and the other girls form a special military unit in different fantasy or science fiction worlds. It's in these third level worlds that all the action are in. And the action is very good, filled with effects and coordinated combat. But if the movie would have consisted only if this it would have been too simple, unmotivated. The brothel-world builds a framework that the action work inside, and suddenly all action makes perfect sense. But to be honest, without the action the movie would have been quite boring. The different levels in the movie really needs, and feeds of another.If you want a mental picture of how this works, one way to put it is that Sucker Punch is how the result would be if two of Snyder's earlier movies would have been cut together. Sucker Punch is an peculiar mix of both 300 and Watchmen.At the same time, Sucker Punch can look like a teenage boys simple fantasy. Hard action, scantily clad young women and both fantasy and sci-fi war. But to discard Sucker Punch as something simple as that is wrong. Then you have missed the bigger picture. I really liked how Snyder makes the different levels interact. How visual small tags in one level become important in another, and vice versa. And one of the big strengths of the movie is the visual component. Sucker Punch is a very beautiful movie. It is skillfully filmed, with smart perspectives and editing, enhanced by a lot of impressive special effects.I enjoyed Sucker Punch. But then I from the beginning expected a very odd movie. I think it is a must to be open to a unconventional and sometimes provocative storytelling. If you expect something ordinary, you will most likely set you up for a disappointment.7/10",7,7,13,20 April 2011
The Hangover," After a weak start - just great.
","Recap: It's two days before Doug's wedding and he and three friends head to Las Vegas for the bachelor-party. But you know what they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And now this almost literally comes true as the three friends wakes up in the morning after, with no memories at all and Doug completely gone. The three friends now must retrace their steps from their wild night in order to find their lost groom. And what about the tiger in the bathroom? Comments: Actually not what I expected. I did expect a high paced almost silly comedy from the get go. Surprisingly it started out quite slow with a long and detailed introduction and explanation how they got to Vegas. That almost became boring.Then it started for real. And it was really funny, but it didn't go off in that pace I expected. But I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Instead it changes pace from moment to moment, really making the audience pay attention. And it really takes off in totally unexpected directions, some quite hilarious.Surprisingly enough there is a collecting thought behind it that even if doesn't seem so at times directs the heading of the story and neatly ties everything together in the end. Well, everything except the rooster, I guess.A really good and fitting cast with actors I recognized but couldn't quite place in the leads. They did very well though. It felt like they did have some good chemistry between them, and apparently some of them have made movies before.I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. It had just the right level and amount of humor. Just the right kind of absurd humor that suit me just right. Now it they just had skipped, or at least shortened the introduction everything would have been just great. Now they have something to work on for the sequel A strong 7/10",7,3,6,15 December 2009
Marie Antoinette," Interesting and peculiar, but where is any real plot?
","Recap: The life of Marie-Antoinette. Wed to the dauphin of France at a young age, only 14, she is sent away from all that she knows to the court at Versailles. She must fit in and strengthen the alliance between her old country Austria and her new country France. To really make sure of this she must conceive an heir to the throne, but it is hard when her husband is as warm and charming as an ice cube in the Arctic. Rumors start to circulate at court that she is frigid. To console herself she goes 'shopping' and partying. This leads to her unpopularity with the people when food is hard to come by.Comments: This is a very interesting movie. Sophia Coppola is extremely skilled when it comes to building a beautiful set, spectacular sceneries. Her compositions and montages are beautiful and her movements of the camera point of view always an interesting choice enhancing the telling of the story. In short, this is a beautiful movie. What it lacks, and what Coppola is seemingly not so skilled in, is the plot. Sure, here she is a bit tied up by the actual historical events, but it suffers a little from the same as Lost in Translation did. Nothing happens. Where's the plot, where's the action? Long stretches of the movie become tedious.A small saving grace is the peculiar humor that exists and pops through from time to time. Some scenes are really funny, and lighten up the entire movie. Also a strong point is the choice and use of music. An interesting mix of historical correct and modern music. As a friend of mine put it, the modern music conveys the movies feelings much better than contemporary would. So true. It also creates a contrast that pulled me in as a viewer (it contributed to an idea to read this film as an American high-school movie).I like Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. She fits the role quite well. I am a bit unsure of Jason Schwartzmann as Louis XVI. I'm not sure if he is stellar or awful. Louis XVI seems stricken with terror most of the time, as he is often very stiff and unexpressive. If this is intentional, which from circumstantial evidence from the movie is inclined to believe, it does fit with the characters portrayal, he is stellar. If it is not intentional, he is as responsive as a piece of wood. Also an honorary mention of Rip Torn as Louis XV.To conclude; I found it interesting, beautiful and intriguing, but need more plot, more action to go from like to love. And although they never showed it (the ending was quite good though) the did chop her pretty head off.Btw, I must also say; Go von Fersen! 6/10",6,1,5,25 February 2007
The Ring," Nice idea that deserved a better fate
","Maybe I just didn't get it, as I have heard a lot of good things about this movie. The idea about a videotape that kills whoever watches it in seven days is a nice one. The actors also perform well and the main plot is nice. However, to me, there are a lot of sub-plots within the movie that appears and disappears throughout the movie that makes the movie make no sense. So instead of being frightened or held in suspense as you might expect from a horror or thriller I was just going 'huh?' and 'what?'.However this movie isn't all that bad, mainly because of the idea and originality and the actors performance. Save it for a rainy day or whenever you have some time over. I give it 5/10",5,1,3,1 November 2003
Stop-Loss," A movie full of emotion
","Recap: After two tours in Iraq Staff Sergeant Brandon King is finally coming home and is leaving the army. With he has his friends that he served with, men that became as close as brothers, equally eager to quit fighting, equally happy to finally be close to dear ones. But the boys may be home, but they certainly haven't left the war behind. It is with them constantly, and each of them struggles with in their own way. They abuse drugs and alcohol and get into fights. It tear every relationship apart. Their wives and girlfriends can't handle them, the brotherhood between them comes under extreme pressure. So when King finds out that the army is about to Stop-Loss him, which means it won't let him quit and forcefully send him back to Iraq, Brandon feels betrayed. The army and government that he fought for, risked his life for, broke their deal. And he can't handle anymore death, more friends dying. He goes AWOL in a race for Washington, to speak with a senator, but he soon finds out that as fugitive, the list of friends quickly grows thin.Comments: A strong movie about courage and duty, and doing the honorable thing. About how a government that has sent thousands of soldiers to fight a war on foreign soil, can turn their back on the same men once they returned home. How deals are broken, trust betrayed and the despair these men that is forced to rejoin can feel.It is a strong movie about how it feels to return home with these horrible memories (at best) and not being able to handle them, the strain it puts on these individuals and their relationships.Well, I have not been in any war, neither am I American, so the real issues might not be mine to debate, even if I do have a clear opinion about it. However, so does it seem this movie has. And it is very good at relaying it.Ryan Philippe, Channing Tatum and Abbie Cornish gives very strong performances along with the rest of a strong cast. Their acting is reason enough to watch this movie, a real impressive effort.It might be so that some of the events is not entirely realistic, however to dismiss the movie or the emotions that are portrayed in them because of that is foolish. It portrays a part of a war that both individuals and governments that send their soldiers to war need to handle. Therefore I think this movie gives an important statement in that debate.In the end, just focusing on the movie, it was a really good movie. Well acted with a real good story that kept my interest without problem. A drama with some real emotion and close to the thriller genre. Well worth watching! 7+/10",7,1,3,23 January 2010
Minority Report," Philsophical futuristic action
","Recap: John Anderton is the chief officer at Pre Cog DC, a department that with the aid of three clairvoyant humans stop and arrest murderers before they have their crime. As a result of this, murders are virtually extinct in the capital, and the system is now beginning to go nationwide. Before this, the FBI want to investigate the system and sends agent Danny Witwer. Witwer and Anderton come at odds from the beginning and it turns catastrophically worse when the Pre Cogs see a now rare premeditated murder, where the perpetrator is John Anderton. Now he is a fugitive and need to find out why he will murder a man he has never met.Comments: Another of these high budget, special effects filled blockbusters based on a Philip K Dick novel. And in my mind his novels need a high budget and it need to be packed with special effects. Because Minority Report, like many of Dick's novel, is set in the future and is highly speculative in both science and fantasy. To visualize these ideas that you need a lot of CGI.But those ideas, those effects are what make Minority Report entertaining. And it is very entertaining. It manages to balance this immense load of special effects with just an immense philosophical question. It all goes down to if there is free will or not. Are we able to really choose for ourselves, or are we just imagining that we can but are ultimately controlled by 'fate'. For Anderton, and hence for us, this question is really put to the edge. Is he able to avoid committing the crime, and the police, or is he destined for a fate worse than death. To find that out Anderton takes us on a wild, entertaining ride.Basically, when you sit down to watch this movie you have a choice, well if you believe in that. You can either just lean back and enjoy the ride, or you can be active and ponder the philosophical question the is the foundation of the movie. Or, and this is what make this movie special, you can actually do both.As a bonus you have a few cameos and a small but hilarious (at least for us Swedes) role for Peter Stormare.A movie to really enjoy, both when you watch it and afterwards when it almost is inevitable to think about it.8/10",8,0,1,15 August 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Likable family comedy
","Recap: Po, a big panda and a great fan of the furious five kung fu masters is leading a quiet life with his father in their noodle shop. His dreams are not in the noodle shop, but in the kung fu temple that resides on the mountainside high above the village. When it is announced that the new Dragon Warrior shall be announced the entire village, and Po especially, is excited. And the shock is total when Po, by odd events, get chosen. Everyone, even Po himself, doubts that he is the next Dragon Warrior, but stays to train with his idols. But soon the much feared Tai Lung brakes out of his prison and threatens the entire village. And it is up to Po to stop him.Comments: A typical animated family story with the main plot element being that if you really believe in yourself, you can do anything. You just got to recognize your weaknesses and use your strength. But also in the typical fashion of these animated features, it contains a great dose of both visual and common humor. Or plainly speaking, it is funny for everyone. It got just the right humor that you can see will appeal to the children but also is funny for you.It is easy to like Kung Fu Panda. It is very well made, by professionals that know how to do it right. And performed by a great cast. Even though it's not their faces, the voices is important to an animated film. Jack Black is just perfect as Po. And when he is supported by Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Dustin Hoffman and Michael Clark Duncan, among others, it is a great cast.Just like Po, the movie recognizes it weaknesses and uses its strengths. But if I may fault it for something is that it might be a little too much predictable. It is too focused on teaching the moral lesson that anybody can be the Dragon Warrior, you just got to believe in yourself. Sweet, but you misses out on a lot of funny opportunities that could have come with surprising plot twists. Kung Fu Panda got none, even the mythical Dragon Scroll holds no surprises. It's a little too predictable.That holds it back a little. It is still good, very good. But it isn't great. Too bad. It is very likable. I wouldn't mind a sequel (if the actors would want to return).7/10",8,0,1,8 September 2009

After being released by the hospital and attending the memorial service he is approached by Elijah Price (Jackson). Price is born with a genetic disease that make his bones extremely fragile, which has lead to numerous breaks and hospital visits. Price wants to know if Dunn has ever been sick. Dunn is perplexed, neither he, or his wife Audrey (Wright Penn), the other part of his failing marriage, has any recollection of Dunn ever being sick. Price has a theory, that if he is so fragile, somewhere out there is someone who is unbreakable, a sort of hero. Like the comic superheroes who are much of Price's life. David and Audrey think he is crazy, but Price is persistent, and then there are some curious facts that undoubtedly points in the direction of Price's theory.This is a great movie. In the bottom, as the base of the movie, is a great story. Shyamalan, who has written and directed, has made a very good job indeed with the story. It has no flaws and is full of details that Shyamalan brings forward by using cinematic tricks and strategies. In addition the cast is very good. Willis and Jackson are giving a great performance, and so are Wright Penn and Clark (as David and Audrey's son Joseph). There is no flaw anywhere. As mentioned, full of details, the story slowly evolves not really giving much clues in which direction it is about to take of, which gives the audience lots of time to guess and think about events. In this way, a kind of suspense is built up. At the same time it is enjoying just watching the effort everybody puts in into the movie. And then one never knows where Shyamalan takes the story... Great!9/10",9,0,1,19 October 2004
This Is the End," Fun idea - but too one-sided type of humor
","The idea is really good, and I bet that the actors had a really fun time. Because I don't think they really took care of the idea - it ended up feeling like some weird kind of frat party movie. The humor is almost only drug- or sexrelated, which gets old really quick (and probably makes it so that half of the viewers wil hate this and half love it with few in between).But it does has its moments, it isn't really boring. And it is a good idea. Just wished they would have made more of it.6/10",6,0,0,24 June 2019
Iron Man 2," Ridiculous first half almost destroyed the movie...
","Recap: Tony Stark is back, and loving it. Iron Man has singlehandedly brought peace to the world, and Stark is reaping in the rewards, fame and endless parties. But behind the happy façade there is dark clouds. The government is pressuring him to hand over the suits so they can equip the army, but Tony can deftly handle that. What is worse is that his power core is slowly poisoning him with palladium. He don't want to alarm Pepper, but does a poor job of hiding it. And SHIELD has planted an agent with him. And suddenly a man, Vanko, appears with the same technology as Stark. And he is not about to play nice.Comments: There is no way about it, the first half is just ridiculous. As sequels go, this is about as bad you can go. The first movie was really good, set a good tone and provided impressive action. But the first half of this sequel, intended to show Stark struggle, but it really made me doubt the entire franchise. No action, and Stark acting stupidly and being drunk most of the time, is not entertaining at all, in the same way that watching drunk people in a bar making a fool of them self is not entertaining either. The only way that could have been fun, if I were drunk myself Fortunately, the second half improves drastically and rescues the entire movie. Then, finally, the action starts and we get something that resembles the first movie. It isn't good enough to make the movie more than decent on average, more than that is impossible. But it left me with some good thoughts and a little hope for the future of the franchise.Once again Rourke impresses, and Downey is good as Stark, once he gets his act together. It is always hard when an actor is replaced, but Cheadle does it well. And Johansson's efforts promises more. Paltrow is always good, as is Jackson in his limited role. Jackson's appearance does mark the turnaround point for the movie though. And most the characters are good as well, they got promise. And I do like the hints at the other Marvel heroes. But the character of Justin Hammer was a mistake, he was just annoying. But to tell the truth, the franchise got a good foundation, some real good characters and a real good cast. It does got real good potential. This was, hopefully, just a bad day at work.5/10",5,3,8,23 January 2011
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," One not soon to forget
","Recap: Musician Peter is dating TV-star Sarah Marshall, star of the popular series Crime Scene. They have been a happy couple for five years, or so Peter believes anyway. But one day, according to Peter out of the blue, he gets dumped by Sarah. Against all advice he goes to Hawaii, to the same hotel where Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow, is on vacation. Severely unhappy, Peter soon realizes that it will get worse before it gets better.Comments: This is another piece of evidence that Jason Segel , both starring in and writing this movie, is an emerging star on the comedy heaven. Here he has put together a really nice story, and it actually is a story. I almost expected that it would be one joke after another in a pointless stream, but no, Forgetting Sarah Marshall actual got a real story. And, of course, a lot of jokes too. But they are not independent of another, they work together and so achieving much more success. Because this movie is really funny.It got a real good cast too. As mentioned, Segel plays the main character of Peter and does it real well. He got two beautiful ladies supporting him in Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell, but also Russell Brand that really has a great character to work with. Also there a lot of minor characters that add flavor and laughter to this comedy.It is this combination of simple jokes and complexity of a story and characters that makes the movie great. It doesn't repeat itself, it is not a copy from other movies. It is both brand new and entirely familiar at the same time.I recommend it.8/10",8,1,4,11 July 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Zombie invasion made fun
","Shaun of the dead is a classic that have aged well. Not too dependent on effects, it feels like it could have been made last year (instead of 15 years ago). One of the first movies of what has now almost turned into an genre (World war Z, I am Legend and son on) it still has a unique and what still feels like a fresh perspective on the zombie apocalypse. Instead of being scary, Simon Peggs Shaun intends to do so well, but it never works out as he wants it to, often with quit fun implications. He and his friend Ed, not the brightest men around, try to rescue Shaun's (ex-)girlfriend and mother, evacuating them from their homes to take refuge in the Winchester pub. And if you can't outrun the zombies, you need to fight them. And if you can't fight them, you migt as well try to blend in...It is a good idea, a fun story, with quite a lot of good scenes and moments with a lot of laughs. However, a few of the characters are just too much. They are too ignorant, too stupid, just too much. I think of Ed and Shaun's mother Barbara. By exaggerating the characters they go from fun to annoying. And that ruins quite a few scenes unfortunately. It would have been better if the would have managed to balance the characters traits better.",5,0,1,17 April 2019
12 Angry Men," A classic!
","** Here be spoilers **A young boy is accused of murdering his father. Evidence strongly points to him. The jury is sent out to make a decision, and they must be unanimous. As they sit down to vote, there are eleven guilty and just one not guilty. One man has reasonable doubt that the young man is guilty. The jury start to discuss the evidence at hand. Tempers flare, people shout and in general, the room contains twelve angry men.This is a masterpiece. A little slow at start but rapidly catching up, and most of the movie is very intense. You could actually cut the tension. As the story is in real time, you don't miss anything and can follow everything that happen. The tension comes from, that in their decision, lies the fate of one mans life. So simple, but at the same time very complicated. The director has done a great job along with the actors. All twelve people act very well within their character, and as they, and the camera move around I actually got the feeling that being in that room, wanting to take part in the discussion. What more can a movie-maker aim for. With the acting and the time-independent (the issue of evidence and life and death is just as real today, I hope) issue I really got involved with the movie. And the suspense kept growing. Not in the way that anyone was in danger or if any time limit would pass, but the simple matter of somebodies opinion and the change thereof made it so. Who will change their opinion next and why? It really seemed as a study of people.Great movie, action and suspense, great directing and acting and a very interesting topic!9/10",9,0,1,13 May 2004
Public Enemies," Good historical action
","Recap: Already notable bank robber John Dillinger manages to free himself and his friends from a State Prison in a spectacular escape. Following this Dillinger and his gang go on a robbing spree, gaining notoriety as he goes. At the same time he is trying to build a relationship with Billie Frechette a young woman living in Chicago. But every steps he takes is closely followed by Melvin Purvis, the star agent of the emerging FBI. Dillinger and the law enforcement often end up in gun fights, and Dillinger's list of allies becomes shorter all the time. In the end he is forced to team up with violent but equally famous robber Baby Face Nelson, the first step to his demise.Comments: A very good and high paced action thriller, based on the life of 'public enemy number one' John Dillinger. The story is not so accurate historically, but the reason for these misrepresentations are mostly to make a more entertaining story, which succeeds.Michael Mann is directing, which is a good thing, since Mann is talented of how to shoot and present gun fights on film. This was something he did in Heat fifteen years ago, and there are a few similarities between the gun fights in Heat and Public Enemies. The main thing is that they are plausible, with and effort made into detail.The movie does not have much suspense though, as I was familiar with at least the main events in the life and death of Dillinger, and the movie is true enough not to alter that in a major way. Hence no surprises. But it doesn't really need to surprise, the pace and action does more than fill that void. In fact it makes an easier movie to enjoy, it is entertaining just to sit back and watch.7/10",7,1,2,6 April 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Adventure set in the legends, but not a legendary movie...
","Recap: As a young boy Dastan is adopted into the royal family, becoming a prince of Persia. Grown up he is one of the generals of the Persian army, standing at the gates of Alamut, a holy city. Spies tell the princes that Alamut is producing weapons for Persia's enemies, and the princes decide to attack. Dastan and his unit proves themselves with cunning and courage, winning the battle for the Persians. But the city holds no obvious forges, but a beautiful princess and a mysterious dagger. Something seems amiss, and when the king is assassinated and Dastan set up as the murderer, he must flee and find what secrets lie behind the walls of Alamut.Comments: Based more or less on the computer game with the same title, this is an action adventure set in the legends. As such, I almost instantly and automatically, likes it. But with that also comes high expectations, and Prince of Persia doesn't quite live up to my hopes. For example the filmmakers seem to have decided to include a little too much from the games, which means a lot of jumping, climbing and balancing on perches. While that can be quite thrilling it can also become boring and repetitive if used again and again in the movie.Also, while I like both Gemma and Jake, they don't seem to have any special chemistry between them, and quite a lot actually depends on the attraction between them. It is what should bind the action together to a whole, and it does not. Now it seemed like a string of action scenes, one after another. But while they don't work together as a whole, they still are quite entertaining. And as such, the movie is quite good, even if I had higher hopes.6/10",6,0,1,30 November 2010
Spider-Man 2," Very much alike the previous one
","** Be warned, here be webs of spoilers **Recap: Peter Parker (Maguire) is struggling to keep his life together. His responsibilities as Spider Man are taking a heavy toll on his life. He's unable to keep a much needed job as a pizza delivery guy, he's far behind in his studies and his relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) is deteriorating. He is unable to pay his rent and has difficulties with being in time. At the same time a fusion project goes awry, leaving the leading scientist Dr Octavius (Molina) a mix between a human and four mechanic limbs. The result, soon named Dr Octopus wreaks havoc in the city to be able to repeat and complete his dangerous experiment. Soon he and Spiderman become enemies. And Harry Osborn (Franco) is still out to avenge his father and kill Spiderman. All this pressure and strain tears inside Peter and gradually he loses his super-abilities. Finally he quits being Spiderman, trying to lead an ordinary life and trough that win Mary Jane's affection. But can he really leave the streets to thugs and thieves? And what if his friends and relatives are threatened?Comments: Much money was spent on the digital effects, and that shows. They are beautiful and very striking. Other than that I wasn't impressed by much. Dunst and Molina was best in their roles otherwise it seemed to me just to be more of the same as the last movie. As Parker lost his abilities and had to rediscover them, it felt just the same as in the first movie where he had to discover them. His internal struggles with the relationship to MJ and to the city in general are just a continuation from the last one, and for a big part of this movie, no development. And then Mary Jane was abducted and needed rescuing, again, but not before he had to save some innocent bystanders in some sort of public transportation. Seem familiar? And then there are numerous visual references (read: repeat of scenes) to the first movie. So on numerous occasions I felt like I just watched the first movie all over again, with just another villain. In a sequel, you do have the advantage of not having to introduce the main characters (especially if you have a complete recap in the intro). This advantage was not used at all as the plot turned out to be. In one way Parker and Spiderman was re-introduced. And that is a little boring actually. However, as the previous movie was good, this means that this movie was also somewhat entertaining, but still a small disappointment. I expected much better.6/10",6,0,2,8 February 2005
The Fifth Element," One of the best, in every aspect!
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Earth is threatened. Well not only earth, all life throughout the entire universe. Threatened by an being of pure evil. A secret priesthood is present on earth in order to keep the secret of an alien race with the only weapon, the fifth element, able to destroy this evil. When this evil appears, the aliens send a ship delivering the weapon. However the ship is ambushed by someone who clearly is not on the side of goodness. Only one being, Leeloo we learn later, (Jovovich) survives the ambush and unfortunately dramatically escapes from the authorities. She lands in Korben Dallas (Willis) cab and pleads for help. Soon Dallas finds himself involved in this mess with everyones survival on the edge. Good for us he is a retired commando.This movie is supergreen! It is completely spectacular and has it all. It has everything. Great special effects, good casting, nice acting (especially from Oldman and Rock), great directing, terrific music and splendid choreography, not to mention great story, humor, one-liners and Chris Rock screaming like a girl.The story is told in a lot of point of views, enabling the director to cut from different persons to tell the story. A possibility Besson uses frequently in this movie, with great skill. This makes the movie fast paced and full with humor. Willis and Jovovich is in the lead roles with Holm in a good performance as priest Cornelius. But the great acting is from Chris Rock, who makes a great radio-star/super-diva, and Gary Oldman, who is one of the best bad-guys ever. The special effects is great with the modern city, the hunt in the cab and a lot of alien views. But the best scene, one of my favorite scenes of all time, is the combined scene with the Divas performance and Leeloo's fight. A masterpiece.If you enjoy some action with little regard to plausibility, sit back and enjoy. Supergreen!10/10",10,4,7,30 September 2004
Pirate Radio," This boat really rocked
","Recap: In a times when BBC broadcasted only 45 minutes of pop music someone must meet the demand of the audience. And when a strict and uptight society prohibits those someones from broadcasting from England the option is only to take to the sea. The answer is a boat. A boat full off odd characters, a climate anything but strict where anything goes and that definitely rocked. A boat that challenged the powers that was, and hence became the prime target for their full force.Comments: It is a movie of its own, a real odd one, full of odd characters. It's not really as I expected, the tempo is not as quick as I thought it would be. The humor is more of a little odd and quirky kind more than the kind where you roll on the floor laughing. It's not worse for it though, actually I think it suits it a little better.The ensemble is really big, and many characters turn up for a little visit only. That may be the worst fault of the movie. Even if that gives it ample opportunities with a lot of characters, each with his or her own peculiarity, it also sometimes too easy to mix them up. Some characters it would have been fun to follow more, but there simply is no time as it is now.Not to forget what it everything is really about. Music. There are some really good tunes in there, and I especially liked how they were used, linked to and an integral part of the story.In the end The Boat That Rocked was a very entertaining movie. Enjoy the music and enjoy the characters.7/10",7,2,3,13 January 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Good and a little unusual 'romantic' comedy
","Recap: After just an eight month long relationship Peter proposes to Zooey. Everything is perfect, except the little detail that Peter don't really have any male friends. So who is going to be best man? Finding new friends can be quite tricky. But then he meets Sidney, and they click almost instantly. But Sydney is a bit eccentric and does things his own way, as Peter finds out a little too late.Comments: A little unusual story in a romantic comedy, as the relationship in question is that of Peter and his presumed best man, not Peter and his wife to be. But if the story is unusual the steps, twists and turns are all the usual ones though. Actually it is really pretty much a standard romantic comedy, well except the real romance part perhaps. I found it pretty good without really falling for it. It is fun but doesn't really hit it off. It is good entertainment but not hilarious.Paul Rudd is stable in the lead, but Jason Segel shows his potential. He isn't great in this movie, frankly no one is, but you can glimpse the comic talent. I think, and sincerely hope, that Segel is a coming man in the comic movie world. Because it is mostly around Segel the funny things happen in this movie. So even though Peter is actually the lead character, Sydney is definitely the most important one.Well. Recommended if you like romantic comedies and want a change of scenery, but still want to find your own way around the story.6/10",6,1,2,27 September 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," It just don't cut it (despite the adamantium)
","Recap: While growing up, a traumatic event teaches Logan two things about himself. First of all, he is virtually indestructible. He cannot die, neither from age nor violence. And he can grow spikes through his knuckles and cause much damage. At first he and his brother serves in every war they can get into, but later Logan withdraws when more and more civilians get in their line of fire. This creates a conflict between him and his brother and his former commanding officer.Comments: It didn't take many seconds and many scenes for this movie to go far over the top. Full of clichés it tries to pack as much action into each and every scene as possible, it quickly gets silly. I enjoyed the three original X-men movies very much, but this is not at all up to the standards they set. It is unbalanced, and because of the way it develops, too unbelievable. Sure, I know it is a work of fantasy and fiction, but it is not even believable and true to the universe created by the first three movies, and that is catastrophic.When the main star stays on to do a sequel it usually means that the production is up to the standard of the previous movies. This obviously is far from it. There are three major faults that almost kills this movie instantly.The first is the predictability of the story. From the first scene you can almost predict the entire movie. No suspense, no surprise. Just stupid clichés one after another. And without the balance of a story with substance, the action just get mind-numbingly boring after a while.The second weakness is odd and irritating. I haven't read the comics so I don't know the 'true' history of Wolverine, but I felt that this really broke with the previous but chronologically later movies. I can't see how that Wolverine can come from this version. There is too much that differs, too much that can't plausible develop into what is supposed to happen later on. It's not true to its own ideas and universe. And the stupid Deus Ex Machina that is supposed to save the storyline that give Wolverine an amnesia is just ridiculous. A kindergarten kid could have been more imaginative, and would be just as irritated as me with this story and the previous didn't fit together. This element is just lazy and plain stupid. And what is supposed to happen in the next (planned) prequel, another convenient amnesia? The third weakness is the most surprising one, but also significant for the entire production. The special effects, and especially the CGI are just plain bad. Many times it just doesn't look real or believable, it looks real amateurish. This is the kind of CGI I would expect in an old episode of Xena, not in a modern high budget movie-sequel. It is so bad that at times the actors really doesn't look to be in the movie at all, you can see them in the studio walking towards the bluescreen behind them. This CGI shortcomings is so bad it should be embarrassing.In all this prequel was a huge disappointment. It just doesn't look like they made an real effort, only Hugh Jackman as Wolverine works. It seems they thought they could live on the previous movies, and just cash in by cutting too many corners. This is just plain bad craftsmanship.The best part of a movie should not be myself singing Monty Python's 'He's a lumberjack and he's OK' to some scenes 4/10",4,0,1,8 November 2009
Alexander," Long, but very well done
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Recap: Well, the rise and fall of Alexander the Great. It begins with Alexander as a young boy, son of kin Filip. We get to see his schooling and training. Finally with follow Alexander on his great conquest to the east, beginning with the conquest of Babylon and finally the battle in the deep forests in India. The focus is spent mostly on Alexander as a person and his visions and relationships with his mother, wife and generals (and especially Hephaistion).Comment: This is a truly epic movie. It is very well done with concern for details. Colours and scenes are very beautiful and breathtaking and battle scenes massive. It is spearheaded by director Stone and a very competent cast including Farell, Kilmer, Jolie and Hopkins. However, even if Alexander is mainly busy with war and conquest the tempo of the movie is slow and the action-paced battle scenes are far between. It is an interesting story that is told, but the movie is simply a little too long. It almost grows dull, even if I believe it is rather historically accurate. Another problem I personally had is Farell as Alexander. Farell is a very competent actor, but with his hair dyed blonde he just didn't seem credible as Alexander. It seemed out of place. In conclusion, an average movie with very nice cinematic aspects.6/10",6,0,2,5 May 2005

Menelaus (Gleeson) is furious. Menelaus goes to his brother, king of the kings Agamemnon (Cox), and demands that entire Greece goes to war with Troy. Agamemnon, who himself long has wanted to annex Troy into his Greece is glad to oblige. So, the greatest army ever seen, including the great warrior Achilles (Pitt) and his friend and king Odysseus (Bean), sets sail across the Egeian Sea. However, Achilles and Agamemnon does not get along and the army of Troy, lead by it greatest warrior, prince Hector is triumphant, for a start.This is a legendary and classic story put into a movie. So there is bound to be some parts that has to be cut or changed to fit into to the movie format. However, I think they have succeeded very well. The story is coherent, although there are few surprises due to that the general story is well known. The effects and detail are very good. A few scenes breathtakingly beautiful. I have the scene with the armada in mind for example. There are good fights, both man versus man and army versus army. There is love, shame and honor. There is death. The characters are beautiful and the cast is made up of famous actors and actresses. The dialog is not all that bad, even if it sometimes become a little too focused in producing dramatic one-liners. As I see it there are only one flaw, and it is not really anyones fault. Nearing the end, Paris pick up the bow instead of sword in the fighting. This, unfortunately brings Legolas into mind, and it feels kind of out of place. Anyhow, all in all a great epic adventure!9/10",9,1,2,5 October 2004
Aquaman," A lot of fighting but little else
","Aquaman is special effects extra vaganza, but seriously lacks in plot, character development and some serious directorial decisions.So, in just about the first scene we learn that Arthur, or Aquaman as he is known as, is pretty much invincible. He takes a grenade in the chest and doesn't get a scratch. So, physically, you can't get to him. For a movie that is just about 150 minutes of fighting, that is kind of a problem. Yes, I know, the hero will win in all movies, but it is easier to get engaged into a movie if there actually is a theoretical chance the hero might get hurt. Kind of a basic rule with heroes; they should have a a weakness. Something that his enemies might exploit. Superman's kryptonite is a fine example. Aquaman seems to have no weakness. Sure, atlantean technology can cut his skin, but even when he is stabbed or shot with plasma (strong enough to make stone explode) he isn't much worse for wear. Not to stop fighting anyway, or deliver some oneliner.Not even when Aquaman acquires the superweapon Atlan's trident, guarded by the ancient powerful monster Karathen, are there any suspense. There actually is no fight at all. So, the movie seriously lacks suspense. What's worse is, Arthur himself doesn't seem to think there is any either. He mostly cracks som weak jokes and seem to take very little seriously (so why should we?). Another side effect of all the weak jokes and fighting is that Arthur and Mera never really develops any chemistry.And why, aside from setting up a sequel, was Black Mantha in the movie at all? It didn't need more fights, and that was about all you got out of that character (you might have used it to explore and develop Arthur's relationship with his father - a possible weakness). And when the movie is full of action, and running over 150 minutes, you might want to consider sutting a subplot out.Visually, the movie is stunning. The settings in Atlantis is wondrous, and I really liked the use of electronic music and the neon lights (got some flashbacks of Tron there). However, it is not enough to carry a movie. Still, the action is good, so it is not like inte isn't an entertaining movie. But, it doesn't really live up to the competition.",5,1,1,12 January 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Beautiful effects but forgot the story
","**HERE BE SPOILERS**Jack Hall (Quaid) is a climatologist workaholic and absent father. During a conference he warns that the melting of polar ice might in the future be enough to disturb the ocean distribution of heat from the equator to northern regions (this concern is for real people, even if a lot of other 'facts' in the movie seem implausible). Naturally the politicians don't take him seriously, accusing him of not considering all the facts and just talking out of a scientific point of view, not considering economics or politics. He returns home to continue his work. At the same time his son Sam (Gyllenhaal) goes to New York to be in a science competition. Unfortunately Jack's predictions seem to come true in a matter of weeks. The mother of all storms evolve devastating everything it passes and bringing the next ice age in its wake. New York is in the middle of it all and Sam and his friends get stuck at the public library. Now Jack has to go get to him.The idea to the story, the effects and views are stunning. Unfortunately those things cannot cover all the holes that the story then uncovers. For example, a crucial point in the movie is that, at the middle of the storm cool air is sucked down to the ground, freezing everything instantly. I seriously doubt a lot of things in these scenes. For one thing, the cold will not affect you if you have closed the door behind you. Another question I thought of is what Jack intends to do once he reaches Sam. Apparently he plans to bring his son, who unlike Jack has no gear to be outside in an ice age, on a trek and walk for several days out of there. A third question that arose is why Sam and his friends in the library started to burn books. Sure they burn nice enough, but paper burn quickly. I would have started with wood, there must to be some wood furniture at a library. There are a lot others questions and loose ends in the plot. Altogether they result in that the movie never really got hold of me. It never really created any suspense. It never really tried to interact with its audience...So, nice effects but too much holes in the plot... unfortunately, it was a good idea.5/10",7,0,0,24 September 2004
Thor: Ragnarok," A little more comedy, a little less story
","Thor is back again. This time he got to save Asgard (again), and to do it he got to find himself and his true power (again). Well, he got to save Asgard from his sister Hela, Odin's first born child, who come to claim Asgard. And Hela is the goddess of death, so she is powerful, and will grow ever more powerful if she get to Asgard (which she of course does).Once again we get a visual extravaganza, although there are not so many scenes from within Asgard ( I like Asgard and it's visual themes ). Once again we get some thrilling action, combat and fast paced chases. That is much what the Thor movies is about. But this time there is much more emphasis on comedy, slap-stick and delivering one-liners. Sometimes so much that it seems like the point of the scenes, the point of the script, is not the action but the one-liners. Unfortunately it detracts a little from the story and thus the movie.What I do like though is how they handle the characters (apart from Thor that is forced to think to fight more with flair and style), and especially so Loki. For once Loki get to be the trickster he truly is, not only to conspire and plot for personal gain. This time he balances on the sharp edge of good and evil, crossing the line so many times you never know which side he is on. I really hope this is a trait that Loki will be allowed to develop in coming movies.Thor Ragnarok is a really good movie (but I have to point out that you should see the other Thor / Avenger movies to get all the references). But it is a step away from the two earlier Thor movies, which had it's funny parts but had the focus on action and story. I think the earlier one's fit Thor better.7 hammers out of 10",7,0,2,18 July 2018

But then he runs in into an old acquaintance that invites him to a convention that will change his life. There Carl is challenged and he enters into an agreement that he takes literally. To any question or proposition he must answer yes, whatever the consequences. And suddenly his boring life is turned into a wild and wacky ride, and fate seems there to reward him. Work suddenly seems promising, and above all, he meets this new girl.Comments: A very warm, actually inspiring but above all, a really funny movie. I enjoyed it very much, and even though a star like Jim Carrey brings a lot of expectations with him, both he and the movie exceeded them. This was just a lot more funnier, a lot more entertaining than I expected.Jim Carrey is cast perfectly in this role. It lets him utilize his unique brand of comedy and wacky acting that once made him famous, but also combine it with some of the more serious aspects he has been looking for in recent years. According to trivia this was something both Carrey and director Peyton Reed aimed for, and I think they succeeded very well. Zooey Deschanel was a real positive surprise for me. Having seen her in a few films before I haven't been impressed. This time she really stood out. She managed to give her character, the girl that the lead is interested in, so many more sides than is usually done. Many times the girl of interest is just beautiful, and Zooey was, but she also had her own quirky way, combined with a caring sweetness. She contributed very much to the success of this movie with her character, and she worked very well with Carrey. They both had good support from the other cast too, to many to mention them all. But I would wish that Danny Masterson found a role that would put him more in the limelight, he got the talent.What really makes this movie successful is that it doesn't depend on Carrey as the sole resource of fun. As mentioned the other cast contribute well, but so does the story itself. It is very well written, and puts mostly Carl in a lot of odd, but funny situations. It develops well and doesn't reuse the same joke too much, it keeps inventive and because of it, very funny and entertaining.It was a positive surprise for me, in more than one way. It was just one of those rare movies that are both very funny and thoughtful at the same time. Recommended.8/10",8,0,0,14 February 2010
Zodiac," Good reality based thriller
","Recap: Based on a true story about a serial killer, calling himself the Zodiac, who played hide and seek with both the police and the newspapers. After an attack where a girl is left dead and a boy critically wounded the murderer reports the attack himself. What's more, he sends three separate cryptos to three different newspapers. He claims that it will reveal his identity, and that he will attack again if it is not published. The newspapers comply but the killings go on, with the police unable to catch him. Eventually the killings stop and the police's interest wane. Only a cartoonist risk everything, obsessed with revealing the identity of the Zodiac.Comments: Based on a true story the flow of the story is a little odd. The killer supposedly vanished for years occasionally and then the move skips time with him. However, that's not really a problem as it is till easy to follow the story and the single events, although maybe months or years apart, feels connected. The story is solid, without major holes to fill in.But, maybe the movie is a little too focused about following the real events. Because when the end comes, it turns out to be a real anti-climax. Maybe this should have been the point to be creative, but that's not the real point of the movie. The movie intends to be true to the story, and it seem to be (I'm not that familiar with the real story). So OK, the ending is not good, I felt a little robbed after the ending, and that's not a good feeling to leave a movie with. But what's really bugging me after, and what should have been either corrected or left out, are a few ideas, or hints, in the movie that is never picked up and explained to satisfaction. One is that Graysmith at one point believes the Zodiac to be two people. Some evidence supports this but that track is left out. Also the main problem with the Zodiac is his identity. But a woman who barely escaped his clutches isn't even questioned by police. Or this incident wasn't really the Zodiac, he claims it wasn't, but if the producers/directors/police doesn't believe it is, why is it in the movie? Either cut it or follow it up.Well, those weak points aside, it is a good thriller. There is suspense in the hidden identity, but is got strong support in the sub plots. The personal life of Graysmith or Avery. Or Toschi's struggles to solve the crime, alone against the stream. They do really add up nicely together. It's a good detective story all the way, well right up to the end.Also it pays to look out for known actors and actresses. Some in really small roles, some in bigger.All in all, I quite enjoyed it, despite it being long.7/10",7,1,1,15 August 2009
Milk," Impressive biographical drama
","Recap: A dramatization of Harvey Milk's life leading up to his election as San Francisco supervisor and ultimately his murder. The movie starts with Harvey and boyfriend Scott Smith moving to Castro opening their own business Castro Camera. The couple soon become frustrated with the discrimination against them and the abuse gay people suffer from the police. With anti-homosexual winds blowing over the nation, with several laws and propositions specifically targeting homosexuals, Milk spearheads a movement in San Francisco for human rights in general and gay rights specifically. And as the first openly homosexual, he gets elected to a public office.Comments: A very well made, almost documentarian, drama about the last years of Milk's life. Sean Penn did win an Academy Award for Best Actor (along with Dustin Lance Black for Best Screenplay) and I must say that his performance is impressive. But he is not alone, on the contrary the cast is rather large, and most of them acts very well too. Josh Brolin's nomination for Best Supporting Actor is not undeserved, but they were more. James Franco had an important role and did very well.The issues at hand is very important too, and the movie handles them well, presenting them both in a historical context with actual footage but also how individuals feel and react to them in the dramatization. And as for a biography it was as entertaining as they can be, much to Milk's own humor, but mostly it is very interesting.I expected that a biographical movie like this would be slow and almost dull, but it certainly wasn't. This is a movie worth seeing.7/10",7,0,2,18 February 2010
Cloverfield," Go Monsters!
","Really, I'm going to write about the ending so don't read if you want to see it for yourself first.Recap: There is a party. Rob is leaving, and this is his going-away party. Not everything is happy though. He and Beth, who seemed to have a relationship going, have a fight and Beth leaves (with another guy). Shortly thereafter the entire building shakes and the lights go out. People go out on the streets fearing an earthquake. But soon buildings seem to collapse randomly and people realize that this is not the forces of nature at play. They are under attack.Comments: Filmed entirely in the way of a home recording so the first word that comes to mind is: Different. It's shaky and of poor quality. Some odd cuts and also some material of a previous recordings acting as flashbacks. I can see how this can be annoying but it didn't disturb me. I think it worked fine.What did disturb me was Hud. Hud is the guy holding the camera most of the time and has one heck of a problem keeping his mouth shut. He also is something quite stupid. Yes, I know, Hud is experiencing some extreme events and some people react that way. But hey, I'm watching a movie about alien monsters attacking New York, so can we keep the annoying but realistic people out of the movie? It's not like it is really an documentary, even if that is some of the point with the camera. I found myself rooting for the monsters trying to kill Hud...The there is the ending. I like open endings most of the times. Leaves something for the viewers to think for themselves. Something different than most movies. And I respect the writers/directors choice to do it this way. But I myself would have gone with a traditional Hollywood-ending were the good guys clearly win. Not as realistic maybe, but leaves you with a lot more feel-good, and you leave the movie a lot more content. Now I got the feeling that it was cut short and I was missing a lot, especially since the movie is just 80 minutes.Otherwise, I did like it. Good effects and I liked the way the monsters were slowly introduced, and never really explained. It got me curious. I really wanted to see the next scene, see what more was revealed, what happened. So I quickly got engaged in the movie, and whenever that happens a lot is won. Therefore it is unfortunate about the abrupt ending. I felt left out. But well, it worked really well for an evening, and I got rid of Hud. Kudos to the monsters! 6/10",6,0,1,6 July 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Deeply touching movie
","Recap: Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a luxurious hotel, Milles Collines, in Kilagi Rwanda. Deeply involved in the business the hotel does, Paul makes relations and friends with as many important and powerful people he can. Because there is trouble growing in Rwanda. Two 'tribes' live together since the colonial time, and now there are a lot of hatred for the other kind. A Hutu-militia is already acting very threatening, and the Hutu-dominated army is not ready or willing to stop it. The peace is fragile. So when the president of Rwanda dies, everything breaks lose. Paul, a Hutu, ends up with his family, Tutsis and a lot of Tutsi friends at Milles Collines, where Paul bribes, collects favors, calls everyone he knows, lies and pulls every trick he knows just to protect those inside his walls. Outside, there is a genocide going on. The UN is powerless, and the outside world is only interested in rescuing their citizens.Comments: A very emotional, deeply touching, and very appalling movie. The tale (equal the truth I'm told) is told in a very realistic and plausible way. A lot of strong and frightening scenes are included, and a lot of them left me with a bad taste. That included when the UN and the Western powers abandoned the people in Rwanda. I'm old enough (unfortunately I don't have to be very old to do so) to remember the actual event, and I am dismayed by the fact that this move touched me more than those news did. In truth I am ashamed of it. So, as you surely can conclude, I think this is a very powerful movie. And it was made very well in all aspects. Especially a brilliant performance from all the cast, and mostly Don Cheadle that are mainly in focus. He brings us through all the emotions, love, hate, fear, terror, friendship, honor and actually happiness. Masterfully acted. I do recommend this movie to all and everyone, but I must warn you. This is not a movie to watch if you want to leave cheerful.9/10",9,1,1,16 October 2005
Ready Player One," Fun adventure
","Ready Player One is a very entertaining movie. First it is a fun adventure movie, typical for Spielberg. Fast paced action, lot of good effects, tongue-in-cheeck comments and jokes. Not really a dull or slow moment in there at all. Spielberg knows how to make these kinds of movies, and he does it well, once again. It helps to have a good story to work with, and in Ready Player One he got it (based on the book). Nothing that reinvents the genre, stripped to it's bones it is quite a typical quest adventure story. Riddles, hidden clues, and one grand prize that one good and one evil team races to get to first. But not every movie need to invent and evolve, it is enough to do it well.The other part is the massive amount of hidden 'Easter Eggs' and references to other movies and pop culture (mostly from the 80s and 90s) that are abundant throughout the movie. Some are evident and an integral part of the story, like King Kong, the KnightRider DeLorean combination that Parzival drives, the dancing from Saturday Night Live and so on. Others are more subtle and hidden, some visual detail in the background or comment, like Sorrento's comment about Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. It is fun to find and recognize them, prompting a quick trip down memory lane. There are likely a lot of them that I haven't found yet.Well, another reason to watch it again. Goodie!",9,1,3,2 February 2019
The Hateful Eight," Western Thriller
","There are far too few Westerns made these days, so Hateful Eight is a welcome addition. The title is typical for a western but that's about it that is typical. Oh, yes, it is set in the 19th century, with all the guns, clothes and horses that you expect in a Western. And so the story begins, with a stagecoach fleeing a terrible snow storm. Aboard the coach is John Ruth, a bounty hunter with his prize, bound for Red Rock. But they don't make it all the way because of the storm. The seek shelter at an isolated cabin, but they are not alone. And so a deadly game begins. All have hidden agendas, and alliances is broken as quick as they are made. From here on it is more of a Mystery and Crime, just set in a Western theme. And it is good. It is told in a slow pace so that there is time to think and make your theories about the next step. Nothing is revealed before it is meant to. The suspense is thick and there is no real good or bad guy. Everyone is a suspect. I really liked it. Not because it is a classic Western, there is no duel, or massive shootout. But because there was a long time since I saw a such a suspenseful movie.Something worth mentioning though. It is a Tarantino movie. There are no massive shooting, but people die. And it is graphic with blood and gore.8/10",8,1,2,25 July 2017
Catch-22," Full of stars but dull
","Recap: A bomber pilot tries desperately to be grounded and escape missions, as his commanding officers repeatedly raises the requirement to be rotated out. He tries to be declared crazy only to be denied as only sane people want to be declared crazy to escape war. Stuck in his outfit he is forced to see the war go crazy about him as it turns into a private enterprise of his mess officer...Comments: Full of very known actors, quite a few that I found it hard to recognize (as I think of them as they look now), it is fun to see how they looked and what they did (a lot) earlier in their careers. The movie also has a few points to make of war, and cynicism in general.The main benefit however is a few scenes that are quite funny. These are gems in a desert though, as the movie is far too slow, stretched out for its material. Mostly it became pretty dull, to be honest.5/10",5,1,6,3 February 2009
We Were Soldiers," Good compromise between documentary and action-movie...
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Lt.Col Hal Moore get assigned to a unit, which is going to be deployed in the War in Vietnam. The plan is to fly in with helicopter, and eventually pull out by helicopter. However their landing zone is very close to an Vietnamese base camp and the battle is soon raging.Fortunately, I have no personal experience of being in battle, so I can only speculate. The movie is based on an actual battle and I gather that it is pretty accurate. Still, the story is told as a movie and has to be folded into this format. I guess this leads to some details and subplots (thankfully) has been omitted. Many other movies may try this way and one hand can get more dominant than the other, i.e. a dull documentary or a pure war-fiction with no reality anchor. To be sure, there are a lot of effects in WWS as well, but they never go overboard with them. The story and the characters are always in focus.By doing it this way, we get to both see an entertaining movie (for us who likes war action that is) but at the same time glimpse the horrors of battle. There were really disturbing images, for example some badly burned soldiers whose skin just fell of, that made my stomach turn. Thankfully they were rather few and apart with more 'normal' blood spill and splatter in between. Also we get an glimpse of the horrors the soldiers-wives has to live through, uncertainty and grief, as the notifications of their dead husbands are delivered to the wives by a cab company. It is also good to note, even if we mostly see the American perspective, that the Viatnamese command and soldiers is portrayed as soldiers as well. They just happen to 'on the other side of the fence.'To conclude things, an entertaining docu-action with glimpses of a scary reality.8/10",8,2,4,26 August 2004
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Interesting and good fun...
","** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS **Butch and Sundance is getting tired of their outlaw life, and after a never relenting posse almost catches them, they decide to go to South America. They try to go straight but revive their criminal lives robbing banks. Creating new in-famousness about themselves, they must fight the local police force, the army and detectives from the U.S looking for them.An interesting movie, where Redford and Newman portray the legendary outlaws Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. A great cast with the two great actors in the lead, the do a really nice job. The story is a nice mix of action, western, adventure and comedy. The characters, no matter their predicament, always keep a light-hearted tone. This make the movie fun to watch. The overall story is very good, following (mostly) what is accepted as the 'true' (?) fate of the outlaws. There are no serious plot holes or errors anywhere and it is a very well made movie.8/10",8,1,3,6 November 2004
The Expendables," Got everything, and more!
","Recap: A team of mercenaries get recruited to overthrow a general that with the support of a rogue CIA-agent has taken a brutal control of a small island in the Mexican Gulf. A mission that they initially decline, but when the leader Ross take a personal interest in a woman that seems to be single-handedly fighting the oppressors the team decides to take action. And it promises to be a violent fight with neither side holding anything back.Comment: The veterans of the genre still know how to do it. The cast, spearheaded by Stallone, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke just to name a few, is perhaps the best an action movie has ever sported It is almost as impressive as the action offered by the story. As you can understand The Expendables is a high paced, action packed, violent and adrenaline filled movie that entertains from the first moment to the last. With a few inside jokes, some great cameos and a string of well delivered one liners this is and will be, in my opinion, a classic in the genre.It starts out in a high pace, and excels by keeping it throughout the entire movie without any real or noticeable dips. But where it surprises most, is the well balanced, well written mix of characters. With the size of the cast there really is no time to explore and develop more than a few more extensively, but none of the seem like a cardboard character. Each and every one of them has at least a few unique characteristics that defines a spot for them on the roster. Ironically, none of them are expendable with concern to the story. All of the acting veterans are given a cool character with the opportunity to shine.A friend told me that the movie was what you would expect of it. It was true but, it contained all the elements I did expect of it, just much more of it than I could ever have hoped for. That said it really isn't very realistic, it isn't a deep perspective shifting drama with an important statement. But who expected that? The best statement made, as one characters puts it, is made best by huge explosions. This is a movie made for entertainment, and it does. Massively.9/10",9,2,6,3 September 2010
MASH," Cynical with empathy, funny but not close to hilarious
","Recap: Two surgeons are being sent to the MASH 4077th. But they are not entirely army material, making their own rules as they go. Of special interest is of course the nurses. And making extra money. Around them the whole camp turns to a circus.Comments: A classic movie, a very cynical satire of the essence of war. Somewhat graphic and gory for its time but nowadays it is nothing to speak of. Instead it is a pure enjoyment to watch all the characters shape their own world. The story revolves mostly around Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke Forrest, each with their own special character, even if they have their total disrespect and disregard of regulations and proper conduct in common. That is really the foundation of the movie. It is funny, but not in any way that any recent Hollywood blockbuster would be. It is really another type of humor. It is cynical and, I wouldn't call it subtle, but is more low key than what we're used of today.The movie was followed up by a popular series and if you want a fun comedy I would actually recommend that over the movie. Not that the movie was bad or dull in any way, but the movie has a more serious undertone, whereas the series I feel is more pure comedy. The undertone is of course the anti-war statement. It lies in the cynical comedy and can actually go undetected if you don't think about it, and only watch it for the jokes and puns. But reading about how Fox and the army reacted to the movie is almost as much fun as watching the movie itself.There is another dimension to the movie, due to time. Director Altman managed to gather quite a few young actors that come to have respectable careers, and still are stars today. Therefore you can see Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, Rene Auberjonois and Michael Murphy in much earlier roles. Some in just the beginning of their careers. And quite frankly, some of them is hard to recognize.A little of the movies charm and sense of being current has been lost through the years. Still it is a very good and entertaining movie, and absolutely watchable due to its classic status. But as a pure comedy, there are better out there.7/10",7,0,1,19 January 2010

With just minor injuries Dan takes her to the hospital and so their relationship starts. Later Dan meets Anna (Roberts), while she is taking his photo for his book (based on Alice) and falls for her, while still living with Alice. Anna is interested but does not fall for Dan, but for Larry, a dermatologist. But at an art exhibition of Anna's photos, including one beautiful of Alice, Dan and Anna meet again and things start to happen...Comments: A film about love, betrayal, illusions and disillusions, of hurt and pain and life in general. This movie is beautifully shot and narrated, using pictures and events as much as words. There are some jumps in the timeline, but not at all confusing. The performance of the actors, which is great all over, in addition to the work of writer and director, makes this a movie just as much felt as seen. There are laughs (much thanks to a witty dialog) and there are sorrows. I guess most can relate to some scene or another (I sure could) and therefore we can feel, actually feel what the characters do. Actually a better trick than any special effect could do. This was worth every penny spent, and well worth the time. Recommended.9/10",9,0,1,6 April 2005
Lost in Translation," Lost in Editing?
","** Here be spoilers ** (and I really mean it, do not read this if you plan to see the movie)Now, there has been a lot of praise for Lost in Translation. Hence my disapontment is greater. Bob Harris (Murray) comes to Japan for some commercial photo-shoots. He is bored and dull, and seem to have some sort of personal crisis. In the hotel where he is staying he meets Charlotte (Johansson). She is unhappy and alone because her husband is out working (?) all the time. In their combined unhappiness they enjoy each others company and some sort of relationship starts to form as they hang out in the Japanese night-life. There, I'm sorry, is the complete movie, as I see it. Nothing really happens and everybody just seem to be more or less unhappy. And soon I really lost interest in the movie.In addition to the poor story, there was some very peculiar editing. The movie runs at only 102 minutes (fortunately), which I reckon might be considered rather short. Still the movie contains a lot of small scenes that is completely pointless, which was either cut short or should be cut out entirely. There is no real (as I see it) development in either character, and interesting potential conflicts, issues and characters that appear throughout the movie simply disappear, never mentioned again to make absolutely sure nothing ever happens.I cannot see why this is praised, I found it very dull, but that was the whole point, heh?3/10",3,6,14,7 May 2004
Doctor Strange," Prepare for Strange..
","You should really be prepared for the kind of movie this is, because this is a movie that you will probably love or hate. Luckily, the first scene presents what kind of movie it is. You will get an action movie, with spectacular graphics and effects, but also with an mind warping edge that might go some steps too far in warping reality. Especially some of the battles contain so much altering realities, changing directions and effects that it is hard to take it all in and follow the action. But it is also beautifully done, and if you enjoy these kind of effects, you will have a blast through out the movie.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor Strange. An egomaniac jerk that following an accident learns that there is more to the universe than most of us knows. Cumberbatch is a quality actor, and he got good help in Ejiofor, Swinton, Madsen and McAdams (which has a too small role for her talents). All do well, but this is not a character driven movie, so they don't get many opportunities too shine. But it is also a feat too pull of an action hero, and they do well all of them. But fans of Cumberbatch from his previous work might be disappointed. He is not the real star in the movie. The effects are, along with the universe that the movie presents.I do enjoy those kind of movies. When I watched it I thought of both Matrix and Inception... there are more than a few similarities. I enjoy the Marvel universe that connects to a bigger whole. This was another piece to that puzzle, and it fits well.And, as in most Marvel movies, don't miss the crazy credits (the extra scenes - yes there are more than one) in the credits after the movie.8/10",8,1,2,12 May 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Honest
","Recap: The experiences of a soldier nicknamed Joker first during the hard training and subsequently his tour of duty in Vietnam.Comments: Seemingly a very honest movie. That being said by one that has never been close to Vietnam, not now, not then. But it feels real, and that's what important with movies, isn't it? So it seems very real, and it is brutal. It is not a pretty picture that Kubrick paints. But it probably is sincere. It is an anti-war movie, it doesn't shrug away from any unpleasant parts. It shows the violence, it shows death. And it shows how it corrupts both soldiers and civilians that are part of it.Very well acted, especially D'Onofrios performance caught with me. But Ermey deserves all the credit he can get too. Ironic that their characters became enemies.Something else that stuck with me and caught my attention was the use of sound and music. Sometimes a perfect fit with the pictures, and something a deep contrast. Both ways worked well to enhance the emotions of the scenes and get the point across the screen. And Kubrick did well when to choose which method to use when.A catching, interesting movie. I can recommend it well, even if it is not a very nice movie.8/10",8,0,0,7 March 2009
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Outstanding movie with heart and a dark sense of comedy
","Don't know if it is a stroke of genius or not, but grieving mother Mildred puts up three big billboards questioning the police about the murder and rape of her daughter. That is how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri starts. Events soon develop, both predictable, like the local police reacting and other more surprising twists and turns. In this story, where facts are few and hard to come by, emotions and reactions are key. But, as it seldon is with emotions, it is not that easy. Mildred is not the only one with grief, heartache and a hard life to handle, and everyone is dealing with it in their own ways. Mildred's billboards just starts the chain reaction.A deeply rich and dark tale, not without it's own peculiar sense of humor (the movie is labelled as a comedy, although I am not sure if I would stretch it that far. More of a drama to me). The jokes are lifelines in a tale that would otherwise be unbearably dark. But the story is much more than the jokes. There are several storylines, many characters have their own, that intertwine and cross each other. It gives a complex, and many times suprising, twists and developments. The characters are full of their own history and agendas, and no character is a saint or hero, neither villain nor monster.The cast has been awarded many prizes, deservedly so. Harrelson's character Willoughby might be my favourite, but there are many others, too many to mention. But they do have a rich material to work with, and well directed by McDonagh (his movies is worth keeping a look out for - peculiar as they are in their own ways).It is a movie that engages fully. Thoughts, reactions and emotions flow as the story unfold. And a little laughter now and then. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,13 January 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Nice
","Recap: Andy, an aspiring writer and journalist is applying for the job of being Miranda Priestly's, Runways chief editor, assistant, a job million of girls would kill for. But not Andy. Andy is not in to fashion, not at all. She only sees this job as a stepping-stone to later 'real' jobs. But it is not as easy at it seems. Miranda is extremely demanding and never gives any compliments. Andy's life soon revolves only around keeping Miranda content and Andy slowly gradually turns into a Runway-girl.Comments: A really nice comedy about Andy and her suddenly chaotic life. Funny situations, good line deliveries and a little absurdity make this comedy really nice. And in addition to that there are two things to augment the movie. First of is Andy's relationship with Nate. It's sweet, warm and loving, and it's impossible not to care. Finally there are the small comments, both by characters and the filmmakers, about the fashion-industry and the world at large that also gives the move an interesting (and unexpected) depth. Some issues is actually worth thinking about, and the points made valid.Also I would like to commend the use of music in this movie. It has a nice way of slowly fading in and lending weight to the scene, always augmenting the pictures and never stealing focus. Also a lot of scenes are done with great skill and creativity. Especially the one when Andy changes clothes walking to work (you know the one if you've seen the movie) - and I liked it very much.Good performances all around, when the cast is considered. It couldn't been easy for Streep to be Priestly, but she pulled that off without any glitches. Also really good performances, and nice characters, from supporting cast like Tucci and Blunt. And finally there is Hathaway. First off, allow me to be a little superficial. Those eyes... d*mn. She got an easier role - considering her character are much more likable but she does really well too.All in all, a good movie that lacks that little special thing that make it outstanding, but I don't regret spending time seeing it either...7/10",7,2,4,28 January 2007

","Recap: A couple working as private detectives get hired to fin a missing four-year-old girl. The police is all over the place but soon they find leads that the police never found. Soon a dirty truth emerges that will have widespread consequences and few wants brought into light.Comments: Whatever this film is, it is intense. You will not turn it of feeling good, you will not laugh watching it. But you will, at least I did, find every moment intense and full of suspense. Revolving around the case of a missing child it is hard not to get in involved, and once the movie got its grip into you, it never lets go.There are twists and turns, the story develops at every scene, and so even if the pace seldom is high you don't want to miss a moment. It is exciting, and maybe its biggest accomplishment is that it raises really big questions. Questions that don't get answered, questions that the movie leaves with you, questions you really have to think about. In that way, the movie doesn't end when the end credits roll. It ends with you.8/10",8,0,0,1 September 2008

But the factory is in a crisis, more and more children are not afraid of the monsters. And would they actually touch one of the monsters, the monster would die, or so the rumor goes anyway.

Afraid to get the blame for the accident, Sulley and Mike hides the girl and tries to send her back without anyone noticing. But something is going on at the factory, the top rival monster to Sulley seem to know more about the accident than he should.Comments: I am not surprised the monsters having trouble scaring anyone. They're too cute to that. Once again Pixar has made a beautifully and spectacularly animated movie. Especially Sulleys fur is impressive. What the monster lack in scare-factor though they make up in fun-factor. Many monster have some fun feature or behavior. The story in itself is fun too. One should keep in mind though, that this is a movie made for families. That means it lack the suspense and some of the fun twists you might hope for in a movie made for a grown up audience. I guess most kids in proper age will love this, but their parents, or if you like me watch this anyway, will be entertained as well. The movie is fun.7/10",7,0,1,25 September 2005

A movie full of action mixed up with a humorous dialog and some classic comedy. And Ant-man was just that. A funny action packed spectacle. However, it doesn't really rise to the level of the other Avenger movies. I don't know what does it, it might be Ant-man's hero ability that is more comedy than action. Or the constant size-zapping that make most action scenes fragmented. Or that Ant-man's ability is not consistent within the movie. Oh, I know and have no problem with that the movie is unrealistic, it is in the genre. But that the Ant-man one moment is heavy enough to dent a car's roof but not the ants he is sitting on. A movie need to be true to itself.Well, it is fun. It is action packed. Paul Rudd does it well in a role unusual to him. But it is not at the level of the other movies that it is inevitably compared to.",6,2,4,5 March 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Loved it
","Following the formative years of the legendary band Queen, from the perspective of Freddy Mercury, it takes us along two paths at once. One is what the characters would probably say it is all about, the music. Queen has a rich treasure of well known great tunes to use and play. There sure are a nostalgia factor, but I think a younger audience appreciates the music as well, and perhaps discovers something new. The music is very well used and the urge to clap/sing along is great.The other part is what the actors might say it is all about. How the band formed and developed, Mercury's relationships with Mary, his family and the gay community. The emergence and the story of AIDS. There are a lot of interesting plots that unfold intertwined with each other. Some events are dramatized quite a bit compared to what really happened, but in the context of making a story for the movie it works.The acting is superb. Rami Malek has deservedly gotten a lot of praise, but I think the other cast is worth mentioning. The band, Mary especially, and a few minor characters (like Jim Hutton) tha bring invaluable contributions to some scenes. And I really liked the direction too. As I said, there are a lot of things to cover in this movie, but it never felt fragmented. The music, the biography, it all comes together in a splendid weave. And as a fan of movie I really liked the (hidden?) gem of Mike Myers (of Wayne's World fame among other) playing a record boss saying that no kids will sit in a car and singing along to Bohemian Rapsody.This movie got pretty much everything and does it superbly. Highly recommended (and if you do watch it, do it with a capable sound system!)",9,2,2,16 December 2018
Burn After Reading," The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts
","Recap: Osborne Cox is demoted (or fired because he subsequently quits) from his job as an analyst at the CIA. That is the start of a chain of reactions outside anybody's control. It contains secrets, spies, betrayal, the promise of love and cold brutal divorce. With more time on his hands Osborne decide to write his memoirs. Memoirs that through unlikely events end up in the hands of two gym instructors, who thinks the material is secret CIA-material and decide that they are entitled to a big reward. When Cox refuses to pay they turn to the Russian Embassy and then things really get out of hand. And in the middle of it all the CIA wonders what the .... is going on? Comments: A splendidly written movie with a lot of characters with just a little insight on the entire story. Unknown to each other and themselves, they are all connected to each other, some in multiple ways. And when everyone tries to get a grip on things, they just makes everything worse. And that's what is so fun! For all the right reasons, the make all the wrong moves.Apart from the story, the Coen brothers have also managed to create some great characters, and cast them with the actors they had in mind when they wrote. The result is interesting characters with actors doing what they do best. Malkovich is splendid in a role written for him, Clooney wins the day with a smile and McDormand is great as the obsessing, plotting woman in trouble way over her head. Best of them all, my favorite is J.K. Simmons as the CIA Superior charged with making sense of this mess (not an easy task).Everything gives 90 minutes of surprising twists and fun. But it is not hilarious all the time. It sure got its moments, but in between it seems to slow down, or rather to prepare and wind up for the nest of these moments. It's not dull, not close, but there are some stretches were you kind of forget the comedy part, some jokes that not really work. It is a very good movie that lacks a little something to make it great.7/10",7,2,6,9 November 2008
The Italian Job," They pulled it off...
","** Here be spoilers **The last big heist. A former master-thief returns from retirement when the opportunity to steal a lot (and I mean a lot) of gold appears. The heist is highly successful but the group is betrayed, the gold taken and the old master-thief shot dead. Now it is time for revenge. However, the group that originally did the heist need help from the daughter of the dead thief.Unfortunately, the movie in itself fails to produce any major surprises. One can sense some possibilities for plot-twists but they are never realized. In addition, the actors do not make any award-winning performances. None is bad, in my opinion, but they do not make anything extra out of it either. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. It is really entertaining to see the spectacular solutions the have to make their heist work. The stunts is good any the plot is entertaining even if it as mentioned fails to surprise. In addition, there are at least a few nice cinematic touches (or did I invent them for myself?) one might enjoy.So, if you like heist-movies, or action in general this is a movie for you. If you really don't this is not the movie to start with to discover the genre.Personally, I enjoyed it very much...7/10",8,0,1,8 March 2004
Baby Driver," An unexpected gem
","Baby is a genius behnd the wheel, and finds himself working as a getaway driver for a local crime boss he is indebted to. Orphaned as a child, when his parents died in a car accident which also left him with a severe case of tinnitus, Baby always have a soundtrack to his life. Finally free from his debt, he meets Debora, and dreams of hitting the highways with her. But he is forced to do one last heist for his old boss, and naturally things unravel...A movie with high speed, both on the roads and in the pace of itself. Quick and elegant with good pieces of car pursuit and action. But it also has another level to it. Baby and Debora, among others, are likeable characters. The humor is good, but above all; the sound and soundtrack is masterfully used. It lines up perfectly with the acting and events in the movie. It kind of becomes a character of it's own, and sound and hearing is a theme throughout the movie. A little more forgotten is the use of colors. There clearly is a thought behind them, as striking colors are often used in the movie. In such, Baby Driver is a treat both visually and audibly. Director Wright and his team have done a really good job here. An unexpected gem.",8,0,2,29 September 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A true masterpiece, modern classic
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **It is Bilbo Baggins (Holm) 111th birthday, and he plans it to be a magnificent one. But he also plans to leave his home and possessions to Frodo (Wood). Bilbo's old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Gray (McKellen), has come and brings his famous fireworks. Among his possessions Bilbo has a ring, a ring he found during his adventures long ago, a ring he has grown very fond of. Reluctantly Bilbo leave the ring and it comes into Frodo's possession. However Gandalf is suspicious and his research confirm it, it is the one Ring. What's worse is that the enemy, the evil Sauron, also know where the Ring, his Ring, is and has sent his minions the ringwraiths to retrieve it. If they succeed, the world is doomed. If the Ring can be destroyed however, the evil can be beaten once and for all. So with his friends, Frodo, set out with the ring on an epic adventure.This is a masterpiece, with all the pieces coming together and summing up to something greater than the all the pieces. At first, and at the foundation we have a classic and great epic story. The movie isn't totally true to the book (a movie based on a novel can never be) but the important events and feelings are all there. Then we have the cast. Those responsible for the casting should be awarded. Each and every actor/actress is perfect, both in appearance and personality, for their role. As you can see this is due to great casting and great acting both. I could mention the entire cast here, but I think special mentions should go to Mortensen, Astin and McKellen for outstanding acting. In addition to this Howard Shore has made an masterpiece of original score that is beautifully used throughout the movie, both to enhance the story and the feeling, and beautiful in itself (Enya's contribution is great as well). What more, Jackson's directing is very good, his sense of detail both in directing and seeing to that make-up, costumes, digital effects and scenery is as good as they ever can be. Credit, of course, to anyone involved in those areas. Naturally, these factors combined give a great feeling of an epic adventure. There is friendship, threat and action, there is love and a great evil. There is heroes. For once, the effort and resource has been made to give this fantastic story the detail and quality it deserves. AS mentioned, this is a masterpiece, I can think of no way to make it better.10/10",10,0,1,19 November 2004
Lilo & Stitch," Cute. And funny.
","Recap: Evil Genius or Idiot Scientist (Disputed) Dr. Jumba Jookiba has just been sentenced to jail for tampering with genetics. His result, Experiment 626, a little creature made to destroy, is to be exiled to an asteroid. Now Experiment 626 is not too keen to spend the rest of his life on an asteroid, or he is just trying to be destructive. Anyway, he escapes confinement, hijacks a spaceship and takes off into hyperspace. And crashes on Kauai. Now, water is about the only thing that Experiment 626 can't cope with, so being stuck on an island is not very good for him. And then his creator and Earth 'expert' Pleakley is sent to recapture him. Enter Lilo and Nani, two sisters who has lost their parents and while Nani struggles to making ends meet and being a mother to her sister, so that they are not separated, Lilo has her own troubles being alone and shunned by other kids her age. Nani decides that a puppy might do the trick, but unfortunately Lilo chooses the talking dog (Experiment 626), that she names Stitch. Not very happy with the new arrangements Stitch stays with his new family just to avoid being recaptured. But things literally fall apart around Stitch, and the outlook for the new family is not very good.Comments: So sweet! Stitch is so adorable in his own peculiar disturbing way. And he is funny. Together with Lilo, who is adorable in a more normal way, they make a great team. Together they wreak havoc wherever they go. Stitch is made for destruction, but together with Lilo he is a great comic creator, making one funny scene after another. Add the big sister Nani, her aspiring boyfriend David, social worker Cobra Bubbles, Pleakley and Jumba Jookiba the character cast is as good as it gets. Each and every character contributes to the story in a unique way. And there is more to the story than just laughs. Love is a big theme, and the concept of a family. Everything combined the result is a sweet funny movie with an attitude, and a deeper message that works for all ages.One should note though, that this maybe isn't the best movie for the smallest kid to see without someone older to watch it with. Yes there is guns, and shooting but that is not what concerns me. That is done in a cartoonish comic way that even the smallest child sees is make-believe. What concern me more is a few moments when Nani and Lilo and Stitch are about to be separated. Being as well made as this movie is, playing on and conveying emotions well, maybe a hand to hold during these scenes are not a bad idea.Otherwise, a great movie, especially if you love Disney-animation movies.8/10",8,2,2,30 October 2005
The Village," A true masterpiece
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **An old village, in the end of 19th century, is living under a truce between it and the monsters that live in the surrounding forest. No villager may enter the forest and then no creature from the forest shall enter the village. The village is happy but recently illness has claimed victims and Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks permission from the elder council to travel through the forest to fetch medicine from the towns. The council is reluctant and then there are incidents. Animals, killed and skinned are found throughout the village. At first it is thought to be the work of some wild predator, but then the monsters cross the border. Something they have not done for years. At the same time, life in the village must go on, and there are love growing between people, for example between Lucius and the daughter of town elder Edward Walker (Hurt), Ivy (Howard). But such feelings may create envy in others and there are hidden secrets that seemingly no one wants to talk about.This is a great movie, a masterpiece. The story is wonderful. Well thought out and full of details, and it also has several layers, something you can feel but not quite put your finger on. This script is put in to the hands of the cast to act it out. It is cast full of great actors and actresses, Phoenix, Weaver, Howard, Hurt and Brody to name but a few. Especially Howard as the blind girl Ivy, and Brody as the troublesome Noah. Hunt should also be mentioned as the leading elder Edward Walker. But the entire cast is great and do a terrific job. And then back to Shyamalan who do a great job directing it all. The combined effort of everyone makes this a masterpiece to treasure. 10/10",10,1,1,7 November 2004
21," Good, but don't bet for more...
","Recap: Ben, a whiz kid with a stellar record still finds it hard to get into Harvard Medical. Not because his grades but because of the tuition fees. There is a scholarship, but the competition is fierce. Ben needs something to make him stand out. But then a MIT professor notices his math skills, and offers him another way to make the money. He is leading a team that counts cards and intends to beat the house in Las Vegas. Though what they do isn't strictly illegal, the casinos aren't really happy about them winning a lot, and have their own shady countermeasures.Comments: There is a saying that you don't play a player. In this movie, everything is business, everyone is a player, and everyone is playing everyone (in one way or another, i.e. not only for money). A good set up for intrigues, and there are a enough of them, not too many though, to make this a good thriller.However, it lacks a little to make it a great one. For one thing there is really never any doubt how it will end, because of the way the movie is set up. It just a question of how to get there, and as the movie progresses fewer and fewer options remain. Fortunately it doesn't become totally crystal clear, and it does some twists at the end to throw you off. It is partially successful but not wholly. It manages to become suspenseful enough to be entertaining but not surprising.There are some good actors, most notably Spacey and Fishburne, but this won't be the height of their respective careers. Sturgess does a good lead, supported by always beautiful Bosworth, but none of them give a performance worth remembering.In the end it just a good entertaining movie, don't bet on anything more.7/10",7,1,1,23 January 2011
Pitch Black," Great in almost all aspects...
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **A lonely spaceship carrying cargo and some passengers come off course and crashes upon a desert planet with three suns blazing at it. Eternal day. Naturally, the ship become a total wreck and the struggle firstly to find water and food and then rescue themselves start. In their search they find an abandoned settlement. But where did the settlers go?Pitch Black is surprisingly good. First, the characters see to be well worked out with deceptive layers and interesting past histories. I could really feel that these were a mix of strangers suddenly forced to cooperate. Most interesting of these are the characters of convict Riddick (Diesel), mercenary Johns (Hauser) and pilot Fry (Mitchell) and the tension and relationship that these evolve between themselves. The actors, those mentioned and the others, perform very well, giving their characters credibility and contributing to the story. Mix in some great cuts and edits from the director/crew and the story is told with humor and suspense. There are some gems to watch out for in the details, both in cinematic aspects and in the dialog. Even the special effects is very good, used well so that the become an integrated part of the story, not standing alone.Does the movie have any flaw, unfortunately yes. There are some purely scientific aspects that I have questions about, like the formation of the solar system, and the creation (and possible end) of the eclipse. However, even if they are a main part in the background of the story they are not rally important for the story itself. One might just ignore them as cool errors.So, anyone who like either sci-fi and or thriller should enjoy this one very much.8/10",8,0,0,24 August 2004
Split," Tense
","Horror movies are not really my kind of movies, but this one I liked. Perhaps that is there is a lot more emphasis on the thriller part of the movie than the horror part. And the horror part is much more the psychological kind of horror than blood, gore, violence and shocking moments (though there are a few exceptions that are quite bloody I should mention)A man with split personalities abduct three teenage girls and lock them in his basement. There is always a very tense and heavy atmosphere, and honestly quite sickening atmosphere, both in the basement and thus in the movie. A few of the personalities are hostile to the girls, a few a symphatetic. The friendly ones warn of the last personality, The Beast. There is always a promise of something bad happening hanging in the air, but what? Violent? Sexual? It is not pronounced and adds to the uneasy tense emotions. In that aspect, ut really is a horror movie.Shyamalan has returned here with a really good script, acted out very well of the small cast. A special mention must go to McAvoy for his portrayal of the abductor. Fantastic.For all the Shyamalan fans out there, this is highly recommended, although you might not find the usual twist you expect...7 out of 10",7,0,0,18 July 2018
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine...
","Recap: One phone call can change so much. The Hoover-family got one that will change their family for ever. Seemingly innocent, the call tells that daughter Olive has won a beauty pageant since the former winner has been disqualified. Now she is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine-pageant in California and the entire family goes on a road trip like no other.Comments: As far as characters go, this movie got it all. There is the father (Kinnear), a success-coach that has yet to be successful. Mother Sheryl (Collette) is totally stressed out but struggles to keep the family together by literally putting food on the table. Eldest son Dwayne (Dano) has taken a wow of silence and can't wait until he can move out, Granpa Edwin (Arkin) is just mad at everything because he is disappointed with how his life turned out, and recent addition Sheryl's brother Frank (Carell) that just attempted to commit suicide over lost love and lost job opportunities. And finally, there is daughter Olive (Breslin) that lives for her pageants, but seem to be the one most connected to her emotions in the entire family.What connects them all is the Dream. The Dream of what life should be like. They all have it, and they all, in their own personal way, fail at them. The net result is a family on the edge of implosion. Now add one long road trip in a VW-van with a personality of itself.So, the characters are great, and you got a good cast too. Arkin won an Oscar for his performance but I'm most impressed by Carell and Breslin. They really embodies hope and disappointment, the two extremes on the path to the Dream.And the script is good too. Some moments are just great. And there is a subtle touch of humor all the way. Unfortunately it is too subtle at times, and some stretches get a little long and dull. In fact some stretches I lost interest all together, until one of those moments brought me back.All in all it is a movie to watch, at least once. Especially with all the buzz surrounding it. Now I've seen it once, that was enough for me.6/10",6,0,1,19 October 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Really, much better than expected... bravo!
","**Here might be spoilers**Must admit that I didn't expect much from this movie as I took my seat in the cinema. But I was surprised. This is one of very few sequels that I actually liked better than the movies which it followed.Like the previous movies there are very elaborated action and fighting scenes were everything seems to be highly explosive. Well that was expected and the fighting scenes are pretty much what they were in t-2. However, I must say that they actually makes the mandatory car chase a great thrill because of the vehicles use, or specifically the one T-x uses (boy, I must get me one of those). I agree that is clearly noticeable that it is not James Cameron that directed this movie. Instead of, or maybe I should put it, in addition to just being your ordinary action-thriller, this movie also sports a heave element of comedy. And this is what I think really elevates this movie above its predecessors. The comedy-bit is handled very-good so it really enhances the movie instead of destroying the suspense, however I would like to call it action-comedy because of that, it feels more accurate.There are two things that annoys me though. First, why do people that are chased or in any situation were they are in short supply of time keep stopping up, just looking around and being a tourist, why? Second, Kristanna Loken as T-x seemed very much like a robot to me with constantly plain facial expressions. When I saw the movie I thought this was fine, however, when I read the trivia I learned that she had trained in communicating with facial expressions. Odd.Well, I really liked this movie, and if you are looking for a action-comedy you will too... oh by the way, not surprisingly you'll enjoy this a lot more if you really know the other two... 8/10",8,1,1,12 November 2003
U-571," As good as it is...
","** Warning. Torpedoes with spoilers here ** Recap: Lt. Tyler (McConaughey) is upset. He has just been denied a ship of his own, and that can only be because his superior Lt. Cmdr. Dahlgren (Paxton) advised against it. Suddenly the entire crew of their submarine have their leaves cancelled and the sub is sent off on a covert mission. A possibility to capture a German encryption machine, called the Enigma, has arisen. A German U-boat has been critically damaged during combat and is immobile at sea. The American sub is disguised as a German U-boat, and the plan is to pose as a relief boat to the damaged u-boat and then board it. However, during the boarding the real relief boat turns up and a sinks the American submarine. A few of the boarding party now find themselves stranded on the damaged German U-boat...Comments: The greatest strength of this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. Cryptic enough? Need an Enigma? Let me try to explain. This is a war/action movie, with some thrills and nice effects. It does that very well. It never tries to send an message or be philosophical or anything. Just plain action. As an audience it is just to sit back and enjoy. The cast is full of competent actors and they don't disappoint. I especially like McConaughey's and Keitel's performances. A good entertaining story with as mentioned good effects to augment. An extra plus for the language difficulties that the movie portrays, i.e. that the Germans do not speak English nor do they make any English manuals to their subs. All in all, good entertainment.7/10",7,1,3,14 February 2005
"I, Robot"," Spectacular
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Del Spooner (Smith) is a detective constantly having bad days (except one Thursday once). He is living in a world where robots are commonplace, and where the robots live by the three (Asimov's) robot laws. So everyone knows that robots cannot commit crime or hurt humans. Everyone except Spooner that is, he is very suspicious of robots. Now, he is called to a scene at URS (the main robot manufacturer) where Lanning, the main designer, has plunged to his death. An apparent suicide, Spooner soon suspects foul play. And then one robot, who evidently do not obey the three laws appear, and Spooner and Calvin (Moynahan) find themselves in a mystery much bigger than just one dead scientist.First, the graphics is very nice, actually giving the robots a somewhat human appearances. The action is very good with just the right amount of fighting and explosions. The movie itself sets the bar and then conforms to itself so that no fight or sequence stick out or feels unnatural. The cast is very good, with a possible (in my opinion) Oscar-nomination for whoever got Will Smith in the lead as Spooner. In my opinion there is no one else who can deliver quotes and one-liners like him. And his way is perfect in this movie. Very high credits for him and those who wrote the script as well, that kept an humorous tone without getting it silly. And naturally then credit to the director that put it all together. And there is somewhat of a mystery too. Not the greatest one or the most difficult to solve, but the movie has a nice approach slowly centering on the solution. There is, in my opinion, no flaw in this movie. A must see!10/10",10,2,4,19 September 2004
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Slap stick humor in this good animated sequel
","Recap: After their vacation turned out to be a little longer than expected, and in Madagascar, the four friends has their minds set on returning to New York. But their escape from the island doesn't go very well, the plane is piloted by penguins after all, and they crash in the middle of Africa. But what initially seems like paradise quickly grows thin. Alex finds out that lions aren't supposed to be dancing and ends up in a power struggle, and the four friends struggle to keep their friendship intact too. And the penguins must handle some tough negotiations with the monkey union to get their plane repaired.Comments: A worthy sequel of the first Madagascar movie, even though, as sequels usual are, not quite as good as the original. Still it has the same type of impressive slap stick animation and it is full of good jokes. The animation is like in the original a little angular, with sharp edges, but also very full of expression and emotions.The penguins are still the best characters in there. Unfortunately they do not have the same sense of adventure and plan to conquer the world. Instead they actually is very cooperative, well most of the time at least (poor Dreamworks-kid). I thought they added more when they did their own thing, no matter the consequences.As many of these animated movies it is a movie that everyone can watch. There are jokes that everyone can appreciate, from kids to their parents. Or film buffs like me. A little surprisingly though it has some scenes that are pretty violent, especially the fight between Nana and Alex in the beginning. But all in good fun, at least if you are a little older.7/10",7,0,0,16 January 2010
Heartbreak Ridge," Tough Eastwood
","Recap: Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Highway seems to find himself in constant trouble both with military superiors and civil law. But he is also a highly decorated war veteran and generally the meanest, toughest ... you can find around. As a last chance before retirement he is assigned to a run down platoon of Recon Marines. His task is, against their will, put the platoon into shape and combat efficiency (and lead them in the invasion of Grenada). At the same time he prepares for retirement and life outside the military, not an easy task for a career soldier.Comments: Most of it is a mean and tough Eastwood, fighting hiss will through with sheer determination and muscle. Not too much depth and introspection, but still very entertaining and his style fits the movie very well.So, what you get is a lot of determination, testosterone, muscle, guns and at the end a little history in the invasion of Grenada. There is the subplot of his attempts to adapt to a civilian life, mostly by trying to get his ex-wife back. It has definitely a role to fill but is a minor on. Highway, and the movie, is still very much military. Don't expect anything else, or you will be disappointed.Eastwood dominates this movie very much, both in acting and directing. There is total focus on his character and it is only Mario van Peebles with his wannabe rocker Corporal Jones that get sufficient screen time to really do an impression. van Peebles to me, rarely is the mark of a quality movie, but here he is very good for this character Stitch Jones. But both he and Highway is very one-dimensional and would benefit from some depth.However, with the movie running over two hours I can't see how there would be room for any such development. It was probably a very wise decision by director Eastwood to cut most of that. The result is a very entertaining (yes very gung-ho - but that can be entertaining) military and war movie, set in a little unusual time (not WWII or Vietnam).7/10",7,0,2,15 November 2008
Salt," Good spy action-thriller
","Recap: Evelyn Salt is a young CIA-agent working in the 'Russia House' a department with focus on events and people in Russia. And she is late for home and her anniversary. That moment, Orlov, a Russian agent steps inside her office and claims a Russian agent will kill the Russian president in New York in a couple of days. And that agent will be Evelyn Salt. Suddenly she is the most sought after fugitive in the entire country, but she is involved in a game with much higher stakes than her own life Comments: Actually, they are quite rare, the really good agent action-thrillers. But Salt is one, and Angelina Jolie is a star talented enough to handle and carry a movie like this. She and the movie got all the ingredients. First and foremost a good and deep enough story. I wouldn't call it complex, but with enough layers that gives it room to evolve and give it weight. Secondly it got all the high adrenaline shots such a movie needs. Car chases, explosions, gun fights. You name it, you got it. And it doesn't dilute it with an half hearted attempt at comedy.In my opinion, given a good enough continuing story preferably in the hands of Wimmer whom has delivered solid action movies time and again, has the possibility to become a new agent franchise. This could well be the first movie in a series, it has established a solid foundation for it anyway.That Jolie excels is not a surprise really, but she got good support as well. Both Schreiber and Ejiofor are solid actors, especially Ejiofor is one of the more underrated in Hollywood. His role was limited in Salt, but could very well be expanded in an eventual sequel.This was one of the better in the genre recently, entertaining all the way through. I can only hope that they see the opportunity and recognize what they have in Salt.8/10",8,1,3,30 January 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Great mockumentary!
","Recap: It's about for famous Dewey Cox to take the stage. But before he does he just needs a moment to remember his life. It began an awful long time ago, and is marked by the death of his older brother Nate. Dewey accidentally cut Nate in half with a machete and it has hunted him ever since. But it also gave him the gift of blues, and lead him to his life of music. It is a story of drugs, sex and rock'n'roll.Comments: I'm not sure it is really right to spoof and parody a movie that is a biopic of someone's life. But it is great, it is hilarious. The Dewey Cox Story is obviously a parody of Walk the line but also spoofs great many other legendary musicians. It is a fine line to make a parody like this funny but not over the line and insulting, but The Dewey Cox Story negotiates that line masterfully.It's a fast paced story with a lot of twists and turns. There are a lot of laughs and it's a great comedy to relax to. But actually, the music isn't that bad either. Sure, it pays to pay attention to the lyrics but the songs also resemble the time they are meant to spoof.John C Reilly has had a long career and has had to worked hard to get the lead parts in the big movies. But now they're here and in this he handles it as good as anyone. He is perfect for the role. And he has got a good supporting cast too, not to mention the musicians that have cameos.If you have the DVD I can also recommend the special feature The Real Dewey Cox. To watch that after the movie is a perfect ending.Just hilarious.8/10",8,1,1,23 August 2009

Or is he just stalking an innocent man leading a quiet life, and his suspicions just a figment of his unstimulated imagination.Comments: Almost a step by step and complete remake of the classic Hitchcock, just adapted to a more modern suburban area and with younger kids in the lead parts. Because of that it got a little twist, or sub-story, of itself of two young kids flirting with each other.Despite being a remake, hence the story is known beforehand and quite predictable, it still gets that feeling of suspense and almost paranoia that the original does. Part of that must be credited to the actors. The suspense is perhaps most due to Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, maybe one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood. He has that uncanny ability to act all normal, almost too polite, but with a piercing look just freeze you.Shia LeBouf I once had serious doubts about, but he has proved to be a reliable actor many times now, and delivers a solid performance here too. He has had a few productive years now and showed that he can handle many different genres well.The movies best surprise was the female lead Sarah Roemer. With both looks and talent I'm a little surprised that I haven't seen her before somewhere, but that seems to be changing. And well deserved too, she handled herself very well against her more known co-actors.In all it was a good thriller. But since it got no surprises it never took off to any real heights. But well worth it's time.6/10",6,0,1,19 December 2009
Van Helsing," Tries to do too much...
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Van Helsing, this is the story of a man fighting evil monsters around the world. A man that doesn't remember his past well (oh he remember that he is at least 1800 years old), a servant of the catholic church secret agency, is sent to Transylvania to aid and save a noble family's Valerious) right to enter heaven and kill the evil Dracula. Because an ancestor to the family has sworn no member of the family will enter heaven until Dracula is vanquished. Now only two siblings of the family remain, and the church don't want to fail this ally. Van Helsing arrives in Transylvania to find Draculas minions attacking the villagers and hunting the Valerious heirs.So this is an homage to the monster movies of the old. Unfortunately this is not a very good movie. I think this movie tries to do so much that it fails it all. First and foremost, the central plot is not coherent. Well it is perfectly understandable why the Valerious hunt Dracula, but Dracula has no apparent reason to specifically hunt the Valerious. Sure, they might have been a bit annoying but no prophecy or anything will be fulfilled for Dracula by doing this. Furthermore the plot is extremely shallow. Now, this might be acceptable in an action movie that don't aspire to be more, but this movie keep hinting of a historical vendetta or some sort of coupling between Dracula and Van Helsing. This I find to be very interesting, and to find out the entire story is one of the main reasons to keep watching. Well, the main history, even if the movie tries in vain to keep it a secret, is ridiculously easy to figure out almost at the beginning. The disappointment comes when the movie tries to reveal this exciting piece of information and it is nothing more than what anyone that is barely conscious already knows. I think that you'll unfortunately discover this as well if you ever watch the movie.Other things that annoyed me was why did Van Helsing use an automatic X-bow, when he can use shotguns, guns or Gatling guns, surely Q, oh did I say Q, I meant Carl, can and did give him some of those. Furthermore the movie confuses how to vanquish vampires and werewolves. As I understand it, werewolves can't stand silver and vampires kind of dislike wooden stakes through their hearts. Why Van Helsing has a silver stake is kind of questionable, to me at least. Additionally for me a totally new aspect of vampires was introduced. They lay eggs. I always thought that new vampires came from people being bitten by other vampires. Oh, finally concerning the story, the addition of Hyde and Franskenstein into the movie is completely unnecessary. They bring nothing to the story and could, should, have been completely cut. Must be that homage-thing.The acting and editing is not awful but not very good either. I don't know if this is due to lack of interest from the actors or due to inferior material to work with. There are a lot of over-acting, especially Dracula has a long, completely pointless scene, where his over-acting his horrific.What is good about the movie then. Four things come to mind. The scenery, with the village and woods, is nice. I did find the music good and the special effects in themselves is very good and finally the action parts is entertaining. But when other parts fail, this doesn't help much.4/10",6,0,1,23 August 2004
Being John Malkovich," Very peculiar, very creative
","** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Craig Schwartz (Cusack) is a skilled puppeteer, but that doesn't pay the bills. He takes a strange job at a company located at the 7½ floor in a building. There he meets the attractive Maxine (Keener), and he gets two problems. First, he is attracted to this Maxine, but he is married to Lotte (Diaz) and second, Maxine is not at all attracted to him. However, when he discovers a secret door, that leads straight into the mind of John Malkovich they start a company that sells the experience. Naturally John Malkovich gets confused, and later not at all happy about it. Things complicate further when Lotte falls in love with Maxine. Maxine is attracted to Lotte too, but only when she is inside Malkovich. And then it gets really complicated...This a extremely peculiar movie, in a creative way. Ideas and scenes are presented in a new refreshing way, thus making the story very entertaining. The actors and actresses are good but somewhat overshadowed by the story. I believe that this is the kind of movie that you either dislike or really enjoy, and one must see for oneself. I enjoyed though...7/10",7,1,2,7 January 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Peculiar and downplayed comedy
","Recap: After his wife left him for his boss, journalist Bob Wilton goes to Middle East to become an embedded journalist to prove himself. There he coincidentally meets Lyn Cassady, a name that popped up during an interview Bob did a while ago. That interview was about a man claiming to possess psychic powers that he learned during his years in the army. Bob thought him to be crazy at first, but when Lyn appears, and continually uses the 'evolved tactics' Bob can't dismiss the story anymore. The men team up and goes on a mission in Iraq, guided by nothing but Lyn's psychic powers.Comments: A peculiar movie, a rather good comedy actually, but not in the common sense. There are no real jokes, no one liners and no over the top acting. Instead every character is dead serious about anything in the they tell in the movie. But as most of it is odd at best and quite bizarre at worst it is quite funny to follow.Although not as good, my mind went to another Clooney movie, Burn After Reading (2008). I kind of got the same feeling while watching the movies in the sense that they was rather funny without really having any real jokes.The Men Who Stares at Goats do entertain through the run of the movie, but it didn't leave any kind of big impression on me. It has a good cast but don't really utilize it fully. A quality actor like Kevin Spacey seems to get lost in the story a bit. Mainly it is only about McGregor and Clooney.Well, fun for the moment, but nothing more.6/10",6,2,3,11 September 2010
Spider-Man," Good ride in special effects
","** Here might be a web of spoilers **Recap: Peter Parker (Maguire) is secretly in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). During a school field trip a genetically modified spider bites Peter, and overnight he is changed. He now has superhuman abilities, but has not learned to control them. This proves to be troublesome, for example in school. When a robber then kills his uncle Peter decides to use his abilities to fight crime. However, the general public can't make up its mind if Spiderman is a blessing or a menace. And at the same time the Green Goblin starts to spread terror in the city, making a deadly enemy of Spiderman. When Peter then finds out that Mary Jane dates his best friend Harry (Franco) a really complicated situation arises...Comments: A very nice first installment in this what now seems to become something like a series. Understandable her some focus has to be used to establish the background of Spiderman, stealing some time from the main plot. However with some small episodes the entire story is both easy and fun to follow. Now this is no philosophical movie, or reality based in any way. But it is a entertaining ride in special effects and superhuman abilities spiced up with a little love story. I will not remember it for actor performances, still there are very competent actors in it, especially Dafoe and Dunst. It's their characters that are given most room to develop. Yes, Maguire has the lead and his character does develop much, but most in the way of coping with his new abilities and adjusting to his new role. He does it well, but cannot be measured by the same means as the other characters. But most entertaining, as mentioned, the special effects and the possibilities they allow...7/10",7,0,0,5 February 2005
Shrek Forever After," A good way to end the series
","Recap: Life couldn't be happier in the swamp as Shrek and Fiona plan the first birthday of their little kids. Or could it? Shrek is missing the good ole days when he wasn't a celebrity, his home wasn't a tourist attraction and his life weren't just chaos. One night he meets Rumpelstiltskin, a tricky little man crafty in magic deal. Shrek signs a deal that he can go back for one day, but of course Rumpelstiltskin has made his own terms. Shrek comes to a reality were Rumpelstiltskin is king and Fiona is the resistance leader of all the repressed ogres. To save them all Shrek must once again woo Fiona.Comments: The fourth installment of the Shrek series, and now it seems the series have come to an end. Or so I hope. Shrek Forever After is still a good movie, still funny, but the concept seem to be a little watered down now. This story stands more on its own legs, an adventure in its own rights. But it doesn't have all the more or less hidden references and homages to different fairy tales and more modern movies, stuff that elevated the previous movies from very good to stellar. So this seems like the time to end the series, while things are still good.Because this is a good movie, it is funny, but is more prominently a movie for the kids than the previous were, which everybody could enjoy. I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't as hilarious as the others, and simply didn't meet the high expectations. The only that seemed to get better, and the best in this movie, was Donkey and Murphy's portrayal of him. Added to that was quite a lot good jokes or just fun situations, but nothing really spectacular. So it's time to put the ogres to sleep for good this time (before anybody does something we all will regret) 6/10",6,1,2,6 December 2010
Collateral," Good, interesting, and well thought through.
","** BANG, HERE BE SPOILERS **Recap: Max (Foxx) starts his shift at his 'temporary' (since the last 12 years) job as a cab driver. He gets a fare, an attractive woman named Annie (Pinkett Smith). He starts to talk to this woman, more than the usual small talk, and they really connect. She is an prosecutor in the middle of a big case and really stressed out. The ride ends with he giving her a picture he uses to relax, and he of course gets her phone number. The next fare, a middle-aged man (Cruise) is a little strange. He says he has some business to do around the city, and hires Max to be his ride for the night. At their first stop, a man drops on the roof of the cab. Apparently, his fare is a professional hit-man. Max is not so keen to be the driver of a hit-man but is forced at gunpoint. So, their journey begins, an odd relationship evolves between the cold calculating hit-man and his driver as they go on their tour. And then both police and criminals get on their tail.Comment: An interesting story with some sparks of pure violence in between of long stretches of talk and or different subplots, primarily in Max's cab. It is those stretches that differs this movie from others, and giving it an extra dimension. Both characters are given time to develop and form an odd relationship between them. Max's character is extremely well played by Foxx, and nicely described in the movie (by small details). Cruise is equally good (or better) as hit-man Vincent. In the movie we for once get an evil hit-man that is more than just evil. This character actually has a background, feelings and a depth that is rarely seen in movie bad guys. In addition to the tremendous work on the characters there are more cinematic diamonds. The use of music and sound effects are stellar, with different themes and a fine-tuned relationship between story and music. There are other interesting, sometimes unusual, choices by the director (and crew) in editing and camera shots. Refreshing and very well done. There is also different themes and details in the scenery that it may pay off to pay attention to.There are some similarities in this move to director Mann's previous movie Heat. This movie is not as good as Heat, because, frankly, Heat was nothing short of brilliant. This movie is still very good, well worth both time and money. I've seen this movie twice now, and I must say that it wasn't until the second time around that I really discovered all the small details, so my advice would be. Watch this, at least once, and pay attention. Don't become passive but search the details, they're there, and they're great.9/10",9,0,1,10 December 2004
The Machinist," Uh, so what?
","Recap: Trevor Reznik suffers from insomnia, in fact he claims not to have slept for a year. And he has lost a lot of weight. So, his life revolves around three places. An all night open café at an airport, a prostitute called Stevie and his work at a factory. It is at the factory he first meets Ivan, an odd character. One day a co-worker asks Reznik to help him, but Reznik gets distracted by Ivan and an accident were the co-worker loses his arm is the result. This is the point were Reznik really start to slip into a strange behavior. Management at the factory claims to know nothing about Ivan and his friends at the factory turns their backs on him. At the same time mysterious messages appear at Rezniks refrigerator. He believes that he is the target of some plot, and that Ivan has the key. But Ivan is hard to catch, and Reznik starts to doubt what is real and what is not.Comments: First, it is a very well made film. The directing is superb, with a lot of hints, clues and references planted around the movie. Use of music, sound effects and visual keys are used in a nice balance. So there is no wrong there. And there is no fault in the acting either. The focus is heavy on Bale/Reznik, and he does it very well. You might actually think that Bale went a little too far with the weight loss, as he is scarily thin in the movie. Well, that's his decision and it do augment the message of Reznik not being very well. In total, I can't actually find any problem with the making of the movie. Instead it is the story that fails. It totally failed to connect, and I found myself not really caring what happened. I sat in the cinema, saw Reznik acting crazy and thought: 'Aha, OK... so what?'. The story lacks the ability to reach out to the audience. I couldn't identify with Reznik, nor could I feel sympathy for him. Actually I didn't have any feelings about what Reznik did that could engage me in the story, not sympathy, not wonder, not anger. Nothing. This movie is proof of that you can do everything right in a production, but still fail. You need the story to carry the movie. Still I hesitantly rate it a 5, only because of the directing and acting.5/10",5,2,3,6 October 2005
Now You See Me," Take a leap of faith...
","Take a leap of faith, that is a common theme in the movie. And it applies to us as the audience too. Before I wrote this review I checked around and saw that other reviews were quite mixed. Some loved it, and some hated it. I loved it. But it required a leap of faith... to believe in the magic of the film.So this is magic/heist movie. Four aspiring young (can you still call Woody Harrelson young?) magicians are recruited by a mysterious person to form the act: The Four Horsemen. In their first show they do a big finale by robbing a bank halfway around the world. That gets everyones attention (especially the FBI's) and the magicians rise to stardom. Now starts a cat and mouse chase with the authorities, all the time while their mysterious sponsor remains in the shadows.Now, performing magic acts must be easier in a movie than in real life, but quite a few are tricks that could have been made (and are?) in real magic shows. And here is the leap of faith we need to take. If you buy into the premise of the movie, that the tricks work, it becomes a spectacle of fun (if you don't, well quite everything falls apart, but why watch a magic movie and not want to believe in the magic).The ride we are taken along is fast paced, with some good action and some nice effects. The air, much built upon from the magic shows, is good and humorous. The movie is really entertaining. It is fun to follow their magic tricks and heists. To follow the next step, and trying to stay one step ahead of the heists. And therein perhaps is the biggest fault of the movie. The final twist is not really hard to see coming, but actually that doesn't matter too much. It is the magic that is the central part of this, so just sit back and be entertained.",8,0,1,30 September 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Good, but the story is not really up to other Marvel movies
","There is much to like about Captain America: Civil War, another of Marvel's superhero movies. It ties in with both the Captain America series (naturally) but also the Avenger movies, as almost of all of the heroes makes an appearance. It also builds on a logical thought from the other movies, albeit that they save the world, the Avengers also cause massive destruction whenever they appear. The 'civilian' world will try to take control. And this naturally leads to strife within the Avengers. But that is also the biggest problem with the movie. The story inevitably leads to spectacular, effects filled fights between the different Avengers. But there is no suspense, I could never really believe that any of the heroes really beating (and hurting) one of the others. The fights are just as spectacular as anyone can wish, they should be the movies main event. But since it is known from the beginning that no one will really win or lose, the story come to something of a standstill during the fights. Ironically, during these action-packed scenes, nothing really important happens.As Marvel's movies always is, this is entertaining. Witty and fast dialog, action-packed scenes and good effects. But it would have been better if they would have fought one of the bad guys. It would have surely been full of clichÃ©s then too, but then the fights would have meant more, not been so predictable. As such, Civil War doesn't really rise to the standard of the other movies of the Avengers.",6,0,2,11 March 2017
Pearl Harbor," Visually stunning
","Recap: Two kids grew up as best friends with a fascination for flying. They both become army fliers during the WW II and end up at Pearl Harbor the fateful day the Japanese strikes. They also end up in triangle drama when both become involved with the same woman, a navy nurse.Comments: A long movie, but a little to my surprise, not too long. It has no problem to fill out the entire 160 minutes it runs, which many other movies finds it hard to do. One reason this does is that it has a few distinctive phases, or acts. There is pre Pearl Harbor, the attack and then post Pearl Harbor. Each with it's own story, almost like small movies or episodes within the movie. Because of that, no story runs too long, or gets old.But honestly, the story is mostly secondary to the real experience. The epically beautiful visual part of the movie. If a depiction of a brutally violent and fatal event ever can be described as beautiful, I think this is it. Two details I was most impressed with was the bomb-perspective, were we got to ride piggyback on the bombs falling. And the vortexes behind the fighters as they fly through the smoke. Attention to details are appreciated.This was a positive surprise for me. I had expected nice visual shots, and was not disappointed. But I had feared a much weaker and duller story. But together with the action shots it never felt long. Good entertainment, whatever others say.7/10",7,1,6,6 February 2009
No Strings Attached," Sweet comedy
","No strings attached is a sweet romantic comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman (with a surprisingly strong supporting cast). Emma and Adam decides to staying just friends, with benefits, and as the title said, with no strings attached. Well, not surprisingly, strings start to attach themselves and emotions start to build up. Perhaps more surprisingly is that both Kutcher and Portman manages to act real low key and actually rather sweet in this comedy. Despite being the big stars they are, they are not trying to steal the show in any way. Instead they steer the story along with real good acting.There is no real surprises here, it is a standard romantic comedy with all the (mandatory?) twists and turns. But I liked it better than I thought I would, wouldn't mind seeing this one again.",6,0,1,28 May 2012
Tropic Thunder," Great action-comedy-parody
","Recap: An inexperienced director is stuck between his starstudded cast that won't do as they're told and his rich but abusive producer. In a final attempt to make his film before he is shut down he tries something drastic. He leaves his actors in the middle of the jungle telling them he has put cameras and explosives all over the jungle, and now it's up to them to act it out. Unfortunately the next thing he does is stepping on a landmine and therefore can't explain that the villains (and their guns) that appear are real and not part of his movie.Comments: It's not easy trying to do many things at the same time, often ending up doing each part half-hearted. But here Ben Stiller is writing, directing and acting (watch the extra material on this) and doing each part very well. In special he has put together a script (with the help of others i.e. Justin Theroux) that is a little daring but mixes action, comedy and parody at a level that I haven't seen before. It is a risk to diversify too much but Stiller's script allows him to do it and the result is great actually.It does help that Stiller has gotten a good cast to work with, and that stars have turned up for cameos giving the movie an edge you can't write or act.However, it may well be Robert Downey Jr that steals the movie with his performance as Kirk Lazarus, or Sgt Osiris, whichever persona he is in at the time. The line 'I stay in character until I've done the DVD commentary' is really telling. His competition might be Tom Cruise, aka Les Grossman, the abusive producer. The best Cruise I've seen in many years.Well, I liked it very much. It's not often you get a movie that can combine own jokes, obvious and hidden spoofs, and a lot of explosions in a balanced way that Tropic Thunder manages to do. I got a lot of laughs out of it. My hat is off for Stiller, please do another one? 8/10",8,1,2,22 May 2009
Inside Out," Another Pixar quality
","This was a new Pixar experience for me, actually. I like Pixar and are almost always impressed by how they can make humor work on many different levels, for young and grown-ups at the same time. Inside out, however, is not an all out ha-ha comedy, as many (if not all) of the other Pixar movies are. Still funny, but there is more room and food for thought in this one, and above all, there is a beauty to it. It is a balanced movie, with humor, about growing up. About growing to accept that life is a mix of feelings, and that that enhances memories. That life isn't clear cut, but complex. And Pixar handles that really well too, in addition to the humor. Even more impressive.",8,3,24,3 January 2016
Quantum of Solace," The new Bond is better
","Recap: Still shaken by Vesper's betrayal and death Bond continues to unravel whatever secret organization she belonged to. His leads point to Dominic Greene, an highly regarded environmentalist and philanthropist who has a side business of overthrowing governments. But Greene has very high connections in a good many countries, and Bond suddenly finds himself alone, at odds with his own management on who is friend or foe.Comments: The second chapter in the 'new' Bond, and even if the old ones are good, Casino Royale and now Quantum of Solace, in my mind, has revived the franchise. Daniel Craig does a great Bond, a little more serious and dark, but still with a touch of the unique humor that only Bond has.Quantum of Solace is a full paced action from beginning to end, and that is both its strength and weakness. It is highly entertaining full of exciting duels and chases, at land, sea and air. There is never a dull moment. There is always the next step in his mission, the next fight. However, because of that the movie never shifts down a gear to let the character develop or the mysterious story develop further. Also there is no time to be deviously sneaky or learn about new gadgets. I know I said I liked the more serious Bond, but at least an appearance of Q would have been fun.Olga Kurylenko does her part as the Bond-girl well. But she too is all action, because of the aforementioned lack of time to develop character. We get a brief introduction of her history in passing, but it is mostly here a little more character development might have been good. Bond we already know quite a lot about, or at least we think we do.One thing I also like about Bond, it is the promise that there will be more. There is clearly more to work with in this storyline, and Bond will return. I also wish he would return a little sooner.8/10",8,3,10,11 July 2009
The Dirty Dozen," Classic war action that is just a little too long
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Recap: Maj. Reisman (Marvin) is given the assignment to train twelve convicted men, either to death or very long sentences, for a covert mission it to occupied France. He is not very happy about it and the twelve convicted men are not thrilled either. There are a lot of suspicion and disbelief among the undisciplined convicts. So first Reisman has to put himself in respect, then bring the group together and at last train them to kill. Progress is slow, and Reisman's superiors are starting to lose patience. The group has to prove themselves in a war game. If they fail, they go back to prison. If they succeed they will be sent into real war were failure is much more fatal...Comments: First, it is a stellar cast. Marvin, Borgnine, Bronson, Savalas, Sutherland, López and Cassavetes. Unfortunately everyone is playing tough guys so there is very little emotions present. It feels like there are much more potential in a cast like this than what is shown here. The story is good, the idea brilliant. However it is a little too long, and I did get a little bored with just the tough guy thing. No change of pace or perspective that might have felt fresh now and then. There are a few witty lines that produce a smile now and then. The war game episode is the best as it is not too long in itself. The final battle is unfortunately too long. And it is annoying that most of the soldiers seem to forget both training and common sense (for example, while trying to be sneaky, don't run upright. Or when being shot at, don't stand upright.) Still it is somewhat of a classic. Give it a try...6/10",6,1,3,3 March 2005

However, when he is older Evan discovers that, with the help of his old journals, to go back in time, and change his past. However, it is not as easy as he first thinks. Even if his intentions is the best, fate seems to make the new reality bad in one way or another. But if he could go back in time just once again... maybe he can correct things.A interesting movie where some key moments are left out, at the beginning at least, when the main character blacks out. These defining events that seem to determine what he and his friends become are traumatic and not altogether nice to either see, or guess what happens when we don't get to see. The story is about love, and to make life as good as he can for himself and his friends. Though I thought the movie is somewhat depressing.The story is nice, and the movie is developing interestingly while filling in and/or redoing the missing pieces in the story. Not action-paced, but there is no dull moment in this movie. It certainly had some peculiarities and might not be for everyone.7/10",7,0,2,10 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," What? Nothing more?
","** YEAH, HERE WILL BE SPOILERS ** Recap: A satellite suddenly detects a heat signature under the ice in Antarctica. Soon it is discovered to be a pyramid, that contains features from pyramids all over the world (South America, Cambodia and Egypt). The head of the corporation, Mr Weyland, assembles a team to on an expedition to the pyramid. Among them are archaeologists such as de Rousa and survival expert Woods. However, as they reach the pyramid and expect to start drilling down to the pyramid they discover that a tunnel mysteriously has appeared during the last 24 hours. AS they venture down the tunnel and then into the pyramid, they discover that the pyramid was used as a sacrificial temple, and that they are not alone. A hive of Aliens has been awakened in the pyramid and three Predators has arrived to hunt them. The humans are in the line of fire, and as they get separated in the (changing) maze that the pyramid is, they get slain by Aliens and Predators alike...Comments: It is evident that much work has been put into the set and surroundings. They are detailed and nice, with some goofy exceptions. It is unfortunate though that the same level of work hasn't been put into the story for example. A lot of time was spent to introduce first the different (main) characters, then the pyramid itself. We got to see and hear about the mythology and history of the pyramid (and the AVP mythology). However, on the part that I suspect most see this movie, the fights between Aliens and Predators, we see very little. The action part of the movie is over very quickly. Most of the Aliens are not slain in combat, but by a bomb. Quick and efficient, but not exciting to watch. The hero and heroine only escape this explosion because that the scientific team has assembled a sledge (pulled by wires on the ground) that actually can outrun an explosion. Impressive (and annoying). Then there are the mandatory end fight, between our heroes and the Alien Queen. It is short and not very thrilling, I had kind of lost interest by then (mostly because of how they handled the other Aliens). This takes place on the surface of the ice. I presume that it is cold on Antarctica, yet the heroine don't seem bothered by having to remove some of her clothes... In short, the poor story overshadows everything else. The character depth and development is mostly non-existent, but that is no problem in a movie like this, and doesn't disturb me. As said above... much of the details in set and history are very good but you can't make a movie out of that. Some of the fight scenes that are there are good though, and leaves an unsatisfied desire to see more. In total, a disappointment. I expected more...5/10",5,1,2,28 May 2005

If Guru Pitka can reunite their biggest star with his estranged wife, and break the Leafs' curse and win the Stanley Cup, none less than Oprah herself has offered him a spot on her show.Comments: Supposedly a cut character from the Austin Powers' movies, and it shows. The humor and set up are identical to the Austin movies. Unfortunately that means that most of the jokes are extremely low and juvenile. At best they are just about sex and mildly distasteful. At worst they are almost disgraceful and embarrassing for any above the age of five. It's a shame because Myers can be a good comedian at times, as is evident because a few jokes and puns are actually very good.Mostly it is a movie that should be forgotten as soon as possible. It should only be watched as a last resort and only if you're really tired and easily entertained. Because when you think about it, it is quite bad.3/10",3,1,6,9 December 2009

In a military waging a losing war, training young men to become killing machines, he just wants to be human, as the tagline says. This leads to controversies within his platoon. Poor Pvt. Cantwell (Guiry), I believe it was, who was appointed day officer, charged with keeping Bozz in line, has no easy task. And both suffer from it. But as pressure keeps building up through training, a few soldiers sooner, or later, realizes that the military is not their way. But the army in not to let any potential soldier walk away, and only a few of them walks away with the help of Bozz. But his ways creates a lot of enemies as well both within the ranks of officers and within his own platoon. And this might be a problem when you're training with real weapons and real ammo...Comments: A very good movie with a deep, consistent and catching story. There were no moments where you wanted, or were able to drift off. Also no annoying goofs or plot holes that stole away some focus. I also thought that the entire cast, with Farrell in the lead, gave very good performances. In conclusion I don't really have much to say or comment other than to me, the movie and the entire experience was both well worked through and based on a well thought through ground.8/10",8,0,0,29 January 2005
Remember the Titans," Entertaining, important
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **For the first time, the schools in Alexandria is integrated, and that means for the first time the schools football team will be mixed black and white. Coach Boone (Washington) is politically appointed to coach the team in place of coach Yoast (Patton). They have the work cut out for them, as they have to bring the two societies of black and white communities to work together as a team. To complicate matters, the coaches don't really trust each other either. To bring the team together, all the players go to training camp were they're forced to live and work together. But problems arise again when the team come back to town, and the ordinary life begins again and the divided community try to tear the team apart. However, they are successful on the field and for every game they win, they come closer to the championship.This is an entertaining movie about an important topic. It is really great to see that a movie can show an important, and still current, issue and still be entertaining. This is mostly due to a nice plot and story, well thought through, that don't shy away from hard interesting situations and the very good performances from the entire cast. Both Washington and Patton is great as the coaches and the team is good as well, especially Hurst and Harris. Another part that makes the story very good is that there is time for individual development in the characters, and there are a lot of interesting characters in and around the team. The use of music is also very good, both the music in the movie and that from 'outside'. All in all, interesting cast, good acting, story and directing and an interesting topic. Very good.8/10",8,1,2,16 November 2004
Liar Liar," Very funny one man show
","** Here be spoilers, and that's the truth **Recap: Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a successful lawyer about to become partner at the law firm where he works. In his work he frequently lies and he cannot stop out of work either. He constantly lies to his former wife Audrey (Tierney) and son Max (Cooper). This leads to him constantly disappointing and hurting his son, and now Audrey plans to move with her new boyfriend Jerry (Elwes) out of town. But Max very much loves his father and at his birthday party, which Fletcher of course is absent from, he wishes that for one the day, his father cannot lie. His wish comes true. And this proves to be a tremendous problem for Fletcher. His new case is utterly depending on him being able to lie and manipulate, but he cannot do it. His entire world falls around him.Comment: Even if there are many other good actors around, this basically is a one-man show. Carrey's show. His character's inability to lie puts him in bizarre situations where Carrey can use his entire range of vocal and gesture comic ability. And he does it well, very well. His co-actors find themselves in his shadow, even if their performances still are good. But they're not given as much space and time as Fletcher is, and by all means, in this movie this is as it should be. Carrey even outshines the story, though it is a mistake to overlook it completely. The story is the foundation for Carrey's character ability to act and helps with some nice witty and funny lines. And there are a fleck of seriousness in the development of the relationship between Fletcher and Max. However, the best parts might actually be after the movie ends. During the credits some outtakes are shown, and they're hilarious. Be patient, sit tight and enjoy them. All in all, a great comedy well worth to watch more than once.8/10",8,1,1,11 February 2005
Bridesmaids," Disappointing
","I was told that Bridesmaids was a refreshing new look, out of the perspective of a woman, of the buddy comedy, such as The Hangover. And in some ways it is, some ways it isn't.Bridesmaids do certainly put the action in the lap of the women, the number of men in the movie is easily counted for they are few. It will certainly pass the Bechdel test if anyone is interested, although a lot of the women characters is referencing their lives to the men around them (which is a bit that I expected that the movie should try to avoid). The comedy is based much on the social intricacies of the group in a way that similar ('male perspective') movies don't. So that is somethinng new.Unfortunately, Bridesmaids, in an attempt to be the counterpart to The Hangover, copies a lot of jokes from that type of movies. It is far too much of juvenile toilet humor, and that is in my view the least fun of comedy out there. I had hoped they would go another direction, but unfortunately no.The only other type of comedy is when the character Annie (Wiig) makes a complete fool out of herself. I don't know who was embarrased the most, me or the character. I know that this is a common theme for jokes and comedy, but it is not to my taste (here actually The Hangover does it better, using wierd situations and characters to build up the comedy). So, there is toilet humor and embarrasment, and unfortunately not much else. Not much of variation and the movie relies too much on just a single track of comedy.McCarthy was nominated for an Oscar in a supporting role, but can't really see why. The role is very minor and not that funny at all. McCarthy has been better in many other works, Gilmore Girls for example.No, this movie was not for me. Maybe I am not of the target audience, but I found it became dull and boring as it started to repeat itself.",3,1,4,12 February 2019
Zulu," Historical War Epic
","Recap: The grave and ominous news reach the small detachment at Rorke's Drift that the main column of the British army has been annihilated by a vastly greater but technically inferior Zulu army. Now they learn that a small contingent of the Zulu army is heading for the missionary and temporary hospital at Rorke's Drift. But there is only about a hundred British soldiers stationed at the missionary and they desperately prepare for the coming attack.Comments: Something very much looking like a historical account of the events of the real battle, even if some things surely has been dramatized and changed. However, what is most remarkably notable, and gives it away as a historical dramatization, is it that there is no real bad guys. There is none among the British soldiers that fall out or has their own intention. Not even between the junior but evenly ranked commanding officers at the station, where the outsider Chard takes over because of only having a few months superiority (one of the things that has been changed, as the difference were much greater). And most remarkably, not even the Zulu are portrayed as evil, bloodthirsty or even ignorant. Instead they are depicted as brave, intelligent, well organized and above all noble foes.Instead it is a epic movie of bravery and doing one's duty. Of standing one's ground against overwhelming odds. And it does it very well. It is rather long at slightly over two hours long, but there is never a problem of feeling that the time doesn't pass. What it doesn't have, and what it lacks compared to the really great movies, is the real conflict between two evenly matched enemies. Sometimes this feels like two teams meeting for a sporting event, a soccer game, despite people dying in droves. But there is no real intensity.Fun to see Michael Caine in his first starring role, and I have to admit that it took a few scenes before I recognized him, but it is always good to see how the stars once started out. However, the character that did the greatest impression is Color-Sergeant Bourne. His calm and way to express himself elevated the movie (even if this was also not entirely historically correct).7/10",7,5,9,5 December 2009
The Pianist," Heartfelt history
","The Pianist is a very gripping and heartfelt movie. Based on the memoirs of the talented pianist Szpilman, a polish Jew who survived the German occupation of Warzaw. The story is about his experiences inside and outside the ghetto the Germans established, how close he came to death by the oppressing forces. But also how he found both cruelty and kindness were least expected. At the same time it is a good testament of how Jews in common around him were treated. How many were killed or deported, fates that Szpilman only narrowly escaped.Well acted with Adrien Brody in the lead, and directed by Roman Polanski, the story is handled delicately. Both grand schemes and details are told. Most notably Szpilman's musicality is used to enhance feelings and memories in a few scenes. It's told and acted in a fashion, mostly low key, that augments the important statement it is. It also makes the movie, and the characters, easy to connect with and feel for. It's hard not to get engaged in the movie. Just like it is supposed to be.8/10",8,0,0,2 April 2011
28 Days Later...," Well, if you won't ask any questions, the story holds...
","Recap: A few activists break into a sealed lab where experiments are made on chimps. A scientist stumbles upon them, and panicky tries to stop the activists. He shouts that the monkeys are infected with an incurable virus, with rage. And when the activists open the first cage, the monkey immediately attacks the nearest activist, instantly infecting the human. And so the pandemic breaks out. 28 days later Jim wakes up in a hospital, just to find it deserted. The bike-messenger, put in the hospital by an accident, takes to the streets to find them deserted as well. Well almost deserted, in a church, the priest suddenly attacks him, screaming unintelligibly. Jim flees and get unexpected help, and soon learns that only a few persons are still sane and uninfected. But a radio-message brings hope that there still is disease-free areas...Comments: Unfortunately it is glaringly apparent that the background story is just an bad excuse to explain empty streets and the existence of zombiemonsters. The inserted gap between the release and Jim's awakening, lets the story ignore questions as how the virus works and spreads widely, and why no response is working. When Jim wakes up, it is just there, and might as well always been. Then we get a movie full of zombie/monster attacks, blood splatter so forth and so on, until the crew felt they had enough material to fill a movie. Insert another black time jump, and now everything is fine again. To conclude, the story itself has no clues as to answer any questions about the foundation it tries to build upon, and if you have one (question that is), the entire movie falls apart.And unfortunately there is no suspense or development in the movie either, as the story aren't really trying to go anywhere. There are just so many minutes of zombie bashing, and it soon gets old...Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson gives a fair performance though, but they just can't carry this story. All in all it was a disappointment.3/10",3,15,29,21 January 2006
Cars," Pixar delivers once again
","Recap: It's the final race of the season, and the winner will take the famous Piston Cup. However the race ends in a three-way tie, and it is decided that another deciding race will be held in California in a week. En route to the race, one of the competitors, Lightning McQueen, the rookie, get separated from his truck and loses his way. Finally he ends up in a small town in the middle of the desert, which is on the edge of ruin. McQueen, whose entrance wrecked a large part of the town, must repair the damage, but can't get his mind off the race. Or can he?Comments: Pixar delivers once again (not another Nemo - but who can deliver such movies all the time - Nemo was superb). First off, the animation is stellar. I could watch the movie solely to watch the effects. Especially the water effects are spectacular. But, of course, as much effort has been put into the story. Combined with the detailed animation, this story, weaves a humoristic, funny and warm movie, as Pixar usually does. This is a movie that everyone can watch, both grown-ups and kids. Parents with small kids should be warned though! The movie is over two hours long. It's never dull, the entertainment is good throughout the movie, but I could guess that small kids could grow tired of sitting still this long.As before, characters are an important piece of the movie, and as before Pixar has done well. Owen Wilson is a good choice, and performs well, as Lightning McQueen. Other favourites include Mater, Guido and Luigi. But I really recommend you to watch this and pick your own favourites.7/10",7,0,0,28 October 2006
Get Out," Unusual horror
","Chris, who is black, follows his girlfriend Rose, who is white, to meet her parents for the first time. It's a meeting where everyone can feel the pressure. And the racial issue is at the forefront, although Rose assures Chris that everyone will be ok with it. At Rose's parents house Chris starts to feel uneasy. Perhaps it is that all the help is black, or perhaps it is some odd behaviour from the help. And it doesn't get better when there is a family party coming, with many other family and friends acting very odd indeed. Chris is starting to feel singled out, something deeply disturbing is going on.An unnerving movie. Jordan Peele, the director, manages to take us along Chris's mental ride. Nothing is revealed beforehand, and there is just the feeling, those few odd details, that something is wrong. Like Chris though, we have no idea what is wrong. At the same time, as the weird things keep happen, sometimes to a bizarre level, it takes on a streak of comedy as well. Augmented by some odd choices of music I can almost best describe this as a horror/comedy.Unlike many other horror movies it is not so gory and blooddripping as others, not until the end, that is. When all is revealed and Chris need to fight for his freedom, you get some quite bloody scenes.I usually don't like horror movies, but this as stated, is something else. In the horror genre for sure, but so different that my normal objections doesn't apply. If you also usually dislike the genre, you might want to give Get Out a chance. If you on the other hand are a fan of the genre, I'm sure you will love it for it's originality as well.",7,1,2,16 April 2019
2012," Why can't we have an end of the world without kids?
","Recap: Dr Adrian Helmsley is invited to his friend and colleague's research facility in India. There he has discovered that the neutrino flux from the sun has changed and is irrevocably heating up the Earth's core. This in turn will lead to the destabilization of the Earth's crust, and practically the end of the world. Adrian, who is employed by the US government rushes this to the presidential adviser, and secret plans are made how to save humankind. The problem is, they can't save everybody. Jackson Curtis is a more or less failed writer, separated from his wife and two kids, who during a camping trip to reconnect with his kids stumbles on the secret. A race and fight to save his family starts with disaster striking all around them.Comments: Emmerich, the director, said that he wanted to make one final disaster movie, and that he wanted to pack everything in it. He did. 2012 is a spectacular disaster movie, that probably should be enjoyed at s big screen as possible. The effects are grand, a non-stop show of apocalyptic destruction. Floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, plane crashes, falling skyscrapers, I think we got most, if not all of the disaster movies covered. So, there is nothing new really, but just more of it, with to date unparalleled effects.Unfortunately this is a effects show through and through. The background story is regrettably also a complete reuse and repetition of older disaster movies. It robs the movie of all suspense and wonder of what is going to happen next. Who will survive is no surprise, but predictable from the get go. Why it was decided to include, no check that, to rely on a story of a absent separated father that finally comes through and saves his family, is beyond me. It is completely worn out, and something Emmerich himself has used before, but that's also the answer to why. If he didn't have to work on the story, all the focus could be put into the effects, which everything is all about anyway. And why not, when the movie is already saving the world and humankind, why not save the family unit too? So yet again we have a movie that suffers from the Annoying Kid Syndrome (which actually seems to be growing into an epidemic). To be truthful it doesn't suffer as bad as many other movies, but at key and crucial moments, the kid is either totally helpless and just screaming, or tries to be the hero and save them all, even if they're just ten years old. The most plausible outcome of that should be the demise of the kid, the family and in this movie a couple of hundred thousands more. Yet it is never so. Understandably, what writer or director would kill off a child? But leave them out of it from the beginning and problem solved! Because screaming and ten year old heroics are not that enjoying. But that may be because I got no kids of my own yet Besides the kid characters (I've got absolutely nothing against the kids themselves!) I found the cast good. John Cusack is a solid veteran that has been around before but especially Chiwetel Ejiofor is good, and underrated in general. Amanda Peet and Thandie Newton bring some known names to the cast, but their supporting roles are too small for them to have any real impact on the movie, which is very much male oriented.It is long, so make time for watching it, but it is rarely dull, even though predictable as a street sign. Sit back, turn of that brain, and enjoy the end of the world, that is the spectacular world of special effects.6/10",6,0,1,5 September 2010

Later in life, Johnny now a great star, the devil wants to cash in on the deal, making Johnny the devils bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider.Comments: This is pure entertainment. Nice effects, really nice actually, I especially liked the skull. Good action and a few jokes. Not much to think about, but that is sort of the point. Actually this is a very well made movie with some really nice touches and attention to details. For example see Mephistopheles shadow on the tent in the beginning.In my opinion clearly better than it's reputation. I sincerely hope for a sequel, but only if the same actors return and someone puts a real effort to script and direction. And I sincerely hope for Sam Elliot to reprise his role...7/10",7,5,7,9 January 2009
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," To boldly go...
","A nice feel good movie about bland Walter Mitty. His life is as dull and he doesn't dare to approach the woman of his dreams, who has started to work at the same place as Walter does. But suddenly the magazine where they work is bought up and turned into an online publication. Everyones jobs is at risk. But the cover photo for the last issue and Walter takes upon himself to find it. And in the process transforms himself and his Life.The movie starts slow, in pace with Walter and his story. And there are some odd turns (and start-overs) as Walter daydeams take over. For me, the story unfortunately got too disjointed. All got better as Walter finally left for his adventure, but then, because of his daydreams, you didn't know how much of it was a real part of the story. Things got better though, and with his confidence growing, the movie grew as well. It turned into a feel good adventure movie, and it was quite fun to follow Walter on his unbelievable adventures.6/10",6,0,0,30 January 2016
I Am Legend," Very good sci-fi thriller
","Recap: Aiming to cure cancer a humanly engineered virus is tried on humans. However, it mutates and starts to spread widely in the population. The effects are horrendous. The infected become highly light-sensitive, extremely aggressive flesh-eating monsters. Only a few are immune, and most of them are killed. One survivor is Robert Neville, an army virologist expert. He stays in NY fighting for his own survival, every day working to find a cure to save the planet.Comments: This is a very good sci-fi thriller, and it is that because of many reasons. Mainly, it is because it keeps the suspense throughout the movie. Sure, there are no major twists or surprises, but most scenes are filled with suspense. Either from some impending threat or by using flashbacks to explain how everything came to be like it is.Secondly, I really liked that we for once could have a epidemic without having all turning into zombies and turning the movie into a blood-dripping slasher-movie. Sure, there is blood, there are action but it is not the main theme. Instead the focus is much more on Neville's loneliness (portrayed very good by Smith) and lack of human contact than monster-hunting. A very wise decision by director Lawrence, in my opinion.Director Lawrence's skill and ambition are evident in my third point. The details. Sure, there are some goofs. Some that should have been avoided, quite easily at that. But most are not that important. What I really liked however is the details, some are just lying in the background. A lot of the story is told by articles posted in the background, for example on Neville's refrigerator. And I don't think the inclusion of Bob Marley or the extensive part from Shrek (loneliness) is coincidental. And what about the butterflies... With this and Constantine (2005) in his repertoire, Lawrence's future work is worth looking out for.I had expected a more action packed blockbuster but got a nice surprise. This is a pure thriller with a lot of talent in it.8/10",8,0,0,16 November 2008

Without his own apartment, he owes his friend, Ned Schneebly, whom he lives with a lot of money in rent and he just got kicked out from his band. Ned and Ned's girlfriend tell him to get his ct together, maybe give up his rocking dream, and get a real job. So when a prestigious private elementary school calls for Ned, in need for a substitute teacher, Dewey decides to impersonate his friend to get his hand on some cash. Problem is, Dewey knows nothing about anything but rock. So he hijacks his class, forms the into a rock band and teaches them to rock, all with a single goal. Victory at Battle of the Bands.Comments: Cute, a little funny but overall very predictable and very close to being a family-movie. The movie itself actually fails in its own theme; to revolt, to challenge and to 'stick it to the Man'. Unfortunately the movie and its jokes are completely mainstream. There are no surprises or new ideas, just the same old proved ones. And to be honest, the proved approach does work, to a certain extent. That is why it has stuck around, but by only using this there is nothing new, no refreshing approach, nothing to elevate the movie. Nothing to give the viewer a little jolt. Because the movie is too slow sometimes and does not rock at all.Jack Black is perfect as Finn, and the child actors impressed me. And then there is the music. It uses some great classic rock pieces, and that actually elevates the movie somewhat, but not by much.5/10",5,4,9,19 March 2006
Unknown," Thriller that keeps you on the edge
","A good thriller with some decent action in it. The plot is based upon a very unnerving and unpleasant idea that after waking up from a serious accident someone has taken your place. That is what happens to Martin Harris, his own wife doesn't recognize him and there is another man in his place. He has no way to prove his identity and even the family photos seem to suggest he is crazy, as the new man is in them, not Martin. Something is indeed very wrong, Martin has just no idea how wrong.The idea is unnerving, but at the same time thrilling and kept me on the edge. It felt like if I missed one moment I could miss something crucial, something that could turn the entire movie around. Just how a thriller should feel. And indeed, there is a twist, quite a major one, so it pays to keep attention.Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger are both very good accomplished actors and they do well, but there is no real spark between them in this movie. It just doesn't feel quite right. Unfortunately. And I had hoped the character Ernst Jürgen, the most sympathetic old Stasi agent, if there ever were one, could have played a larger role.In all it is a very good thriller. But it there is some spark missing to put it among the best.7/10",7,2,3,1 November 2011
Hero," Epic and beautiful
","** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Qin is fighting to unite China, which is divided in several small kingdoms. However, not all small kingdoms that are about to be conquered is really happy with that. So Qin has to live with several attempts on his life, and has taken extreme precautions to stop the assassins. Now one soldier has killed two of the most known assassins and is about to be rewarded by the king. The reward is stated by the law, gold and land and a toast a mere 10 steps away from the king (compared to the 100 steps one should normally consider). As the king and the soldier are about to toast, the soldier is asked to tell the story how he defeated is adversaries, known to have great skill. He tells a tale full of wit and cunning, skill with the sword and martial arts, and of love and betrayal. The king listens but senses that there are more to the story, not all has been told, or if the truth has been told...Comment: A very beautiful movie with sharp contrasting colours in beautiful schemes. Large pieces of fabric accents and hides movement. Also the landscapes and scenery chosen for the movie are very dramatic and beautiful in itself. Together with the use of large armies this is truly a epic movie. However spectacular the battles and fights are, they are not the main focus of the movie. The focus are on the conversation between the king and the soldier, and on the story itself. What really happened, and why? So far, all is well. Then there is the decision on if you like this type of spectacular fights with skills that allow the combatants mind boggling speed and incredible jumps and so on. I don't. To me, they're more like choreographed dance than fights (yes I know that fights in movie are more or less choreographed, emphasize dance here). Sure, they are impressive and in a way fun to watch, but they're dances, too implausible to be exciting as fights. This actually lowers the tension and suspense in the movie, the fight scenes actually becomes pauses to relax in instead of heightening the suspense or thrill. This might have been intentional, what do I know? For me it is unfortunate. Still the movies should be seen, preferably in original language.6/10",6,0,1,10 July 2005
The Hurt Locker," Different war movie, but how did it win all those awards?
","Recap: A military bomb squad, consisting of three soldiers, is busy going into the last stretch of days before they are sent home. But with only 30 days left none of them dare to believe they will survive in an environment where everything might be a trap. But the squad has some internal problems when the squad leader is taking more risks than necessary. And how are they going to deal with this when they come home? Comments: With as many as six Oscars, The Hurt Locker comes with high expectations, and unfortunately doesn't really manage to live up to them. It is a very detailed and meticulous movie, not told with a overall story or a defined individual enemy. Instead it is told in episodes where the squad is thrown into one unknown after another, and because of it is much more realistic.Realism and plausibility is the key for this movie. There are no defined overly evil to combat, there is just war. There is no unnecessary or exaggerated effects or fights, but when used it is not low key. The soldiers are no super human heroes, but humans struggling to do their best. Therefore it is surprising that the movie abandons this now and then. In a few scenes realism is abandoned totally and simple mistakes are made knowingly or unknowingly, and it affects the entire movie. What disturbs me most is the tactics and organization used by the soldiers. If the USA Army sends it's squads, especially it's specially trained soldiers with a particular mission like in the bomb squads, without backup or support it the casualty rate would have been much higher. Sometimes the tactics used were just plain stupid. Other details just seem sloppy, or are we to believe that one is able to put out a car on fire with a normal hand extinguisher? I don't believe it for a moment, I know it to be impossible. If not it is a special almost magical extinguisher. That gives the movie a problem with credibility, and with a movie that aims for realism, that is a major problem and flaw.A few odd choices from the awarded editing and directing crew too. In the middle of intense scenes where the soldiers are under heavy pressure, suddenly the scene is cut with a shot of gravel or casings in slow motion. Both the momentum and narrative of the scene is cut, and have to almost start over. In some movies such moments can augment the scene, here it just interrupts it.It is a good movie, especially for those who wants to see a little different war movie. But there are enough flaws to disturb it's flow, and I can't really say it deserve all those awards. At least not in my opinion.6/10",6,8,13,7 April 2010
The Longest Day," Classic war movie
","The Longest Day is a ambitious movie that tries to show everything that happened that fateful day, the D-Day. It is very long, as it is ambitious enough to tell the story both from Allied and German viewpoints, and do so at least in a plausible way, if not wholly truthfully. That means a huge cast list, and it is a little difficult to keep track of everyone and their own little subplots. However, it also manages to deliver an overlook with each little subplot augmenting each other. As a story it is magnificent. Despite the known outcome it kept me on the edge. Helping is the for its time good effects and huge scenes with great masses of extras. It is very clear that few expenses were cut making this film. The huge cast also allows for a lot of famous actors appearing, most notably John Wayne, Richard Burton and Sean Connery, among many others.Even though it is a little too long for my taste it was never boring or dull. It kept the tension and the interest by combining calm scenes with action filled ones. In that way there were never too much of either one.The Longest Day is getting a little old nowadays but still keeps it place as one impressive war movie. Only a few movies are made in this scale anymore. I can see how it has influenced the entire genre since. It is simply put a classic.8/10",8,3,4,2 November 2011
Ex Machina," Makes you think
","A suspenseful thriller without fast paced CGI (although it did win the Academy Award for special effects - the effects are used in a totally different way). Instead the story is driven by dialog and the hints of hidden agendas (and there are a few of them).It is slow paced, taking its time to make you think. The questions that the character asks of another are many times also directed to the audience. There is time to think about both ethical and philosphical questions, especially in reference to new technology, but also how we live and treat each other. What it means to be sentinent, and to be human.You don't need to think about it if you don't want to, the suspense and story is good enough to carry itself, but it is that extra dimension that gives the movie an edge.The acting and directing is very good, without anyone standing out. The entire (but small) ensemble is very good (I must admit that I didn't recognize Isaac with his beard), and director Garland knows how to make his points. He has also put in a lot of references, both to other (many of them with a similar topic) movies and history (especially in reference to technology). It is telling that the character often quote pieces that is associated with the development of the atomic bomb.Recommended, especially if you want a movie that you can continue to think about even after the end credits.",9,1,2,31 July 2019

But his ambitious, bombastic and flamboyant ways, along with his often ill advised remarks to both public and enlisted men, lands him in trouble more often than not. Despite his success on the battlefield he is relieved of command, something that pains him a lot. He is a commander, made for war, and not to be in The War of his time vexes him. Finally he gets the chance to lead the third army in France, once again able to win the glory of the battlefield.Comments: A movie that won many awards, including the Acadamy Award for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture, that has since grown into a classic. But to me it isn't that good. Don't get me wrong, it is still a movie, not just that good.It seems to follow historical events pretty much, even though some things have been changed for dramatic effect or to save time (even though it still runs over 160 minutes). The main events in Patton's World War II career seem to be there though. What makes me doubt is that Patton seem to have only one mode, all out attack, no restraints what so ever. That may be the truth, and a correct depiction of the real Patton, but it also makes the character a bit one dimensioned, something I am sure the real Patton was not.The story doesn't add much dramatic effect or suspense either, as it is seen from either Patton's or Bradley's view, i.e. the commanding officers, not the front line troops. It may also be very accurate, but not the typical war movie.Patton's speeches and remarks do live it up a bit though, as they always add some spice to the story. From the viewpoint of the movie it is those talks that drives the story. It is both a little funny, and maybe the most dramatic that's in there. The situations his words put him into are quite tense and lends some suspense to a story.In conclusion you could say it is a biographical drama. Seems pretty accurate but also made to be entertaining to watch.6/10",6,3,7,26 January 2010
The Illusionist," What a great illusion!
","Recap: A small commoner boy learns how to weave illusions, in part to impress a young girl he has a crush on. The feelings are answered, but she is the duchess of Terschingen. They are separated and not reunited until years later. Then he has become a master illusionist and she the wife to be to the imperial heir. The flame is rekindled, but their love might be a threat to their lives.Comments: First off, this is a visually stunning movie. The light, the mood, the angles. Every scene, every motion seems full of emotion. It really is a weave of an illusion with every picture being one of the threads. Only to watch each and every scene, even if they were disconnected, would have been enchanting.Movie who are visually good often lack in the story. This does not. The weave that is made is very solid. Or it seems and feels that way anyway. It is a love story, a thriller and a murder story at the same time, juggling each ball/theme very well. Neither theme is lacking or is suppressed. Each has a key component to the whole. Also it keeps a great sense of wonder about it with the illusions, each more stunning than the last (even if I know that CGI might explain it). I really want to believe that the illusion is true, and to me that is a great feeling.A great piece, a key piece in the puzzle is the acting. And even if the Crown Prince might be the bad guy, it is Eisenheim (Norton) and Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) that is the real opponents. And both bring their best. It was a long time ago I saw Norton and Giamatti this good. A near flawless performance from them both.This was true entertainment. The sense of wonder, the sense that I couldn't miss a moment so that I didn't miss a crucial detail is rare. But it is a welcome feeling when I happen upon it. This movie comes very highly recommended from me!9/10",9,0,0,24 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Extremely well made, beautiful and sad
","Recap: On the eve of the end of the first world war a boy is born. His mother dies in childbirth, and when the father looks upon his child he is horrified. The newborn looks like he is about to die of old age. He leaves the child on the stairs of a nursing home where the kid grows up. No one expects the kid to survive for long, but he does, and seems to get younger as he grows older. When he is about ten years old he meets a young girl, visiting her grandmother. Instantly they form a bond that will follow them through their life. She growing older, he growing younger by every day.Comments: If this movie would have been a house, people would have knocked on its beam and been impressed by how well it was built. The curious case of Benjamin Button is a really well made movie, it is a piece of craftsmanship. It is well shot, well edited and well acted. It is an impressive piece of art that is well worth watching.But a movie, how well made it is, a movie is still dependent on the story it tells. The story is good, it is entertaining but perhaps the title is really describing it best. It is a curious story indeed. As the movie is well made, it is well written and solid enough. But the entertainment value lies within its peculiarity, that I was really curious how it would develop. Nothing wrong with that at all, but don't expect much of a comedy, and certainly not much action. It is a drama with certain romantic elements, but not very much of a happy one. In fact I found that the story is quite a sad one, of love with almost insurmountable obstacles.It was a beautiful story, but with a sad and emotional ending. But despite the end being rather sad, it is in line with the movie, beautiful and fitting at the same time.The only fault might be that it is quite long. But to tell a whole life's story takes time, even if it is backwards.7/10",7,0,1,27 March 2010
Wimbledon," Sweet and witty
","** SPOILER ALERT **Recap: Peter Colt (Bettany), former tennis star, is making his final appearance on the tour in the tournament of Wimbledon. His career of late has been dismal and he figures he will be sent home quickly and without anyone noticing. At the other end of the career ladder is Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) a young shooting star aiming at the championship. The two meet when Colt is given the wrong room, and a sort of relationship starts to evolve. Even as the two are at different points in their lives, Colt with a dysfunctional family looking for what to do after his career and Bradbury with her father (Neill) watching her every step. As if hit by a magic wand, Colt puts his game together and starts to advance through the tournament. Bradbury, and especially her father is concerned however that their relationship might distract her.Comment: A very sweet and witty romantic comedy with stellar performances from the cast. Especially Bettany and Dunst do great work. I really liked Bettany's character Colt's introspective monologues and his conversations with tennis friend Prohl, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The parts with either them talking or Colt and Bradbury developing their relationship are simply great. But there is tennis as well, and contrary to what I expected, the scenes with the play are fast-paced and full of nice special-effects, due to good editing and special effects, not at all slow and boring as I feared they would be. The one minor flaw is that the plot is too predictable and full of clichés, but fortunately it does not taint the movie otherwise. In conclusion a fun and romantic, yes it is both, there are both laughs and loves, good romantic scenes. Highly recommended!9/10",9,1,1,23 January 2005
Hidden Figures," Both inspirational and depressing, both important and entertaining
","A strong movie, with strong performances, set within the space race era. I say set within, because this is not the story of how USA finally managed to send a human into space. This is the story of how three black women managed to stand up for themselves and fight for their rights (which they shouldn't have to fight for).It is inspirational to see how these women fight and succeed in a time when prejudice against both black and women was everywhere. I am not saying that everyone was racists or regarded women as less than equal, but the system was. And how those women managed to fight and prevail in the system, hence changing it for the better.The movie in itself, how the story is told, is pretty ordinary. It follows the classic path with steps forward and backwards for the the three protagonists. It is the story itself, the history in it, and the strength in the characters that make the movie really good.But it also depressing and frustration experience. Frustrating that these woman had to fight for something that they honestly shouldn't have to fight for. Frustrating to know how many others that have had to fight the system, perhaps in an losing effort. How much both individuals and socitey both lost because of it. And depressing that many people seem to still hold those beliefs.Then it is important that stories like these are told.",9,0,3,19 June 2019
Kelly's Heroes," A movie with an edge
","** Here be spoilers **Kelly kidnaps a German Intelligence officer and finds out that, 30 miles beyond enemy lines, there are a bank full of gold. And therein lies the problem, it could get troublesome to get passed the Germans, rob the bank and then get out again. He need help. When his platoon find out that their vacation will be at a ruined old farm far from any booze, broads or action, not to mention that it is a lot of gold we're talking about, they decide to join him in his enterprise. Along the way, Kelly recruits Oddball who volunteers his three Sheridan tanks to give them an edge...As with any military operations, officially approved or not, there are some complications. First of all, you got to get past a lot of German troops, and second of all, your own army might not be very helpful either.This is a very nice war movie. No costs seem to be spared. There a lot of vehicles and men, not as in some where you seem to miss a lot of men and an entire army seem to be made up by twenty men or so. But, not in this case, the armies are in full scale. Furthermore there are a lot of explosions, but they are well integrated into the story, and do not try to steal attention from the story, only enhance it. In addition, this movie sport a lot of comedy too with interesting characters and situations. The actors acts well with an honorable mention to Sutherland for Oddball. In difference to a lot of other movies, this movie keeps a nice pace with the story. Many other movies make a nice introduction, then some chopped up scenes in the middle that leads to an spectacular end. This however, let these scenes in between act themselves out, which gives the movie a feeling of completeness.A very good movie.8/10",8,1,2,21 March 2004
Children of Men," Ordinary chase in grim future
","Recap: It's the future, and it's not looking good. Mankind have lost the ability to bear children and the youngest human, now over 18 years old, have just been murdered. Most societies has collapsed, and the few that remains, Britain for example, are overrun by illegal immigrants. In response to that, Britain has turned into a militant (fascist) society with an oppressive police force and frequent identity and security checks. And in response to that outlaw groups form to fight the oppressive system.Theo Faron just got kidnapped by one of these groups, the Fishes. His ex-wife Julian runs it and she needs some papers that allow travel through the country. For she has found a pregnant woman. But she is not the only one that wants the baby.Soon Theo and the young woman, Kee, is in a run for their lives.Comments: There is basically two parts in this movie. Two parts that unfortunately don't mesh all the way. Not that they contradict each other but there is very little symbiosis between the two either.The first part is the surroundings, the environment, the setting. The fascistic and dystopian future. The loss of all the children. All the immigrants and the camps they are interred in. The general breakdown of society and human rights. Very interesting and could be discussed at length. But aside from setting the ground rules it doesn't have much of an impact on the rest of the story.The story is the second part. The mission to get the pregnant girl and her baby to the coast and into safety. And the ensuing chase by the military/police and mostly by the underground group the Uprising who wants the baby as a political tool in their violent uprising against the government. Suddenly Theo and Kee find themselves alone and nobody to trust.The problem is that the chase, apart from the prize being a kid, is not really dependent on the setting. It is mostly a chase that could take place anyplace anytime. Not that it is bad, it is not. It holds unexpected twists and turns, it has suspense. The actors are good, especially Clive Owen who fits nicely as a rugged and depressed man that becomes the unwilling hero. He looks the part and he acts the part. Very good.But going from good to great is a steep climb. You need the two parts to interact, to evolve together. You want some questions raised, questions to ponder while (and after) you're watching. Children of Men does not. It accurately describes the setting and then launches a story, straight from beginning to the end.It was a good movie. Entertaining to watch. But for me, it was not great. And surely not one of the top 250 movies on IMDb as it was when this was written.7/10",7,2,2,6 September 2008
Million Dollar Baby," It sure got heart...
","** SPOILER ALERT **Recap: No fighter with just heart is going to win anything. I think it was those words that introduced us to the movie. Frankie Dunn, an old boxing trainer has just led his protégé, Big Willie, to victory and a championship match might be near. Dunn is reluctant though, and finally, Big Willie leaves for another manager. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald turns up at the gym, asking for Dunn to be her trainer. He refuses, but lets her train at the gym, since she paid for six months training in advance, and the gym needs the money badly. But at the gym works an old retired boxer, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupuis, or Scrap in short, gives the girl some hints. Dunn, still reluctant, sees her progressing and finally he concedes and becomes her trainer. Maggie got talent and patience, and finally it pays off. She quickly makes a name for herself, Mo Cuiishle, a nick name given to her by Dunn. Finally, she gets her championship match, but now the competition is though, will she make it?Comment: At the start, I didn't think I would like this move very much. But it has, like the three main characters Dunn, Maggie and Scrap, a big heart and when it was time for the championship match, I found that I actually did care. Both Eastwood and Freeman is starting to get old, but they still can act and act well. So does Swank, though she's not that old yet. One could actually divide the movie into two halves, as it has a break (literally) in the middle. The first half deals with the training and boxing, and the way to the championship match. It is the part I liked best, because it was there I found the most heart, the most joy, and the will to take the next step. Such feelings are infectious. The second half is much more about humanity, relations and almost another story. The heart and joy (quite naturally) was lost, and even if it was interesting and joy was exchanged to sorrow and concern, it never got as good as the first part. One should say though that it didn't end like I thought it would at the start of the movie, and in a movie that's almost always positive. Though the story now is very different, the acting is still very good, I think especially Eastwood gives a good performance. One final thought though, I believe the movie treads on thin ice, considering the end (I'll try not to reveal it). I felt Dunn got something of a hero label, that one should be very careful to hand out, as it concerns a very difficult matter. I won't judge one or the other way, just note the above. But maybe that's another good thing about the movie, it actually made me think about some serious and difficult matters, I hope I was not the only one to do so...7/10",7,1,2,11 September 2005
Garden State," Sweet drama about the wonderful crappy thing called life
","** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Andrew Largeman lives in LA, a failed actor working as waiter. One day, his alienated father calls and tells him that his mother has drowned, in their bathtub. Andrew returns home for the funeral, and meets with his old friends that handle life in their own ways. There Andrew meets Sam, a habitual liar that somehow gets him. The two seem to match each other and something special evolves.Comment: A melancholic and humoristic look upon life today. The movie is filled with both funny moments, and emotional, even sad moments. Both Braff and Portman gives great performances and I should mention Sarsgaard as well. One can see clearly though that Braff has carved his own space in Hollywood and will probably be a name to remember for the future. In this movie he has shown that he is able to write a really good story, direct it and do both comedy and drama. Portman's capabilities I already knew about. I sensed though, that Braff is influenced by Scrubs. It might be that I connect him so tightly to the series, but in some scenes in the movie, I clearly felt a very close resemblance between Andrew and J.D. To conclude: This was a sweet funny movie that promises good things for the future. But top 250 on IMDb? Not for me it wasn't.7/10",7,1,2,14 September 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Very good thriller
","Män som hatar kvinnor is something so rare as a good, tense and exciting Swedish thriller. Based on a successful novel it got a well developed and well worked story that is adapted well to the screen. One of its main strengths is that the characters are well written, outside many stereotypes with a partly hidden but always relevant history that is revealed along the way.It is a long movie, with a running time of at least 150 minutes (depending on version), but that is due to that the movie really takes its time to establish the characters before the mystery is introduced. I think that was a good choice. It makes the movie long, but never slow or boring. There is always some development to keep interest, to keep viewers on the edge.The weakest link in the movie, unfortunately, is the mystery. The solution presents itself almost immediately, and is too easy to resolve. However, that doesn't take away the suspense either. So Män som hatar kvinnor is a really good thriller. But to go from good to great, it needed to keep the solution a secret longer.7/10",7,0,2,15 March 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Black and white, in all aspects
","Recap: As the pressure and persecutions from senator McCarthy and his hearings grow, one team of reporters, spearheaded by Murrow and Friendly, decide to investigate and criticize his methods.Comments: It sure is black and white, in all aspects. With that I mean that very few emotions, very little color. It is little more than dramatized documentary and seems to cover (rightly so if meant to be a documentary) very little of thoughts, emotions and character development - basically what makes a drama interesting. Even though it is a very important and maybe traumatic episode in American modern history, as a movie it becomes dull and uninteresting. The only element of interest is generated outside the movie, and that is that it is based on reality. Otherwise it is little more than a bunch of well-known actors making a black and white movie. A movie so black and white that it contains no emotions...4/10",4,3,5,13 September 2006
Shrek 2," Great and witty, fun for the whole family
","** Yupp, here be spoilers alright **Well, last we checked Shrek (Myers) got his princess Fiona (Diaz) and in this sequel they're back! Off to a honeymoon trip, and then they're invited to Fiona's parents. Shrek is hesitant, but Fiona makes sure they go. The parents, King (Cleese) and Queen (Andrews) don't quite expect two ogres to turn up however, and the family reunion is awkward, to put it mildly. And it won't get better when Fiona's Fairy Godmother (Saunders) secretly wants to pair up her own son Charming (Everett) with Fiona, so that her son becomes king (eventually). And there are some clandestine deal between the Fairy Godmother and the King, which actually leads the King to hire a hit-man, or hitcat (Puss in Boots (Banderas)) at least, to take Shrek out. Not the best way to create family happiness. Shrek and Fiona, mostly Shrek in this movies point of view, must fight to keep their love alive.This is a great movie that anybody, young or old, might enjoy. For the young, a great animated adventure with a lot of familiar characters from fairy tales and stories. For the older audience, there is a great humor and an awful lot of terrific funny references to other movies, series and such. Actually, this is one of the best spoof/parody movies I ever seen. The story is good, but not great. It seems like a lot of the story is written just to cram as much references as possible into it. As it is masterfully done, I can see no fault in that however, but the story itself is not what one remembers from the movie. However, I suspect it is good enough for the younger audience to be happy and not lose interest. The cast and characters are great. Myers reprise his role as Shrek brilliantly, Diaz is great as Fiona once again, Murphy is awesome as Donkey. Cleese, Saunders, Everett and Andrews are good additions, but especially Banderas (perfectly casted) is great as the wonderful character Puss in Boots.Well, was there more to say? Good humor, greats spoofs, brilliant characters and cast. Ah, throw in good animation as well and you have a totally great funny movie. Go see!9/10",9,1,2,15 December 2004
Jurassic World," Diluted ideas with good action
","It is quite easy to sum this up, it's another Jurassic Park. There is the same misguided attempt at growing dinosaurs for a theme park. Some or all of the dangerous dinosaurs will escape and go on a killing Spree. And finally, yes, some kids will end up in the middle of it. Knowing that, it delivers what is expected. The effects are really good (it feels wrong to call them realistic when they're creating dinosaurs) and the action is evenly spread throughout the movie. The entertainment was good.However, I couldn't help but sigh when I understood the main monster. This time it isn't enough to have a big bad dinosaur running wild. The dinosaur must of course be genetically enhanced, and for example now being super smart and setting traps, in addition to having stealth ability, being able to withstand grenades without much problem and much more. Unfortunately this gives the movie too much flavor of the low budget monster movies.So, the craftsmanship in doing an action movie is good. I just wish that next time (yes I'm sure there will be a next time) there will be a little more originality in the plot.6/10",6,3,3,21 October 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Philosophical thriller
","Movies that sticks with you and makes you think for a while is always good, no matter what they are about really. The Adjustment Bureau raises the topic of fate and free will, with agents hidden among us, stealthily nudging us in the right direction so everything goes according to the Plan. The movie is about David Norris a congressman running for Senate that by chance runs into Elise, a promising dancer. They click, but they being together does not agree with the Plan, so the agents are sent in to correct it. But love fights everything, and David can't let Elise go, hard as he tries. Finally he decides to put everything at risk and challenge the Plan, just to be with Elise.The Adjustment Bureau is a thriller with a philosophical edge. Do we really have free will, or are we constantly adjusted? If it goes as in the movie, most of us will never know, and therein lies the thrill. It poses a lot of 'What If?'-questions that stuck with me at least. So even though when neither Damon or Blunt was at their best, the plot rescued the movie. Originally a Phillip K Dick idea, it is strong and vivid, as many movies based on Dick's stories has proved to be. The best acting is instead made by the agents, especially Anthony Mackie as Harry, but also John Slattery and Terence Stamp.I really liked the movie. Not for the action, not for the acting, but for the bright and inventive idea that is the basis for the plot. Exciting and entertaining through and through.8/10",8,0,2,18 September 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Non-stop entertainment, but do they try to do too much?
","As expected this is an action packed spectacle. Entertaining all the way, this installment of the Marvel Universe doesn't disappoint. I like how the series lets the storyline jump between the Avenger series and the characters own Movies. It makes the story bigger than what would be possible to create with a single movie.However, maybe they have added to many characters this time. It is a difficult task to balance the screen time of that many main characters without compromising the story. And this time the movie struggles with it. A few of the Avengers, like Thor, is absent long stretches (not speaking of the more and more strained explanations for Jane not being with him - if this was the real world I would be very worried for their relationship) and the chemistry between the characters is not as good as in previous installments (that is a part of the story though, but still unfortunate). The dialog, ripe with tongue in cheek jokes, doesn't flow as well as it has. And, surprisingly, I wasn't as impressed with the CGI as I have been. Some scenes, especially the intro, looked more like a computer game than a movie.Still. It is a entertaining movie. A good pace without being too one dimensional acting. A good cast, with a stellar choice of James Spader as the villain. His voice gives Ultron an unexpected dimension. Small jokes and a quick dialog. It is hard no to like.7/10",7,2,5,16 January 2016

And it does not really help when his father's partner's wife comes on to him really strong. Despite himself Ben begins an affair with her, Mrs Robinson. Bur life really really becomes complicated when he meets Elaine, Mrs Robinson's daughter. He falls for her, but mother Robinson is willing to do anything to stop him from dating her...Comments: 'You are trying to seduce me, Mrs Robinson.' A classic line in a classic movie. However, I was a little surprised that it was in the very beginning of the movie. It seems like the climax of a long courtship, but surprisingly no.I would like to split this movie in to. One with Elaine, and one without. The first half, the one without Elaine, when Ben haves his affair with Mrs Robinson is actually quite dull. Slow, cut in small episodes. I'm not sure if it is an intentional reflection of Ben's internal state, however it was really boring.And introduce Elaine. The disturbing affair becomes a very interesting triangle drama were Ben tries to court Elaine and desperately avoid Mrs Robinson. The dull first half suddenly into a spectacular funny second half. It is funny in an absurd way where Ben finds himself in situations, the one more impossible than the other. I regret that the first half wasn't set up like this second part. But it is quite possible that the first part did the necessary groundwork for the second.In the first half I was prepared to turn the movie off, but the second completely resuscitated it into an overall better than average movie. Really good actually.7/10",7,0,2,10 February 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Interesting but very strange
","** HERE BE SPOILERS (AND I MEAN IT!) **(You might want to have these memories erased). Joel (Carrey) wakes up, but instead of going to his job, he goes to a cold beach in Montauk. There he meets the girl Clementine (Winslet) and they soon hit it off. It actually seems that they know each other from before. Well, they do. We get to see a previous relationship between them evolve and disintegrate, leading up to both of them having their memories of the other erased by Lacuna Inc. Enter subplot. The people working at Lacuna are very intimately involved. Secretary Mary (Dunst) has something going with technician Stan (Ruffalo). Co-worker Patrick (Wood) actually uses material handed in by Joel to woo Clementine. However, during Joel's procedure to have his memories of Clementine erased, he is having second thoughts and start to fight the procedure. He desperately wants to keep at least one memory of Clementine. But how to do? A hunt in his own mind, through all his memories ensues. And both inside and outside his mind, secrets wait to explode.This is an extremely strange movie, that needs you to actually be alert to have hope to keep track. (One tip is to keep track of Clementine's hair). I think the journey through Joel's mind was interesting, as it showed, from a unique perspective, situations were he didn't really know why he reacted the way he did. Situations were would have wanted to act differently. Situations we have all experienced. Carrey and Winslet have a nice relationship going between their characters and the entire cast is good I think. However, sometimes it was hard to really pay attention to the story while I were trying to coop with the strangeness (I was a little tired when I saw it, maybe that wasn't the best start). And the strangeness was all over. Now, don't equal strange with bad, because that is not at all how it is. But a lot of things were a little strange, or had an strange effect. All from music and sound to the plot, special effects and cuts. All in all, a very unique movie, an experience.6/10",6,1,3,17 December 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Horror movie for ten year olds?
","Recap: Stunned by the news that she is going to be proposed to, by a man with good standing but not of her liking at all, no less. Alice flees, following a white rabbit, and tumbles down a hole. There an very odd and peculiar, not to say dangerous, adventure awaits her. She tumbles into Wonderland, where a conflict rages between the Red Queen, a ruthless dictator currently in power, and the White Queen. And between them lands Alice, she is foretold to be the one that slays the Jabberwocky, a monster and the Red Queens most fearsome weapon. Therefore Alice is much sought after, by both sides. But how can she save Wonderland when she keeps believing it's just a dreamComments: Now, I have never read the books, or that I can remember, seen any of the previous movies. But from some of the comments I infer that Tim Burton has made quite a big input to the story, so that it does not stay true to the original books. Tim Burton's movie does not, unfortunately, make me want to read more of it though.Listed as a Family movie, I would not let any young children watch it, not alone anyway. Tumbling down the rabbit hole with Alice is like stepping into a world painted by Dali. It's very spectacular, the effects are many times just stunning, Burton is certainly very creative and inventive. But quite often, it is just disturbing. Well, it could be that I am a grown up and don't 'get it'. But I felt it being quite a dark and scary movie, especially if it's intended for a younger audience. Perhaps that is the best way of describing it, a horror movie for a ten year old.As it should be, most of the characters are odd. Some more hilarious, some more in a mad scary way. Depp does a good Mad Hatter that falls somewhere in between. Otherwise I grew quite fond of Mia Wasikowska. Both in character and actress she was the beacon of light and reason. I also usually like Anne Hathaway, but cast here as the White Queen, it was a character that really didn't fit her. It is a far too passive character for her, and the pale appearance didn't do her justice either. I'm glad to have seen it, I can say that. The effects and the imaginative story are well worth the time. But having seen it once, I won't see it again.5 rugged top hats out of 10.",5,2,5,18 February 2011
Avatar," Stunning and imaginative visually, but a stereotypical story full of old clichés
","Recap: Mankind has gone for the stars and found a treasure of the rare material Unobtanium in the planet Pandora. Covered by a beautiful but deceptively dangerous jungle a big part of the human colony is security forces, and that is how disabled veteran marine Jake Sully ends up there. Going in place of his dead brother he operates an Avatar to reach out to the humanoid native species, the Na'vi. The Na'vi is in extreme touch with nature, depends and protects it at any cost, and it is soon clear that their interest comes in clear conflict with the humans' greedy mining intentions. And of course, Jake ends up in the middle of this, feeling more and more sympathy for the awe inspiring nature, and finding love with the Na'vi.Comments: Despite not seeing this in 3D, but only on a Bluray, this still is stunningly beautiful picture with marvelous sceneries, landscapes and vistas, not to mention wonderful details. It is instantly obvious that this is a movie heavy in the visual experience. And despite coming with heavy praise, it doesn't disappoint even though some scenes are clearly solely there to impress 3D-watchers. Still, many scenes are just breathtaking. It is a marvel of light and colour in the hands of a playful, imaginative mind (or more probably, minds). Most impressive, and most entertaining.But the danger with movies becoming so heavily focused on the visual and effects part is that the story might be somewhat forgotten, or at least having to take the back seat. Avatar, along with 2012 for example, suffers from this. In Avatar's case a very big part of the framework of the story is almost copy-pasted from an old western movie, complete with stereotypes of the evil white ranchers and the primitive but in touch with nature natives. It annoyed me that a movie with such a big budget, and made with such an enormous effort couldn't be more original than that. However, a cliché is often a cliché for a reason, and in this case it is because it provides a simple story with a clear conflict to exploit with stunning effects.Sam Worthington has quickly established himself as a lead man in action movies. And with good support from Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Roudrigez, Stephen Lang and Joel Moore, among many others, there is absolutely nothing to complain about the cast, or their performances.In all, Avatar was a refreshingly good movie. Long as it is, something is always happening or there is something breathtaking to watch, it is entertaining every minute, even if predictable. It is a real treat, and I'm thankful that once in a while someone sets their mind's to make an epic film like Avatar (and note that is almost always a sci-fi). Highly recommended, and would have been a full-pointer if there would have been just a little more effort on a more original script.8/10",8,2,4,23 September 2010
La La Land," Not enough musical in this
","La La Land is a musical set in, and mostly about, Hollywood and those who try to find their way in it. It starts out with a big musical number on the highway and promises much. It is also there we meet our two main characters, Mia and Sebastian. Mia, a struggling and aspiring actress, and Sebastian, an equally struggling jazz pianist. They keep running into each other and this musical evolves into a romance.Unfortunately, even if it brings along a lot of music, it leaves the musical pretty much behind. Much of the ensemble and dance scenes as the introduction sets the tone for fail to materialize. it is a good, but rather classic romance about how two people meet (in this case meet and meet again) and ultimately fall for each other. Predictably trouble then ensues. Music and a songs are a central theme in this, but this is not as much a musical as I hoped.I like Stone's and Gosling's performances, and I like the characters. I like the storytelling in the movie, it has some nice tricks with time and what if's. But I feel I don't really get what I expected.And, in the end, was it a happy ending?7/10",7,0,3,10 April 2017
Up," Doesn't quite take off
","Recap: Growing up, both Carl and Ellie idolize Charles Muntz, a world famous explorer. But after a mission to Paradise Falls, Muntz falls out of grace after a retrieved bird skeleton is accused of being a fake. Muntz goes away to capture a live specimen, and Carl and Ellie continues with their life, growing up, marrying each other and growing old together. But when Ellie dies, and old Carl is left alone, the dreams of their adventure awakens again. Carl wow that he shall fly their house, with a lot of helium filled balloons, to Paradise Falls. By accident Russell, a kid scout, happens to come along, being trapped on the porch as Carl lifts off. But as they arrive at Paradise Falls, they discover that the hunt for the mysterious bird is still on.Comments: A rather sweet comedy, but ironically it never takes off and lifts to the heights that previous Pixar movies do. This time it seems that, somewhat in the spirit of the movie, they have focused more upon the adventure part of the movie than the comedy. But comedy, especially comedy that works for people of all ages, are Pixar's strength, and I think the movie lacks some of that strength. Especially knowing what Pixar can do.One guess on my part, is that like many others released in the new 3D format recently, a little too much focus has been given to make a visual treat over perfecting a good story. But effects can only augment a story, not build it. And for me, the characters didn't quite work out. Carl is a little bit too grumpy and Russell is just too annoying at times. And they being the main characters, it is a problem when they don't quite work out. However, supporting characters Dug and actually and especially Kevin save part of it.Up is good, mostly a sweet movie, funny at times. But it is not hilarious. Pixar has done better, and I expect better in the future.6/10",6,0,1,19 December 2010
The Hurricane," Captivating story
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Young Rubin Carter, in self-defense, stab a prominent (white) man and is declared as a menace to society by a judge, sending him to a juvenile detention center. Later, a couple of years older, he escapes, joins the army and after serving some time, returns home only to be thrown back into jail. In jail, and after being released he trains himself as a price boxer something he becomes very successful at. However, after a murder in a bar, a cop who has put his life to put Carter back into jail, frames Carter and he is sentenced to three consecutive lifetimes behind bars. As he is innocent he refuses to conform to prison life. A few years later a black kid, tutored by three Canadians, reads his autobiography and get involved in his case. Together they try to resolve what really happened and free Carter.To me, it doesn't really matter if the movie is accurate to what really happened. It was in any way a really interesting and captivating story about a man that had rough upbringing and had to fight the system just because of his skin color. Denzel Washington is very good as Rubin Carter, giving the character strength and humanity. Unger, Schreiber, Shannon and Hannah is giving nice performances as well, although the movie, naturally, is very focused upon the character Carter, not giving the other characters much chance to grow. Other cast is good as well, for example Brown once again is a prison guard, and does it convincingly. The movie is very well done, with nice detail and effort. That some scenes is in black and white is not bad, just kind of gives the movie a change of pace. As mentioned the story is very captivating, and although not as entertaining as more action-packed movies, this one is better than most. You just didn't want to miss the tiniest bit.8/10",8,1,3,25 October 2004

","This is another of the modern animated movies. Beautifully and colorful animation, good characters, but above all, a good story full of jokes and fun action.

Groundhog Day," Sweet and witty
","** O'boy here be spoilers ** Phil (Murray) is a meteorologist in Pittsburg. He is totally egocentric and does not like at all that he has been assigned to go to Punxsutawney and cover Groundhog day. Along with him goes sweet Rita (MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Elliott). Phil, just wants to do the work and leave as quick as possible ( or before that if he gets his say). Well, unfortunately for Phil, a snowstorm (that he himself predicted would miss them) makes leaving town impossible and when Phil wakes up it's Groundhog day all over again. Phil is stuck. Stuck in Punxsutawney and stuck on Groundhog day. What to do? Well, you could perfect the arts or study. You could get dates with attractive women just by trial and error. You could be the biggest jerk in the world or an angel sent from above. You could rob a bank or kidnap a famous woodchuck. Or you could get depressed and kill yourself in a lot of different (more or less creative) ways. And always wake up to the same day all over again. Phil does all that. But how to solve this mysterious riddle so that poor Phil can go on with his life?A funny and interesting movie, with funny little quirks. The story is great, and the concept of it brings a _lot_ of unique possibilities, most of them followed through in the movie. Good work Ramis and Rubin! Murray is great as the sarcastic Phil. He is asked to act out in a lot of different moods and situations and pull all of them off brilliantly. MacDowell is good as well, even if her character is given a secondary role to that of Murray. Elliot's character is even more in the perimeter but he is good and occasionally chips in with a funny tidbit. But mostly, the movie is funny because of a great story, Murray's acting and a nice directing and editing. There is a romantic bit in the movie as well, but in my opinion that is well integrated in the comedic part, which is the one emphasized.8/10",8,8,14,14 December 2004
National Treasure," A modern Indiana Jones with just a brush of Bond...
","** Here be a treasure of Spoilers **Recap: In ancient times, the Knight Templar, collected a great treasure that they thought was too great to being owned by just one man. It didn't matter if that man were king or pope. So the treasure were smuggled out and hidden away by the Templars, who turned into the Free Masons, who among their ranks held some of the Founding Fathers of the independent America. History turned to legend, legend turned into myth, and the treasure is all but forgotten. A young boy however is told the story by his grandfather, who claims to have a little clue. The boy never forgets the treasure and now Ben Gates (Cage) is on the hunt for the treasure that his family has sought for many generations. Packed in ice Gates find an old ship with another clue that point towards the Declaration of Independence. However, the Gates family has a less than stellar reputation, and to examine the Declaration for hidden clues about a hidden treasure is out of the question. An associate and sponsor to Gates, Ian Howe (Bean), suggest that they 'borrow' the Declaration. Gates opposes this and Howe then considers Gates an obstacle and tries to blow him up. Gates and his friend Riley (Bartha) survive and travels to USA to warn the authorities. But when no one believes them that the DoI is about to be stolen, they decide that the only way to protect it is to steal it before Howe does. But Gates and Howe attempt the theft almost simultaneously and it turns violent. Gates finally walk away with the DoI, but also get conservator Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) as a 'bonus'. Now the three must find the new clues but they are sought after, both by Howe and the FBI...Comment: A very nice modern version of a Indian Jones type movie. The story is very nice, with a lot of historic connections to give an plausible (and somewhat exotic) story. The focus is on adventure but there are some moments of action and comedy as well. Especially the character Riley contributes with some funny parts and lines. It is the story that is the main attraction here with nice effects to augment it. The actors are mostly there just to tell the story and they do it well. Bean is very good as the bad guy (again), Cage is good as the adventurer, Kruger as the conservator (and guess what, love interest), Voight as the disbelieving father and Bartha was a very interesting new acquaintance for me. Mostly very entertaining, some little slower parts and unfortunately somewhat predictable, but as mentioned still good.A weak 8/10",8,0,1,14 February 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Great story, beautiful scenes... but read the book!
","Recap: Inside the Louvre its head curator, Jacques Sauniere, is shot dead and when found by the police Sauniere has left mysterious clues, written in part with his own blood. And he says to find professor Robert Langdon, who happens to be in Paris. Police brings Langdon under the guise of wanting help to decipher the clues and symbols, but Langdon is not there to help, he is the prime suspect. Sophie Neveu warns him of this and suddenly they are on the escape from the police, and at the same time trying to understand Sauniere's message. By doing that they enters the trail of an ancient secrecy and mystery, and finds themselves in the middle of an old feud between hidden, but powerful, organisations.Comments: A movie is not a book, and a book is not a movie. So it's never fair to compare a movie based on a book with its source. Still, it is impossible not to do so. In general, the movie follows the story of the book pretty good, but of course there are differences, and in most cases the book is better than the movie. So if you have to choose, read the book. But that puts a dilemma; if you have read the book you know the ending. And that steals away most, if not all, of the suspense and mystery. I wonder if I had not appreciated this movie better if I hadn't read the book (I guess it is the same the other way around too). However, as the book is better, I don't regret it.Anyway, looking at the movie by itself, it is still a good movie. The story is still good, the mystery (if not known) delightfully revealed. And there are a few scenes that are breathtaking. Include all flashbacks into these, as they are spectacularly beautiful, especially that of Newton's funeral. Howard shows that he knows how to use the special effects just right, and the right amount of it. The best scene of them all had little special effects though, and it was the only scene better in the movie than in the book is the ending itself. With Langdon kneeling and the music rising it was beautiful and emotional. A great ending indeed.I understand that the cast was not clear from the start, and the cast ending up in the movie not always the first choice. But in my mind, it was the right choice. Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen are proved great actors, they do not disappoint one bit. Paul Bettany is somewhat of a personal favorite. Though he did not have the biggest role, or much freedom in it, he was good, once again. Audrey Tautou is a new acquaintance to me, but did good with her part too. So, to conclude, acting was never the problem with this movie.The movie has some (minor) problems though. One is not its own fault, as the real suspense ends long before the actual ending, so the last part might feel a little long and dull, even if it is crucial to the story. One other (EXTREME SPOILER ALERT!) is the suggestion of the movie that Sophie, as heir to Jesus, can perform miracles. But if the Priory was right, Jesus was human, and couldn't have performed miracles, and certainly not Sophie. If the Priory was wrong, and Jesus divine, then there could have been no heir, or am I mistaken? Finally, this is a movie, not a religious statement. Nothing to get excited about, not in that sense anyway. It is a movie, and a good movie at that. If I hadn't known the ending beforehand, it would surely gotten a higher rating.7/10",8,1,2,26 May 2006
Thor," Superhero movie that sets the standard for the genre.
","Being a comic book based movie, Thor comes with a special set of expectations. Good action, a myth based story of heroes, high level of special effects, and some quick one-liners. Thor meets and in my opinion surpasses all these expectations.Actually, Thor, is a really good, entertaining movie. It is two hour pure entertainment, handled skillfully by Kenneth Branagh. That gives the best of two worlds, the supernatural story combined with the touch by acclaimed director and actor Branagh.But Branagh has had good help on this one. Especially the effect makers has had great success. I loved how they portrayed Asgard, and they handled all the effects very well. Apart from being entertaining, Thor is also impressive and surprisingly rather beautiful. The casting department also has made a great job. Combining solid veteran actors as Hopkins, Portman and Skarsgård with virtual newcomers as Hemsworth and Dallas. Hemsworth is well casted as Thor, having both the right physique, looks and talent to deliver such a role. Hiddleston as Loki was a good choice as well. But the gem among the characters, and a personal favorite must be Idris Elba as Heimdall.Well, the main thing anyhow is that Thor is an action filled movie spiced up with some good humor. It had both thrilling fights and good laughs. And it stood upon a good story as framework. As I said above, it was entertaining all the way.I like the tie-ins with the other superhero movies released and look forward to seeing the Avengers, but I also hope that Thor itself might get a sequel. They certainly laid the ground work for one.8/10",8,24,47,1 May 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Great! Certainly got that special twinkle in the eye
","Recap: An assassination in Bogotá and the police are out looking for tourists that travel alone. Boy meets girl, and they decide that they are safer together than on their own. Ah, fate sealed. Boy and girl fall in love, decide to marry and move in together. Both travel a lot in their work, he as a contractor she as a computer specialist. Looks like a happily ever after, but there is a slight problem. They haven't been totally honest with each other. He isn't a contractor, he is a hit-man. And she isn't a computer specialist, she's a hit-man too. But all is fine until they both have to go to work at the same time, and find they have competition. By their spouse! Their agencies give them both 48 hours to 'clean up' the mess. The marital peace is over.Comment: This is a movie precisely in my taste. Action, comedy and a high pace with some nice pauses, with great timing. A lot of shooting, a lot of explosions and some fighting, but never so much you think they go overboard. Add a real witty dialog (and no dubbing or subtitles can ever be as good as the original lines), some real situation based comedy and a great performance by the actors in the lead roles. Face it, it doesn't get much better than this. I especially loved the dance scene. Good lines, good acting. Humor and suspense mixed up and I really never knew in which direction it would go. I just felt that it would be spectacular. And it was. The ending was little other than I expected, but actually was pretty good.Great as this was, I hope they don't do a sequel. A lot of the chemistry in the movie was the discovery, and then the resolve of Jane and John finding out the other was a professional hit-man. Now that they know, I don't think another go at the story would be as good. But this was great, a must see! 10/10",10,2,7,2 October 2005
American Made," Not supposed to be taken seriously?
","American Made is much more a comedy than anything else. Based upon the life of pilot and smuggler Barry Seal, the story has been changed a lot from the truth.In the movie Seal is portrayed more like an entrepreneur and adventurer than anything else (and that he started out by working with the government and just expanded his business when the opportunities came, than working with the government after being arrested). The main focus of the movie is that Seal get so successful that he has major problems to hide all his money, which lead to some comical effects. In one scene it literally floods out of a closet when Seal opens the door, and other times the dog digs it up when they buried it in the yard. Added to that is the hide and seek games he plays with different agencies, and even Seals eventual demise is joked about.Real action is scarce, and suspense is not included at all. So to take it seriuosly seems to be a mistake, since the makers don't seem like they did.",5,2,3,25 December 2018
Crazy Heart," Just stellar acting
","This is one of the movies that could end up really bad, or really good, depending on the actors and actresses in it. But with Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal, supported by Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall among others, it really never could go wrong, could it? Even with the expectations from all the high praise that comes with Crazy Heart, it still manages to surprise me. Not with any surprising plot twists, but with how heartfelt the story is. Simply put, how good it is.Jeff Bridges plays the ageing country star Bad Blake. But his career has stalled, well, hit rock bottom is more like it. The former star is now playing bowling alleys, while the big stage is set for younger talents like Tommy Sweet. His personal life is pretty much rock bottom too. He's alone, alcoholic, and quite grumpy and bitter. But a chance meeting with a younger woman, a struggling reporter, Jean, might be the turnaround.Bridges performance is just stellar. He needs to carry the story on his shoulders, and he does it so well. He got an intensity that I haven't seen before from him. He is perfectly cast as Bad Blake and makes this could be unpleasant character instead very human. I really got to care about him. Bridges is very well deserving of his Oscar.I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is well deserving of an Oscar for her performance as well. She is really good in roles such as these and makes Jean come through as the strong single mother and at the same time the very vulnerable and searching woman. Colin Farrell surprises with a small but nice role as Tommy as well. A little surprisingly Tommy is not the hot shot ungrateful diva. On the contrary, Tommy cares very much for his old mentor and tries his best to support the old star. Farrell also surprises with a quite good singing voice.This is a movie that should be watched for the actors, and their performances. The story is good, and got some uniqueness of its own. Perhaps best is that it got its own version of the happy ending. But the story would have been nothing without the acting.8 crazy hearts out of 10.",8,2,3,21 February 2011

Man on Fire," Well done but slow paced
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **Mexico City is a place where kidnappings are commonplace. Therefore Creasy (Washington) is hired as a bodyguard for Pita (Fanning). Creasy is old military that lost faith and turned to the whiskey bottle. Pita slowly reaches out to him and brings him about. It is because of that Creasy is devastated when Pita is kidnapped, and Creasy severely injured while trying to protect her. The ransom drop then goes awry and there is only revenge left for Creasy. The corrupt police do nothing, actually there seem to be some officers involved in the kidnapping. With the aid of a journalist Creasy starts to hunt down those responsible.This is a very well made movie. The cast with Washington, Walken, Fanning, Mitchell and Anthony are all very good. All characters is well established, in fact the times spends so much time in establishing plot and characters that the movie, especially in the first half, becomes very slow paced and you just wish that it could skip along and bring on what will inevitable happen. I can think of some scenes that could be shortened or cut entirely (for example Pita's extensive swimming). Unfortunately the pace only picks up a little when Creasy goes on the revenge trip. One redeeming fact is that the movie is brutally blunt and honest, does not shy away to show some brutal moments and scenes. It seems that Creasy is actually rather inventive when it comes to revenge. However, there are some things that are really annoying. For one the characters switch between Spanish and English in the middle of conversations and a lot of the dialog is printed out on the screen, regardless of it needs to be translated or not. Then there are some cuts and cinematic tricks that may seem cool at first but in the long run just is annoying. So, some parts are very good, and some not so good at all. That brings the movie to just above average.6/10",6,0,0,31 October 2004
Downfall," Very interesting
","Recap: We get to see how the finals days leading up to Hitler's suicide from a couple of different perspectives, mostly that of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary. The pressure and angst keep keep building up as the enemy, mostly the soviets keep getting closer. A lot of officers react differently to the situation and Hitler himself seen to live in an fantasy world of his own.Comment: A very interesting movie, and important as well, since the generation that can tell first hand what happened is slowly getting fewer. There has been many war-movies that focus on the horrors of the front for the soldiers or the terrible fates of innocent civilians. This is the first movie I have seen that entirely focuses upon the officers (Nazi) and Hitlers actions. That means, there is very little scenes of action or actual fighting in the movie. The war is mostly noticed through the sound of impacting artillery shells. I sincerely hopes that the movie is meant to be as accurate as possible, because it gives the impression to be, and from what I can read it seems accurate enough. The actors gives great performances as they play very different roles. There are those characters that are actually quite human and thinks of the bystanders, the people and the victims, then there are those, including Hitler and Goebbels, that are frighteningly evil. But all are convincingly played by the actors. It feels odd to discuss the entertainment value of the movie, since I'm not sure it is meant to have one. And true enough, it is not the kind of movie you laugh about or feel good after seeing. On the other hand it is very interesting and although it is fairly long and slow paced, there was not a single moment I felt like the move came to a halt or was boring. So, this is a highly recommended movie, maybe not for a more weekend-movie intended to cheer you up, but for a movie to make you feel and think.9/10",9,0,1,20 September 2005
"Hail, Caesar!"," Peculiar, fragmented but likable
","A very typical Coen Brothers comedy, with humor very much in stile from Burn after Reading and O Brother where art thou. However, as this movies anchor is Eddie Mannix, the Capitol Pictures problem-solver, the story is a bit episodic and fragmented. It is hard to pick up the thread throughout the movie, partly due to that there is none. At the same time the story, the characters are quite likable and somewhat funny although there are few real laughs.At the same time this is a great homage/spoof of the 50's movies industry, having seen movies from that time sure helps. Both to understand all the thematic jokes and also to feel the nostalgia. A great many known actors also appear, in more or less (especially Dolph Lundgren) prominent roles. Feels a bit like the Coen Brothers and friends had a get together to reminisce about good old times. So even though this is likable, I found the somewhat similar Burn after Reading much better.6/10",6,0,2,17 February 2017
The Wrestler," Randy lives up to his hype, the Wrestler doesn't...
","The Wrestler is a drama about an old wrestling star, Randy the Ram, that once upon a time was one of the great, that nowadays travels and performs at small local wrestling events, living of his old fame. He is constantly strapped for cash, and fills out his paycheck with smalltime work at the local supermarket. But there might be change on the horizon, it is soon the 20th anniversary of one of his classical fights, and a rematch might give him a last chance to be in the spotlight. But a heart attack puts everything in perspective, and jeopardy. Randy struggles to reconnect with his estranged daughter and connect with a local stripper he is fond of.It is a slow, quite sad story that is told in Wrestler. The performances of the cast is good, and the characters seem well written with good depth, even though most of them are not explored very much. But even though Randy, the main character, is a good hearted, kind man that means well but not always succeeds to do good, I fail to really connect, to sympathize with him. Ironically enough I found it easier to sympathize with Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, a movie with a theme very much alike the Wrestler. One reason might be that the Wrestler is very much focused on Randy, compared to Crazy Heart that has much stronger supporting characters.The Wrestler is a good movie, but it doesn't quite live up to its own hype. It did mark a kind of return for Mickey Rourke, and he does his role very well. But it is not really enough to carry and lift the movie to any greater heights, I'm sorry to say.6/10",6,0,1,28 March 2011
Hancock," Unexpected development
","Recap: Hancock is a superhero, but not your ordinary superhero. Alone and deeply troubled he has turned to the bottle and almost left society. His interventions cause more damage than he saves and most people would just see him go away. Until one day he saves the life of Ray, a PR-specialist (while wrecking several other cars and causing a train to derail). Ray decides to try to repair Hancock's relationship with the public, but his decision comes with a lot of unexpected consequences.Comments: Actually not at all what I expected, and that may be because the trailer (intentionally?) hints at another story entirely. I expected a action-comedy about a superhero gone bad (not evil), and it started out like one. However it didn't develop along that track, but instead took a turn to focus more on Hancock's character. How a superhero might turn out in a real world, if he felt like the only one of his kind.It still kept the humoristic touch though, but it took a step back. Instead an element of mystery and discovery entered into the mix. Somewhere the movie took a turn from simple action-entertainment to something unknown with a few surprises along the way. It is a different kind of movie, but in my opinion still a very good one.They have selected a good cast too. Will Smith does the roughed up hero very well, and Jason Bateman the trusting, hopeful and positive Ray. But Charlize Theron steals the game with her performance as Ray's wife. It is the small things, a glance, a tear, a hesitation. Small things that build up the character and give the entire story tension.So, not at all what I expected. But something else. Still funny, but more complex. Maybe even better than what I hoped for.8/10",8,1,2,23 May 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Monster Mania
","Well, if you are thinking about watching Kong: Skull Island, you probably have a pretty good idea of what to expect. And except one thing (no, they don't go to New York and climb skyscrapers - that is pretty obvious from the start) you are probably right.You get one really big ape, a lot of other really big animals, a few monsters that come straight out of some other horror movie (they are really familiar - but for the life of me I cannot recall from where). And you get a dozen or so misplaced (regular sized (well except some egos maybe)) human beings with a lot of guns. The humans are misplaced because they are really out of their depth here and don't know what they are doing (except Hank Marlow (John C Rielly) but noone really listens to him anyway). Of course some one comes up with the great idea to kill Kong, and the hunt is on. And you probably already know how that goes as well.Kong: Skull Island is not for those who wants thrills in surprises. If you know a little about Kong lore, you probably can tell most of the story before watching. On the other hand, it doesn't disappoint those expectations either. It delivers exactly what is promised. This is certainly no masterpiece, but it is an entertaining ride for the full two hours. One thing should be said though, a lot of people die in a lot of gruesome ways, I actually expected a 'horror' tag thrown in as a sub-genre. It wasn't but wouldn't be misplaced. Be warned if you dislike such scenes.A few mentions about the actors. Samuel L Jackson is like the rest of the movie, as advertised. He has made his own niche (and does it good) and plays it once again. John C Rielly, mostly seen in comedies actually does a good role of the long lost/trapped flyer Marlow. It started out shaky with Rielly pulling some bad joke in his first scene, and I was afraid that he was about to be the designated comic sidekick (which had been quite out of place in the movie) that would have ruined the movie. But the character shaped up and became something much more and Rielly performed well. Fun to see Hiddleston not being Loke, this was a role that fit him well. Hope to see more of him in the future. And the same of Brie Larson (which is almost guaranteed as she is cast as Captain Marvel).You shouldn't think or analyze these movies too much, but there is one big question that bothers me. Why, if you have helicopters with range weapons (guns), why do you not stay out of reach of the giant ape? Well, we seen it before and we will see it again.",6,0,0,13 February 2019
Hitch," Good fun!
","Recap: Alex Hitchens is the DateDoctor, giving advice to insecure men how to act to get in touch with their love interests. He sort of creates opportunities and possibilities. Now he's got a big challenge on his hand, Albert Brennaman is secretly in love with his boss, Allegra Cole. Two problems though, Allegra is a rich celebrity, Albert is not, and Allegra is famous, leading to that her love-life is of prime interest to gossip newspapers. Such a reporter is Sara, and she is very good at her job. Though she works to cover a lot of love affairs and goes to a lot of parties, her own love life is closed down. Well that was until she met this interesting and original guy in a bar. Who? Yes, you guessed it, Alex Hitchens. So that's the drama. Alex helps Albert and is interested in Sara. Sara is covering Albert and Allegra and finds Alex attractive, and she is definitively interested in this mysterious DateDoctor she hears about. Well... the situation is set up to explode, and it will.Comment: A very sweet, actually very funny movie. Most romantic comedies involving insecure men that tries to get their dream girl is usually a journey in embarrassing moments where the guy (mostly) makes a fool of himself. Well, there are those moments in her too, but they are mixed up with some nice moments of situation based comedy and dialog, and also some nice tricks and unexpected turns. I must say, Will Smith does a very good Alex Hitchens and also narrates the beginning of the movie in a nice fashion. Nice casting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although they do not really rise to Smith's level.7/10",7,3,6,18 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Nice puzzle with stunning special effects
","** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Basically a puzzle to patch up SW II with SW IV, if you're familiar with those plots, you shouldn't have any problem to figure out the main plot in this one. Anyway, Anakin is still in training by Obi-Wan Kenobi, but his powers have grown. War is upon the republic, and the Jedis is dispersed to fight the separatists. Obi-Wan and Anakin rescues the chancellor Palpatine who is kidnapped by the robotic separatists and Anakin gain the trust of Palpatine, and becomes under his influence. The Jedi council soon become weary that something is not right in the Republic...Comment: On the surface it is a very good puzzle that connects both to SW II and SW IV. However, if the surface is scratched, some inconsistencies arise (for example, Vader is given a more elevated position in this move than what he seems to have in SW IV), and there are some unnecessary 'cheap' references to the other movies. Still, the movie works very well within itself. The special effects are stunning, I especially liked the initial battle scene (except that the ship cannon seem to use shells, aren't they energy weapons?). Very beautiful, and a lot of other scenes are grand and masterfully done. Good cast, with extra credit to Samuel L Jackson as Mace Windu, and Christiansen seems to have grown into the part as Anakin and delivers a much better performance than in the previous movie. The story is much darker, and some few scenes might even be unpleasant for younger viewers, however, for other audiences the movie is better because of it... In conclusion, a worthy end (?) to the Star Wars movies...8/10",8,3,6,25 May 2005
Inception," Spectacular (and very logical)!
","Recap: Mr Cobb is a specialist in extraction of secret information. The method he and his team uses is special, they sedate the victim and extract the information from the victims dreams. The information is then passed on to the client, often a competing corporation. Their latest mission went bad, but instead of repercussions, their intended victim has a new challenging mission for them. To plant an idea in the mind of a competitor. Firstly they need to recruit a new team, all the while their original client want them dead. Secondly they must go deeper inside the dream world than they ever has done before, a challenge that risk their lives. And in the deeper depths of the dreams lurk the dangers of the subconscious.Comments: This is a magnificent film, combining intelligence and an innovative script with good old-fashioned action. Add a good dose of suspense and some spectacular effects, and last but not least some good actors, and you get a stunningly good end result. To me it came highly recommended, both from friends and from IMDb, and with that comes high expectations. For it to pass that with flying colours, that says something.One test I put to really good movies afterwards is if I can find anything I would have done different. Usually there is something, some subplot I would have cut or explored further. But with Inception, I couldn't think of anything. In my opinion it is perfect.One of its great strengths is despite its complexity, despite its mind bending alternate reality, it is also strictly and simply logical, within its own defined set of rules. Those rules are not really given, many of them are explored, explained and discovered during the movie, but I couldn't find a moment were it broke its own rules, which is very rare, especially in a innovative story like this. That is simply put impressive.Through and through, in almost every aspect, Inception impresses with the attention to detail and solid craftsmanship. It is beautiful, it is suspenseful, it is something that sticks in your mind and makes you think (aha!) and it is very entertaining. And above all, when the end nears, well after two hours, I kept wishing it would last longer.10/10",10,1,6,12 December 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Classic story, superb cinematography
","Another remake of the classic story, so the story is not really a surprise (even though I don't count myself as one of the hardcore fans of Christie). But the story is a classic for a reason, it is compelling and engaging, making the movie entertaining all the way.That being said, the best part of the movie is the cinematography and cast/characters. First of, the cinematography is top notch. The landscapes, the views and places we are shown made my want to go on a train ride, hopefully in a landscape as dramatic as in the movie. I loved that part through and through.And I really liked the characters. As I said above, I'm not one of the hardcore fans, but I think Branagh made a superb Poirot. A little different approach than others have portrayed him (especially compared to the TV-series) but very sympathetic and likable. A genius detective with a peculiar personality, but not without warmth and humor.To go into detail about rest of the cast and characters would lead to a long, long text as the cast is numerous and full of stars. Suffice to say that they live up to their names. The characters are intriguing, and acted out really well.I really hope Branagh make another of Christie tales into a movie...9/10",9,3,8,2 December 2017
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Well worth the time
","Recap: North Korean forces cross the border into South Korean and the war is a fact. Pushed hard, South Korean forces conscript every available young man, and that's how Jin-tae ends up on a train to the front. Jin-tae, still a student, and the hope of his family, is very close with his big brother, Jin-seok. And when Jin-seok can't break Jin-tae free, he might as well join the army and look after his little brother. Together, they face the horrors of war. But Jin-seok, told that if he perform tasks of bravery, and beyond the call of duty, might ask the commanders to send his brother home. With that in mind, Jin-seok, rushes into mission after mission, soon becoming somewhat of a hero. But war changes men, and Jin-tae aren't sure he likes what his brother is turning into.Comments: A statement about war. It isn't pretty, in fact it is full of horrors. This movie seems to take the responsibility to depict the war truthfully seriously, hence there are a lot of unpleasant scenes. The backdrop of the Korean war is interesting, though a little confusing sometimes, if you don't keep up when the tide is changing. But it is the story, the connection between the two brothers, that add the sparkles to this movie. The cast do a great job, and the movie had me captured from beginning to end. Though, if you're no fan of war-movies or dislikes pictures of blood and gore, you should probably avoid this. But if you do like war-movies (and don't mind the blood that much) this is a movie well worth seeing.It did remind me a little of We were soldiers with Mel Gibson. Most because of its sincerity.8/10",8,3,4,2 February 2006
Arrival," Teasing the brain
","This is a fairly rare movie. Firstly that it is a science fiction that puts its emphasis on the first word, science, more than fiction. Of course, it's a made up story, with some decent special effects. But the interesting part is the story, and the growing understanding the character Louise gets as she tries to communicate with an alien species.First contact movies is always interesting, especially those movies that doesn't go directly to action filled war movies. It raises questions about how the aliens look, act and communicate. The last is the focal point of this movie, as the expert Lousie Banks is brought in to learn how to communicate with the mysterious aliens. Lousie makes some headway, but soon also starts to experience strange dreams and memories. Can they help her solve the problem. The dual mysteries of the alien language and Louise's dreams easily caught my attention and immediately made me think, speculate and guess my own solution. The movie made me take part in the puzzle, the mark of a really good movie. Unfortunately, someone decided that some extra drama was needed and inserted an attack of some fearful soldier, and the preparation of war by humans. Too much of a cliché for my taste, and actually unnecessary to make the story captivating enough. It seems like the writer/director didn't trust the scientific mystery to be enough. But in my opinion it took away more from the story than added to it.Still it is a refreshingly good movie, that activates the viewer instead of passivating them. It raises more questions than it answers, in a good way, both about the story, but also about our own perception of the universe.8/10",8,1,5,7 October 2017
Centurion," God historical war action, but with a disturbing flaw
","Recap: Centurion Dias is one of the Roman officers at a camp recently overrun by Pict raiders. Taken prisoner, he is brought before Gorlacon, the king of the Picts. However, he manages to escape and return to Roman lines just in time to join the ninth legion on their march to conquer the Picts. However, the legion is wiped out by a Pict attack, and Dias and a few friends find themselves lost far behind enemy lines and hunted by the best there is.Comments: A rather good movie, far more closer to the genre action than drama. It is tricky to do good historical war movies, but Centurion manages fairly well. My only real concern is that the quality and the unfortunate overuse of blood and gore is not up to the standard that the rest of the movie has. Really a minor part of the movie, but it really stands out and bugs me. It seems that they ran out of budget and had to cut corners somewhere, unfortunately they chose something that they want to show in almost every action scene. For me it really brought the movie down a notch.Otherwise it is pretty good, even though the story wasn't the best, but good enough, but it got a little repetitive in the end. The soldiers ran, and the Picts hunted, that's about it. But for the 90 minutes it ran, it did work out OK.6/10",6,2,3,11 December 2010
Paths of Glory," Stuck with me... but the movie kept it's distance
","If a movie really sticks with you, that counts for something. If it does, there was something in the movie that made me think and reflect. The problem with Paths of Glory is that I'm not sure what it was...But let me start from the beginning. Paths of Glory comes with a great reputation (and it is always difficult to live up to a hype) and an impressive rating here on IMDb. The movie, a clear anti-war movie, shows the aftermath of an futile attack on a German stronghold by the French army somewhere along the trenches in the first world war. To be clear, this is no war/action movie, it is almost all about what happens after. The general responsible (hoping for yet another promotion) is furious. After trying to have his artillery fire on his own lines (to get them moving), he 'settles' to have one from each company put on trial for cowardice (after initially demanding that a hundred be put on trial - and this is a general that takes pride in being 'a soldier - one of the men'). The men's colonel, who personally led the attack, protests vehemently and demands to defend the men during the trial. The trial is of course a sham, the outcome decided from the beginning.Futility is a common theme. The futility of the attack - thousands of lives sacrified for nothing, with no hope of success. The futility of the trial and hopelessness of the men - chosen just to make an example. The disdain of the higher officers for the enlisted men (one genereal thinks it unfair to compare the enlisted men dying to the newspapers critique the officers suffers (which he thinks is worse)). The anti-war message is clear. And finally, the ending scene, where the enlisted men leers and howls at a poor captured German girl that is made to perform for them. Is that the message? That everyone, even the common man, kick downwards on those who are weaker? The men start to sing along in the end, a significant change - but what does that mean?To be fair, I wasn't that impressed when the movie ended. But then the thoughts started. What was the point really? Is everything depressing, or was there hope somewhere? And then I realized how expertly Kubrick has manipulated my thoughts and emotions throughout the movie with his choice of scenes and camera positioning. In that regard the movie is a directorial masterpiece. The movie, almost without me noticing, planted seeds of thoughts and questions, but offering no answers.But herein also lies the movies greatest fault. By the same questions that made me think after, built a distance between me and the characters during. There were no real accomplishements, almost no characters to build a relationship with and feel for. I can't say the movie was very entertaining at all. By entertaining I don't mean I have to laugh or wonder at the effects - but I do expect to be engaged by the movie. Be dragged into the movie by the story. I actually wasn't with Paths of Glory, there was that distance.And in the end, the real masterpiece manages to do both. I don't think Paths of Glory quite lives up to it's hype. Or is it that I expected too much out of it because of the hype?",7,0,1,14 February 2019
X-Men: First Class," A surprisingly good prequel
","X-men: First Class is a very good and entertaining action movie, much better than other spin-offs from the X-men saga. In my mind, it might be the best since the original X-men, even though I missed a few of the characters from the sequels.But being a prequel, which is always tricky, First Class does it very well. I'm actually impressed how the story was written as to be both fun and not overly evident, but at the same time keeping the integrity of the 'following' movie.Of course there are lots and lots of special effects, most of which are done very well. It fits the story, and never feels out of place. Maybe not too hard to accomplish since a story like this needs a lot of special effects.I liked many of the 'new' characters as well. Not being familiar to the comic X-men world I can't say if they're true to the comic, but they felt right in the movie. Not sure if they can return in an eventual sequel since they do not appear in the 'original'. They have also found a good cast to the characters, McAvoy does it good as a young Xavier, but can't unfortunately not really compare to Patrick Stewart. Then Fassbender is better as Magneto. Lucas Till and January Jones fits their characters nicely, but perhaps best is Kevin Bacon as the villain Shaw. Bacon is underrated and it is nice to see him in a leading role.In all this is an entertaining movie, mostly because of good action. It is not as good in the humor and one-liners as the original, mostly delivered there by Wolverine, whom does have a cameo though. It is a very good prequel though, and I would be interested to see if and when they continue the saga.7/10",7,2,4,3 November 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Another good Ice Age animated comedy
","Recap: Manny and Ellie is having a kid, something that puts the herd to the test. Manny is freaking out, Diego is feeling old and is leaving for new adventures and the coming kid is waking up the mother feelings in Sid. Unfortunately, the only kids Sid can find is three large eggs he found in a cave nearby. And when the eggs hatch Sid is suddenly the mother of three little adorable dinosaur babies. However, one T-Rex mother is now missing her three kids, and are not entirely happy about it.Comments: The third installment in the Ice Age series, one knows what to expect now. And it doesn't disappoint. Like all Ice age movies it got a good story and a special eye for the small, but hilarious details. Those details are the real gems in an otherwise good story.But a few things seem to have changed, or developed. For instance, the animation has risen to another level. They were not bad at all before, but a few scenes, Diego's chase in the beginning for example, are actually really impressive. But the extra attention to the visual have taking a small toll out of the story-telling. Not as fresh and inventive as the originals anymore, and the story seem to direct itself a tad more to older audience's. Not that I complain, being adult, and not that I doubt that kids will enjoy this, but I did note a small shift, both in language and story.A few small scenes and moments are truly gems though, so it pays to pay attention. Probably the best scene of the entire movie is just a minor detail, just a few seconds long, at the beginning. And then those details just keep coming.Sit back and keep your eyes open, and you will surely enjoy this animated comedy. And I hope that 20 Century Fox keeps them coming as long as they are as good as this.7/10",7,1,2,14 February 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Great biopic
","Recap: The history both in front of and behind the scenes of Elizabeth, the English Queen of the 16th century. Also known as the Virgin Queen for her lack of husband she lives in a peaceful time and the English people prospers. But she is a protestant, and the Catholic countries around the Mediterranean, led by Philip of Spain, plot against her. The center of this plot is the imprisoned Queen Mary of Scots. She is a catholic, and the focus of a rebellious group that wish to put her on the throne. This group try to assassinate Elizabeth, leading to Mary's, as the apparent head of the conspiracy, execution. And that is all Philip needs to declare war.But also, there is the personal story of Elizabeth. Despite being at the center of attention all the time she is lonely. She longs for love and true honest friendship, which is desperately hard to find when you are in power. But then a Sir Walter Raleigh appear at court, and emotions stir.Comments: I liked this much better than I thought I would. Knowing little of her time on the throne I knew there were some dramatic events that surely would do for good parts of the movie. But I feared that long stretches in between would be slow, dull and only about showing the costumes. My fear was fortunately unfounded.Sure, it is a lot about the costumes, and the settings. And they are fantastic (I recommend to check the bonus feature about this). The director, production designer and art and costume department has truly done a masterful work. Because the movie is stunningly beautiful. Costumes, architecture, light and perspectives are woven together to a truly magnificent ground work for the movie. Fortunately, and to the directors credit, it is meant just to be the ground work, the foundation. It is never supposed to take over the story, be the main attraction or take over the story (i.e. just prancing about in long pointless dances dressed up in the beautiful dresses). Instead it supports the story well, gives it credibility.The main story is divided in two with Elizabeth and Raleigh at the center of both. These two story lines supporting each other do so that are very few slow or dull moments in the movie. Perhaps not full of traditional action all the time, but there are always something happening, something brewing. It might be the complex relationship between Elizabeth and Raleigh, with the air full of attraction but a relationship that can't be. Or it might be the political plotting that leads up to the war, and one of the legendary naval battles in history. Either way, something is always happening. There are few, if any, dull moments.A key part to this is the complexity of the main characters, especially Elizabeth, well played by Cate Blanchett. Clive Owen is good too as the roguish, independent and proud Raleigh, but it is Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth that stays in my mind. Deeply determined and strong, at least outward, she is also fragile and lonely, seeking attention and affirmation. It's her complexity that really breathes life in the movie.8/10",8,2,2,15 August 2009
RED," All you do, is worth doing in style
","If you are going to do something, you might as well do it in style. That seem to be the motto of both the director and characters of Red. Red is a slow paced action movie, laced with a subtle humor that many times is much better than the obvious kind. Retired CIA hit man Frank Moses suddenly finds himself the target of a hit squad. Now, he intends to survive, and he is the best at his work. But he is no special rush, nothing is worth doing if you can't do it in style. To aid him he recruits his old friends Joe and Marvin, and brings along a girl he is fond of. Together they form a unstoppable force, heading straight for the CIA top.This is an unusual action movie, just in my taste. As tasted it is slow paced, almost subtle but full of great special effects and extravagant explosions. Just a great mix and balance of low and high key, that augments each part. The story is pretty basic, a typical action story, but the editing and direction elevates the story to another level. Schwentke's direction is masterful, I guess he is at least partly responsible for the tone of the movie, but also the play with scenes, settings and visual effects are impressive.Just as impressive is the cast. The character Frank Moses is just perfect for Willis, and when he is supported by such a stellar cast with Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren, Cox, Urban and Parker you could turn just about anything into a decent movie. But with a good story and directing Red turns into one of the better action comedies in recent years.8/10",8,0,0,25 March 2011
Final Destination," Not as good the idea, but entertaining
","** CONTAINS SPOILERS **Recap: Alex and his fellow students in the high school French club are going to Paris. But as they have boarded the plane, Alex has a vision of the plane exploding. He panics and angers fellow student Carter. A fight follows and the both along with some friends of theirs and a teacher are kicked off the plane. As they argue over the missed flight at the gate, they see the plane explode, just as Alex said it would. The terrible tragic is hard to deal with, especially if you 'saw' it happen before it did. The school has a memorial hoping to heal all wounds, but soon thereafter odd accidents happen to those who survived the crash. They've cheated Death, and Death doesn't appreciate being cheated very much.Comment: As I heard of it I thought it was a stellar idea. You can't cheat Death, he will come for you. Though the end result is not bad, actually it is pretty good, it is not as good as I envisioned. Basically I thought you could spin it two ways. A) a horror comedy with a lot of freak accidents or B) a pure horror with a lot of deaths and scares. Now it's neither, or a little of both. First, there are too few people to kill of to begin with. Time as to be filled, so a subplot of Alex being suspected of foul play (and he has a incredible ability to incriminate himself) by the FBI. The subplot is good but does not fit any of my alternatives above, and I think it slows the pace of the movie a little too much. The cast is good even though this is (surprise) no Academy Award-winning performance. Best is Seann William Scott in a role very typical for him. Director James Wong and his crew of special effects workers should be mentioned. It is well worth to pay attention, and I also had as much fun reading through the trivia and checking up on them afterwards as I had watching the movie.7/10",7,0,1,10 September 2005
Rear Window," A movie that has earned the right to be named Classic
","Recap: Photographer L.B. Jeffries is used to taking risks. That's why spending six weeks in his apartment after breaking his leg on his latest assignment is worse than prison. To make time go by he sits at his window and follows the lives of his neighbors. At the same time he is doubting that his girlfriend is the right one, even if she is perfect. But something much worse is clouding his mind. Suddenly the wife of one of his neighbors have disappeared. And he is the only one that seemed to notice.Comments: There are a few reasons to see this movie. The first and foremost reason is that the movie is a really good one. Made by Alfred Hitchcock, which is another reason to watch it, it is proof that Hitchcock really was a master of suspense. The movie builds it slowly on a subtle psychological level, but when it really counts it is impossible not to watch.The story is masterfully told, threaded through a complex weave, with small hints and clues presented constantly. But their meaning is not instantly clear, so you have to keep watching to get their real meaning. And so the suspense builds, until Jeffries has involved everyone close to him, whom all was very skeptical at first, until the very end. What also makes it so interesting is the hints ambiguity. The story could turn in two directions, right up to the end, and those directions are truly opposite. Is Mr. Thorwald an murderer, or is he just a victim of his neighbors paranoid mind ghosts. Either end is plausible, until which one is right is revealed.The acting of the cast is an integral part of the movies success. Stewart must convey that he is convinced, with his supporting actors contributing with the doubts but slowly coming around to his point of view. Stewart is very good at this, and it is also very easy to see how Grace Kelly came to be so popular. Such beauty with such talent is memorable. And it is also easy to understand why Thelma Ritter got so many nominations as best supporting actress (but unfortunately never won). The acting of those three, combined with Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr under the supervision of Hitchcock is really the main reason why the story is so captivating.Albeit not so apparent in the movie and not so essential for the story, the ambition with the sets and setting of lights and placement of cameras is impressive. It is just good craftsmanship.8/10",8,1,3,19 September 2009
Life," More about emotions than thinking
","A scientific crew aboard the ISS recovers a sample from Mars that contains a dormant but alive cell. For the first time, alien life is discovered. Unfortunately the cell, now awakened, grows unbelievable quickly and turns decidely unfriendly. Growing more and more intelligent, it sets on a killing spree aboard the ISS.First off, let me say that horror movie is not normally my kind of genre, and this movie is more of a horror than sci-fi. The sci-fi is just about the setting (ISS) and premise of the movie. The rest, like how the story evolves, is more or less pure horror. One thing I dislike with horror movies is that the characters are prone to do irrational (read stupid) things and that the plot have holes in it. Life got them too (and having read a few other reviews all the plot holes ruined the movie for them - so be warned if you are about to watch it) and they are plenty. For starters, how they recover the satellite containing the sample, using the ISS as a baseball catching glove, is ridiculous. On the other hand, there and then you get a feel how the movie and story is set up, so if you don't like it, turn it off. It will continue with the plot holes and bad (yeah, stupid) decisions from the crew.However, if you view it as it actually is, a horror movie (and able to oversee most of the technical plot holes) the movie made me feel. It made me cringe, made me think 'oh, no' and almost want to hide behind a pillow sometimes. And that is what horror movies is all about, isn't it? Emotions. So the story, albeit full of mistakes, is not that bad. If you like horror movies, this might br something.The casting is impressive, with Ferguson, Gyllenhaal, Reynolds, Sanada, Dykhovichnaya and Bakare making up the crew. Since the story isn't character driven, the characters don't evovle much, and we don't get to know them very much. The acting are decent, but not stellar (not much material to act about). The effects are good enough.So if you like horror movies, give it a try. If you are looking for a science fiction adventure, pick something else.",6,0,0,3 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excellent start of an epic series
","Recap: There is turmoil in the galaxy, a rebellion has broken out against the Emperor and his dictatorship. Little of that is noticed on Tatooine though were Luke lives with his uncle and aunt on their farm. However, the fight between good and evil suddenly pays a visit when Luke and his family gets hold of two droids carrying secret plans of a powerful space station. Along with mentor and old Jedi Knight Obi-wan Kenobi Luke sets out on a quest across the galaxy to save a captured princess vital to the rebellion and join the fight against the empire.Comments: This is a terrific start to what initially was an epic trilogy, now a series of six movies. This is the first or the fourth in that series, depending on how you look at it. Anyway, the movie got it all. Most notably it is a variation on a classic theme, the young hero that sets out on quest to save the world. Only it is not set in our ordinary world but in a great galaxy with unlimited places and possibilities. And especially the special edition released two decades after the really uses the special effects to show the grandeur or horror of the entire galaxy. But one should not forget that the initial release was a break-through in special effects! But there is much more than special effects. First off there is a great story and a great plot with an excellent sense of adventure, some drama but most notably some great action. Actually Star Wars set the standard of how spacefights should be when I grew up playing, and it still holds true. Add some quick one-liners and a light sense of humor and you got what resembles a perfect mix.John Williams has left an great impression too with one of the most recognized themes ever. The music and sound alike is wonderful. And not to forget, this is a movie that contains some very good actors and actresses. It was a breakthrough for Harrison Ford but also sported established stars like Alec Guiness. Add Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones and you got a great cast. And with George Lucas at the helm nothing much can go wrong.Not only the cast is great but it sports some of the best characters ever. Luke, Han Solo, Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi and perhaps especially Darth Vader are legends. Each and every one of them are very strong and it is easy to sympathize and identify (or wish to) with them. Even the evil Vader.This is a great movie that I enjoy very much each and every time I watch it. Even knowing every twist and turn it don't reduce the experience. This is a movie that belongs among the stars, and that make me wish I could be among them too every time I watch it.10/10",10,1,2,23 February 2008
300," This is Sparta
","Recap: Sparta, an ancient Greek state where the highest glory is to die for land and country. So from the day they are born Spartan boys are raised as warriors, producing the finest army ever seen. But now Sparta is threatened by a mightier foe than ever, Xerxes and the Persians. Xerxes has assembled the greatest army ever seen and now turns his attention to Greece. But Xerxes long arm has already reached Sparta with the promise of gold, wealth and women and a few Spartan do not support their king Leonidas anymore. So Leonidas is forced to bring only his bodyguard, 300 of the best warriors in Sparta and with them try to repel Xerxes. But above all they will abide by Spartan law. Never retreat, never surrender.Comments: This is Sparta, and there will be blood. A lot of it. Actually it will be abusive amounts of blood spilled in this movie, so if you don't like blood, choose something else to watch. What makes this move so good (but also its major weakness ironically) is the monumental sense of wonder. Nothing is done half-hearted, every thrust with the spear, every stroke with the sword every line delivered is done so to the fullest. This makes it a great movie to unwind to, to relax to. To get caught in this fabricated sense of heroism and glory. It is easy, and it is very enjoying.But to have everything yelled, every line delivered as their entire fate depended on each syllable, makes the move very monotone. There is no levels, no subtleties. Everything is brutal. This is in part due to be honest to the story, as it is told that there is no room for any softness, any weakness. But to raise the level of the movie even further you really need to be able to handle all aspects.There are a lot of special effects, and they are really good. The action is massive and each and every adrenalin full moment is well choreographed and full of blood. You see this for the action, and it never disappoints.And there is an interesting question, a hint at a more complex thought beyond the action. The Spartans, the good guys, are all perfect. Even the slightest flaw and you're discarded. On the other hand, the tyrant Xerxes is very accepting of flaws and disfigurement, unintentional or intentional. But he is also very obviously evil. But the accepting stance is mostly associated with good, although not here. Something to think about? I don't know...Still, and all in all. This is a very entertaining movie.8/10",8,0,1,15 June 2008
Fast Five," Typical Fast and the Furious
","Fast Five is the fifth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, the second since the series was reclaimed by Vin Diesel and the gang. Since it is the fifth, there are no real surprises as to what the basis of the story is. They still are expert drivers that drives fast and real expensive cars. This time they end up in Brazil, fugitives from their break out at the end of the last movie.A heist goes awry, and they end up becoming enemies to the top crime lord in Rio. At the same time the U.S. sends its best agent to apprehend them all. Suddenly Toretto and his friends must wage a battle at two fronts.It is a good action, with some good stunts and effects, and some spectacular driving. Exactly what I have come to expect from a Fast and the Furious movie. Diesel is good as Toretto, and his match up with Dwayne Johnson is good. It is also good to see the characters from all the different movies get together.In all, it is an entertaining movie, but it lacks the element of surprise, or the edge to give something really extra. It delivers what I expected, but not much of anything else. Still, it was good enough that I will most probably watch the next one.6/10",7,1,2,26 September 2011
Sin City," Pure violence
","Recap: A few loosely connected stories that takes place in the fictional story of Sin City. Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. The stories generally tell the story of a lone man that has fallen outside the system. The law is not functioning, and to protect and avenge the girl of theirs, and get even, they go on a personal crusade through the city, to find out who is responsible for the injustice done to them. And they are not asking nice.Comments: This is two hours of pure violence. The heroes can take and dish out enormous amount of damage, and they do on a nightly basis. Indeed the movie is so full of action violence, clearly resembling that what one expects in a graphic novel, that the story is forced to take the back seat. In my opinion, the movie would have been better if there would have been a stronger, more emphasized story. But still the move is very entertaining. As I believe director Rodriguez said, this is an translation of the graphic novel to the medium of a movie, not an adaptation. So the very brutal violence is given a clear aspect of that in a graphic novel. Indeed, the total experience is the one of having been shown a graphic novel, and if that was the intention, the movie is very successful. This means, for instance, that the violence is very brutal and unrealistic, so it is never scary or nasty. Actually just fun and entertaining.The visual concept of the movie is very interesting, mostly being black and white, but with a few exceptions. Red is a returning color, as is the eyecolor blue. Blood is red sometimes, and white other times. This gives the movie a unique visual feel, which is very interesting. But it never bothers with the story of the movie.Since there is three almost independent stories the cast is big, and there are lot of big names. Some get more time on the screen than others, but a in general it is very good acting. I really like Rourke's performance as Marv. Good casting, good acting.I'll give this move a 7 out of 10. It was very entertaining, but if the movie wishes to score higher with me, I need a better story.",7,1,3,7 November 2005
Moon," Interesting and suspenseful, a very good sci-fi thriller
","Recap: Sam Bell is an astronaut working for Lunar harvesting helium on the moon for Earth's fusion reactors. His three year contract is coming to an end, and he is looking forward to going home and reuniting with his wife and young kid. But he is having some peculiar visions, imagining people that isn't there. One of those lead to him having an accident getting trapped in a lunar rover. When he wakes up in the infirmary the station AI informs him he has been in an accident, but he can remember no details. When he goes outside the station he discovers the demolished rover, and to his surprise, a trapped astronaut inside it. Is he still imagining people, or, if the trapped astronaut is real, who is he? Comments: A very well written and inventive thriller using a possible aspect of a near future technology of cloning. It is an eerie suspense that slowly builds up with the uncertainties the characters feel, well acted and scripted so that I viewing also had my doubts of who was what or who.It is also interesting that a movie can be made so complex with only three characters, and two of them being the same person. The third is Gerty, the suspicious station AI, voiced by Kevin Spacey. The threat and suspense connected to it is not really external, not initially at least, but stems from Sam Bell's uncertainty of his own identity and sanity.One could extrapolate and have a serious discussion about cloning after having viewed this movie, but it also works well as pure entertainment. Duncan Jones is a new director that has also written the original story, having made a well made movie with good attention to detail. It will be interesting to see what Jones can make in the future.8/10",8,1,6,28 March 2010
Warcraft," Entertaining
","I am always a little skeptical about movies based on computer games, as they often turn out not so well. But this one did. A special effects extravaganza, of course, and with a not too complicated story, it is an action-filled entertaining movie.More surprisingly, it manages quite well to stand for itself, I haven't played much of the game(s) (or read any of the books) but could still find my way into the story. If you are familiar to the franchise you might pick up more subtle references, but it worked well even without knowing much beforehand. You just need to be into the genre of fantasy and special effects.",6,1,1,9 August 2017
Contact," Stellar!
","Recap: Ellie Arroway a bright little kid, is orphaned at a young age and seek comfort in trying to contact other people, and her dead parents on her radio. When she grows up (maybe feeling betrayed and abandoned by God - personal reflection) she turns to science and specifically, the Search For Extra-Terrestial Intielligence, SETI. This field in science, often frowned upon by other scientists, leads to Arroway always having to fight for and defend her projects. Kicked out of Arecibo, she turns to the private sector for funds. She finds a benefactor in the eccentric industrialist S.R. Hadden. With the money backing her she goes to the VLA and continues her search. And suddenly it happens! A signal. An intelligent signal! Complete chaos breaks lose, with media, government, military, politicians and scientists all wanting to have their say. Parallel with the struggle to understand and decode the signal, a political and personal struggle for fame and power goes on. And a struggle between science and theology about in which aspects to view the signal. Ellen Arroway finds that her fiercest opponent David Drumlin, suddenly takes credit for her work and makes and has a personal agenda. And then there is Palmer Joss, a theologist with a completely different view on the world compared to Ellie, but still there is something going on between the two. Everything is suddenly very hard to do, but her mysterious benefactor has an uncanny ability to find a clue for her every time the projects threaten to come to a standstill.Comments: A very visually beautiful movie with deep philosophical questions with a lot of different interpretations. But it is not therefore I love this movie. I love this movie because of the sense of wonder, the curiosity and the feeling of exploration. It manages successfully to transport me along with Ellie, to feel her awe and curiosity, both when she is in the desolate desert watching the star filled sky and listening to the radio sources of the sky, and when she is going on her (or did she, decide yourself) trip to see all the alien places. And, just having watched the movie again tonight, knowing what is going to happen, I still get the same sense of curiosity. Just love it! As stated, the movie is very beautiful (and a little sad from time to time) using special effects very successfully. And that it manages to convey those emotions, is proof of a very well directed movie. Along with very good acting from the cast it makes the movie complete (yes, it got a great story as well). Foster is great in the lead, she just has one little cheesy moment that keeps her from giving a stellar (hehe) performance. McConaughey gives a flawless performance too, but in my opinion, the best performances is given by actors in smaller supporting roles, namely Morse, Fichtner and Busey. Morse is just great as Ellie's dad, Busey perfect as a madman. Also like Woods as a cynical government official.Well, I could go on, but I won't. I'll just say. Watch it. It is a great journey.10/10",10,2,5,20 October 2005
The Proposal," Good romantic comedy
","Recap: Margaret Tate is the chief editor, Andrew's boss in fact, and the office witch. Exactly everyone, Andrew included, hates her for her heartless, ruthless ways and that she puts work above anything else, and expects everyone else to o the same. She does things her own ways, and don't bother listening to anyone else, including the Immigration Agency. So now they're deporting her. To stop that she recruits Andrew to marry her. To fool the immigration agent they go to Andrew's grandmothers birthday, in Sitka Alaska. At first they can barely stand each other, but naturally there is more to each one than first meets the eye.Comments: A pretty much standard romantic comedy, where the two at first seems to hate each other but in the differences find love. And it works well, and I really liked The Proposal. Not very surprising in the grand scheme, actually it takes most of the standard cliché, but it does have a few quick turns and small surprises.It got a good cast too. Bullock is a real veteran in the genre, and got solid support from Reynolds, Steenburgen, Nelson and perhaps especially White. They are all proved actors in the genre, and performs their respective roles well. But especially Reynolds and Bullock lack some of the chemistry as a couple, both when fighting and when in love, to really elevate the movie. It looks too much of acting, they don't seem to believe it themselves.But I did get quite a few laughs out of it, and that's the point isn't it? 6 fraud marriages out of 10.",6,0,1,15 February 2011
Shark Tale," Fun for everyone
","** Beware of spoilers here **Recap: Lenny is not happy. He is a vegetarian and a great white shark, and that don't really work out. His father, Don Lino (the mafia-boss around), is now considering retiring, and leaving Lenny and his brother Frankie in charge. As a last effort Frankie takes Lenny out to teach him how to be a real shark. At the reef Oscar is in trouble. He works at a Whale wash but aspires to become Somebody. His ambition also makes him overlook his co-worker Angie, who is secretly in love with Oscar. But Oscar's boss, Sykes, is under pressure from Don Lino. Sykes in turn, with his jellyfish thugs Bernie and Ernie, forces Oscar to pay his, somewhat large debts. Oscar, with help from Angie, puts the money together but loses them at the races. Sykes's thugs then bring Oscar out into the 'desert' where Oscar is about to 'get lost' when Frankie and Lenny stumbles upon them. Ernie and Bernie flees and when Frankie goes to attack to show Lenny how it is done, he is killed in a freak accident. Back at the reef Oscar take credit for the killing, is soon named The Sharkslayer, and becomes the hero and the Somebody he always dreamt to be. Things get complicated when Lenny turns up and threatens to reveal the truth if Oscar doesn't help him start a new life in the reef. Back at the shark hangout, Don Lino is furious about the news that one son is dead, the other one missing. He wants revenge...Comments: This is a great movie, which I believe can be enjoyed by everyone. The story itself is somewhat focused on 'mature' aspects as love, revenge and so on. But I believe kids will have a lot of fun watching it as well. For the more movie-experienced audience the movie is full of evident or ¨subtler, all hilarious, references and spoofs of other movies. In other aspects, DreamWorks animators and crew have done a great job. The movie is illustrated beautifully and especially nice is that the characters have borrowed some physical features from the actors that lent them their voice. The actors and actresses do it well too, using their whole range of vocal abilities and peculiarities. And at last, but most important, the story itself is very funny and inventive. No dull moments. Great!9/10",9,4,6,14 February 2005
Princess Mononoke," Actually pretty good
","Recap: Suddenly a great monster leaps out of the forest attacking the village. Ashitaka, with a steady hand on his bow, slays the monster but is at the same time stricken by its curse. He must leave his village and travel far to find the Deer God, deep in his forests, and hope that the Deer God will save him. Once there, he finds that humans and animal gods are fighting. Humans are destroying the forests in the process of gathering iron and the animals are fighting back. In the lead is the wolf Moro, her two cubs and Mononoke, a girl raised by the wolves. Ashitaka finds himself in the middle, and also find himself attracted to Mononoke.Comments: Rather good actually. The tempo in the movie is not high, but not so slow either that you get bored, a problem I find with a lot of other animés. I also liked the story, as it really had a beginning, a comprehendible and motivated plot, and an end. But it still is an animé where the scenery takes much space and focus in the movie. Small creatures that have really no place in the story comes and goes. But they never gets overhand over the actual story and just enhances it with some cute mystery. There evidently also is an idea with the story, a message but I will not comment further on it. So I haven't very much more to say actually as the movie to me was quite average. Pretty good, but not spectacular.7/10",7,1,4,11 March 2007
Jurassic Park," A classic adventure
","Recap: Three scientists, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm are recruited by a wealthy entrepreneur to inspect his latest business venture before it is opened to the public. The entrepreneur, John Hammond and scientists working for him has managed to extract and develop dinosaur DNA, resurrecting one extinct species after another. Soon Jurassic Park, a theme park with living, wild dinosaurs, will open. But the tour is sabotaged, the security measures turned off, and soon the dinosaurs run free. The weekend tour is now a fight for survival.Comments: I remember it very well when this movie opened at the cinemas, a major development in cgi and a big step for movies. I remember going to the cinema on several occasions to see it, enjoying it every time. Now, almost two decades later effects have developed massively but Jurrasic Park still holds its own against the competition. As a testament to the craftsmanship that was put into the movie, Jurassic Park don't look obsolete or out of place when watched even today.What it has lost is its uniqueness, now cgi like that are hardly breathtaking. The story is OK, the music great, but the main attraction when it was released was the stunning effects. With that lost it is still a good adventure movie, with a few quite suspenseful moments and a few jokes and one-liners mixed in, but it is not the stellar movie experience it once was. That aside, I still enjoy it. The only parts that annoy me is that it occasionally suffers from irritating-kid-syndrome, for example with the flashlight in the jeep and the T-rex.The cast is strong, with Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum heading the credits. But it is most fun to see Samuel L Jackson in a supporting role as a programmer before breaking through big time and becoming a leading actor himself.8/10 (based upon how I felt when it was released, now it maybe is a 7)",8,1,2,22 August 2010
Valkyrie," Infotainment at it's best
","Recap: A dramatization of the events leading up to, and after July 20 Assassination Plot to kill Hitler and install a new government. Count Colonel Stauffenberg returns to Berlin after being severely wounded, with growing doubts of the war and Hitler's government. He joins a group of highly ranked officers that conspire to overthrow Hitler and end the war. The operation centers on the contingency plan Valkyrie that is to be activated if Führer is dead. The plan is to assassinate the entire leadership with a bomb, planted by Stauffenberg himself, and claim that rouge elements of the SS is behind the coup. Then, with the aid of the army, they must take control of Berlin.Comments: Based on actual events, and from what I can tell it is pretty true to the actual event, even if some parts must have been dramatized either because of effect or because of uncertainty of what really happened. Either way the story really works well as an action-thriller, with or without connecting it to the real events. It's dramatic, it got a lot of tension and some twists as well.And for once I really thought that Tom Cruise acted well again. He has done many good movies, but in the last few years I haven't been impressed at all. In Valkyrie he shows that he hasn't lost it all. But maybe what impresses me most is that they honor the true events in such detail. Right down to the cast, they have managed to assemble a highly merited and veteran cast with many respected and well known actors and still keeping that the actors actually should resemble the person they are acting as. Cruise and Steuffenberg is does really resemble each other, and so does Nighy and Olbricht, Stamp and Beck, Wilkinson and Fromm and so on. It gives the movie a certain edge in credibility and plausibility.Enjoying the war genre, it is not hard to like Valkyrie. But it actually accomplishes to be both entertaining and interesting, in such a way that I had to check what really happened (and discover how true it seem to be). Actually a high level of infotainment. Recommended for everyone with the least interest in war movies or recent history. Or hopefully both.7/10",7,0,0,20 December 2009
The Soloist," Unusual story that turns out being just average on movie
","Recap: By coincidence Steve Lopez, a journalist for the LA Times, meets Nathaniel Ayers Jr. a homeless man. What strikes Lopez as peculiar is that Nathaniel plays the violin, and he does it really well, despite the violin having just two strings. Lopez starts to do some research and finds out that Nathaniel was a prodigy, accepted to Julliard. But a mental breakdown forced him to quit, and has now left him homeless. Lopez and Ayers strikes a bond, builds a tentative friendship.Comments: Based on a true story, the story of Nathaniel Ayers and his friendship with Steve Lopez is a peculiar one. Their friendship got its bumps, but that is natural, them coming from two extremely different viewpoints. But ultimately it is a story about beauty. Their friendship is beautiful, and the music that Nathaniel plays is beautiful. But if the true story is a peculiar one, the movie is pretty ordinary.Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are both good, solid veteran actors. And they give solid performances, what you could expect. But they do it individually, I don't really feel the real connection between them, as it must have been between Lopez and Ayers. And I think that is what carries this movie,, the bond between the two of them. And the movie becomes as good as I as a viewer can feel their bond. And it was good, but it wasn't much more than that.What disturbs me a little is that this most unusual story is still told in a usual way. The movie takes its standard steps. The beginning, the tentative start, a brief period that goes well, a little honeymoon so to speak. Then comes the inevitable setback and at the end the resolve. Many, many movies uses these steps. They do for a reason, because it is safe, and moderately successful. But it seems unnecessary that such a unusual story like this should feel the need to use them. A little more inventive a creative narration would have been welcome.Six cellos out of ten.",6,0,0,6 February 2011
Dodgeball," Very funny
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **White Goodman (Stiller) is running an aggressive, elitist gym. The gym is economically successful and Goodman is looking to take over Peter LaFleur's (Vaughn) Average Joe gym across the street. Only very few odd customers visit Average Joe gym and business is extremely bad. In fact, LaFleur is short $50000 and Goodman is about to finally take over the business. The Average Joe crew has only one chance to save their gym, to enter a Dodgeball tournament with $50000 in prize money.The story is not great, but the little mishaps and adventures the crew experiences, along with odd characters and great cameos, make this a hilarious movie. Ben Stiller is great as Goodman (I have a hard time imaging anyone else that could make that role better). Vaughn and the other are also good, and especially Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate is really good. Otherwise, it is the little things that make this a good movie, as mentioned the story is not great, and unfortunately it is a little too predictable to merit a higher grade. But a must see nonetheless.8/10",8,4,7,2 December 2004
The Fighter," Superb acting
","The Fighter is a biographic movie about Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund and their quests. The plural because there are two intertwined stories, Ward's ambition to become a champion fighter and Eklund's fight to end his addiction and find his feet. Ward's boxing career is the center of it all, with its several bumps and turns along the way.The story is intriguing, but never really caught me until late in the movie. Perhaps because there were too much focus on the bumps in the beginning, almost exclusively, so the story didn't get any flow until later on. Perhaps it is because the stellar acting, foremost by Bale as Dickey, that made this rather tragic and unnerving story too real.The real entertainment is the acting. Mark Wahlberg is good, real good, but it is Bale that steals the show completely and he got an Oscar for it. Melissa Leo also got one for her character Alice, Micky's mother, and they're supported by Amy Adams and Jack McGee among others.All in all a good movie with a good albeit unsurprising ending.7/10",7,1,3,27 May 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," Good solid and a little unusual thriller
","Recap: One terrible and fateful night ten years ago, Clyde was stabbed in is home and made to watch the brutal killings of his wife and young daughter by two burglars. In the following trial, the main perpetrator uses the legal systems to cut a deal with Nick, the hot shot district attorney handling the case, to avoid the death penalty. Clyde is devastated, but powerless to do anything about it. Ten years later it is time for the death penalty for the accomplice to be carried out, but the supposedly calm execution turns into a brutal killing. Soon after that the burglar responsible is murdered in the most gruesome way. There seem to be someone out for vengeance, and Nick can think of only one suspect.Comments: Surprisingly good, even though the two leading actors in Gerard Butler and especially Jamie Foxx do raise some expectations. It is a little out of the ordinary crime thriller with a thick and well written plot, giving it a deep suspense throughout the movie. Even though it is no secret who did what, it still manages to not only keep the suspense, but add another level to it. Just because that we precisely know who, but not how, there are a new element of uncertainty.Foxx and Butler fits well with their characters and give nice performances. They have got good support from (most notably) Colm Meaney, Leslie Bibb and Bruce McGill as well. But a warning should be made. It is a very honest movie with its special effects and do show more of the gruesome details of the killings than other movies. Hence it is quite bloody and might not be for anybody. You got to have the stomach for it, or at least a handy pillow in case you don't.8/10",8,2,3,18 August 2010
The Island," Very underrated
","Recap: Lincoln 6 Echo wakes up, and its another beautiful morning. He puts on the same white clothes as he does every day and goes down to the dining central. After another bland meal he goes to work in the factory putting nutrition in different tubes. They can't go out because outside the world is contaminated, and only on the island can people walk outside and be truly free. But not everyone can go there, you have to win the lottery. And there is one new draw each day. But Lincoln 6 Echo has questions. Why must everybody wear the same clothes, what happens with the tubes at the factory, and is the world really contaminated? And why aren't he allowed to be close with his friend Jordan 2 Delta? Dr. Merrick, head of the plant, is concerned about Lincoln 6 Echo, but leaves him be, for now. But Lincoln 6 Echo finds a bug, and how can that have survived in the outside world. Curious he explores outside of his own sector, and stumbles on a terrific episode. He finds Starkweather, the lottery winner of the day, being cut open and harvested for his organs. And guess who wins the lottery the next day? Jordan 2 Delta.Comments: Supposedly this flopped at the cinemas. I can't imagine why. First of all, the action is high paced, the explosions and special effects spectacular, and abundant. And for once, all the action is complemented by a good and above all consistent story that carries the entire movie. Admittedly, at the beginning, the movie is slow paced and a little confusing at times. But be patient, at least I found answers to all my questions. In fact, I was impressed with the use of foreshadowing and connections within the movie. Overall the directing was really good.As for the cast, I can't believe the supposed failure was blamed on the lead actors. Not famous enough? Anyone with any claim to know anything about the movies should have heard of McGregor and Johansson. Come on, who have missed Star Wars, Trainspotting, Lost in Translation, Girl with the Pearl Earring, Moulin Rouge and so forth? And with a supporting cast like Bean, Buscemi and Hounsou. And add a small part for Clarke Duncan. Trust me, the cast is good.As for the acting, the pairing of McGregor and Johansson was a success. They really fit together, and I wouldn't mind if they teamed up for another movie. And I really enjoyed when McGregor acted against himself. What a play with the dialect, what self distance. Great. And Bean contributed with another 'good' bad guy. And once again Buscemi delivers. And Hounsou, whom I have only seen in small parts like Gladiator before, really carried himself well in a bigger part.So, have I missed anything? Don't think so, can't think of anything right now anyway.",9,0,0,21 November 2005
Semi-Pro," Surprisingly average
","Recap: A one hit wonder artist uses his new found fame to buy the local basket club Tropics in Flint. He takes over as coach, but also as a player. Fortune and public interest fade, but at long last he might be able to fulfill his dream, to bring his team to the NBA. To do that he only has to make his partying ego centered players into a team and bring the audience back. No easy feat.Comments: Another day at the job, that was what it felt like. It's uninspired and mostly pointless. A few bright jokes lift the movie but it has a far way to go to even compare to other Ferrell comedies. Ferrell himself is surprisingly uninspired. He that is a master on comedies like these and able to carry them by himself seem tired and uninterested. He doesn't stand out at all. Instead it is only Woody Harrelson that seem to care, and seem to invest anything in his character. Most other seem to do it by routine only.Saved by a few fragments of bright, actually really funny jokes. Otherwise my rating would have been much lower. But too many other supposedly funny scenes jokes is only pointless and incomplete. Also, in a comedy so dependent on the actors it need much more from them.I think everyone involved can do much better, and this can hopefully be forgotten as a lone mistake.5/10",5,1,1,25 August 2009
