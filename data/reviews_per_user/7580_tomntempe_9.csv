The Lobster," Super Disappointing. Pointless and absurd take on an alternate society
","From the other reviews I expected something fresh, different, clever and insightful. What I got was something different but different but that's all. The movie posits a world organized to promote couples but populated by idiots. By age 40 you must be coupled and apparently it matters not if you had been coupled but no longer are, all that matters is whether you are coupled AT 40. From that follows the setup and setting of the movie, a hotel where you have a month to find your matched partner or else you suffer the penalty.This absurd world is, for some unfathomable reason, tolerated by the inhabitants. Well, there is a reason of sorts I suppose, it's because these are no ordinary inhabitants, no, the inhabitants are a cross between the Stepford descendants and barely functional morons. We are to believe people meekly line up for their 'stay' at the hotel, question almost nothing and if they do escape go on to be just as foolish and meek and stupid in their new environment.The acting is wooden but that is on purpose and in keeping with what apparently was the vision for this movie, a world full of wooden idiots meekly and blindly accepting their fate. Oh how clever..I might accept that premise if it was not taking place in the bigger setting of our current world with cars and well engineered highways, etc, etc. But it is just not believable that a world of people as meek and stupid and compliant and almost utterly lacking in self-awareness would have the smarts to create our current world yet be such moronic idiots by the age of 40. The movie Idiocracy seems far more realistic an alternative world than this waste of almost 2 hours.I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 because it's somewhat more engrossing than Plan 9 From Outer Space.",3,2,3,17 December 2018
Fury," absolute garbage
","I've recently been reading WW2 histories. .. and have watched many documentaries on same. This movie fails on every level, it's not technically actuate, morally accurate, human nature accurate, or historically accurate.It is nothing but a cliche fest. Starting with the opening scene it's just cliche after cliche after cliche. .. delivered with sophomoric dialogue. Others have detailed it's many failings in regard to weaponry and tactics and simple logic. Norman's question to his team when he first arrives says it all... Almost the first thing out o his mouth is... 'Where's the front?' what kind of idiot would write such trite dialog? The whole movie is like that.I won't go farther with this because there are already plenty of other reviews covering the same failings. I did want to get my 1 star rating in just for the record. This movie is a POS.",1,2,3,24 January 2020
The English Patient," A tedious and pretentious mess.
",Perhaps worse than Water for Chocolate. Elaine Benes pegged this dog in the Seinfeld epi.,1,4,11,28 January 2019
Cloverfield," If you've ever seen any other movie you know how this starts, proceeds, and ends
","ALL of this review is spoilers..... I saw this in the TV listings with 3 stars so thought it must be worth watching. What a mistake. There is 20 minutes of tedium at the start that makes you wonder if you are watching the right movie. Twenty minutes of talking about, setting up, going to the going away party for some guy who's just been promoted to VP of some Japanese company. We don't, and never will, have any idea of what he does and there is nothing about his demeanor or personality that suggests he's VP material. He and his friends appear to be only one step removed from their frat house vibe/bar every night vibe. Then the 'monster' appears, sort of. It's never clear where the monster comes from or why, not that it matters to this film. The rest of the film is people doing stupid things like all rushing to the Brooklyn bridge, presumably so they can all be smashed together in one place unable to escape. Apparently the idea that it's better to stay spread out never occurs to anyone. Certainly one wonders why, after the monster has already smashed his way thru your area without killing you, you would then want to go to some other area and give him another chance to stomp you. And of course our 'hero's' have to go into the subway - again, why stay where you can run when you can pre-trap yourself. Then, out of nowhere, little baby monsters show up to attack them in the tunnels. The connection between the big monster and the little ones?? not at all clear. Our hero's trudge on to rescue their friend, who the VP belatedly realized he loved now that he's about to leave for the airport and fly to his new VP job overseas. After rescuing her (from her nearly destroyed building that still manages to have electric) they wind up running into the military who are ready to load them onto helicopters. The rest is a silly blur, most likely several of them died, I really didn't care who did or didn't, there was never any connection to any of the characters established. I can't believe so many people liked this movie. I must be out of step. The only thing making it better then plan 9 from Outer Space was that it's in color and the actors/actresses are prettier.",2,2,2,30 March 2013
Armageddon," inane, hackneyed, predictable, stupid, grossly inaccurate scientifically
","Certainly this is in competition for the world film of all time. Entirely predictable, cartoon characters, grossly distorts anything related to scientific accuracy, could easily be cut by one-third and that would make it better but still horrible but at least the pain would end sooner.I could list all the stupidities, such as shooting a shotgun on a drill rig, or how it would literally be impossible to drill 800 feet WITHOUT any drilling fluid, in a few hours, or how, after 800 feet of drilling there is ZERO material brought up to the surface. Or how the shuttle and the armadillo can take massive impacts and escape essentially intact. To list all the inanities would exceed the allowed 1000 words.Basic plot is as old as the hills. Asteroid heading for earth, reluctant heros sent to destroy it, several crisis averted with mere seconds to spare, all interspersed with insipid dialogue that would surely get you a D- in Screenplay 101.If you want your IQ lowered 20 points buy the DVD.",1,5,11,19 June 2017
Drive," Dull, wooden, illogical
","I see a lot of people liked this movie but I have no idea why. The acting of the two leads is wooden. ALL the problems would have been solved early on by certain people who have no reason to not move to simply move to another state. Then people just beg to be killed by thinking (apparently) that if you are 'tough acting' no one else might think to shoot you and be done with it. I don't mind a bad movie if it's entertaining but this was simply dull for most of the first 60% of it and then silly violence for the rest. I think they were going for 'stylized' but to me it failed, all it was was formula that went nowhere slowly.",3,1,3,31 May 2014
Jurassic World," A 3 is generous. Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid
","Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me. Even if you ignore the stupidity, etc it is SO predictable that there is not a moment of suspense in the whole thing.",3,61,88,11 February 2018
Saw," Pretty good but still requires buying into some illogic
","This is a pretty good movie, it moves along from the beginning and keeps going. Not as gory as I thought it might be but still quite a bit of blood. It suffers from the same illogic of most of these kinds of movies, i.e. when the bad guy is *almost* captured and could be either quickly killed or disabled, they don't shoot him but talk or otherwise allow themselves to be distracted and of course the bad guy regains control. Also, how does the bad guy manage to get access to all these spooky gvt abandoned places AND why is someone still paying the electric bills to keep the lights on in buildings that appear to have been abandoned years earlier? Still, you expect this kind of illogic in a SAW style movie and as long as you can put that aside it's a lot better movie then most of the blood and gore flics that pass for suspense nowdays.",6,0,1,24 April 2005
Arrival," Horrible, turgid, plodding, morose, dull excuse for science fiction
","It's hard to overstate how horribly bad this movie is. There is no reason to like the cardboard characters (or to dislike them). I won't repeat what others who saw thru this pretentious pile have already said but did want to go on record as one more voice to warn people. If you are not easily manipulated, if you don't have a very good grasp of science, and if you don't care if there is any logic to your Sci Fi, than perhaps you will connect with this film.",1,10,18,7 May 2017
