10 Cloverfield Lane," 'People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.'
","I was conflicted as to whether to categorize this film as a psychological horror-thriller or a monster flick (probably more to the former). The film was very much hyped back then (partly due to the viral marketing strategy employed); a long-awaited sequel to its critically-lauded predecessor, <a href='/title/tt1060277/'>Cloverfield (2008)</a>. Instead, we got a remarkable quasi-sequel.WHAT I LIKE: The atmosphere of the film was so intense and suspenseful; it doesn't really have any dull moments. There were twists at every turn; when you think you know it all, you actually don't. It kept you guessing right till the very end; is there really a catastrophic gas attack on the American soil? Or are they just kidnapped by a deranged old man? Or maybe there is more to it than meets the eye.WHAT I DISLIKE: I was geared up for an all-out monster flick, but I was bombarded with a gripping survivalist tale. I was sorely disappointed at first (even though it was a good film) because I felt cheated.",7,0,0,26 April 2020
The Big Lebowski," 'Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.'
","WHAT I LIKE:
I believe everyone has a little bit of The Dude in them; I know I have it. This film is funny without ever trying to be; which is a big contrast to the over-the-top comedies of the '90s like <a href='/title/tt0109686/'>Dumb and Dumber (1994)</a> and <a href='/title/tt0109040/'>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)</a>. The comedic nature of this film is more in-line with films like Bill Murray's classic, <a href='/title/tt0107048/'>Groundhog Day (1993)</a>; with a pinch of stoner element, a dash of crime mystery and a spoonful of subtle political undertones thrown into the mix. On top the that, the visually-stunning representation of a stoner's psychedelic journey and the sharp (witty) dialogues are also worth mentioning. Most of the actors and actresses in this film are acting heavyweights; so you don't have to worry about bad acting. Strong performances overall; especially by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.WHAT I DISLIKE:
I am not going to lie; this film does lack a little in the plot department; which was redeemed by the quirky humours and the strong performances by the cast. This film is meant to be a quirky, idiosyncratic comedy; instead of a highly-analytical crime thriller that many had hoped for. This film is laid with a complex theme; deceit ciminality and death; which were swiftly diffused by the situational comedies. How could you cry for someone when the next thing after his/her death was his/her ashes flying right onto your face?",8,0,0,27 April 2020

Well, IT IS, you silly.Made by the talented <a href='/name/nm0942367/'>Edgar Wright</a>, this film is:
✔ tastefully bloody (the kills were tastefully done)
✔ hysterically funny (the British humour & the gags)
✔ witty and quotable (well-written dialogues)Encompassing all of the aforementioned criteria above, this film became a funny and memorable masterpiece; depicting the reactions of the common people to the early days of a zombie apocalypse.When are you gonna make a sequel to this, Mr. <a href='/name/nm0942367/'>Edgar Wright</a>? I am a sucker for sequels when it comes to good film (even though I know that most sequels were disappointing).P. S. this film is a part of the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (<a href='/title/tt0365748/'>Shaun of the Dead (2004)</a>, <a href='/title/tt0425112/'>Hot Fuzz (2007)</a> and <a href='/title/tt1213663/'>The World's End (2013)</a>).",8,1,2,29 March 2020
Hot Fuzz," 'Nothin' like a bit of girl-on-girl!'
","Another British classic by the Big Four; <a href='/name/nm0942367/'>Edgar Wright</a>, <a href='/name/nm0661912/'>Nira Park</a>, <a href='/name/nm0670408/'>Simon Pegg</a>, and <a href='/name/nm0296545/'>Nick Frost</a>.Instead of bashing heads and chugging beers at the Winchester, <a href='/name/nm0670408/'>Simon Pegg</a> and <a href='/name/nm0296545/'>Nick Frost</a> are shooting up elders this time around in this hilarious buddy cop comedy.If you are an adrenaline junkie (or just an action movie buff like me), this film will definitely click with you.

It is dramatic but at the same time, I doesn't take itself too seriously. Man, all I can say is that you are in for a thrill ride.P.
