Skyfall," One of the best of Bond in last 10 years
","Craig Daniel has dropped the larger than life image of Bond. This is amply clear in this movie at least. Gadgetry used is also not making him a superhuman. I find this better than those movies where machines used to work more than the human 007. Movie also takes into account the new development of world - the digital dimension of warfare ! And the good part is - suddenly Bond does not become a network's wizard. there's another guy to help him out here. I am expecting the next Bond-movie to have more on this stuff. But Overall, a very good movie. For Indian viewers - you may find it much like a Hindi movie plot albeit very well made.",8,13,26,15 February 2013
Argo," A movie well made.
","'Argo, F*** Yourself' - Best fake movie ! Argo may have won the Oscar for Best Picture but not now when 'Lincoln' and 'Zero Dark Thirty' are also in race. 'Lincoln' will be get it, no speck of doubt in that ! Curious thing is that Argo is a hit in Iran, even though critics there might have said it show Iran in poor light. Movie stops short of mentioning how the hostage crisis finally ended in 1980. US military operation was humiliatingly defeated in Iran and later had to negotiate to get the diplomatic staff released. It secured a chance to get into the Oscar race at least by not telling this to the public.",9,0,1,31 January 2013
Life of Pi," Must watch for believers and the non-believers !
",I'd say the movie is a must for both the atheists and the God-fearing beings. It gets cleared out in the beginning itself Society today has lost and confused the meaning and the spirit of God. Movie try to make sense of out of His spirit. One of the dialogs in the end changes one's all entire outlook towards Him. Its not a thriller movie but still I'd say its the core of this movie. Movie has some of the best visual special effects I have experienced since Avatar in 3D - especially the beginning and his imaginations in between. I'd suggest watching it in 3D only as 2D might just take away all the fun form it. Acting of Pi is very good. The movie deserves an Oscar from next year's academy. Excellent watch !,10,6,12,5 December 2012
