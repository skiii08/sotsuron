Lucky Number Slevin," Wrong actor selection
","Both bad bosses are quite far away real bad guys. So the movie becomes not realistic. Even the movie starts with a nonsense killing story. The reason killing those people and the child is just stupid. Bad start, mediocre continues but ends logically. Since the director only could manage the ending pretty well, movie becomes acceptable.",5,0,1,7 March 2020
