Black Swan," Good but repetitive and predictable
","The movie has an OK cast but nothing special. The story is short, predictable and repetitive. The director has tried to steal a lot of 'tricks' from triller/horror style movies without luck.Don't get me wrong it's interesting to see but there is so many better movies than this. Sitting down expecting 'Oscar material' and getting this was disappointing.The actors all preform well together and they could not have done a better job. The visual effects where good and the sound flawless, so the problem lies with the director and the writers.The issue I finally decided on was simply the fact that we have seen this all before and could have expected so much more.",4,2,4,18 March 2011
2012," Why?
",This director went from the great movie 'The Patriot' to the EPIC FAIL 'the day after tomorrow' this movie reached a new low in movie history. When I thought that he couldn't reach any lower he made '2012'.2012 starts with a couple of meaningless clips of people that have NOTHING to do with the movie. It's like if you are in a really serious argument with a friend and he suddenly starts talking about the weather or asks if you want pizza. From such an experienced director this is PATHETIC!Now for the actors:Woody Harrelson was the ONLY actor that actually did a good job. He played his part well as a crazy person.John Cusack was as usual mediocre - nothing more nothing less and of course now for the badmouthing:Chiwetel Ejiofor: Why do you always have to be the good guy with all the female feelings and sh*t?! You act like a science student!During one scene in this movie there is a moment of 'deep conversation' but nice try you only make people sleep.,1,5,8,4 December 2009
