The Blair Witch Project," boring
","I kept waiting for the scary parts of the movie to occur. It was a good trick to make the actors and actress scared and they did look scared.  I also appreciated the paranoia which gripped the 'film students'.  However, those were the best two parts of the movie.  I'm sure I would have been terrified if was in their shoes.  However, the movie didn't really take me there and I was never at all frightened.  I found it about as frightening as H20. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing really ever did.",5,1,3,17 July 1999
