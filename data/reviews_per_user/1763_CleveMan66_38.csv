Insidious: Chapter 2," 'Insidious Chapter 2' is as good as the original.
","It is said that the Plains Indians used every part of the buffalo that they hunted. In much the same way, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' (PG-13, 1:45) uses everything at its disposal - and does so VERY effectively.The follow-up to the equally good 2010 'Insidious' takes the Lambert family's story forward from about where the original left off. Unfortunately, there's very little I can tell you about the plot without spoiling the fun. Suffice it to say that it's not all that easy to enter the spirit world and return without being changed by the experience. I can't even tell you everyone who's in this movie without spoiling something. What I can tell you is that Patrick Wilson is back as the dad, Rose Byrne as his wife and Barbara Hershey as his mother. Oh, and James Wan is back as director and Leigh Whannell as writer.As we watch the film unfold and start to worry more and more about the effect that dad's journey in the last movie had on him.... not much happens, but Wan keeps us engaged with low-tech, old-school scares designed to make you jump in your seat. When things do start happening, the plot seems to be heading in several different directions at the same time, but then something amazing happens. The film weaves together every character, every plot point and even the most minor details so tightly that it would put an Egyptian sheet manufacturer to shame... but would make the Native American buffalo hunters very proud. (Please excuse my mixed metaphors. I couldn't decide which one to use, so I used them both.) 'Insidious: Chapter 2' does contain some shaky acting, but the film is one of the best constructed and most entertaining horror movies I've seen in a long time. 'A-'",8,1,2,17 August 2015
Child 44," 'Child 44' is a grim but fascinating police procedural that peaks behind the Iron Curtain into the paranoia and dysfunction of the U.S.S.R. under Stalin.
","Sometimes it's tough to stand on the side of right. That's especially true when all those around you are more interested in perception than reality. And I don't just mean your family and your friends or your social circle. I'm talking about fighting against the abuses of power, corruption and cover-ups of an entire society. That's what Moscow-based secret police (MGB) agent Leo Demidov faces in the Soviet Union of the 1950s in British writer Tom Rob Smith's trilogy. The first book in that trilogy lends its title to the film 'Child 44' (R, 1:37) and focuses on the real-life crimes of a Russian named Andrei Chikatilo.Demidov is played by underrated British actor Tom Hardy. Hardy's character is a tough, but good man who wants to do what's right, but runs into a brick wall every time he tries. He's a cop in Stalin's U.S.S.R., a government that whisks away any citizen who expresses a point of view contrary to that of the authorities and holds fast to its denial of the existence of crime in their communist utopia. When the young son of fellow agent Alexi (Fares Fares) is murdered, Demidov is reminded that, according to Stalin, 'murder is a capitalist disease.' Or, as Vasili (Joel Kinnaman), Demidov's bitter rival within their secret police unit says, 'There is no crime in paradise.' As Alexi's friend and superior, Demidov is assigned to present the police report to the family. 'Railway accident' is listed as the cause of death. Everyone, including Demidov, knows that this is a lie, but when the family argues with him about the official version of events all he can do is half-heartedly insist that they read the report. He pulls aside Alexi to tell him repeatedly that his son was not murdered. You can see how difficult it is for this talented investigator to deny his friend any hope of justice, but it's for Alexi's own good. Demidov knows that pursuing the matter any further would mean the end of both of their careers, or worse.Demidov soon gets to experience an example of that 'worse' for himself. When he finally takes an unyielding stand and refuses to toe the party line on another issue, he is demoted, and he and his wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace), are basically exiled to a small town that is even bleaker than Moscow was for them. When Demidov is helping investigate the murder of another young boy, he encourages his new supervisor, General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), to investigate further. Nesterov soon discovers that there have been a total of 43 similar murders in the region. '44,' Demidov corrects him. 'My friend's son was murdered too.' Nesterov does what he can within the confines of the Soviet legal system, while Demidov and his wife go well outside normal procedures in an effort to catch the killer. Vasili gets wind of what the Demidovs are up to and tries to use this to get his former boss out of the way for good.'Child 44' is grim, but effective. The story is a disturbing but fascinating peek into life in the U.S.S.R. late in the Stalinist era. We get a look at the state of schools, orphanages, mental hospitals and even the treatment of homosexuals, but this film is mainly about the paranoia of a broken system which victimized its own people and allowed many criminals to go unpunished. The script is strong, but the acting is even stronger. Hardy plays Demidov as a confident and dedicated public servant who is barely holding the cork in the bottle of his righteous anger. Rapace comes off as proud and strong, but with a barely concealed vulnerability just beneath the surface. Oldman has been (and remains) one of the most talented actors of his generation and, anyone who remembers him as the terrorist leader in 'Air Force One' (1997) can attest that the man knows his way around a Russian accent. Basically, this is the kind of movie you want to see if you're in the mood for a serious crime thriller which has the courage to approach the sub-genre of police procedural from a little-understood place in a nearly forgotten time.

World War Z," 'World War Z' is 'The Walking Dead' on a global scale - and even more frightening!
","An ordinary day in Philadelphia becomes a horrifying fight for survival in a matter of minutes.okay, maybe that's not too unusual, but in a matter of days, people are confined to a few islands of humanity where the walls seem to be closing in and no one is really safe. 'World War Z' is truly frightening.It all starts with the best shot, best edited most heart-pounding opening credits I've ever seen (yes, I said opening credits) and it just builds in intensity from there. Zombies have been scaring movie audiences for decades, and, more recently, TV audiences as well, but never like this. This film is like an episode of 'The Walking Dead' on crack. These zombies move much faster than most of the zombies you've seen on TV or in the movies and they work together in ways that make you believe that mankind is indeed doomed. Still, the movie balances the action and sense of dread with a humanity that is lacking in many zombie tales. As in most zombie stories, a bite from a zombie quickly turns a healthy human into one of the undead, and a shot or severe blow to the head is the only way to really stop them, but as lethal as these zombies are, they have a weakness.'World War Z' star Brad Pitt, in a subtle, but intense performance, plays a former United Nations employee and man-of-many talents who is brought back into the fold to help figure out how this whole thing started. Pitt's character is smart, resourceful and absolutely determined to do anything he can to save the world, but mainly as a way to save his own family who waits for his return on a ship at sea. He embarks on a perilous around-the-world trek following clues and putting himself at greater and greater risk to prevent the apparently imminent extinction of the human race.The movie comes to an end, but the story's ending isn't so neat. That's not a criticism. It's an example of what this film does very well – make the audience feel that if there were a zombie apocalypse, this is really what it might be like. One man living through and accomplishing everything that Pitt's character survives and does in this film makes him come off a little too much like a superhero, but it sure is thrilling to be along for the ride. I give 'World War Z' an 'A-'.",8,1,6,24 February 2015
Little Boy," 'Little Boy' features a big story and even bigger issues.
","Depicting faith as a major part of a film's plot is a tricky thing, as the many-faceted movie 'Little Boy' (PG-13, 1:40) does. Children will almost always believe what authority figures tell them, whether right or wrong. After all, the vast majority of people all over the world are raised, live and die following the religion of those closest to them. It isn't hard to get a young person to believe, or to have, as the Bible calls it, 'the faith of a child.' This movie shows adults giving one child mixed signals about the importance and effectiveness of believing, but he goes with what a priest tells him. The priest seems to have trouble explaining the boy's confusion between a church sermon claiming that 'nothing is impossible' for someone with faith 'as small as a mustard seed' and the priest's statement that prayer changes things 'only if God wills it,' yet, the boy believes his faith can do anything. That's the common thread running through this movie, but this is a wonderful story that's about a lot more than one theme.The title character is a small 8-year-old boy named Pepper (Jakob Salvati), but others call him 'midget', 'runt', etc. because of his small stature. Eventually, the people of the (fictional) coastal town of O'Hare, California settle on the nickname 'Little Boy', but Pepper has bigger problems than people picking on him and bullying him. His beloved father, James (Michael Rapaport), with whom Pepper has many imaginary adventures, has to go on a real-life adventure overseas to help fight World War II. Pepper's very upset that he can't join his 'one and only partner' on this adventure, but the little boy has his loving mother, Emma (Emily Watson) and his caring, but hot-headed older brother, London (David Henrie), to look after him. Meanwhile, James finds himself fighting the Japanese in the Philippines.Pepper grows obsessed with doing what he can to get his father back. After being called on stage at a magic show during which he 'makes' a bottle move across a table, and then hearing a church sermon about faith accomplishing the impossible, he becomes convinced that he can basically will his father home. The local priest (Tom Wilkinson) tells Pepper that he can increase his faith by completing a list of good deeds which includes biblical admonitions to 'feed the hungry', 'shelter the homeless', 'visit the sick', etc. And the priest adds 'Befriend Hashimoto' to the list. Like Pepper, who is ostracized because of his height, Mr. Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) is also 'burdened' with a physical characteristic that he cannot change. Hashimoto is treated very harshly by almost all the town's people because of his Japanese heritage.Pepper follows the priest's instructions and Hashimoto helps Pepper complete his list, but asks the priest what will happen if 'your imaginary friend in the sky' doesn't come through and Pepper's dad dies. As the main characters wrestle with whether to encourage Pepper's faith, discourage it or temper it, we occasionally get glimpses of what James is dealing with during the war and we hope almost as strongly as Pepper does that James gets home safely. The resolution to that situation is very dramatic. (Sorry, but we're talking about military missions here. If I told you more, I'd have to kill you. Or you'd kill me for revealing a major plot point in this movie.) 'Little Boy' is anything but a little story. Salvati, for example, is one huge talent, especially for his age. The script's ruminations on faith show both sides of the issue fairly (giving believers, non-believers and those in between all something to relate to), but also seem to be delivering mixed messages. This film's executive producers include Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, who also produced 'The Bible' (the mini-series, not the book). If their objective was to show faith as real, then why show so much of what Pepper accomplishes as having naturalistic explanations? Then, of course, there's the backdrop for this story which is World War II – one of the biggest stories in the history of mankind. (Besides being Pepper's nickname, the film's title refers to the codename of the atomic bomb that the U.S. dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, an event which led to the end of World War II in the Pacific Theater.) The movie's messages about faith may seem simplistic to some, but the film's depiction of war is realistic in its danger and complexity. And whether you find the portrayal of faith issues to be oversimplified and inconsistent, or right on the mark, the movie deserves credit for making such an important conversation a major part of a feature film – and making us care so much about what it all means to one very special little boy.

Fast & Furious 6," 'Fast & Furious 6' is a crowd-pleaser which will leave the crowd anxious for more.
","'Fast and Furious 6' is everything fans of the franchise have come to expect and should probably please most fans of action movies, regardless of whether they've ever driven fast or been furious before. I admit that I came late to this party. The older I get, the less interested I am in movies that seem to exist just to blow things up (which is why I can't stand the 'Transformers' films), but the previous 'Fast and Furious' movie looked so good, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. It was a lot of fun - and so is the most recent sequel.In this latest entry in the series, the gang is talked into trying to bring down another gang out to steal a highly sensitive computer chip. They're also trying to rescue a character who supposedly died earlier in the series. As the stakes between the dueling gangs of drivers rise, so does the adrenalin. The action and the stunts are bigger and more spectacular than in the previous film, which is no small accomplishment. Of course, in this series, you have to keep pushing the 'I believe' button, but if your button is still functional by the end of the film, you will have had a great time. You'll also be looking forward to the next installment. The last scene in this film feels like the first scene from the next one was slipped into the credits by accident - and the apparent villain in that scene is one most action movie fans will recognize and be anxious to see join this increasingly popular franchise. I give 'Fast and Furious 6' a 'B+' with the possibility of an even higher grade for the next one, based on the last scene of this one.",7,0,3,24 February 2015
Black Mass," 'Black Mass' is massively disappointing.
","It's a story that was begging to be filmed. James 'Whitey' Bulger gains control of organized crime in South Boston and, with the help of corrupt law enforcement officials, expands his criminal empire to include the whole city. He gets rich through racketeering, extortion and drug trafficking and enforces his will through violence. Meanwhile, his younger brother is a rising star in Massachusetts politics and becomes President of the State Senate. When Whitey learns that law enforcement is closing in on him, he disappears. Bulger rises to number two on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list (behind only Osama Bin Laden) but remains a fugitive for 16 years until he's arrested. Yes, It's a story tailor-made for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the Hollywood treatment is exactly what Bulger's story gets in 'Black Mass' (R, 2:02).Johnny Depp stars as Whitey Bulger and the film focuses on the middle portion of his life, his rise and fall as a Boston crime boss. In the mid-1970s, Bulger was on the rise but his criminal activities were confined to the South Boston neighborhood where he grew up. When his childhood friend, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), suggests an alliance that can help both of their careers, Bulger agrees. Whitey will supply information about his rivals in the Italian mafia, while the FBI uses that information to bring down the Italians, but ignores Bulger. That arrangement does benefit both parties. The local FBI cripples the Patriarca crime family and Connolly gets promoted. Bulger becomes the undisputed crime lord of Boston and ignores the FBI's demands that he refrain from committing serious crimes. As Bulger's criminal activities increase, the FBI realizes they're in too deep with Whitey to even try stopping him.There are many problems with this movie, starting with the casting. In a film whose main characters are male, the female cast members do most of the best work. Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's long-time girlfriend) and Julianne Nicholson (as John Connolly's wife) give especially strong performances. Among the males, Edgerton, and Corey Stoll (as Connolly's supervisor) do their usual exceptional work, while the actors playing Bulger's cohorts (Rory Cochrane, W. Earl Brown, Jesse Plemons and Peter Sarsgaard) are no more than serviceable, and consistently outstanding actors like Kevin Bacon (as the director of the FBI's Boston filed office), Adam Scott (as an FBI agent) and Benedict Cumberbatch (as Whitey's politician brother) are simply miscast. The same can be said for Johnny Depp. He gives a convincing performance, but the make-up used on him is distracting and it feels like a lot of time and effort went into making Depp look, sound and act like Ray Liotta in 'Goodfellas' and that's not the only distracting part of this movie – or the only connection with 'Goodfellas'. As in that 1990 classic, gangsters are depicted as respected in their neighborhoods/families and there are scenes in which people are talked to very calmly right before they're killed (including one such scene in an otherwise empty room) and there's even a scene in which a dangerous criminal frightens someone by threatening him as a joke, a la Joe Pesci's character in Martin Scorsese's film. The original aspects of this film's characterization of gangsters aren't very compelling either. The opening scene, designed to show Whitey's menacing personality, has him complaining about one of his friends licking his fingers and putting them back in a bowl of bar nuts. Seriously? Is this a gangster movie or an episode of 'Seinfeld'? Worst of all is the script's liberal use of dramatic license. Several of the movie's characters, plot points, and major facts are different from what happened and how it happened, while other important details are left out. It's unnecessary and counterproductive to change so much of a true story that so many people know so well. It also would have been nice if the script related the movie's title to the story in some way, shape or form. This movie is based on a fascinating and many-faceted true story and, overall, the film tells a fairly interesting tale, but the devil is in the details and this version of the story of the FBI's deal with Boston's devil is disappointing.

Pacific Rim," 'Pacific Rim' is exactly what it's supposed to be - eye-popping, action-packed Sci-Fi fun!
","Some movies stand absolutely no chance of winning a Best Picture Oscar but that's okay. Movies don't have to be a showcase for brilliant actors, touch your heart or change the world in order to be worthwhile. Isn't 'to be entertained' the simple reason that we go to the movies in the first place? Of course, I'm often entertained by movies that do one or more of the things that I just listed, but sometimes a movie is entertaining just because it's FUN. And 'Pacific Rim' (PG-13, 2:05) is a lot of fun! In this movie, enormous, ugly, ill-tempered sea creatures (called Kaiju) periodically emerge from the Pacific Ocean, come ashore and wreak havoc on populated areas of countries that border the world's largest body of water. The only thing that humans have found to fight these extremely unpleasant monsters with any degree of success are giant robots (called Jaegers) operated by two people inside the robot's head. These two 'pilots' make the Jaeger's arms and legs move by moving their own arms and legs, oh, and sharing their thoughts and synchronizing their actions through some sort of high tech mind meld. Sound dumb? It is. And delightfully so! As quirky characters mix with serious warriors who are all trying to stem the increasing tide of unwanted visitors emerging from the deep, they forge bonds, solve problems and get to the bottom of why all this is happening and how to stop it. The basic story, the relationships between the characters, and the way they deal with problems aren't terribly original (borrowing from any number of movies, to include 'Transformers', 'Godzilla', 'Starship Troopers', 'Avatar', 'Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Top Gun' and even 'Inception'), but it's still very enjoyable to watch. Here's one example: When the leader of the pilots gets up on a vehicle and makes a rousing speech that ends with the line 'Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!', you'll probably think of Bill Pullman's big moment before the climactic battle in 'Independence Day', but it won't bother you.One reason I liked this movie so much is the actors – especially Idris Elba ('Prometheus', 'Luther', 'The Big C') as Stacker Pentecost (!), the man in charge of the Jaeger program (or whatever they call it – it really doesn't matter), Charlie Day ('Horrible Bosses', 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia') as an over-caffeinated scientist who just might be able to figure out the answer to how to save the world, and Ron Perlman (the 'Hellboy' movies, 'Sons of Anarchy') as a mysterious man who is able to help Day's character – and who wears the coolest shoes ever captured on film. Also appealing are Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi as the very different, but very well-matched heroes who pilot the oldest Jaeger in the inventory at a critical moment in the effort to rid the world of the Kaiju once and for all.The main thing this movie has going for it is the visual effects. Just about every frame of this movie explodes with color – more than in any live-action movie I can remember seeing – and the 3-D makes that color seem to go on forever. The sound effects are pretty amazing too. I'd give the film Oscars in several of the technical categories. But don't worry about how many awards 'Pacific Rim' did or didn't win – just see it, if possible, while wearing those plastic glasses with the special lenses! For not having any higher goal than giving people a good time watching a movie (and delivering) and for its stunning audio and visual effects, I give 'Pacific Rim' an 'A'!",9,0,6,20 May 2015
Southpaw," 'Southpaw' is fomulaic, but still packs a wallop.
","There's a moment every year when I see a film that signals to me that the Oscar race has begun. This is that moment and 'Southpaw' (R, 2:03) is the film. Film studios and distributors regularly schedule their most prestigious releases for the last half of the year, so they will be fresher in the minds of members of various awards-sponsoring organizations when it comes time to nominate films for various accolades – and then reward them for excellence early in the new year. Those films that are perceived as the strongest award contenders are often held until the fall, or even the beginning of winter, but the flow of Oscar-bait has to start somewhere. I feel that this film is the first heavy hitter in the ring for 2015.To garner year-end awards consideration, your film and/or its actors have to be especially good (obviously) – and it helps if your film has a good pedigree. This film is being distributed by the experienced Oscar-campaigning and Oscar-winning The Weinstein Company and was scored by the late multiple Oscar-winner James Horner. Director, Antoine Fuqua helped Denzel Washington to his Best Actor Oscar for 'Training Day' (2001). This film's supporting cast includes Forest Whitaker, who won the Best Actor award at SAG, the Golden Globes and the Oscars for 'The Last King of Scotland' (2003). The star of 'Southpaw' is Jake Gyllenhaal, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005) and nominated for a Golden Globe (and many thought should have gotten an Oscar nomination) for Best Actor for his transformative performance in 2014's 'Nightcrawler'. Well, chalk up another transformative performance for Gyllenhaal, as the title character in 'Southpaw', for which he'll almost certainly draw significant attention in the upcoming awards season. And he may not be the only one.Gyllenhaal gives what may be his most committed and most intense performance to date as Billy Hope, a light heavyweight champion boxer who gets too easily stuck in negative and harmful patterns. In the ring, his style is to allow himself to get savagely beaten in order to awaken the monster inside, a monster which, when unleashed on his opponent, always wins Billy the fight. And his manager (Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson) is always on hand to cheer him on and ask for more. Billy's beautiful wife (the excellent Rachel McAdams) supports him, but also worries about him and asks him to retire before it's too late for them to enjoy their lives with each other and with their daughter (an impressive Oona Laurence). In spite of his wife's pleadings, Billy's ways of dealing with things eventually cost his family dearly and Billy risks losing everything when his anger leads to increased drinking, drug use and other self-destructive behaviors.When Billy hits his 'rock bottom', the only other person who seems able to help him is former boxer, former trainer and current gym owner and supporter of at-risk youth Titus 'Tick' Wills (Forest Whitaker, in possibly his finest performance since his Oscar win, and maybe his best ever). Billy finally sees for himself that if he is going to regain what he's lost, he has to change, and he eventually returns to boxing as a way to do that. As long as the odds are against him rebuilding his life, he comes to believe that he can do it. Even his name implies what eventually comes out of him (Billy Hope as in, William Hope as in, Will Hope). As with all boxing movies, the hard work that's required to be great and stay great (and maybe to become great again) is symbolic of the boxer's struggle to be the best person he can be. If Billy is able to get back into the ring, he will face a hungry young fighter (Miguel Gomez) who will do just about anything to win the title, but Billy's toughest opponent will always be himself.'Southpaw' is formulaic, but still packs a wallop. Fans of boxing movies (especially the 'Rocky' movies) will recognize the basic story structure: A champion boxer fights through all manner of pain and injury to become and remain the champ. His loved ones worry about him. He considers retirement, but an up-and-coming fighter insists on his shot at the title, goading the champ in public and even insulting the champ's wife to get him to agree to a fight. The champ has to convince a reluctant old man to train him, but then resists the trainer's way of doing things. There is a training montage, and then a climactic fight. You've probably seen it before, but never quite like this. The only thing that these performances lack is a weak link, and the film itself is as real, rough and raw as you could ask for.

Ant-Man," 'Ant-Man' doesn't stand very tall compared to other Marvel superhero movies.
","Any movie adaptation intended to reach and entertain a wide audience, especially a movie adapted form a comic book series, needs to be able to stand on its own merits, and 'Ant-Man' (PG-13, 1:57) does that. Still, a little background and perspective wouldn't hurt and that's what the first part of my reviews are for, so let's see if I can give you a little context for this movie before I set up its story.The 'Ant-Man' character first appeared in a January 1962 comic and was one of the five original 'Avengers', but is only the fourth of them to get a solo film. (We've been watching Hulk, Iron Man and Thor movies for years and 2015 brings Ant-Man to the big screen, but there's no movie being planned for the character known as the Wasp.) 'Ant-Man' is the sixth and final film in Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with a new Captain America movie kicking off Phase Three in May 2016. 'Ant-Man' ties in with the MCU, but is meant to be more of a stand-alone film.Wow. That only barely scratched the surface, but it's now time to talk more specifically about this film.In the comics and in the film, Ant-Man is not about one person, but a series of people who wear the costume. Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, the first Ant-Man, and the inventor of the so-called Pym Particle, which allows the wearer of his suit to shrink to the size of an insect by shrinking the space between molecules and using the resulting density to possess a strength very much out of proportion to his size. We see Pym resign from the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that their scientists are trying to replicate and militarize his formula, which he has come to believe presents more danger than benefit.About 25 years later, Pym's protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), working with Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), is about to successfully recreate Pym's formula and Pym feels that he knows just the guy to help him prevent this. Pym tricks a very talented convicted burglar named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) into trying out the Ant-Man suit and convinces Lang to become the Ant-Man and help permanently derail Cross' plans. Pym explains that Lang's efforts will help him see more of his young daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson), whose mother (Judy Greer) and new husband (Bobby Cannavale) don't want him around until he gets back on his feet and becomes a more trustworthy father.Lang soon finds out that being effective as the Ant-Man involves a lot more than just donning a special suit, pressing a button and becoming really, really small. He has to learn to fight better than he had to in prison, he has to learn how to fully harness the power of the suit and he has to learn how to communicate with different kinds of ants, which he can then use to help him get around and accomplish certain tasks. All this requires a lot of training and practice, as well as a little help from Lang's shady friends (played by Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and T.I.) And, of course, someone as greedy, power-hungry and unscrupulous as Darren Cross isn't going to take all this lying down. It's safe to assume that he has a few tricks up his well-tailored sleeves.I can't say much more without giving away significant plot points, but I do want to offer a few points of interest which may seem random, but which at least MCU fans will appreciate. The first scene includes characters that have appeared in other MCU films, with both aging make-up and CGI de-aging of various actors for the sake of continuity. One of the Avengers makes what you might call a guest appearance in the middle of the movie and again late in the movie. Don't stress yourself out throughout the movie looking for the traditional MCU Stan Lee cameo because it comes very late in the film. Lastly, there are two short additional scenes, one mid-credits and one post-credits, which set up possible future story lines for the characters in this movie.'Ant-Man' is different from other MCU movies, but not for the better. The CGI during the shrinking scenes is very good, but not the best that MCU has shown us in the other films and, because of the nature of the story, there's less of a need for the more spectacular visual effects to which MCU fans have become accustomed. This allows more focus on the story and character development, but the lackluster script still fails to create adequate tension or make us care much for the characters. 'Ant-Man' gets points for originality and good pacing, but is relatively unimpressive. 'B-'",5,19,53,18 July 2015
The Italian Job," 'The Italian Job' is a remake which pays homage to the original, but creates an enviable legacy of its own.
","The faithfulness of re-made films to their original material run the gamut from shot-for-shot remakes, like 1998's 'Psycho' (starring then little-known Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche), all the way to movies that bear almost no resemblance to the original except for the title and basic concept, like 2013's 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' (Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Sean Penn). 2003's 'The Italian Job' is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. This movie is a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine vehicle of the same name, and known as one of Britain's most popular films. The 2003 version is, according to director F. Gary Gray, 'an homage' that is 'inspired by the original'. The remake changes the location of the story's main caper, but keeps the focus on stealing gold bullion. The homage aspect of the remake can be seen in the names of some of the characters (even though their roles in the plot are different), the part of the plan that involves carefully controlling the escape route, the prominent use of the Mini Coopers, an escape through a small tunnel and a dramatic scene in which a vehicle is perched precariously over a large drop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.2003's 'The Italian Job' begins with a creative and daring heist of $35 million worth of gold bullion in Venice, Italy. The gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg, in the Michael Caine role), Steve (Edward Norton), 'Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham), 'Napster' (Seth Green), 'Left Ear' (Mos Def) and the group's senior member (pulling his final job), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After cleverly making off with the gold, the crew is celebrating on a mountain road in the Alps (also a setting from the original film), when John praises Charlie (the group's new leader) for planning the perfect robbery and pulling it off 'without even holding a gun.' Unfortunately, the group doesn't get much farther than that. One of their own turns on them, leaves them all for dead and makes off with the gold.The story now jumps ahead one year. The original group's traitor is living large in his L.A. mansion, while those he thought were dead are planning to steal back what remains of the gold bars. John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), an expert safecracker like her father, joins the gang. They also take on a mechanic named Wrench (Franky G), who the group needs to customize those Mini Coopers that are essential to the plan – and so prominent in the story that Gray referred to them as 'part of the cast.' After dealing with some unexpected challenges and having to completely change their plan, Charlie and his crew go after the gold in a climax that is even more inventive and exciting than the original robbery in Venice.'The Italian Job' is exactly what a movie like this should be – a whole lot of fun! Every cast member is fun and interesting to watch and they have great chemistry between them. The story contains some clichés, but you won't care. The screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers has some very funny moments amidst all the scheming and double-crossing. Gray balances it all perfectly, makes the whole thing entertaining and what comes out is a 'Job' definitely worth having.",8,1,5,16 February 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' keeps the franchise fresh and fun.
","'Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny.' It's a great line – and it aptly sums up the central character in the 'Mission: Impossible' films. Spoken by one of Hunt's frenemies in 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' (PG-13, 2:11), the line makes the point that Hunt is smart, skilled, determined and, yes, lucky enough that anything he determines will, one way or another, come to pass. It's true. And it's a good thing that he's on our side kind of. The 'sides' are often hard to define in the murky world of international intrigue. It's a world in which Hunt thrives. He and his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) work in the shadows, where only the world's most dangerous people and our government's most knowledgeable people can shine a light. But even then This film features the IMF's most challenging mission yet (some would even say 'impossible') – fighting government bureaucracy. The story opens with the already famous scene of Hunt (Tom Cruise) absolutely refusing to let a plane full of nerve gas take off without him. His most recent cohorts in this fantastic film franchise, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) use their digital expertise to remotely open the plane's door before it's too late for Ethan. Meanwhile, the fourth Beatle, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), is clashing with CIA chief Alan Hunley (Adam Baldwin) before a highly secretive congressional committee meeting that is meant to decide the fate of the controversial IMF.Hunt finds out that the IMF has been dissolved just as he is pursuing what is possibly the IMF's most dangerous opponent to date. 'The Syndicate' (an organization which first appeared in the 1960s' TV series on which the movies are based) is a clandestine organization of former international spies who are out to wreak havoc and remake the world as they see fit. The problem is that even Hunley dismisses claims that this organization actually exists. He has ordered Hunt brought in, and is leaning on Brandt and Benji to help him, just as Hunt is reaching out to his old IMF buddies for help pursuing the Syndicate. Guess who Benji, Brandt (and Luther) end up helping.Hunt also has a new helper maybe. When this film's 'big bad', Syndicate honcho Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), captures Hunt, a mystery woman named Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape. But why? Hunt doesn't know and neither do we. Even the most espionage-savvy moviegoer will probably go back and forth throughout the film regarding who Isla is working for and what her true motives are. And while you're trying to figure that out, the organization non grata IMF will be crashing cars, racing motorcycles, kicking ass, taking names and operating in dangerous underwater environments in overseas locales such as Morocco, Vienna and London. As the members of the now defunct IMF go rogue and end up proving their unique importance, the rogue nation known as the Syndicate is also fighting for its existence – and to greatly expand its nefarious worldwide influence.'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' manages to keep things fresh and fun, even after four films and 19 years. The action is top-drawer (as the British agents in the story might say), from its fight and chase scenes to its seemingly impossible situations and (especially) that opening sequence in which Cruise, without use of a stunt double, actually hangs off the side of an actual plane that is actually taking off. (Wow!) Christopher McQuarrie's script and directing keep things moving, allowing us only a few brief quiet moments and a handful of funny moments to give us a break from the adrenaline pumping through our bodies for most of the film.The plot and the actors keep us guessing about their characters' motivations and plans. Even the inevitable moment when one agent peels off a mask comes as surprise. I wish the nature and desires of the Syndicate were explained a little better, but its ominous shadow is thrillingly omnipresent and Harris makes one truly menacing villain. This installment of the franchise is every bit as good as the previous one and number six is already in development. In the meantime, 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' gets an 'A'.",9,3,7,31 July 2015
Inside Out," 'Inside Out' is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative, but unremarkable in some areas.
","The mind is a complicated, confusing, contradictory place. But it's also a unique mix of emotions, memories and thoughts which make each of us who we are. Wouldn't it be interesting to actually see how all that stuff between our ears works? Interesting, but also helpful and even cathartic. And, potentially, a lot of fun too. Those are the ideas behind the animated comedy-drama 'Inside Out' (PG, 1:34) from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures.Riley Anderson is a human being (well, an animated version of one anyway). More specifically, she's an 11-year-old girl, but that's almost beside the point. Her gender and her age have a lot to do with how her emotions cause her to think, feel and behave, but the movie makes the point that the way her mind actually works is driven by the humanity that she shares with all of us. Her feelings are controlled by the interplay of five main emotions, each personified with their own physical characteristics, their own hue and their own role to play in her life. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is a yellowish sprite who keeps Riley's spirits up – and is Riley's ruling emotion. Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is a green, eye-rolling fashionista who protects Riley's social life, Fear (Bill Hader) is purple and nebbish and protects Riley from physical harm, while Anger (Lewis Black) is a stocky, red munchkin who protects Riley from unfairness in her life. Last and least is Sadness (Phyllis Smith), a short, round blue figure in a turtle-neck sweater who doesn't really seem to have a purpose. Somehow, these five work together to achieve balance in Riley's emotional life and help her function on a daily basis.In living her life, Riley makes memories in the form of glass-like orbs. Most of these memories (each orb literally colored to show which emotion is dominant in that memory) roll down tubes into the massive storeroom of long-term memories. The most important memories, those that really define Riley's life, are core memories which reside in the 'control room' of Riley's mind and power her islands of personality. 11-year-old Riley has five such islands – Goofball Island (she is a kid after all), Hockey Island (reflecting her favorite pastime), Honesty Island (her most significant characteristic), Friendship Island and, of course, Family Island. But as a complex human being, that's not quite all there is to it. Her mind has areas for imagination, facts and opinions, abstract thought and dream / nightmare production. She also has a vast abyss for memories that are no longer important and, working in that warehouse-like archive of long-term memories, a couple 'Forgetters' who decide which memories to keep and which to discard. Each area of Riley's mind is both necessary and dangerous, but I won't say more because seeing how Pixar has imagined and animated each of these areas is a large part of enjoying this movie.As great an idea and as wonderfully realized as it is, this movie wouldn't be much without a good story – and this film definitely has one. After we see Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) form many wonderful memories (most of which are contained in orbs colored yellow), she is removed from the place where those memories were created when her parents (Kyle McLachlan and Diane Lane) move the family from Minnesota to San Francisco. A delayed moving van and a tenuous job situation stress out her parents, while the normal adjustments of leaving behind friends and starting in a new school has Riley's emotions working overtime. Tensions rise among the emotions until a struggle between Joy and Sadness result in both – along with many of Riley's core memories – getting sucked into a long tube and out of the control room. As Disgust, Fear and Anger are left to run Riley's mind, Joy and Sadness have to work together in a wild and strange journey through her brain, trying to get back to the control room, before the other three emotions mess things up too much – and before Riley loses her way. As Riley's personality islands begin to crumble into her mind's abyss, Joy and Sadness learn that they each have much to learn about themselves and each other and they have to figure out new ways to work together, for the sake of all concerned. In addition to the inner workings of Riley's mind, we get a glimpse into the minds of each of her parents and minds as diverse as those of a birthday party clown, a bus driver, a pizza maker, a dog and a cat.As advertised, 'Inside Out' is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative. If you're having trouble picturing all this, try to imagine a colorful, animated combination of 'Fantastic Voyage', 'Mermaids', 'Toy Story', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'San Andreas'. Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain, but trust me, it's quite a sight – and pretty thought-provoking too. Unfortunately, I can't quite turn myself inside out praising the movie. The voice acting is very good, but nothing special. The animation is state-of-the-art but isn't what I would call 'remarkable' and is probably not worth the extra couple of bucks for 3-D glasses. The film contains very funny and genuinely touching moments, but they are few and far between. While the filmmakers have clearly put considerable effort into realizing their vision, more effort should have gone into the actual script. The concepts explored are a little cerebral for a kids' movie, while the dialog isn't cerebral enough. In short, the film is hindered a bit by a lackluster script and unremarkable animation and voice work, but deserves high marks for its creativity and, in that department, definitely lives up to its billing. The main emotion that 'Inside Out' activated in my mind's control room is Joy and this film will live in my long-term memory for many years to come. 'B+'",7,3,24,19 June 2015
It Follows," 'It Follows'? It's stupid! (Read this and more constructive criticisms below!)
","The possibility of contracting AIDS. The large number of sexually transmitted diseases. The fear of upsetting your parents or offending someone's religious beliefs. The risk of unexpected pregnancies. Jason Vorhees' rampages in the 'Friday the 13th' films. You would think that young people have had enough warnings about the dangers of premarital sex. Apparently not. 'It Follows' (R, 1:40) is a horror movie that seems to touch on most of those issues. Or is it none of them? Read on – and I'll try to make more sense than this movie does.The movie's title can be seen as part of an argument in logic, or simply a statement of fact. For example, 'Most professional critics seem to love this movie, so it follows that nearly universal praise should be met with skepticism.' In the more literal sense, 'It' does indeed follow. 'It' follows anyone who has sex with someone who had the curse passed to them by someone else. It can look like anyone – even someone you know. It might appear to you naked, or partially clothed, or fully clothed, but only those cursed can see It. It doesn't move very fast, but It will always find you and, if It gets a hold of you, It will kill you – unless you have sex with someone else and pass the curse on to them first. But if It kills the cursed person before the curse is passed on, the curse reverts to the previous person. The film's opening sequence shows us just how scary the curse can be.Then we meet Jay (Maika Monroe). According to her friends 'it's annoying' how pretty she is. When Jay goes on a date with her new boyfriend, Hugh (Jake Weary), they have sex in the backseat of his car. Afterwards, he reveals that he has passed on to her something much more dangerous than your average STD. He has been followed by It and, in his attempt to shake It off (apologies to all Taylor Swift fans), he has passed the curse on to Jay by having sex with her. He advises her to pass the curse to someone else as soon as possible, he explains the rules to her, he shows It to her (It shows up right on cue), he drops Jay off in front of her house and then disappears. At first, her sister (Lili Sepe) and their neighborhood friends (Keir Gilchrist, Daniel Zovatto and Olivia Luccardi) don't understand why Jay is acting this way, but soon find themselves risking their lives to try to keep her from losing hers.'It Follows' is just dumb. And I'm doing more than just calling names here. I have many questions whose answers (if there are any) reveal how dumb this movie really is. (Warning: Mild spoilers follow.) Writer/director David Robert Mitchell contradicts himself throughout his movie. If the curse is supposed to be symbolic of STDs or just the dangers of premarital sex, then why set up the curse so someone afflicted with it has to pass it on to be free of it? And if It isn't supposed to symbolize any of that, why is this apparition so upset that people have sex in the first place? And where did it come from? Mitchell has said in an interview that the movie was inspired by nightmares he had as a kid and that the problem in the movie can't be solved any easier than you can solve a nightmare while you're in the nightmare. If so, where's the clue that all this is a nightmare and, if it's not, once again, where did It come from and why is It so obsessed with sex? If the cheesy generic horror music, old neighborhoods and old TV shows are supposed to recall the 1970s, then why insert a single piece of technology (an E-reader) that obviously comes from the present? And if the movie takes place in the present, why have generic 1970s horror music, neighborhoods and TV shows? But wait, there's more! (More mild spoilers) Why have a character learn to shoot a gun as a way to fight a supernatural specter? (Aren't they usually impervious to bullets??) When one character has an accident, why choose to have him/her break an arm, then have that character wear a cast and then put that character in water three different times? If someone in the movie comes up with an idea to kill It and the idea doesn't work, why continue to play the scene as if the audience should still be sacred? If a character begins to pursue an idea of how to pass on the curse, why cut away from the scene and never show or say what happened with that plan? Oh, and kids? If you're trying to hide from a very persistent ghoulie which will find you wherever you go, why choose a house in the woods right next to a lake? Have ANY of you seen any horror movies? Ever?? Okay, I better stop now before veins start popping out of my head! I usually don't get so wrapped up in movies' plot holes and logic flaws, but when they are so frequent and so significant as in this movie, they begin to consume anything that is positive. And there is positive here. The premise is fairly original and well, that's all I got. 'It Follows'? It's stupid! 'D'",1,48,177,28 March 2015
Ex Machina," The pronunciation of 'Ex Machina' may not be obvious, but not much about this movie is.
","Let me help you out, so you don't make the same mistake I did. If you go to the theater to see 'Ex Machina' (R, 1:48), make sure you know how to pronounce the title correctly (if you don't already know), so you don't have to suffer the indignity of the guy in the box office correcting you as he prints out your ticket. It's especially embarrassing if you're going to see the film not just as a movie fan, but as a reviewer. It's enough to make you thankful that you're writing your reviews incognito. And speaking of words with Latin origins, this movie's title comes from the Latin phrase 'deus ex machina'. The last word of that phrase, and of this movie's title, is pronounced 'MAHK-ee-nah'. (Apparently, 'mah-SHEE-nah' is incorrect.) 'Deus ex machina', by the way, means 'god from the machine'. No matter how you say it, that makes 'Ex Machina' a good title for this movie. But is this a good movie? In 'Ex Machina', Oscar Isaac is playing the role of God. Well, not literally, but he might as well be. As Nathan Bateman, the fictional 'Bluebook' internet search engine CEO, he's rich, reclusive and brilliant. But those are all understatements. That's like saying Bill Gates is 'well off', the Unabomber 'enjoyed his own company' and Albert Einstein had 'some pretty good ideas'. Not only did Nathan develop the algorithm for what became the world's foremost search engine at 13 years old, build an extremely isolated and high-tech home – slash – research facility where he lives and works alone, but he has also developed the world's first true artificial intelligence, or so he hopes. He has brought Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), one of his company's most talented coders and most intelligent employees, to his live-in lab for a week to test 'Ava' (Alicia Vikander), the robot who can supposedly think - and feel. After making Caleb sign an all-encompassing non-disclosure agreement, Nathan says that Caleb is about to witness the most important scientific achievement in the history of mankind. Mankind? Caleb counters that true A.I. is more in the realm of gods. Nathan likes and enthusiastically embraces the comparison.Nathan's 'tests' involve daily conversations between Caleb and Ava... for starters. Ava does look very human in part(s). She has a realistic-looking face, hands and feet. The rest of her is stylized robotics, but pretty voluptuous robotics at that. (After all, they do say that REAL women robots have curves, and we do see a fair amount of female robot curves – and skin.) In their first meeting, Caleb is shocked to discover that Ava's conversational skills are even more realistic than her very expressive face. Their daily meetings alternate with debriefings between Caleb and Nathan about how the tests are going, along with discussions of the implications of Ava's existence. Caleb and Ava's talks go well beyond simple Q&As and intellectual probing. During their increasingly personal conversations, it also seems that Ava is flirting – and Caleb is responding. And during Caleb and Nathan's alcohol-fueled discussions, Caleb increasingly wonders about Nathan's true motivations for these tests and his plans for the future. Nathan is looking more and more like a master manipulator and one with more than a few secrets.More than just the latest in a long line of films about artificial intelligence, 'Ex Machina' is fresh and exciting. The action, with only three main characters seemingly embarking on a strange new world, does give a sense of the beginning of something monumentally important and may remind audience members of the biblical account of creation, or the creation of Frankenstein's monster, or any of a number of similar stories. The staging evokes a certain moodiness and the dialog is ominous, deep and even profound. This film doesn't have the action of the similarly-themed 'Terminator' movies, but its focus on the subtle, but meaningful, makes it well worth your time. The cast really sells the story, with another great and unsettling performance from the increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac, a wide-ranging, but measured performance from Domhnall Gleeson (who also does a great job of shedding his British accent), not to mention a very effective Alicia Vikander. This is the first film by British novelist – turned screenwriter – turned director Alex Garland, but let's hope it's not his last. This film does suffer from a few noticeable plot holes and a couple instances of predictability, but it's still a stylistically provocative and intellectually interesting tale – with a heck of an ending.

Pawn Sacrifice," See 'Pawn Sacrifice'. You'll gain so much more than you... give up.
","Good actors know how to act 'in the moment', while GREAT actors know how to RE-act in the moment – AND to act and react with their eyes, their faces and their entire bodies. Based on those standards, 'Pawn Sacrifice' (PG-13, 1:54) is VERY well-acted – enough to even make watching chess games exciting.Golden Globe nominees Tobey Maguire ('The Great Gatsby', 'Brothers', 'Seabiscuit' and the 2002-2007 'Spider-Man' Movies) and Liev Schreiber ('Lee Daniels' The Butler', 'Salt', the 'Scream' movies and TV's 'Ray Donovan') play American Bobby Fisher and Russian Boris Spassky, two chess champions whose names will forever be linked in history for their decades-long rivalry, their epic matches and, in particular, the 1972 World Chess Championship in the politically neutral location of Reykjavík, Iceland.It's difficult for those who don't remember the Cold War to understand all the commotion that surrounded these two men at this particular time and place, but the film does a very good job at communicating its importance. The movie opens with a brief scene in which we hear a reporter announce one of the strangest of many strange developments during those two months in Iceland, then gives us an interesting back story that puts it into context. The movie focuses mostly on Fischer. It quickly and smoothly takes us through a few key moments in his life as he becomes the world's youngest international chess grandmaster (as a 15-year-old) and shows us his rise through the ranks of the world's greatest players, culminating in his much-anticipated showdown with the USSR's Spassky.Fischer benefits from the help and support of various people, in spite of his erratic behavior. Carmine Nigro (Conrad Pla) mentors young Bobby Fischer (Aiden Lovekamp) from when he's still an unknown Brooklyn chess prodigy. The teenage Fischer (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick) becomes estranged from his mother (Robin Weigert), but his sister (Lily Rabe) supports him throughout his ups and downs. As the international star of Fischer the young man rises, but he shows no interest in the political implications of his ability to challenge the Soviet Union's chess dominance, Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) shows up. He's a mysterious lawyer who offers financial and logistical support that will help Fischer achieve his goals – and serve his nation as an instrument of propaganda. (It's kind of like John du Pont's support of the Schultz brothers' wrestling careers in 'Foxcatcher', but with less insanity and no murders.) Marshall, along with former chess champion and Catholic priest, William Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard), spend many years helping and encouraging Fischer, as well as dealing with the chess genius' arrogant, rude and demanding behavior as well as his increasingly paranoid and fragile mental state. The film leaves out some major events and issues, and encapsulates others, but it flows well and maintains a clear focus.The story of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer is a remarkable one and has appeared in various forms on TV and in the movies, but never this compellingly. The film's script was written by Oscar nominee Stephen Knight, who has written little-seen, but critically acclaimed movies like 'Eastern Promises' and 'The Hundred-Foot Journey' as well as several TV shows and 2015 feature films 'Seventh Son' and 'Burnt', not to mention 'World War Z 2'. The director is Oscar-winner Edward Zwick, who has directed great movies like 'Blood Diamond', 'The Last Samurai', 'The Siege', 'Courage Under Fire', 'Legends of the Fall' and 'Glory'. The former has turned dull-sounding Europe-based stories into praise-worthy films and the latter seems to do his best work on true stories and stories in historical and/or politically-significant settings. Both of these men's talents seem tailor-made for a movie like this one, and both make great use of their individual talents and experiences which, when joined with this film's truly outstanding performances, make for a fascinating historic, politically-charged biographical drama.Maguire and Schreiber make you feel their characters' brilliance, their arrogance and, most importantly, their humanity, as they were each under tremendous pressure to perform in front of the entire world – and represent their rival nations under a microscope as focused on each of them as on any Olympic athlete. Their bodies, their faces and, especially, their eyes draw our attention to those chess boards more than most of us probably thought possible for a movie. They make us alternately feel, or at least understand, their individual moments of stress, frustration, confusion, desperation, dejection and elation. You don't have to understand chess, have personal memories of the Cold War or even speak their languages to understand what they and those around them are going through. Now, THAT'S acting.When talking about great actors, I've heard people say things like, 'I'd pay to see him read the phone book', or 'he'd be interesting just watching grass grow' (or something like that). Well, if there's ever a movie in which Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber recite a list of names and phone numbers while fertilizing someone's lawn, give me a call – especially if that movie takes place during a period of high international anxiety and has an extraordinary story as exceptionally well told as 'Pawn Sacrifice'.

Magic Mike XXL," 'Magic Mike XXL' doesn't have enough to satisfy.
","It's early July. The movies duking it out at the box office include one about a Teddy bear which has come to life and another is about a group of male strippers. The year is 2012. That's right, the original 'Ted' and the first 'Magic Mike' hit theaters on the same day in late June 2012 and the first weekend in July saw them both going at it in Round 2 of their weekend box office competition. ('Ted' beat 'Magic Mike' at the box office each of those first two weekends, and every other weekend that both movies were in theaters.) Almost exactly 3 years later, each movie had a sequel in theaters, but with one big difference. 'Ted 2' improved on the quality of its predecessor. 'Magic Mike XXL' (R, 1:55) not so much.Mirroring the time between the two movies hitting theaters, the action in 'Magic Mike XXL' takes place three years after the story of that handful of studly strippers leaves off at the end of the 2012 original. Mike Lane (Channing Tatum) is running his own custom furniture business, which was his motivation for leaving the 'Kings of Tampa' at the end of the first film. He's living his dream, but without the girl of the same. His budding relationship with Brooke is no longer budding and, to be honest, his business is not exactly bearing a lot of fruit either. Mike decides to take a break from his life to try to rekindle that old Mike magic, and spend some time with his bros, not to so much to share a six pack, as to show off his.Most of the gang is back for the sequel (the most notable absence being Matthew McConaughey) and there are a few new sets of abs on screen as well. Mike joins the innocent-looking and spiritual Ken (Matt Bomer), sexually frustrated ladies' man Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), mountain of a man Tarzan (Kevin Nash) as well as Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias), whose characters aren't, ahem, fleshed out as well, on a road trip to a male stripper's convention in Myrtle Beach. Their transportation at the beginning of the movie is a food truck. (Insert beefcake joke here). By the time they arrive in South Carolina, they're down one teammate, but are cruising along in a much nicer ride.The guys also make some new friends along the way. In Savannah, they entertain a small group of rich southern women, including Nancy (Andie MacDowell), who happens to be the mother of some girls they met at the beach. Earlier, one of guys accepts a challenge to dance for an apparently humorless convenience store clerk in an attempt to make her smile, and they all dance at the private club of one of Mike's old, ahem, acquaintances, the confident, flamboyant emcee, Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), in her private club for women, where they meet her performers, who may be familiar to fans of morning talk shows, quirky NBC sitcoms and freestyle hip-hop dancing (Michael Strahan, Donald Glover and Stephen 'tWitch' Boss, respectively). Lastly, they gain a groupie of sorts in the person of a young female drifter named Zoe (Amber Heard), whose self-chosen nickname is too risqué for me to use in this review.'Magic Mike XXL', despite its name, can be described in two words: not enough. There is a basic plot, but it's not enough. The story of the guys heading to a male stripper convention feels like just an excuse to put them in various situations where they can dance and act sexy. (If anyone reading this is tempted to remind me that that's what this movie is supposed to be about, I'd like to say that the first film had an actual plot, and a pretty well-constructed one at that.) The rapport and the banter among the guys and between Mike and Zoe is occasionally entertaining, but not enough of the time. The dancing (especially with the big buildup to Myrtle Beach) and the amount of skin on display is well, you get the idea. I can't imagine this movie really satisfying the target audience, much less the casual movie goer. 'C-'",2,28,51,4 July 2015
Big Hero 6," 'Big Hero 6' is a bigger deal than you might think.
","What IS 'Big Hero 6' anyway? Yeah, I know that it's an animated film from Disney and it was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' choice for Best Animated Feature of 2014, but what does 'Big Hero 6' MEAN? To what does it refer? I didn't know until I saw the movie – and read up on the film and its background (my usual post-viewing and pre-review writing research) and now I understand. But there's more at stake here for the movie than whether its title confused a formerly ignorant movie fan or two. This film has to live up to its Oscar win! Does the movie deserve the award? Does the basis for the title become clear during the film? Does this reviewer ever tell the readers about the movie? Read on and find out! Does 'Big Hero 6' refer to the giant marshmallow-looking robot that is featured on the movie poster and in its theatrical trailers? No, it doesn't.That robot is called Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and is the creation of a very talented college student inventor named Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Tadashi created Baymax as a health care provider. Baymax can assess your physical and emotional health in an instant with a pain-free body scan and give you the help you need. And Tadashi designed Baymax's look to make him more effective, or, as Tadashi puts it, 'non-threatening and huggable'.So is 'Big Hero 6' a reference to the President's Affordable Care Act?? No.Baymax is completely apolitical – and he actually works. Besides, he doesn't go away until he hears you say, 'I am satisfied with my care.' How many people have said that about Obamacare? But that's how 14-year-old Hiro (Ryan Potter) meets Baymax. Tadashi takes his brother Hiro to his college's inventors' lab in hopes of inspiring the brilliant and precocious (very) early high school graduate to actually do something with that big brain of his. It works. Hiro is impressed enough with what he sees at San Fransokyo Tech Institute that he decides he has to become a student there. (San Fransokyo is the futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo that serves as the fictional setting for the story.) So, Hiro sets out to invent something in order to impress Tadashi's professor, Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), enough to gain Hiro admittance to the program. That works too.Is 'Big Hero 6' somehow a reference to Hiro??? Nobut you're getting warmer.Hiro's invention is a revolutionary new tiny robot, or microbot. It's smaller than some computer thumb drives, but when it gets together with a bunch (a BIG bunch) of others like it, and their efforts are directed by the thoughts of a human wearing a neurotransmitter headband, their potential is practically limitless. As an interconnected group, they can form shapes, lift and move heavy objects and even transport people across the room or across town. A fire at the lab later that night consumes more than just the lab, and Hiro's dreams and motivation seem destroyed too. Eventually he learns that there was more to that fire than he realized and he builds some carbon fiber armor for Baymax in the hopes that the two of them can get to the bottom of what happened and try to put things right. But it's too big a job for just the two of them. Hiro and Baymax end up getting help from Tadashi's (and, now, Hiro's) college friends, Go Go (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). They adapt their inventions to make themselves more formidable than they would be as mere college students, fashion superhero costumes and identities for themselves, and away they go – as a team.Does 'Big Hero 6' refer to the six newly-minted superheroes???? Yes! This film is actually an origin story for a group of superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. Making this film as an animated feature rather than a live-action movie allows the creators a lot more freedom to create the spectacle that is this film. The animation is amazing. It is not detailed in an HD way, but is impressive in its smoothness. And the colors are as varied and vivid as I have ever seen in an animated movie. The story is great too. As a relatively obscure group of comic book superheroes, the Big Hero 6 can become whoever the creative minds behind the movie want them to become. The script contains elements of danger which give the film a little more depth than in your average animated feature, but keeps it kid-friendly by making Baymax into a physically reassuring presence. The movie is also family-friendly as it clearly endorses respect for elders, healthy ways of dealing with emotions and the selflessness that is required to truly be part of a family (or group of close friends) and make a difference with your life. As an origin story, an Oscar winner and a very profitable film, you can expect a sequel. But what will they call it since the original already ends in a number? Well, I guess that doesn't matter as much as the sequel living up to the quality of the original – especially since most people seem to agree that 'Big Hero 6' deserves all the profits and accolades that it has received. I think so too, and give this film an 'A-'.",9,26,36,8 March 2015
Jurassic World," 'Jurassic World' brings the franchise into the 21st Century with big thrills and big fun.
","Before reviewing 'Jurassic World' (PG-13, 2:04), I think a few historical notes are in order. October 28th, 65,000,000 years B.C. (approx.) – dinosaurs become extinct, probably because of a massive comet or meteor striking the earth. 1990 A.D. – publishing company Alfred A. Knopf releases Michael Crichton's book 'Jurassic Park', probably because of a desire to make money. 1993 – filmmaker Steven Spielberg directed, and motion picture studio Universal Pictures, released a film based on Crichton's book, probably for the same reason that Crichton's book was published. In the film, a venture capitalist named John Hammond is preparing to open an island theme park populated by creatures created from extinct dinosaur DNA. The project is abandoned when Hammond and his guests discover that the dinosaurs are too dangerous and unpredictable to be a theme park attraction. 1997 – all the key players behind the original 'Jurassic Park' phenomenon are responsible for another book and film sequel called 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' in which it is discovered that there is a second island where surviving dinosaurs roam free. Results are similar to the original – dinosaurs eat people and lots of moviegoers pay money to see dinosaurs eat people. 2001 – A third film takes audiences back to the island from the second film. This film is not based on a Michael Crichton book or directed by Steven Spielberg. Moviegoers spend more money, but not as much as in the past. Then, no more people are eaten by dinosaurs for the next 14 years. 2015 – a fourth film in the series is released. Michael Crichton has since died and Steven Spielberg is only involved with the film as executive producer. Also in 2015 – the Movie Fan Community Facebook page publishes a review of the film. The review begins with a very long opening paragraph and then finally gets around to discussing the movie in question.'Jurassic World' shows us that the late John Hammond's dream has become a reality. Built on the island of the original Jurassic Park, this new park is a combination of Disneyworld, Sea World, a safari park and a Jurassic Period 'Island of Dr. Moreau'. The coolly efficient park administrator is Claire Dearing (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, looking strangely like Jessica Chastain). Claire may run the place, but like everyone, she has a boss (Irrfan Khan) who wants to make money. Like a traditional amusement park building wilder roller coasters, or maybe a film franchise trying to manufacture bigger thrills, this park needs to periodically add new attractions to keep up consumer interest. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) and his team of scientists are more than happy to fulfill that need by coming up with larger and meaner genetically-engineered dinosaurs. Meanwhile, a shady character named Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) has more than ticket sales in mind as he intently watches the park's head trainer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), act as a kind-of dinosaur whisperer with some velociraptors.Soon, the new 'Indominus Rex' (part T. Rex and part other stuff the lab rats aren't at liberty to discuss), the park's latest coming attraction, breaks free and starts coming to the other side of the island where the main park is located (along with its over 20,000 guests). This 'containment breach' is very bad for business and occupies the efforts of all the main characters, including control room technicians played amusingly by Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus. Even as the park is starting to lose employees, the attentions of some of the key players are divided. Claire is supposed to be hosting her two visiting nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), but has simply given them V.I.P. passes and left them in the care of her assistant (Katie McGrath). The boys run off on their own, just as the park's 'assets' are starting to run amok. As much as Owen cares for the dinosaurs he's training, he also seems to care for Claire as more than a park administrator. And as dangerous as loose, hungry dinosaurs can be, Hoskins views the growing mayhem with a combination of interest and greed as he tells someone on a cell phone call, 'we may have an opportunity here.' It looks like it's going to fall to Owen to save Claire's nephews from her neglect, save the park visitors from the marauding dinosaurs and save the park's power brokers from themselves. It's not exactly guarding a galaxy, but Pratt's character still has his hands full.'Jurassic World' is everything a fan of the previous films would likely be hoping to see, and maybe more. The dinosaurs are bigger and badder and they look great (especially in 3-D)! The movie makes good use of the 'Jurassic Park' story from the previous films, but branches out in some new directions. Except for a few random and slightly awkward moments, the script is smart – especially when it comes to the plot. It contains several different story lines that are woven together seamlessly. There's danger around every corner, but some subtle and well-placed humor relieves some of the tension and when the dinosaurs have a snack, the audience is spared an unnecessary amount of blood and gore. Some of the acting is less than stellar, but the leads do a very good job – especially Pratt who is perfect as the hero. This movie brings the franchise nicely into the 21st century and even elicited applause from some of my fellow moviegoers. 'A-'",8,12,32,12 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is even better than 2012's 'Avengers'
","Marvel has pulled off something INCREDIBLE – something unprecedented in the annals of American cinema! They have assembled the parts of four different movie franchises into a combination franchise – and it's a huge, HULKing success! Almost a decade ago, when I first heard of Marvel's plans to make separate movies about the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, and then bring them all together in an 'Avengers' movie, I admit that I was a bit skeptical. I said to myself, 'Self, that's a lot of time, effort and money towards a single goal. I hope, for their sake, these movies don't suck.' I watched and waited to see if they could IRON out the details, and MAN, did they! The 2008 Hulk movie (2003's 'Hulk' wasn't part of this grand plan), the three Iron Man movies and the Captain America and Thor films (two each) and 2012's 'Avengers' have made a combined total of over $2.6 billion – in the U.S. alone! By the hammer of THOR, that's a lot of money! More importantly, these nine films (ten, if you count Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy') have averaged 7.4 stars on IMDb.com and an 82% audience rating on rottentomatoes.com! And now, writer/director Joss Whedon, the CAPTAIN of this culminating franchise, has given us a blockbuster that may break box office records in America and all over the world! Is Whedon's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (PG-13, 2:21) worth all that? For the details (but no spoilers), and our official Movie Fan judgment, read on. The AVENGERS have ASSEMBLED! 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (as part of this grand plan for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) picks up on the cues and clues left us in 'The Avengers'. As the 2015 episode opens, Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), The Hulk / Dr. David Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) are racing through the woods in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia, to a secret research laboratory where they hope to reacquire Loki's scepter. As we learned from the previous film, that staff has tremendous power and can't fall into the wrong hands. And in the right hands, it could be very beneficial. There's a rare stone within the scepter and that Stark realizes he can use to power Ultron, the artificial intelligence project that he's been working on. The idea is that Ultron would function as a global defense system to keep the world safe from aliens with bad intentions. 'Peace in our time,' Stark calls it. The problem is two-fold. 'Peace in our time' was the phrase used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after he got Adolf Hitler to sign an agreement not to attack England and we all know how that turned out. Secondly, these guys have apparently never seen any of the 'Terminator' movies, in which a defense technology called 'Skynet' was supposed to keep earth's inhabitants safe and we all know how THAT turned out.When Ultron becomes self-aware (much more quickly than Skynet did), he makes himself a body out of spare robot parts, starts sounding like James Spader talking through a bad cell phone connection and decides that the best way to save the world is to exterminate humanity. Uh-oh. It takes all the Avengers to slow him down for a minute or two. Ultron, he of the high intelligence in the digital format, can escape into any computer in the world – or all of them. Besides that, he has help. A pair of genetically-enhanced twins, Quicksilver / Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), have a personal beef with the Avengers and are more than happy to help Ultron destroy them. Quicksilver makes Superman look like an old man with a walker and Scarlet Witch can move objects by waving her hands and can get inside someone's head more effectively than any woman I've ever met. Ultron uses their particular set of skills to significant advantage, but he hasn't told them that he has a little more on his high-tech mind than just getting rid of the Avengers. But the good guys have help too. Several characters from previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe show up to lend a hand. I'd love to tell you who they are, but my policy is to not reveal anything that you can't learn from the trailer or the movie poster. I'd also love to tell you what we learn about several characters' back stories and the surprising developments involving some of the characters in the present, but that would spoil the fun! And 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' IS a lot of fun! This movie contains all the elements that made the first film work so well, but never gets repetitious. This movie even enhances those elements. We get more character development, more character conflict, more humor, superior visual effects and, most importantly, an even better story and even better action sequences! What's not to love? The visuals are stunning, the action sequences are intense and creative, and there are more laughs in this movie than in many so-called comedies I've seen. The humor is not only perfectly balanced with the action, it's perfectly timed. This film will leave superhero fans and action movie fans alike wanting more, and more is on the way. We're going to have a chance to see 'Ant-Man' in July. 'Captain America: Civil War' arrives next May, 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' in 2017, and 'Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1' in 2018. For now, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' gets an 'A'.",9,1,10,1 May 2015
Everest," Like climbing the famed mountain, watching 'Everest' is a harrowing, but rewarding experience.
","'I want to see Everest'. Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, 'Everest'. More to the point, 2015's 'Everest' (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ('Into Thin Air: Death on Everest'), but tells it more vividly than ever before.The '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller 'Into Thin Air', which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's 'Everest'. As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. 'The last word,' as one character in the 2015 film says, 'always belongs to the mountain.' 'Everest' follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for 'Outside' magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.'Everest' is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. 'Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying,' he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.'Everest' is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate. 'A-'",8,67,100,18 September 2015
Elysium," 'Elysium' is intriguing, but gets bogged down in its own negativity.
","Class warfare, health care, immigration. 'Elysium' (R, 1:49) is an action thriller that explores all these social issues and more.Less than a century and a half in our future, the rich live in the ultimate gated community – a man-made satellite shaped like a bicycle tire, which hangs in the sky within sight, but out of reach, of the poor people of earth. Earth has become a dirty, run-down planet full of dirty, run-down people who are lucky if they have a job. Elysium is a paradise with a swimming pool in the middle of every manicured lawn. Every home is beautiful and they all have a device that looks like a cross between a tanning bed and an MRI, which can heal any citizen of Elysium of any injury or disease.Naturally, the citizens of earth want to be on Elysium and the citizens of Elysium want to keep that from happening. Whenever the citizens of earth attempt their futuristic version of a border crossing. well, they're stopped. Leading that effort is Secretary Delacourt (played by Jodie Foster) - a Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, National Security Adviser and border patrol agent all rolled into one. She's also ruthless and she talks funny. In the future, unusual accents are plentiful, but morals, not so much. Delacourt will do anything to keep Elysium pure and secure, while people like Matt Damon's character, Max, yearn, and sometimes really NEED to 'get up there'.When Max suffers a serious accident at work, he knows that getting to Elysium for medical attention is his only chance for survival. The same need exists with a little girl, the daughter of a childhood friend of Max. Max knows someone who can get him to Elysium, but only if Max does something for his 'friend' in the process. And that 'something' could turn out to be a game-changer for everyone in this Orwellian morality play.There's a lot going on in 'Elysium'. Maybe too much. Incorporating so many social issues into the plot makes the film feel cluttered. The condition of earth and its people is portrayed with an nearly overwhelming grittiness and the 'every man for himself' mentality of almost all the characters is pretty depressing. The story is interesting and the action is exciting to watch, but I would call other aspects of the film. too much of a good thing. 'B'",6,1,1,30 September 2015
Woman in Gold," 'Woman in Gold' is a work of art in its own right.
","When I review a movie, I ask myself but one question: How entertaining is it? Of course, such a thing is always a matter of opinion and depends on an individual's personal background, personality, tastes, preferences, interests, experiences, and so forth. As a reviewer who likes all kinds of movies and hopes these reviews will be helpful to all kinds of moviegoers, I'm as objective and open-minded as I can be. Regardless of its genre, its subject matter or its background, all I expect from a movie is to enjoy it. This attitude allows me the freedom to like movies of any and all kinds, regardless of whether others think that I'm 'supposed' to like them or not. Did the movie's comedy make me laugh, did its a drama draw me in and make me care, did its thrilling moments thrill me? Etc., etc. You get the point. I expect a film to entertain me – to make me FEEL something. But the best movies also inform, educate, enlighten and uplift. Oh, and bonus points for originality, creativity, and technical and artistic excellence. When you have the pleasure of seeing a film with all of those characteristics, it is a 'must see'. It is a treasure. It is art. 'Woman in Gold' (PG-13, 1:49) is such a film.'Woman in Gold' is based on the true story of Maria Altmann, who, as a young woman (played by Tatiana Maslany of 'Orphan Black' fame) fled her beloved Austria as the Nazi noose was tightening around the necks of her Jewish countrymen. Encouraged by her family and with her new husband by her side, she left behind the people, places and possessions she loved. One of those possessions was a Gustav Klimt painting of her dear aunt Adele (Antje Traue), a painting which would soon be taken by the Nazis and, after World War II, end up in a Vienna art museum where it became so revered that one character calls it 'the Mona Lisa of Austria'.When Maria (played as an old woman by Dame Helen Mirren) loses her sister, she discovers some letters that, along with 1990s changes in Austrian law, make her think that she might reclaim what once belonged to her family. She enlists the help of Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), a friend's son, to look into the matter for her. Randy is a young attorney who has just started a new job and whose wife (Katie Holmes) is concerned about the impact of a lengthy case on their growing family, but he becomes obsessed with Maria's cause. In Austria, Randy gains the assistance of a local journalist (Daniel Brühl), but this long and complicated bureaucratic and legal struggle may prove to be too much for any of them, or even all of them. If you ever start to think that this lengthy and emotionally taxing fight is merely about the extremely high value of the painting or even one woman's need for closure, you'll remember Maria ending a conversation about her motivations with 'and then there's justice.' 'Woman in Gold' has something for everyone. It's an unusually dramatic history lesson, a riveting drama, an involving mystery, a fascinating legal thriller and a touching story of families and friendships. All members of the very talented cast bring their 'A game', the writing is excellent and the editing is superb. All these factors come together in a narrative which transitions seamlessly between the story's present and its past, doing so as effectively as I've ever seen it done. The opening of the movie, a short scene involving the creation of the painting, effortlessly but effectively communicates how special the painting of the title really is. The film shows the plight of the Jews in Europe more personally than any film since 'Schindler's List', but without being overwrought. It also sheds light on what it meant for a country to capitulate to the Nazis as well as the long-term effects of that chapter in history. Many scenes in the movie are dramatic and suspenseful, but the portion of the film in which Maria and her husband escape Austria is on par with the climactic scenes in Oscar-winning films like 'Argo' and 'The Sound of Music'. Whichever genre or cubby hole that professional critics choose to place this movie in, it rises above most films to which it might be compared.Like a great painting, a great film is a joy and an honor to see for yourself. I hope that 'Woman in Gold' is remembered when all those gold statuettes are handed out this next awards season. The worth of the movie is, in the end, only my opinion, but this film informed me, educated me, enlightened me, uplifted me, and, as a wonderful work of art, it entertained me.

Groundhog Day," It's time to watch 'Groundhog Day'...again.
","Some movies are enjoyed by millions and even critically acclaimed when they are first released, but end up being largely forgotten. Then there are those movies that are so original, so well-done, so reflective of their times, or so impactful on the culture that they never leave our memories. These are the films that seem to constantly hover in the back of our conscious minds, available to be instantly brought to the forefront when we encounter a situation, a phrase or even just a mood that reminds us of the first time we saw it. 'Groundhog Day' (1993) is such a movie.It made a good profit during its initial run (according to Wikipedia, earning $70.9 million in North America, making it the 13th highest grossing movie of 1993), but the movie has become even better appreciated and loved over the years. It has made many 'Best of' movie lists and has been preserved by the Library of Congress. Even the legendary critic Roger Ebert, in his 'Great Movies' essay, according to Wikipedia, wrote that 'he had initially underestimated the film's many virtues and only came to truly appreciate it through repeated viewings.' But the film's impact is even deeper and broader than those facts suggest. Think about it. When people refer to a case of seemingly never-ending repetition, they often refer to it as being 'like groundhog day'. They're not talking about the annual event in Pennsylvania and various other locations around the nation. They're talking about the movie. THAT'S significant impact. When was the last time that YOU checked out this cinematic gem? If it's been awhile, or if you've never seen it, read on.Bill Murray stars as Chuck Connors, a clever, but arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is dreading his annual trip to nearby Punxsutawney to cover Groundhog Day, or as he calls it, 'a large rodent predicting the weather.' His new and vivacious producer, Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) does her best to keep him happy and help get the job done, while their cameraman, Larry (Chris Elliott), has learned to just put up with Phil. On his way from his room in a cozy B&B to his on-camera gig, Phil encounters a number of people whom he writes off as 'hicks', including a friendly hotel guest on the stairs, the proprietor of the B&B, Mrs. Lanchester (Angela Paton), and an old high school classmate named Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) who tries to sell him insurance. After running this gauntlet, he gets to the site just in time, does a brief, sarcastic on-camera commentary and gets ready to get the heck out of Dodge. To Phil's consternation, their van gets turned around on the highway by a blizzard moving in, a blizzard which, ironically, Phil had predicted would miss that area. But a botched weather forecast and an unexpected return to Punxsutawney are only the beginning of Phil's problems.The next morning, Phil wakes up in the same room as the day before, to the same song on the radio, with the disc jockeys saying the same things and meeting the same people in the same places saying the same things as the day before – because it IS the day before! As Phil says in his on camera report, 'It's Groundhog Dayagain.' It soon starts looking like it's going to be February 2nd for the rest of Phil's life. As Phil goes through the cinematic equivalent of purgatory, at first, he's confused, and then he's frustrated. Then he expresses a desire to get stuck in a better day but starts trying to enjoy the consequence-free nature of this one, even to the point of manipulating people (especially Rita, whom he wants to fall for him). Soon, Phil despairs to the point of trying to kill himself and then he resigns himself to what seems to be his fate. It's almost as if he's going through the classic stages of grief – grief over the life he has lost – the kind of life we all take for granted, the ability to wake up tomorrow and actually have it BE tomorrow. 'What if there IS no tomorrow?' Phil once shouts in frustration. 'There wasn't one today!' Eventually, after untold numbers of years stuck in the same day (the actual number of re-dos being the topic of much debate), Phil begins using his virtual omniscience for good and becomes a better person for it. (Just in case anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, I won't spoil it by telling you whether Rita eventually falls for Phil or if he breaks free from his cycle of February 2nds.) The late, great Harold Ramis co-wrote, directed (and briefly appears in) this classic comedy, which is much more than the sum of its parts. The script is sharp and witty, the direction and editing are skilled and the film is perfectly cast. This movie is original, clever and very funny, but is also very meaningful. I won't over-analyze the movie and ruin it for anyone, or deprive you of your own interpretations, but I will say that there is a lot of symbolism in this movie and some lessons on the importance of having unselfish priorities. Now, as long as this retro review is already, I could say more, but I'm writing this on the evening of February 2nd and I'm excited about what that means. It's time to watch 'Groundhog Day'again!",9,2,9,2 February 2015
Love & Mercy," 'Love & Mercy' is an original, insightful and compelling look at the genius and the struggles of The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson.
","Unfortunately, genius and mental illness sometimes go hand-in-hand. Too often, the kind of genius that represents truly original thought is so unusual that it's perceived as being 'crazy', but when we're talking about a literal, clinically-defined mental or emotional impairment, the issue becomes whether the mental illness is the cause or the result of the sick person's genius. It's a kind of chicken-egg question, but no matter which came first, mental illness hurts. It hurts the person suffering from it and those who care about him or her and, left untreated (or poorly treated), it can destroy those interpersonal relationships and, of course, the person who is ill – genius and all. This was the problem, and nearly the fate, of Brian Wilson, founder of The Beach Boys. Wilson's struggle is the focus of the innovative and insightful biopic 'Love & Mercy' (PG-13, 2:01).Part of the problem in describing this movie is that the term 'biopic' applies only in the loosest sense. This film is not a valentine to the Beach Boys, or even a chronicle of all the important events in the life of Wilson himself. The story's unusual structure is meant to convey a single major issue in his life – an ongoing struggle with mental illness. The plot revolves around two pivotal periods in Wilson's personal history – the late 1960s and the late 1980s – when his illness began to have a significant effect on his life, and, later, when the treatment he received was exposed as more harmful than helpful and Wilson was able to start receiving proper care. Constructed as it is, the film's creative team decided to have two actors play Wilson – Paul Dano for the earlier portion of the story and John Cusack for the later part. Those separate periods in Wilson's life unfold throughout the movie, which skillfully alternates between scenes from each, similar to the way 'The Godfather, Part II' tells its tale, but without the sense that the earlier scenes are flashbacks. Both stories are told chronologically and as if they are happening simultaneously, both bringing Wilson's life to points of crisis and ultimately, to redemption.The late 1960s' Brian Wilson was a young genius, at the height of his powers. A few well-chosen scenes (displayed as if they're bits of genuine archival footage) show The Beach Boys at their most popular – clean-cut California kids cranking out hit after feel-good hit. By the late 60s, most of their biggest hits are behind them and Wilson is trying to move the band in new directions, gaining inspiration from his natural musical talent, innate creativity, some illicit drugs, and the voices and music that he hears in his head. The main focus in the late 60s scenes is the production of the classic album 'Pet Sounds', which was critically acclaimed (and is now considered one of the greatest albums of all time), but was dispassionately received by many Beach Boys fans due to its radical departure from the band's signature upbeat songs. Except for a few scenes in which we see the band create 'Good Vibrations', the focus is not so much on the music as on the man. It's a very human story which is both more personal and more relatable than a traditional biopic.The late 1980s' Brian Wilson is a broken man being rebuilt by the radical 24-hour therapy of his psychiatrist and legal guardian, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). There are bits of dialog to let us know how Wilson got to this point and how much Landy did to bring him back from the brink, but most of what we see in these portions of the story is the complete control that Landy exercises over his patient's daily life and personal affairs. Landy, or those on his staff, follow Wilson everywhere he goes. We can tell by the way Wilson talks and acts that he needs some level of supervision. What isn't as clear is whether his need for Landy's care has more to do with Wilson's actual mental state, the huge amount of medication Landy has Wilson taking or the near complete physical, mental and emotional dependence that Landy has caused Wilson to have on him. This is the situation that Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) walks into. She's a former model who is now selling cars. She and Brian meet when he comes to buy a Cadillac from the dealership where she works. In spite of Wilson's off-beat way of talking, Melinda is drawn to his sweet and fragile disposition and it's obvious that Wilson is immediately attracted to her too. As the two grow closer and Landy allows her, as he says 'unprecedented access' to Wilson's life, she sees Landy's manipulations for what they are and feels compelled to help, regardless of the cost.Those who can watch 'Love & Mercy' without being distracted by the unconventional story-telling style are likely to find it both enlightening and enjoyable. The film provides rare insights into mental illness and shines a light on the need for the families and friends of such patients to remain active and attentive regarding their loved one's care. Beach Boys fans, and really, all music fans, will enjoy seeing the creative process behind one of the most important influences in the history of American popular music. And those who like a good romance or human drama will get that too. Last but not least, movie fans will appreciate the outstanding performances and will likely hope, as I do, that they are remembered come the next awards season. However, the film has a few too many slow moments, it could have done a better job of filling in some of the obvious gaps in the story, and the prevailing tone of the film is a little depressing, but its compelling story told in such an original way with such great actors outweighs its few imperfections.

"McFarland, USA"," 'McFarland, USA' builds on an already great year for Hispanics in cinema.
","2015 is shaping up to be a great year for Hispanics in the movies! First, the drama 'Spare Parts' told the true story of undocumented Mexican-American high school students who entered a college-level competition to build the best underwater robot. Then, 2014's surprise Mexican hit 'Buen Dia, Ramon' (a Mexican-German production also known as 'Guten Tag, Ramon') brought its unusual feel-good story north of the border. Shortly after that, 'A la mala', a 2015 Mexican romantic comedy opened in the U.S. All three of those movies have been reviewed and highly recommended by the Movie Fan community Facebook page and in my IMDb reviews. Enter 'McFarland, USA' (PG, 2:09), a movie in the spirit of 'Spare Parts', but with its own unique story to tell.McFarland is a small, primarily Hispanic town in rural south-central California. It's one of the poorest towns in the state. It's a place that people do not choose to go and where they only stay if they have no other options. And that doesn't just apply to the Mexican-American agricultural workers who call McFarland home. Idaho high school football coach Jim White moves his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) and young daughters Julie (Homeland's Morgan Saylor) and Jamie (Elsie Fisher) to McFarland when he loses his job after accidentally injuring a student in a minor fit of rage. Jim and his family are the only Whites in town and practically the only whites too. They're clearly uncomfortable in their new and unfamiliar surroundings, but Jim just sees McFarland as a weigh station on his journey to professional redemption.Jim was hired as a science and physical education teacher and assistant football coach, but he soon takes on another challenge. When he notices how fast some of his students run – both in class – and to and from school (in between working in the fields), he decides he wants to start McFarland High School's first cross-country team. Jim has absolutely no experience with the sport, but he convinces the friendly, but no-nonsense principal (Valente Rodriguez) to back him. It also takes some convincing to get seven boys to take time away from what they see as their lot in life to join his team – and the boys' parents to allow them the time to attend practice. Jim is very convincing, but his powers of persuasion go beyond mere words. He shows he cares in a variety of ways and gains the respect of the boys and the support of their families and the townspeople. Soon, Coach White and his runners, Thomas (Carlos Pratts), Johnny (Hector Duran), Victor (Sergio Avelar), Jose (Johnny Ortiz) and the three Diaz brothers, David (Rafael Martinez), Damacio (Michael Aguero) and the overweight, but underestimated Danny (Ramiro Rodriguez), are jelling as a team and seem poised for accomplishments they had never dreamed of, including maybe even leaving McFarland behind. Maybe.'McFarland, USA' is as formulaic as most sports movies (and the previously mentioned 'Spare Parts'), but a good movie is a good movie. This one is well-cast and well-acted, especially by Costner who definitely knows from sports movies (see 1988's 'Bull Durham', 1989's 'Field of Dreams', 1996's 'Tin Cup' and 2014's 'Draft Day'). The story unfolds a bit sluggishly, but builds to some moments of tense drama, genuine emotion and life lessons and empathy that the audience is sure to carry home with them. There are some very enjoyable light-hearted moments too. Lastly, the films ends, as all 'Based on a True Story' films do, with an obligatory, but especially poignant 'where are they now' segment. Whether you see 'Spare Parts', or 'McFarland, USA', you're in for a treat. 'A-'",8,4,19,1 March 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," 'Pitch Perfect 2' isn't perfect, but its pitch is every bit as good as the original.
","One of the really cool things about movies in the early 21st Century is the increasing diversity – in terms of the characters being written, the actors being hired, the points of view being expressed and the growing variety in the types of movies being made. Take 'Pitch Perfect 2' (PG-13, 1:55) for example. It tells a story about (of all things) a college singing group, it shows 'nerdy' characters as basically no different than anyone else – and the movie is a big hit! Would this have happened 10 or 20 years ago? And how about this: The movie is written by a woman (Kay Cannon), directed by another woman (Elizabeth Banks), co-produced by both of those women (and three men) and stars men and women representing different races, nationalities, ethnicities and sexual orientations. Diversity – AND progress! Sure, most of these groups' identities are fodder for humor, but hey, this IS a comedy – and everyone is made fun of equally. None of the jokes are mean-spirited, and you, the audience member, are laughing WITH these different groups even as you're laughing at them – and maybe even laughing at yourself a little. The real question is: are those jokes actually funny – and, is the movie, as a whole, worth seeing? 'Pitch Perfect 2' picks up three years after its predecessor left off. The freshmen of the college a cappella singing group called the Bellas, at the fictional Barden University, are now seniors, to include aspiring music producer Beca (Anna Kendrick), who is now the Bella's leader, overly-confident Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), low-talking Lilly (Hanna Mae Lee) and the Bellas' one black member, Cynthia (Ester Dean), as well as Beca's boyfriend and male counterpart in the Barden Treblemakers, Jesse (Skylar Astin) and his best friend, the magic-loving and girl-fearing Benji (Ben Platt). Another one of the Bellas, Chloe (Brittany Snow), the one who recruited Beca in the first film, is also a senior – for the fourth year in a row (failing required classes on purpose), because she just can't let go of her involvement with the Bellas. Some of the singers from the previous movie have graduated, but still turn up in this one, including the former Treblemakers' leader, Bumper (Adam DeVine), who briefly worked for John Mayer, but is now a security guard at Barden, and former Bellas' co-leader, Aubrey (Anna Camp), who now runs a nature retreat where businesses send their employees for team-building activities. In addition, the Bellas have added Flo (Chrissie Fit), a hilariously pessimistic immigrant from Guatemala, and they also add a talented song-writing freshman named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who the Bellas call 'Legacy' because her mother (Katey Sagal) was a former leader of the Bellas. Returning to comment on the goings-on are Barden employees John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks). That's a lot of names but you gotta have a program, right? So, now that we have the performers straight, what of the performance(s)? Well, like the original, this movie starts with a disastrous show that sends the Bellas reeling. In a Kennedy Center command performance, Fat Amy goes commando, which becomes obvious to all in the audience – including the Obamas – when she has a major wardrobe malfunction while hanging above the stage in a silk swing. The university's embarrassment, and suspicions that Fat Amy exposed herself accidentally-on-purpose, lead to the Bellas being banned from all competitions, except one. As the reigning national champions, they still have to represent the U.S. at the quadrennial World A Cappella Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. And Barden agrees to reinstate the Bellas if they win. No American group has ever won that title before, but that is just the beginning of the Bellas' challenges. Pursuing her dream of a career in music, Beca has accepted an internship at a record company. This has Beca distracted from producing the arrangements for the event in Denmark and she hasn't yet worked up the courage to tell the other Bellas about what she's doing. Two other Bellas have distractions of their own as they are being romantically pursued by male a cappella singers. All of the Bellas are concerned about the daunting challenge of beating the practically flawless German team, known as 'Das Sound Machine', led by the arrogant and condescending Pieter (Flula Borg) and Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen), the latter of the two Beca, in particular, finds especially intimidating – and strangely attractive. Worst of all, the Bellas seem to have lost their musical identity. They fumble their way through an underground riff-off organized by the self-proclaimed 'greatest a cappella fan in the world' (David Cross) and then, performing for a group of senior citizens with a routine that one commentator says is more like a circus act than an a cappella performance. The Bellas go to Aubrey's woodland retreat in an attempt to put aside their distractions, get past their personal issues, rebuild their team and recapture their mojo and their sound, so they can give themselves a fighting chance to win in Denmark, and then move on with their lives. It's a tall order, but the Bellas didn't get to where they are by folding under pressure.'Pitch Perfect 2' is a lot of fun, but it isn't perfect. Some of the gags are just awkward, but most are genuinely funny, even as un-PC as they are, and the large number of clever cameos throughout the movie really add to the fun. The musical numbers are enjoyable, though not spectacular, and Banks' direction is a little uneven. But, like its predecessor, this movie is humorous, on target musically and is filled with likable characters who you'll want to see succeed. As with the original, I liked this movie very much, but I can't say that I loved it. Both exemplify a diversity of spirit that is commendable, both are equally worth checking out and, while I'm comparing them, I feel that both films deserve the same grade: 'B+'.",7,9,18,15 May 2015
Whiplash," 'Whiplash' is exceptional filmmaking, but is just about one minute too long.
","What price success? That's basically the question asked in 'Whiplash' (R, 1:47). Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal? How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential? When does motivation become abuse? We've probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything, or had a parent, a coach, a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it. Well, what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation? Can we expect the result to be excellence – or tragedy – or both? Miles Teller plays Andrew Neimann, a freshman at an extremely prestigious (but fictional) music school in New York City, called the Shaffer Conservatory. Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great, but to be one of THE greats. His only friend is the single father (Paul Reiser) who raised him. He doesn't have friends or girlfriends. He needs to be free to focus on his music. He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer's most demanding professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who picks Andrew for the school's very exclusive Studio Band. Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987's 'Full Metal Jacket' look like a purring kitten. Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood, sweat and tears, but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor. Fletcher regularly abuses all his students – emotionally and even physically – especially Andrew. It's Fletcher's idea of motivation. He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness, and greatness is what Andrew covets, but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial. It's toxic. And combustible. As the tension builds, Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher – if Fletcher doesn't destroy him in the process. It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps. Inevitable.Besides asking some very important questions, 'Whiplash' gets credit for excellent execution – mostly. First of all, the acting is terrific. Simmons deserves all the awards he has won for the role and one wonders why Teller wasn't nominated for any awards. The film's cinematography and editing really add to the on screen tension and the music is so much a part of the story-telling that it's practically a character unto itself. This film will probably do more for jazz than any film since 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' (1999). The only real problem I had with this film is the ending. What seems to be a strong narrative thread, a consistent message and a uniform tone (all thanks to writer-director Damien Chazelle, who based the characters on his experiences as a music student) gets off track in the film's final scene. This movie is simply 30-60 seconds too long. Except for that, this is a very artistically intense film and deserves a look – and more than a passing thought about the questions it raises.

The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring' builds slowly, but eventually loads up on thrills and chills
","'The Conjuring' conjures up the spirit of 'The Exorcist', 'The Amityville Horror', 'Poltergeist' and 'The Birds', but manages to be scarier than any one of those by itself. 'The Conjuring' is based on a true story (if you believe in that sort of thing) from 1971. The film follows the story of a couple who investigates paranormal activity and call in a priest when they can prove that a house's quirks are more than just squeaky boards and rattling pipes.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play the couple as two serious and gifted individuals who sincerely want to help people. It's obvious that they're inevitably going to be needed by the family who moves into a creepy old house (with an even creepier tree on their land) in Rhode Island. That other couple is played with charm and sincerity by Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor (who does Oscar-worthy work here). They have five daughters and a seriously malevolent presence in their home. As is the case with most horror movies, it takes too long to get to the really scary stuff....but when it gets there, look out! Slamming doors and dead animals turn into visions of evil spirits and, eventually, demonic possession.As the ghost-hunting couple gets involved, things go from bad to very bad. Their research uncovers a long-forgotten series of tragic deaths in and around the house and they begin to gather audio, video and photographic evidence to bring to their contacts in the church. The question is whether all their efforts are too little too late. The malevolent spirit who started this whole mess has some seriously evil plans for the family. And when everything comes to a head....let's just say that the spirit really, REALLY doesn't want to go.'The Conjuring' brings together the two couples' stories very effectively and all the efforts to save this family give us more to watch than most horror flicks do. The climax of the movie is so tense and action-packed that I'm even willing to forgive (mostly) the film's unnecessarily slow build. I give 'The Conjuring' a B+.",7,0,1,4 February 2015
The Water Diviner," 'The Water Diviner' is a good (but not great) directorial debut for Russell Crowe.
","World War I and its immediate aftermath is the backdrop for Russell Crowe's 'The Water Diviner' (R, 1:51), a story about a father's love. You don't need to know much about The Great War to appreciate this film. The script tells you what you need to understand about the history of it all, but if you'd like to appreciate the film even more, you might want to read the next paragraph. (If not, you could just skip to the third paragraph.)One of the most famous battles in World War I (1914-1918) was the Gallipoli Campaign (1915-1916). It was fought on a peninsula which overlooks the entrance to the Dardanelles. Beyond those straits lay Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. What's left of the Ottoman Empire is now the nation of Turkey and its capital is Ankara, but in late 1915, those changes were several years away and the Ottoman Turks were fighting for their empire against foreign invaders. As a member of 'The Central Powers' (the Ottoman, the Austro-Hungarian and the German empires), the Ottomans fought against 'The Allies' which included Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, and, starting in 1917, the U.S. At the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turks eventually forced the invading troops from France and Britain and the colonies of the British Empire, including ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers, to abandon their Gallipoli Campaign, but not before over 100,000 men lay dead and twice that many had been injured. In this film, Russell Crowe plays an Australian farmer named Joshua Connor. It's 1919, the year after World War I ended, and four years since his sons went off to fight but never returned. Connor busies himself trying to make a living off of the land of rural Australia. Part of that process involves digging wells. He uses a pair of divining rods to help him decide where to dig. It's not an exact science. In fact, much like a Ouija board, a divining rod probably only works because the user wants it to work NEEDS it to work. Finding water with divining rods probably has as much to do with the instinct of the user than anything else. Fortunately for Connor, he has VERY good instincts. Yet, Connor's wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), teetering on the brink of insanity, berates him for being able to find water, but being unable to find his sons. Connor promises Eliza that he will indeed find their boys (Ryan Corr, James Fraser and Ben O'Toole) and bring them home for a proper burial. Connor makes the three-month journey from Australia to Turkey, which only represents the beginning of his hardships. Upon arriving in Constantinople, a young boy runs off with Connor's only bag. Connor chases Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) and doesn't catch up to him until Orhan has led Connor to the hotel that Orhan's family runs. It is a nice place, but Connor is met with thinly veiled hostility from Orhan's mother, Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband died in the war, likely at the hands of one of Connor's countrymen or their allies. Ayshe's brother-in-law, Omer (Steve Bastoni) – and, if he gets his way, her second husband – welcomes Connor and he checks in. The family (especially Orhan), warms to Connor but figuring out how to find his sons is even tougher. The British consul's office won't give civilians permission to go to Gallipoli, so Conner has to find his own way. When he finally makes it there, he meets an Australian officer (Jai Courtney) and his Turkish counterpart (Yilmaz Edrogan) who are working together on a graves detail at the massive cemetery that is Gallipoli. Connor first has to convince these men to help him, or at least allow him, to look for his sons. Then, it's going to take all his divining talents to find their remains and even more than that to solve the mystery he uncovers.'The Water Diviner' is Crowe's feature film directorial debut, and he handles the job well mostly. The flashbacks of the battle scenes are as meticulously staged and gut wrenchingly real as anything this side of 'Saving Private Ryan'. It's also nice to see mostly real Turks playing the parts of Turks and mostly Aussies playing the parts of Australians (although Crowe was actually born in New Zealand and some of the Turkish characters are played by actors from Down Under). The script and the editing tell a very personal story, keep it interesting, and skillfully reveal the film's secrets.Unfortunately, this film may not be the most accessible in terms of its setting and its general story. The events depicted all took place 95-100 years ago and the Battle of Gallipoli doesn't mean much to most Americans, while in Australia and New Zealand, the date the invasion began is a holiday akin to our Memorial Day. Also, the movie gets a bit off track with some plot points that feel contrived and by making too much of Connor's special abilities, without ever explaining why he's special. Are his talents supernatural? Is he lucky? Or is he just really, really good? And, why doesn't Crowe make the answer clear? Between Connor's vaguely divine talent for divining and a highly improbable romance, this movie almost seems as much a fantasy as a drama 'inspired by true events.' It's a good first effort, Mr. Crowe, but keep working at it. 'B'",6,4,9,5 May 2015
Straight Outta Compton," 'Straight Outta Compton' almost hits the ball outta the park.
","There's a baseball expression that we've probably all heard: 'touch all the bases'. It's a reference to the rule that a player who hits a home run has to run around the entire baseball diamond and make contact with each base for the run to count. Every player comes to home plate wanting to accomplish this feat, but, over the course of the game, relatively few of them reach their goal. In order to be successful at telling its story, a movie has to touch all the bases too. A group of young men wearing baseball caps help 'Straight Outta Compton' (R, 2:27) do just that although, in this case, an instant replay may be required to verify the accomplishment.This film tells the story of the pioneering gangsta rap group N.W.A. and its five main members who rose above their circumstances on the mean streets of mid-1980s Compton, California to help create a new sub-genre within hip-hop music. Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) are spinning discs in a local club, while a friend, Ice Cube (Cube's real-life son O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), has been writing rhymes in spiral notebooks. When Dre gives Cube a chance to rap in the club, a couple other guys from their neighborhood, MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and small-time drug dealer Eazy E (Jason Mitchell), are in the club and are impressed with the music. When E bails Dre out of jail after Dre mouths off to a cop, E and Dre start talking about making something out of that music. With Cube and the others joining them, N.W.A. is formed. Cube writes, E raps and Dre produces their first song, 'Boyz-n-da-Hood' which becomes a hit.This began a relatively short, but eventful, impactful and timely run for the group. Their first problem was how to gain wider acceptance for a musical art form that few people considered music or art. The answer was a white Jewish record producer named Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti). E starts Ruthless Records with Heller, who becomes the group's manager and gets the guys their first record deal. N.W.A.'s star rises quickly. Maybe too quickly. Egos, greed and petty jealousies divide the group's members and come between them and Heller, all of which threatens all of their careers – and their growing fortunes. These problems become grudges which lead to anger, violence and the kind of tension and drama you might get in, say, game 7 of a Major League Baseball playoff series.'Straight Outta Compton' really does cover all the bases, even if it just skims the tops of some. Along with the rise and fall of N.W.A., we get very good character development of the main players (including a family tragedy for one of the characters, the death of another and Cube's developing career as an actor), and we get to see what happens to these men post-N.W.A. We're also introduced to other rappers who became popular during this period, some of which are still recording today. A few soundbites of mid-80s news clips open the film and very quick video and audio clips, carrying forward the stories of several of the characters, close the movie. In between, we some news events and commentary which give context and significance to the group's music.The problem is that the depiction of some developments is unbalanced. We see video of Rodney King being beaten by police, but there's no mention of white bystander Reginald Denny being beaten by rioters enraged over the outcome of the officers' trial. In fact, every one of the group's encounters with the LAPD (and police in other cities) is shown as confrontational, and every single police officer portrayed as racist and abusive. Understanding that their mistreatment by police is a major source of the anger that fueled N.W.A.'s music, this completely one-sided portrayal of police is as bad as recent movies 'Merchants of Doubt' making everyone who questions climate change appear unscrupulous or 'Do You Believe?' showing every atheist as depressed and immoral.Then there's the ambiguous characterization of Jerry Heller. He is shown throughout the film helping make the group successful and caring about them as individuals, but a rising distrust of him from some of the group's members culminates with a scene that leaves whether he was in fact good or bad for N.W.A. very unclear. Were all the bases touched? Yes, but it would have helped the film if all were touched with authority.But even these weaknesses don't negate what this film accomplishes. As a portrait of late 80s and early 90s rappers and the groups and record labels they created, their movement can be seen with a wider lens than in 2009's commendable, but limited 'Notorious' (about the life and death of rapper Notorious B.I.G.). As a depiction of actual events and the people who made them happen, this movie is even more powerful than impressive and dramatic movies like 1991's 'Boyz n the Hood' (which is referenced in this film's script). At the end of the day, as it takes a long, hard look at problems black Americans still deal with today, this is one of the most important movies of 2015. 'Straight Outta Compton' may not have quite hit the ball over the wall in centerfield, but an inside-the-park homerun is still pretty impressive – and gets this entertaining, informative and very relevant film an 'A-'.",8,4,31,15 August 2015
The Woman in Black," 'The Woman in Black' shines with old-school thrills and chills
","The 2012 British horror film 'The Woman in Black' (PG-13, 1:35) has a diverse heritage. The basic story first appeared in a 1983 horror novella by Susan Hill. In 1987, the story became a stage play which is still in production and has become the second longest-running non-musical play in London's West End (behind 'The Mousetrap'). A made-for-TV version debuted on British television on Christmas Eve 1989, but made minor changes to the story with which the novella's author took exception. The story was even more significantly changed for the 2012 big-screen version. But the feature film's rich pedigree goes beyond the story's adaptations and changes to the original version. 'The Woman in Black' is an old-fashioned ghost story which uses low-tech thrills and chills to maximum effect.The big-screen adaptation eliminates and condenses many of the novella's details to produce a tighter story. In his first post-Harry Potter film role, Daniel Radcliff stars as Arthur Kipps, an early-20th century English lawyer whose wife (Sophia Stuckey) died in childbirth, leaving him to raise his now 4-year-old son, Joseph (Misha Handley), as a single parent, but with the help of a nanny (Jessica Raine). Arthur's employer tells the still-grieving and ever-morose young man that his job is in serious jeopardy if he fails at his new assignment – settling the estate of a recently-deceased recluse named Alice Drablow. On the train to the small northeastern English town of Crythin Gifford, he meets a resident of the town named Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds, also a veteran of the Harry Potter franchise) who offers him a ride into town. Arthur's interactions with the locals suggest that this is either the least welcoming town in all of England, or that the townsfolk have a personal problem with Arthur or maybe a bit of both.Mrs. Drablow lived in the large, spooky-looking Eel Marsh House, a mansion that is only accessible by a long, narrow road which disappears every day at high tide. Mrs. Drablow was a widow whose adopted son drowned in the surrounding marsh years earlier, eventually leading her to hang herself in grief. Her house is filled with piles of papers that Arthur must sort through before the estate can be settled and the house can be put on the market. These papers reveal that Alice Drablow's sister (the boy's birth mother who lost custody to her sister and blamed the sister for the boy's death) was a tortured and possibly mentally-ill woman who the locals say haunts the house. They say when someone sees her ghost, a child dies. Arthur doesn't believe in all that (nor does Mr. Daily, who befriends and helps the young attorney), but there's definitely SOMETHING going on. The creeks and thumps that Arthur hears in the old house turn into crashes and screams – and the increasingly frequent appearance of a female figure dressed in funeral garb. Bad things do start to happen in the local area. Arthur has his hands full trying to do his job, figuring out what is happening in Crythin Gifford and stopping it – and doing all this before his son's nanny brings Joseph to the town to meet up with his dad at the end of the week, as Arthur had arranged before he left home.'The Woman in Black' is a throw-back, both in setting and in tone – but in a good way. The Edwardian England backdrop separates the audience from their modern horror film expectations and the unsettling old-school sights and sounds can still produce effective scares in the 21st century. The movie is scary, but it's also dark and tense, much like 'The Others' in 2001. Radcliff is convincingly troubled and carries the film very effectively. Hinds is equally troubled, but sympathetic and helpful. The actors playing the residents of Crythin Gifford make for a solid ensemble, their emotions ranging from callous indifference to frightened anger to extreme grief. The titular specter is so frightening and omnipresent that you may end up looking for her in the dark corners of your house. All this adds up to a believable story and a mystery that you'll want to see solved – plus an ending that you'll likely find both horrifying and touching.",7,2,5,16 March 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," 'Fifty Shades of Grey' explores much more than sex festishes.
","Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation – and misunderstanding – than 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (R, 2:05). What is billed and understood (at least by those who haven't read British author E. L. James' novel) as simply a story of a young woman being introduced to one man's sexual fetishes is much more – and much deeper – than one might expect. Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana – and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to 'rescue' her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different – and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance – these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say 'romance blooms' (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, 'I don't do romance.' That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the 'various physical pursuits' he says he likes and his 'singular' tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded – both emotionally and physically – by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely – sexually and otherwise – to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually 'f--- hard', as he describes it) and then shows her his 'playroom.' This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's curious.Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and 'keep an open mind.' She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like 'Boogie Nights', director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. 'B+'",7,77,133,13 February 2015
Monsters University," 'Monsters University' earns high marks
","If you don't have kids or your kids are no longer young children, you are spared having to sit through an endless parade of animated entertainment with varying degrees of actual entertainment value. But sometimes, there's a so-called 'kids' movie' that you want to see just for yourself.'Monsters University', is a prequel to the 2001 hit 'Monsters Inc.' and shows us how Mike and Sully first met and takes us down the long and winding path to them truly becoming friends. In the original, it's immediately clear how different Mike and Sully are, but meeting them as college students accentuates those differences. In this film, Mike is studious and determined, while Sully is content to rely on his natural scariness and his family legacy to get through the training to become the scarers that we know they eventually become.Since we know how the story turns out, keeping us interested along the way is a challenge. but it's a challenge well met. As the future best friends each struggle to overcome their limitations and get through their university program, we see a fun and funny portrayal of college life, monster-style. The movie ends up becoming an animated version of 'Revenge of the Nerds', but the climactic scene is especially well done. Add to all that the superior animation (which is enhanced by a pair of 3-D glasses) and the excellent voice work led by returning stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman and 'Monsters University' graduates with honors. I give it an 'A-'.",8,0,0,6 February 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," 'What We Do in the Shadows' is like a great amusement park ride that you'll want to relive again and again!
","Great comedy can come from the most unlikely of places, both in terms of location and subject matter. How about vampires? Are they funny? They can be. They've been fodder for many big-screen comedies over the years. How about a vampire comedy from, oh say, New Zealand? Believe it or not, that's the combination you get in 'What We Do in the Shadows' (NR, 1:26) – and, as the movie's poster makes clear, it is hilarious! This is a mockumentary about four vampires living together in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand. They've invited a film crew (promising not to eat them) into their house to document the vampires' daily lives (actually, nightly lives) and their preparations for the annual Unholy Masquerade ball. The vampires have a variety of backgrounds and personalities. The one who addresses the camera most is Viago (Taika Waititi, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film). He was 'a bit of a dandy' before he became a vampire three centuries ago and now basically acts as the group's housemother, calling a meeting to discuss chores, for example. Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, the other half of the film's writing-directing team) is the ladies vamp of the group and, back in the day, was much feared for his habit of 'poking people' (a winking homage to the real-life Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration for the legendary Dracula character). The group's youngest member is Deacon (Jonathan Brugh). He's less than two centuries old and he's the most impetuous of the four. Oh, and he used to be a Nazi. The fourth blood sucker is 8,000 year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham). He's the oldest of the group (looking like the vampire in the classic silent film 'Nosferatu') – and he's also the crankiest. He usually just stays in his closet. Most nights, the three youngsters of the group go out to clubs looking for victims (and sometimes harassing the local werewolves), but sometimes they have a dinner party – a phrase that takes on a whole new meaning in this case. Deacon has a human servant named Jackie (Jackie Van Beek) who helps out the housemates by doing everything from cleaning up blood that has been spilled in their house, to helping them get new victims. Deacon has promised Jackie that, after a certain period of service, he'll make her a vampire. One day Jackie brings a couple old acquaintances, named Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Katherine (Ethel Robinson) to the house for one of those dinner parties. After playing it cool for a while, and then briefly toying with their guests, they attack. They suck Katherine's blood, but Petyr gets a hold of Nick and turns him into a vampire. Nick ends up moving in to the house. The guys teach him about being a vampire (important things like – don't tell everyone that you're a vampire!) and he helps them get up to date on modern technology (including cell phones, the internet and Skype). Nick starts bringing his best friend, Stu (Stuart Rutherford) around to the house. That's usually a big no-no amongst the children of the night, but Stu takes it all in stride, and they all really like him, so they decide that it's cool. But that's not the end of the story. This situation comes to a head (along with a long-standing feud between Vlad and a rival vampire whom he calls 'The Beast') at The Unholy Masquerade. All that, along with a few zombies and other 'predeceased' creatures thrown into the mix (not to mention a pivotal encounter with that pack of werewolves) and the movie has an ending that is to die for. A lot of the comedy in 'What We Do in the Shadows' comes from the juxtaposition of the vampires' politeness and their brutality, as well as the matter-of-fact way that they talk about their lifestyle and nefarious nocturnal activities. A good example would be Jackie driving in her car, casually discussing the merits of eternal life as a vampire, or Nick talking about the ups and downs of being a vampire and ending with 'It sucks.' Whether the comedy makes you laugh out loud or you simply find it quietly amusing is a matter of individual personality, but most people seem to agree that, no matter how you define it, this movie is very funny – and very clever. It goes to show that filmmakers don't need millions of dollars, big-name stars and an elaborate story to make a quality film. A great concept, properly fleshed out (no pun intended) and a few creative and talented actors will do. This movie is like a great amusement park ride. It's scary, fun and unique – and as soon as the ride is over, you want to get right back in line and enjoy it all over again. 'A-'",8,1,7,14 March 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' features fun over-the-top plot and characters, but disturbing over-the-top violence.
","Defeating the bad guys is very important. So are manners. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' (R, 2:09) shows us how the two can go hand-inumbrella. Foiling the plans of evil-doers and being a gentleman through it all are two goals to be accomplished at all costs. Buying into that presumption makes for a fun two hours at the movies. Unfortunately, this film also suggests that revered institutions are mostly worthy of our disdain and that human life is cheap and watching many lives end in a short period of time can also be a lot of fun – and even funny. This film is a mixed bag that's hard to review, but I'm willing to give it that old college try.Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a thug. He's in his early 20s, but is leading an aimless life of petty crime in a tough part of London. He's intelligent, resourceful and has moments of selflessness, but is doing nothing constructive with those positive qualities. Instead, he blames his surroundings, his upbringing, his family troubles anything but himself for the way he lives his life. Enter Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Harry is a former colleague of Eggsy's father and seeks to repay a debt of gratitude by rescuing Eggsy from his latest scrape with the law and offering him an opportunity to become a 'gentleman spy'. Harry is actually better known as Galahad, one of a group of modern day knights called the Kingsmen, a secretive spy agency that operates 'at the highest level of discretion'. Eggsy doesn't really have anything else going on, so he agrees to give it a go.This is all part of a recruitment and selection process reminiscent of Tommy Lee Jones choosing Will Smith to join his group in the original 'Men in Black'. In 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' (based on the 2012-2013 comic book series 'The Secret Service'), Merlin (Mark Strong), the Kingsman who runs the testing and selection process, calls this 'the most dangerous job interview in the world'. Eggsy and several other potential Kingsmen are nearly drowned, forced to jump out of an airplane and then figure out what to do if one of them is without a functioning parachute, plus make very difficult choices designed to test their commitment and loyalty to the organization. As Eggsy's experience on London's mean streets keeps him in the game against his better educated and better bred competitors, he finds that some of his toughest competition comes from the group's sole remaining girl, Roxy (Sophie Cookson). Watching the recruits with great interest from the sidelines is Galahad and the head Kingsman, Arthur (Michael Caine).The attention of Galahad, Arthur and the others is understandably divided, however. One of their numbers has recently died attempting to rescue a kidnapped university professor (an unrecognizable Mark Hamill – yes, 'Star Wars' fans, THAT Mark Hamill). And that's only the beginning. Royalty, politicians and miscellaneous celebrities are disappearing all over the world. The man behind all this is billionaire tech magnate Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). But he's not planning to harm these important people whom he's gathering up. He's actually trying to save them. It's the rest of the world that has to worry. With the help of his lethal assistant, Gazelle (Sophia Boutella), a woman with knives for feet, he has a plan to 'fix' what he considers earth's biggest problem – overpopulation. The hour of his plan's execution is fast approaching and it's all hands on deck as the Kingsmen fight to prevent, what you might as well call Valentine's Day.Better than 90% of 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a lot of fun, but it's that other 10% that taints the whole thing. Using a tailor shop as a front for an organization of gentlemen spies is clever and is used to maximum effect. The over-the-top take on James Bondian service to queen and country is quite entertaining. The challenges Eggsy and the others have to negotiate in the hopes of becoming a Kingsman are exciting and Valentine's extreme solution to overpopulation makes for a great tongue-in-cheek plot. Jackson is great as a villain with a lisp, a wannabe mass murder who hates killing and can't stand the sight of blood. Egerton is well cast and Firth is convincing as a proper, yet dangerous secret agent who can kick your ass with a beer mug and an umbrella. Caine is always a pleasure to watch and I'm very happy to see more and more of Mark Strong on the big screen.I liked this movie, but I would have liked it more if it weren't for the excessive violence and institution-bashing. The movie makes out as if the Kingsmen were the ONLY honorable government institution in the world. The story makes a sport out of bashing Christians (albeit very hateful Christians) and makes political leaders all over the world – even President Obama – complicit in Valentine's evil plan. Even more disturbing, extended and vicious fights are shown in gory detail, blood flows, heads explode and many of these scenes are filmed and scored in a whimsical tone. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' sullies a good story with an unnecessary amount of bile and blood. I'm giving this film a very weak recommendation, but be advised that the extremes to which this movie goes may ruin (or at least greatly diminish) an otherwise mostly entertaining movie for you too.

Minions," 'Minions' is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.
","In 2010, Illumination Entertainment released its first animated feature film, 'Despicable Me', about an evil genius named Gru who was struggling to stay on top of the evil genius business, with the help of his pint-sized henchmen known as minions. That film made over $250 million in the U.S. alone (almost quadruple what it cost), so, naturally, there was a sequel. In 2013, 'Despicable Me 2' made over $368 million domestically and was rated by audiences as even better than the original. The minions were a small big reason for all that. They were a hit in the first film and they played a larger role in the second film, which performed even better than the first, so, naturally, they got a movie of their own.The minions are child-sized, yellow, pill-shaped creatures whose sole purpose in life is to serve an evil master. Some are a little taller than the others, they have slightly different styles of (sparse) hair, some have two eyes and some have one, but all wear goggles and they speak in a kind of child-like babble which combines English, Spanish, French and possibly bits of a few other languages too (it's kind of hard to tell). Oh, and one more thing – they're simply and completely ADORABLE! In spite of their evil inclinations, these are simple-minded, child-like innocents who mainly want to have fun and fulfill their potential as minions. And they are front and center in 'Minions' (PG, 1:31).This sequel to the 'Despicable Me' movies is really a spin-off and also a prequel, which takes us back to the beginning of the minions' story – ALL the way back. We see how the minions originated and, through a short series of vignettes, we observe their well-meaning, but hilariously botched attempts to serve a wide variety of ill-tempered masters throughout history. Finally, they are driven into exile in an ice cave in Antarctica. They build a civilization and do their best to entertain themselves, but without a master to serve, they're unbearably bored. So, in 1968, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, who does all minion voices), a tall(ish) minion, tells his tribe he's going on a quest to find them a new master. With only the extremely child-like minion (even by minion standards) named Bob, and a 'volunteer' named Stuart to help, Kevin begins his journey.The three minions end up at Villain Con, a secret convention of super villains and their fans, where the minions meet and get hired by Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the first female supervillain. Scarlet is taking her typical girlish fantasy of being a princess a little too seriously. She wants her newly-hired helpers to steal the British crown jewels so she can be Queen of England. Scarlet's husband, Herb (John Hamm) sets up Kevin, Stuart and Bob with a variety of his evil inventions and they embark on their mission. Of course, this being the minions, nothing goes according to plan, one thing leads to another, Scarlet feels as if the minions have betrayed her, and she sets out to get revenge on Kevin, Stuart and Bob, while still trying to accomplishing her goal. Meanwhile, the rest of the minions have received word that Kevin has found them a new master in the U.K. and the entire tribe is working to get there ASAP.'Minions' has a slightly different target audience than the 'Despicable Me' films and feels like a little too much of a good thing. Don't get me wrong – I LOVE me some minions, but they're schtick can wear thin. Even their powerful minion cuteness can't sustain an entire film. Plus, while the 'Despicable Me' movies seemed to appeal nearly equally to kids, teens and adults, the minions' spin-off is more squarely aimed at kids. The animation, voice work and story are all as strong as the previous films in which the minions appeared, but the humor in this one aims a little lower. The adults will enjoy the soundtrack and there are plenty of cute, clever, and funny moments. 'Minions' works well as a family movie, but I think the little yellow guys should stick to being fun, naughty side-kicks. It's what they do best. 'B+'",7,9,16,10 July 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is wild, over-the-top fun.
","In 1979, a bleak and violent film set in a dystopian future was released in Australia, with a then 23-year-old actor named Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson as its star. We hear that that Mel Gibson guy did pretty well for himself, and his first major film made quite a splash too. 'Mad Max' held the record as the most profitable film in history (comparing budget to box office) for two decades, and spawned sequels in 1982 ('Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior') and 1985 ('Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'), and 30 years later with 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (R, 2:00) – and more are planned. The 'Mad Max' franchise has influenced countless dystopian films, inspired directors and musicians and become the basis for video games and entertainment properties as diverse as a WCW PPV event and an episode of 'Rugrats'.Meanwhile, the 'Mad Max' films themselves have gotten bigger, bloodier and bleaker. The budget for the second film was ten times that of the first and the budget for the 2015 version was fifteen times that of the 1985 version. As the series has progressed, the bigger budgets have allowed for more spectacular visual effects, more elaborate props and more impressive set pieces, as well as more violence and the depiction of a steady decline of the human condition in the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max. But after all is said and done, the only question that matters is whether the time and money that has gone into 'Mad Max: Fury Road' was well-spent – and whether we should be looking forward to the sequels.At the beginning of the fourth entry into the franchise, Max (Tom Hardy) is still trying to survive alone in a world where civilized society has now completely disappeared. He's captured by the War Boys, an army of young men with painted white skin who believe that their power to fight is enhanced by the blood of other strong men. The War Boys fight for King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who rules his corner of the globe by rationing the only water in the region and he preserves his power through complete control of all available vehicles and the gas needed to run them. Immortan Joe keeps everyone in his realm dependent on him for their very survival and he treats the War Boys as his own private army whose loyalty he preserves by promising them an afterlife in Valhalla if they die fighting for him. Besides all that, selected men are used as blood banks for his warriors and women are used as breeders and sources of milk.In a setting like this, it should come as no surprise that a very strong female character is as important to the plot as the title character. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has escaped the fate of every other female in Immortan Joe's realm by being a tough and smart servant of the king. She drives his heavily armored war wagon, a vehicle which is designed to carry and protect the gasoline that the War Boys help procure from nearby communities. Furiosa may be considered privileged, but she is not happy about her lot in life and she develops a plan to break free from the pack and do some good. She turns one of her gas runs into a run for the border, if you will. Furiosa drives her war wagon west toward the place where she was born and stolen away from many years before. She's heading to 'the Green Place', as she calls it, but she's also smuggling some of Immortan Joe's most prized possessions in that war wagon. When he catches on, he pursues her, with the help of his regional allies and his own army of War Boys, one of which is the especially devoted Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who has Max chained to the front of his vehicle and connected to him by a rubber tube, making Max into a personal portable blood bank. Things don't go according to plan for anyone involved and there are multiple violent confrontations among the main characters as they crisscross this vast wasteland in a deadly game of cat and mouse.'Mad Max: Fury Road' creates a world that can be as upsetting as it is fascinating. This film is something of an assault on the senses, but is a truly engaging experience. The action is virtually non-stop, while the various design elements and the cinematography are truly remarkable. Frenetic action and explosions of color are occasionally punctuated with an eerie quiet and practically monochromatic scenes, which are beautiful in their simplicity. The vehicles, weapons and clothing that these futuristic communities have cobbled together from the remains of civilized society's industrial production are both frightening and fascinating to behold. And the characters' personalities are just as colorful. It's very clear that Max has his issues, but almost everyone he encounters is madder than he is. At times, this film is almost too much to take in as it goes somewhat over the top with its action sequences and, for lack of a better word, with its freakiness. But there is no denying that director and co-writer George Miller, the man who co-wrote and directed (or co-directed) all three previous 'Mad Max' films, has brought to the modern screen a unique, coherent and engaging post-apocalyptic vision which will remain in your head long after you leave the movie theater.

Furious 7," 'Furious 7' is one of the best action movies - ever.
","This is Paul Walker's final film. That's the armored truck in the room when talking about 'Furious 7' (PG-13, 2:17), so I might as well address it up front. During a break from filming this installment, franchise regular Paul Walker died in a single-car crash on November 30, 2013. While mourning his loss, the film's producers set out to alter the script and make a plan to finish the movie without one of their most important characters. Walker had completed filming most of his dialog before his death. Four men similar in physique to Walker, including his brothers, Caleb and Cody, were hired to help complete Walker's scenes. All that, with a little CGI help, has produced a film which is likely to please action film fans and Paul Walker fans the world over.This film's story begins at the end of the last film, 'Fast & Furious 6' (2013). The last scene in that film has someone killing Han (Sung Kang) on the streets of Tokyo and immediately making a phone call saying, 'You don't know me. You're about to.' Early in 'Furious 7' we see that the recipient of that call was none other than Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), the only character to appear in all seven movies. The villain making the call is Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the older brother of the man who Dominic and company defeated and left for dead in the previous film. Immediately after the call, a package explodes, destroying the home of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their young son. All three of them (along with Dominic) narrowly escape being killed, as does Luke, whom Shaw attacked at work. As Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) says to Roman (Tyrese Gibson) at Han's funeral, 'We're being hunted.' Indeed they are. They need to get to Shaw before he can get any more of them.A mysterious government agent (Kurt Russell), who simply refers to himself as 'Mr. Nobody' can help Dominic's gang, but Nobody needs something in return. A terrorist named Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) has stolen a computer chip that Nobody refers to as 'God's Eye' and also kidnapped the program's designer, known only as 'Ramsey' (Nathalie Emmanuel). God's Eye can use 'anything with a lens or a microphone' (surveillance cameras, cell phones, etc.) and facial recognition software to find anyone in the world. Mr. Nobody tells Dominic that, if his gang can retrieve the computer chip, then he can use it to find Shaw. Dom agrees and Nobody assembles Dom's crew, including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who is still struggling to regain the memory she lost in a major accident earlier in the series. The quest for the chip and, ultimately for the chance to kill Shaw before he kills all of them, takes this 'family', as Dom calls them, to Azerbaijan, Abu Dhabi and back home to Los Angeles. Along the way, the gang find themselves in all manner of deadly situations. Anyone who has seen the movie's theatrical trailer can tell that the action is the wildest yet, and can only guess that there's a lot more where that came from. (They'd be guessing right.) Not only is the action in 'Furious 7' the best in the franchise to date, so is the film. Sure, some of the dialog can be a bit hokey and the beatings the characters take should either kill them or land them in the hospital right next to The Rock's character, but that's all part of the fun. The film's plot allows us to see the characters in a variety of exciting chase scenes, intense fight scenes and practically impossible scenes of 'vehicular warfare', all while dealing with some serious real life situations. I meant real life as in the lives of their characters, but the movie also deftly handles the real life human tragedy of Walker's untimely passing. When I reviewed the previous entry of this franchise, I gave it a 'B+' and wrote 'with the possibility of an even higher grade for the next one, based on the last scene of this one.' I got what I hoped for. 'Furious 7' is one of the best action movies – ever. 'A'",9,2,6,3 April 2015
