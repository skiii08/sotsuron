The Blair Witch Project," If you see a 100,000 movies this year make sure this isn't one of them.
","'The Blair Witch Project' has got to be the dumbest movie of all horror movies.I saw this movie after all the hype about it being really scary and that you'll have nightmares for the rest of your life.NOT!I couldn't believe how much was missing from this film like plot and performance. All it has is a girl who can't control herself,a guy who's really easy to scare, and one who's totally clueless. I urge you not to see this movie. Oh by the way, it's not a true story.",Null,0,1,20 October 2000
Duck Soup," RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!
","This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen!There are so many gags that you'll have trouble keeping track, and the one-liners that Groucho Marx keeps punching out are amazing and clever. This may also be one of Harpo Marx's best skits ever, especially the mirror sequence and the peanut stand.Rent this movie,you will enjoy it.",Null,0,0,21 October 2000
