The Ring," Absurdly scary..
","This movie had the hair on my skin prickling every scene.. Even the scenes which aren't overtly shocking are darkly ominous. Ghastly imagery in both the faces of the damned and the video itself.. It is TERRIFYING. See it in the theater, I've got a feeling that this won't translate to video well. There's something about being in a dark room with a big screen with people you don't know that makes you vulnerable. Which means that this movie will absolutely rend you. See it.",10,0,0,24 October 2002
