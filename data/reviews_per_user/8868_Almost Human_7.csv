The Ring," Something Unexpected
","I was so excited when I heard about The Ring, and that Gore Verbinski was the director to it. I went into the theater expecting to see a tight suspenseful film, on the lines of Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath. Instead I was left with an empty feeling and a 'so-what' attitude towards the film. The film is full of holes and unanswered questions, it left me unimpressed.",Null,0,0,10 November 2002
Fight Club," A Visual Experiance
","'Fight Club' is one of those films that was sadly promoted wrong, the advertisments made this film out to be a bloody-fist fight mess wich granted some parts are but very few parts.  The majority of the film is about Jake (Edward Norton) a lonley, depressed man who hates his job and his life, to escape this reality he creates an altered ego Tyler Durden played marvousley by Brad Pitt.  David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) is a genius in visual filmmaking and he diffently makes it known in this film! From the amazing 'brain traveling' credits to the barrel of the gun, and of course who could forget the plane crash sequence... trust me rent it or buy it ASAP!!! You will NOT regret it.",10,0,1,9 May 2000
The 13th Warrior," Sweet but not so neat
","This film had some sweet part to it but lacked story wise.  It needed more of a plot and more interaction between the people.  This was also not one of Antonio Banderas's better films, I enjoyed him in Zorro but his acting was poorly done in this film.  If you enjoy senseless action by all means see it, if you are like me and like the action to make sense then don't.",Null,0,0,11 September 1999
The Fifth Element," One of the best!
","I have read the reviews and comments but when I saw this film I was blown away.  Luc Besson best known for his films; 'Le Femme Nikita' and 'The Professional' has out done himself again.  An incredible journey from the past to the future, excellent F/X and the direction is superb, and hats off to composer Eric Serra!",Null,0,1,30 May 1999
American History X," A Truly Remarkable Film
","I new about American History X when it was in theaters, I heard how great and truly inspiring it was, but I finally saw it for the first time on DVD and I had no idea how true those statements were!!! This is true cinema at its finest.  The suspense and intense is done so perfectly, I have never seen anything like this before!!!!",10,0,0,30 July 2000
The Evil Dead," The Best Horror Movie Ever!!
","I was only 6 when this was first released in theaters, so I was unable to see the film do to age restriction. I never missed it when it was on cable/TV! When I was old enough I saw the complete and unedited NC-17 version, and must say that I feel in love with it all over again.  This is truly 'The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror' and has spawned to sequels 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army Of Darkness' and both are as good as the first.  In my opinion this is the BEST horror flick ever!!!",Null,0,0,2 February 2001
Contact," Simple Amazing!!!
","'Contact' did not get the attention it deserved!!! This film is so brillant and just simply amazing! Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) has given us another marvel, the special effects in this film is outstanding the commentary on the Laserdisc and DVD relase is extraordinary and it reveals a lot about the special effects even ones you thought were not F/X.  Jodie Foster gives a stunning performance, as so does the rest of the cast.  Robert Zemeckis has brought Sagan's dream into a reality so to speak, and Alan Silvrestri's score is truly amazing and frightening.  Go see this film there's no doubt you'll be impressed.",Null,0,1,10 July 1999
