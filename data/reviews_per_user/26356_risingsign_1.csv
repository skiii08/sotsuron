The New World," It's not about what people say, it's about what people do
","I disagree with the previous reviewer - you CAN 'tell a story with just glances/glares/smiles/frowns/etc'. And this film did it beautifully.The dialogue was almost inconsequential - in fact, quite often it was delivered so softly or incoherently that you couldn't follow it anyway. Not a problem. It's the feelings and impressions of the main characters that are 'the story', not their words. For instance, when John Smith does speak his words lead him astray - his talk of 'dream' and 'reality' drawing him ever away from Pocahontas.I came away from the film quite satisfied that I 'understood' the main characters, with the exception of John Smith - which was probably the intention, as he didn't seem to understand himself.A beautiful, moving and captivating film - highly recommended.",8,1,4,15 April 2006
