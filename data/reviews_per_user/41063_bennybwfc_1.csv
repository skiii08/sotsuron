Ford v Ferrari," Amazing movie even if you ain't into racing
","Went into this movie knowing almost nothing at all. I knew the two main actor, Christian bale and Matt Damon and that it was a true story about a race between Ford Vs Ferrari in a le mans 1996 race but I had no idea what happened or how it went down! However this movie was amazing for me and it told a story which was oh so much more than just a race. The chemistry between the two load roles were fantastic and really shined through, not even scared to say I may of shed a little tear during this movie! Defitnaly worth a watch for anyone who wants to be inspired.",9,5,11,16 November 2019
