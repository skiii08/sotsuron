3:10 to Yuma," Crappy movie
","Only one thing defines the whole movie. Spoiler alert. The scene where Christian bale brings Russell Crowe to the train after a lot of tough decisions, and at last puts him into the train cage in the middle of the gun battle. This is in the middle of a gun battle with bullets flying everywhere, Christian bale turns his back to the gun fire to say goodbye to a convict he is sending to jail by putting his life at stake. 'Turning your back' to gunfire is making everything in the movie useless. What is the point of the movie, even if it was a remake. Time to retire, if basic logic evades you. If you want us to believe your premise and unrealistic sense of a convict helping his capture, please throw us a bone, keep the simple stuff logical. Acting is okay, but when things like this fail to come through, all over the movie it stinks.",1,1,3,29 September 2012
