The Ring," Help...
","Oh My God.I went to the theater having read and heard a lot about this movie, so my expectations were pretty high.I really almost s*** my pants. I haven't been this scared during a movie since The Others. The only difference is: The Others stops being scared when the movie's over. The Ring haunted me for at least a week. Because seven days later I actually got scared again, thinking: 'Crap, at what time did I see the movie? How long do I have?' Luckily I survived.Go and see this. Be sure to pick a date and time when the chance of being in a theater full of highschool kids is minimal. It will ruin a lot if you're a person like my who likes to 'expirience' a movie. Children tend to resort to laughter when emotions get too big to handle.I can't say very much about the Japanese original(s), but I've heard they are even scarier, so I don't know if I'll be able to sit them through...One definite advantage the Hollywood version has though is Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive fans, eat your heart out.",10,1,1,15 March 2003
Fight Club," Define the 90's
","I would like to illustrate the meaning of Fight Club in my opinion together with another work of art from the last decade.Fight Club and OK Computer (Music Album) by Radiohead are THE masterpieces of the 90's.They completely define the society of that period(*). The shallowness of 'normal life'. Fight Club: 'I am Jack's complete lack of surprise' Radiohead: 'No alarms and no surprises'The way that women have taken a different position in society which leaves men inconfident and unsure of the role they should or can fullfill.The lost generation with nothing to fight for, post-cold war. (*I deliberately wrote 'that period' and not 'today' for we all know that this decade has gotten a very different taste since about 1 year ago...)The consumer-society driven by the media telling everybody what to buy and how much.I could go on for ages with themes the movie covers, but won't because I don't have the time and you should probably figure them out for yourself.
If you can ofcourse that is, because I have read some terrible negative reviews here about this movie that really want to make me fight those who wrote them. I mean, sure the movie wasn't flawless, but how come it is that when people write negative reviews they never seem to have valid arguments.I've read things like:'It was boring''Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot''Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title''Shallow characters''Bad acting''The 'twist' is just plain stupid''A very average movie completely lacking in the 'meaning''Arguments that are either pathetic and inconcievably dumb or just untrue. It makes me sad.If you lack the intelligence to understand a movie like this, just shut up. Don't watch this stuff, go rent The Gladiator or Pearl Harbor, those movies were made specially for you.Thank you.P.S. if you DID like the topic of this movie I would like to suggest watching A Clockwork Orange and American Psycho, which movies are absolutely not the same as Fight Club, but are somewhat related.",10,0,2,27 September 2002
