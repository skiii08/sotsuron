Blade Runner 2049," Replicants of the replicants
","This movie should have never been made, at least not under the Blade Runner franchise. The original, even tough veeeery loosely based on a short story by F K Dick, was actually quite original and groundbreaking for the cinematography of the time. This one, 'the sequel', has a very shallow and predictable story / plot, trying to mimic some of the atmosphere of the Blade Runner of 1982 and make it 'genuine' by using state-of-the art CGI and some artsy-like design have instead made the entire movie look and feel like a cheap Canadian (no offense intended) Sci-Fi TV series from the 90s. Also, very ambiguous at best, the viewers are forced to believe that Decard was actually a human falling in love with a replicant (facepalm). Did Ridley actually make this film at all O_o 
If some people of the younger generation believe this to be a masterpiece it's simply because they haven't witnessed anything genuine and raw from Hollywood in the last 20 years or so and have nothing to compare it with. IMHO, if the movie was made as a single, out-of-franchise flick, then it would deserve a solid 5* and would unavoidably be compared to Blade Runner as being influenced by. However, this is a solid 2* kino :/",2,2,4,29 December 2017
