Despicable Me 2," Worth watching
",I just watched the movie today with my family. This simply had me laughing the whole time. I found really touching and lovely the picturing of Gru's struggles and deals with being now a good guy and being a father at the same time. The introduction of charismatic characters such as the villain and Lucy Wilde made the movie pretty enjoyable. And then there's the minions. Those little yellow fellows helps through the movie a lot. Few laughs really come from their account and never fail to keep the crowd entertained and rolling on the floor with their adorable clumsiness and crazy ideas. I would recommend this for all the family.,Null,0,0,6 July 2013
The Conjuring," Hell of a movie
","I'm a big horror-movies fan. And, to be honest, my standards of a good horror movie are really high, it is hard for me to get scared in one. This movie had me yelping and grabbing on to something. I was so surprised it actually took many good scares out of me. As the warnings say, this movie is not for everyone. Only after the movie ended, I was able to realize how much psychological scares they give you here. I started imagining noises and movements around my room. I loved the acting. They all seemed so real and made you believe the whole thing. The calmness of the movie contrasts a lot with the scares they give you, and that, for me, is awesome. If you're really looking forward to watching a great horror movie that stays with you even after you finish watching it, this is definitely the movie for you.",9,0,2,7 August 2013
Monsters University," Delightful
","This movie brings back the characters we loved from the previous one and gives us a nice throwback to their beginnings. Typical college-laughs and situations that can be extremely related to reality makes both kids and adults enjoy and laugh from the very first minute to the end. A very G rated approach to college life sytle with the bully-juggies, the studying guy, pretty girls, outcasts, goths amongst many others. Pixar really never fails to amaze me. Like in their previous movies, every little detail is thought and applied form the main characters to the background settings of the movie. An absolute go-see. Oh, and parents, don't go and throw your children to the movies, you might as well enjoy it!",9,10,15,24 June 2013
