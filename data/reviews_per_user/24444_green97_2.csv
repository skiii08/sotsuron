Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poor character development, great effects
","Some would say the CGI effects were not as good as models. No way... they were awesome. The character development was poor, however, and you end up not really caring much for the characters. The acting in some places is just plain bad, and overall I think the movie is too geared toward kids.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Dark City," Underrated, excellent
",A pity that this film did not do very well... it is excellent. I loved Jennifer Connelly in this: my question was why the soft focus when she was in shot -- you can notice it the first couple of times she appears by herself in a shot.This movie sits alongside my copy of the Crow as one of the few movies I own. Love the goldfish scene.,Null,0,1,17 November 1998
