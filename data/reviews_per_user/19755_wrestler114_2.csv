The Ring," CaCa
",The movie was doo-doo...it wasn't even scary and the plot was pretty dumb...oh well though...I went and saw it because 'it's the scariest movie of the year' yeah right.  'Signs' was much spookier and scarier than The Ring.,3,0,0,27 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Much Better
","Episode II is much better than Episode I.  The action, acting, story, and even Jar Jar (note that I still hate Jar Jar) was better.  Though Jar Jar messed everything up for the entire galaxy thats ok, this is a must see and I give it 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up.",9,0,0,17 May 2002
