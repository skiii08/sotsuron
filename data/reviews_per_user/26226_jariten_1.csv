Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wonderful
","I must say that i'm amazed that the reviews here seem to be uniformly negative. Lucas had an almost impossible task and the result is wonderfully inventive, exicting and imaginative. Where to begin?*Direction: So refreshing to see a director attempt an approach that hasn't been utalised in recent memory. The jump-cuts he uses tie the various strands of the film together beautifully, making for a tight plot and satisfying climax.*Plot: Amazingly fluid and inventive. The Palpatine/Sidoious plot is intelligent and well executed- people are obviously afraid of having to go into a movie and actually think, to puzzle stuff out for themselves.*Characterisation: The subtlety in character development means that it only really comes into effect on 3rd or 4th viewing. Needless to say- Qui Gon steals the show with his noble Jedi of ambigious morals, but Shmi, Watto, Anakin, Obi-Wan and Palpatine in particular are all excellent. Just because the characters aren't shouting at the screen a la A New Hope doesn't mean they don't exist.There's so much more to this film than the SFX laden film so many make it out to be. It's requires time to see it again and again but this *is* Star Wars after all. Roll on Episode II.",Null,0,0,8 April 2001
