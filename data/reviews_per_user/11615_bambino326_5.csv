Alien 3," Sad
","I am a huge fan of the Alien series. That is, up to when I saw Alien3. The movie is so tortured by bad graphics, lame acting, and a plot that just isn't up to standards, that it shouldn't even be added into the Alien franchise. So many things are overlooked throughout the movie, that I feel that the director didn't even really try. I mean, come on! You are making an Alien movie. It should carefully be considered and thought through, not just thrown out there like some teen slasher flick. And this is very disappointing. Why wouldn't you spend time on a movie that has such high standards, and should be one of the best movies at the time. But instead, the director decided to just make a very mediocre movie (and that's being nice). I really wish that it could have been better, but it's not. Too bad.",5,504,557,28 February 2005
United 93," Brilliant and Heartbreaking
","United 93, a film about one of the four hijacked planes on September 11, 2001 is a terrifyingly realistic look into the morning of that tragic, and yet heroic, day in American history.From beginning to end, United 93 seems to be happening in real time. With acting that is so genuine that you are absorbed into the horrifying experience that the characters are going through.Character development is minimal, with no back-story for anyone on the plane. The connection made to the people is found through phone calls they make to their family, friends and loved ones and through the dialogue, which is authentic and captivating.Acting is superb, with no big names or high profile actors cast in any role. Even some real U.S. Military Air Traffic Controllers were used to play parts essential in understanding the reality of how confusing and hectic it was for everyone to grasp what was actually happening in those few heart wrenching hours.Director Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy and Bloody Sunday) has made a masterpiece of a movie. While sometimes, especially towards the end of the film, camera movements are erratic and the hand-held cameras used inside the plane is almost disorienting, it captures the frantic pace at which everything must have happened on board United 93 during its last minutes of flight.What this movie truly comes down to, though, is the heroic and unbelievable story of the passengers aboard Flight 93, who did something that was not only incredibly brave but also undoubtedly lifesaving.The actions taken aboard that plane and the catastrophic events of that day should never be forgotten by the American people.United 93 is not an exploitation of the events of 9/11, but an account of the happenings of that appalling day and the actions taken by the hero's flying onboard that flight. It is the right time for people to begin to remember and commemorate the hero's of September 11 with films such as this one.An achievement in every aspect, United 93 is just as gut wrenching as it is saddening and breathtaking. This movie is a must see that cannot be overlooked.",10,0,2,8 May 2006
Full Metal Jacket," One of a Kind
","This movie will always be remembered on the internet and comedies as 'the show that had that guy that swore a whole lot'. And this disappoints me very much. Although everyone who has ever seen the movie knows that it is a classic film that will never be doubled in any way possible, there are still many people who just know it as the film with many words you shouldn't say in front of your mom. Although this is disappointing, it is necessary to the movies success to have so much vulgarity in it, because without it... how would it be a Vietnam movie? This is undoubtedly the 2nd best Vietnam movie ever made, and I know how that sounds. But when you are second to 'Platoon', then it isn't all that bad. After watching this movie, you will be in awe. Why? Simply because it has such lasting power that it will always be in your mind when you think about war.The movie looks at the war through the soldier's eyes. From boot camp to the front lines. The movie will show you emotion, integrity, bravery, heart, but most of all, a look at war that people have yet to see. Where small girls fight for their country just to survive, and where young men fight for reasons that they cannot even understand. This is what the movie surrounds. The conflicts of the soldiers, not the war itself. That's why this movie will always be a one of a kind classic that everyone must see.",9,3,6,28 February 2005
Grindhouse," An Unrivaled Movie-going Experience
","With countless remakes, sequels and rehashes seen at the movie theaters in recent years, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's 'Grindhouse', an over the top double feature, is a very refreshing movie going experience that actually warrants a ten to twelve dollar admission fee. With two suspenseful full length feature films and several hilarious fake trailers in between, this movie is guaranteed to satisfy both the nostalgic fan boys of 1970's and '80's grind house theatergoing experience as well as anyone who is up for some non-stop entertainment that manages to keep audiences intrigued even with an over three hour running time.Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' is the first of the two films and starts the grind house experience off incredibly. This zombie movie is a violent, laugh filled saga about a town that becomes overrun with contaminated, undead humans. The film never takes itself too seriously, as unbelievable plot lines are necessary in creating Rodriguez's almost spoof-like experience of 70's and 80's horror movies, with missing reels and all. A main character with an automatic machine gun for a leg would seem ridiculous at first, yet is surprisingly cool, unique and funny.The gore, action and humor of 'Planet Terror' is followed up by Tarantino's 'Death Proof', an intelligent slasher flick where the murderer uses his car instead of a knife. A huge change from the previous film, this one is all about suspense and anticipation, riddled with witty, clever dialogue that is humorous and entertaining. The car stunts throughout this portion of 'Grindhouse' are done completely without CGI and will make your jaw drop because of how impressive they are.While both story lines differ substantially, the overall feel of each separate film remains the same. The prestigious directors actually went as far as to 'age' the films by adding scratches, dirt and dust, which creates a movie viewing experience unique to any other seen in past years. Tarantino and Rodriguez's faithfulness to the late 1970 grind house theaters is remarkably enjoyable and so different from any other type of movie which has been released recently that the intentional B-movie scripts are overlooked.The fake movie trailers in between the 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof' are brilliantly made, spoofing the way trailers use to be thirty years ago, and do so with such hilarity. Also created by famous horror directors such as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth and Edgar Wright, trailers for the 'Thanksgiving', 'Don't', 'Machete' and 'Werewolf Women of the S.S.' are purposely vulgar and ridiculous in order to have audiences laughing the entire time they preview what is suppose to be an actual movie.It has been an incredibly long time since a movie has been released that manages to escape every set genre of film and create its own personal identity. 'Grindhouse' does this by not only being two horror movies in one, but also by never taking itself too seriously and incorporating such unique elements as missing reels and fake trailers. This underrated, over the top double features is truly something to behold, and most definitely worth the price of an admission ticket.",10,1,4,18 April 2007
Casino Royale," Bond is back and better than ever
","Casino Royale marks the twenty-first return of the quintessential stylish spy, James Bond, and does so with so much enthralling action and engrossing story that you will find it hard to look away from screen for even a second of this unique action thriller. Based on Ian Flemming's first novel about the super cool MI6 agent written in 1953, the film captivates audiences by bringing a type of Bond movie that has not been seen before.Controversial choice for the new James, Daniel Craig, gives a stunning performance and proves his worth as one of the best Bonds of all time. He maintains the character's main traits of being smooth with women and keeping cool under pressure, but adds a level of humanity to the man in black as he struggles with the demands his new double 0 status requires.Up and coming actress Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, Bond's beautiful leading lady. Audience members feel a real connection with Vesper, as well as other characters, because acting throughout the film is absorbingly superb.Casino Royale does not follow the usual Bond formula. While high tech computers and tracking devices are used throughout, gadgets such as laser watches are hard to find in this realistic story. There are no gun turrets or rocket launchers that pop out of the hood of Bond's classic Aston Martin DB5 or his brand new Aston Martin DBS. The absence of such formulaic elements does not take away from the film, but rather gives it individuality from other movies in the series.The story is a major selling point in Casino Royale, as the unbelievable story lines from the previous movies is replaced by one that is compelling and realistic. James Bond has just gained his 007 status and is on his first mission. He's not out to save the world, but to stop a banker from winning a poker game. A slight understanding of poker terms helps during the intense poker scenes or else such expressions as fold, raise, check and all in will be lost on the audience. Casino Royale is not merely a two hour film about a poker game, as exquisite action and chase scenes are found throughout which are so well done that you will most likely stop blinking for ten minutes at a time. Daniel Craig rivals Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton for being Ian Flemming's definitive James Bond. He plays an amazing egotistic main character that is not bland or one-layered as some previous actors have portrayed the famous spy to be.Director Martin Campbell seems to do little wrong throughout the picture, as special effects are nearly flawless and camera angles and movements do not try anything special but are nevertheless pleasing to the eye. Campbell has made one of the best Bond movies of all time that is bound to entertain and captivate movie viewers everywhere.",10,1,3,21 November 2006
