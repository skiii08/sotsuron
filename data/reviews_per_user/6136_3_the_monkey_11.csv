Requiem for a Dream," Faultless but intense and memorable!
","This film was 'sold to me' at the time as amazing by a friend who I think wanted to teach me a lesson. I watched this film with a friend and to start it was all good fun and giggles but by the end of it we were literally speechless.... Ignoring the fact that it's imaculately acted and made I give it ten stars purely for the impact it had on me as a person, how it made me 'feel' and the intensity of those feelings and how they have lasted with me for literally EVER! It's a scary film teaching a valuable lesson....",10,0,0,9 July 2018
It," LOVE IT! But wish it was a tad scarier
","Awesome film, the guy sat next Tuesday me made me laugh because he was literally jumping all over the pace and close to tears, you can't fake that! Personally I found it a bit jumpy and loved it, acting was faultless and story amazing, I just can't give it tent stars though... Ten stars is faultless, nothing needed chaninf, it was perfect and I didn't feel that. I wanted to feel like the guy next to me, so personally something was missing....still, brilliant film and the clown was just brilliant!!",9,1,1,10 July 2018
Hereditary," Drama that makes no real sense
","As a horror it makes no real sense and just leaves you feeling you've wasted your time, as a drama it was pretty good if you like that sort of thing.
It's like wicker man but with less everything, good acting though which almost makes it more annoying as you're expecting it step it up but when it does it's just pretty random with a loose link to something but then everything goes out the window and it's all just completely
odd, frustrating and weird but not in a good way... just random...
Good acting, good drama, poor explanation, sense or ending really, I feel like I wasted my time. Build up (drama) was good though, ending could have been from a different film.
5 was for acting/suspense and drama as it kept me thinking, although I was thinking because I was expecting horror/thriller/mystery and how it was going to fulfill, hence I was ultimately dissatisfied....",4,3,6,21 August 2018
Memento," Best film ever
","You will love it or hate it, personally it's my best film of all time. Ignoring the basics such as acting and production which are faultless the story and how it's portrayed onto screen is just awesome!!! I love how clever this film is and how it portrays just how fragile the human psyche and powerful the human drive is....",10,1,1,9 July 2018
Deadpool 2," Doesn't disappoint and doesn't feel like a sequel
","Just as good as dead pool 1, enough said really.... Josh Brolin is slowly becoming one of my favourite actors",9,1,3,9 July 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," I can't fault this
","If I am Honest I don't think this is the best Marvel film, I prefer other Marvel films (which I rated lower) but ranking this film on its own merits I really don't see how they could have made Ragnarok any better and isn't that what a 10star should be?",10,2,7,9 July 2018
Interstellar," Hands down most amazing film I have ever seen at the cinema
","I was blown away by this film, the sound, the music, the experience!! It was amazing but I couldn't recreate it at home, I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see this at the cinema, it was just amazing and spun me right out in such a good way!",10,2,2,9 July 2018
Split," Acting masterclass
","Absolutely amazing, James McVoy is amazing, the subtleties and nuances in his performance are beyond great!",10,0,2,10 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Unexpectedly amazing!!!!
","I was bought a ticket at the cinema for this film and didn't really want to go. Don't get me wrong I love Marvel, I love DC more but everything Marvel is good and worth a watch but I thought this film was a step too far for the cinema, I couldn't really be bothered after Black Panther, another Marvel movie, groan....... Anyway, the actually film was flipping amazing!!!! There was none of the back stories or build ups or fluff pieces it was just a load of super heroes kicking backside!!!! Thor just owned it to be honest, Iron Man is awesome and my favourite character, Downey Junior carries the character now to be honest, they just keep increasing his powers probably to match these super duper evil guys but I dont think they need to, he is awesome as he is without extra nano super ridiculous hammer tech!! Make the armour harder and the beams more powerful to be honest or something, he doesn't need guardians of the galaxy god powers manipulating his suit. 
Anyway, the film is the beat yet even though I didn't want to see it, THOR rocks.",10,1,6,10 July 2018
Iron Man," Would have been a 10 if the final baddy was good enough
",The only that stopped this from being a 10 was a better baddy at the ending. Just awesome!!,9,0,0,9 July 2018
Deadpool," Made for the part and cannot fault it
","When Ryan Reynolds originally played dead pool in that wolverine movie I saw flashes of excellwnce, I have see all of Ryan Reynolds movies (Blade Trinity and 'Coolege' being the most obvious) and was screaming for a film to be made which was true to dead pool using Ryan Reynolds, i don't think they could have done the character any better justice, the films awesome, funny and simply true to character!!!",10,0,1,9 July 2018
