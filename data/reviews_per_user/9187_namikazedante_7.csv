The Equalizer," What was the point again?
","This movie is lifted up by the presence of Denzel & Chloe but when the action starts it just feel like something is missing and the slow-motion moments is used way too much. It just feels like there is no point to this whole movie. And I tried to get it why Robert (Denzel Washington) did what he did. But nope I was completely lost all the time and even at the end when the kingpin in Russia asked the same question , why? And I first thought Denzel would say; Uh, I don't know.I mean he didn't even know the little girl, and didn't even trust her enough to tell her what happened to his wife etc. Nope it just felt like another brainless go in and kill everyone. And I don't get it at the end all over sudden he couldn't take down one guy? Nope this movie was all over the place so yeah I was really disappointed.",4,11,21,24 October 2017
John Wick," Think I hyped this movie too much !?
","For people who just heard or seen the photos of Keanu Reeves from this movie and thought yeah this maybe is a good flick. And then reading about it about being the most underrated movie of the year and so on. Yeah I was one of those. And it was kinda a letdown actually. I don't think I hyped it too much but it just seemed like a good action movie and The letdown is hands down the story. But not bad writing, it's more how they presented it in the movie. Strange way on how they did it and it is very clear they just tried to jam it in as fast as they could so they could do brainless action all the way. Keanu Reeves acting , there's nothing wrong with it. I loved that part but everything else with the movie was just a snore. I mean this thing that have been way overplayed about showed the end first and then go back to the beginning. Don't you just hate that? It was cool the first time but now you see it all the time in TV shows and movies and even video games and yes I think I am not alone when I say; Just stop. Just stop. This movie is enjoyable yes. But The beginning was so slow I almost turned it off and said to myself; Oh well another movie that didn't lived up to what I expected, sigh. Good things with the movie: + Keanu Reeves+ Willem Dafoe + The fighting scenes (with guns)The Bad: <ul><li>The story</li></ul><ul><li>The focus on brainless Hollywood action instead of a good story</li></ul><ul><li>Stupid bad guys (obviously stupid, even more stupid than an old Arnold movie)</li></ul><ul><li>The slow start</li></ul><ul><li>The reason for this movie </li></ul>And the last one 'reason for this movie' it's painfully obvious this movie was made to do a brainless action movie because that is what it became when they just tossed away the story for action. Sure it is very done well (the gun scenes) but I want some real story and some story I can think about after seeing this but nope. Frankly I don't even know why anyone would think about this movie more than 3 seconds afterwards and thinking... that was dumb huh?",5,3,6,3 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good Job
","Rian Johnson ruined the whole saga in 2 hours... no wait. In a few minutes. This movie is without a doubt the worst star wars movie ever. How this man could be able to direct such a thing is beyond me. I mean we all know that every star wars movie has a big climax moment at the end. Episode 1, Darth Maul, Episode 2, Count Dooku. Episode 3 , Obi-wan and Anakin. Episode 4: Darth Vader and Obi-Wan/Luke destroying the Death Star. Episode 5 Darth Vader and Luke/I am your father. Episode 6 Vader vs Luke vs Palpetine. Episode 7 Rey vs Kylo Ren vs Finn and Han Solo. You see the connection?Episode 8... Luke sends a force ghost when he's not dead and then he dies anyway when not doing anything but repeating the original trilogy. Thanks Disney. You literally killed my childhood. You made luke into a sad old killer who thinks killing a boy is better than talking sense into him. Btw how the hell did snoke get hold of Kylo Ren if he was a student under Luke in the Jedi Temple? Did Ben Solo just ignore that he was a Jedi in training? Or did Snoke go and visit Luke because they're old pals? This whole plot don't make any sense. Disney knows this by playing on all the kids feelings. With rehashing the old trilogy in the new films. Yeah it's so much better now when Luke is a mentor who kills his students in their sleep. No wonder Kylo Ren got some to come with him in this ridiculous story line. It's just sad. This movie don't even deserve to be called Star Wars. Even Rogue One was better than this jesus christ... what happened?",1,2,3,19 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I liked it and not
","I went into this with a open mind after Force Awakens and I don't know if I hated it or loved it. First off the things I liked ; Snoke (in person)
More Kylo Ren, Rey and Luke Skywalker ! 
The dialogue between these characters
The whole Rey and Luke moments
The fighting (Force users)But there is so much I don't like with the movie. I felt like they could've and should have just focused on Rey and Luke plus Kylo Ren and Snoke through the entire movie. I was so bored when they tried rehash the whole Han Solo-thing from Empire Strikes Back. And I was just waited for them to go back to Rey and who she is and what Luke is up to and Kylo Ren and who Snoke is and what he really wants. But I can't give this a 8/10 or anything like that when the thing that was most important and interesting was like a small thing of the story. And the Leia thing? I was just sitting there in the cinema going ''Really? Really? What the hell am I watching?'' Because at times (Many times) I forgot that it was a Star Wars movie I was watching. Just with the beginning of Force Awakens I was so disappointed. And just sad in how they just like didn't seem to care about what Star Wars is really about. Like Mark Hamill said in an interview, he was sad/confused why Disney didn't wanna use any of the man's knowledge about the character 'Luke Skywalker' at all. I mean the man wrote the story for gods sake. And yes I am a diehard fan of the Star Wars saga ! The best thing they did with the movie was when they focused on Kylo Ren, Rey, Luke Skywalker and Snoke. Still the movie left too many questions unanswered. Which was a big letdown in one case. But is it worth it to go and see it? Yes it is worth a watch. Some people say it's better than Empire Strikes Back. Not chance ! What they did wrong was they almost joked away the entire movie. Sure Star Wars is known for it's lame comedy which is good at times but it was just too much this time.",1,1,2,14 December 2017
The Purge," Meh
","What to say about this movie? Got here because of the Ricky & Morty episode. Just had to check it out but yeah a solid action movie with very lame 'horror' moments and just terrible acting from Lena Heady and Adelaide Kane (the daughter). So many unbelievable cliche moments it's laughable. Like who wrote the script? Yeah it's dark in a big mansion. The first thing we do is split up with small flashlights and guns so we can accidentally shoot each other? And all these look at one way, then look back and 'Buh!'. Gotta say Ricky & Morty had a way better script for such a theme. But what got me bored were Lena Heady and her fake scream all the time. She was either not even trying or just thought the movie sucked. We all know she is amazing. Maybe she can't play the happy/kind wife with kids. And the thing that started it all. Oh boy, why does a little kid have the code to the locks so the entire family can get purged? Also the daughter, yeah sure the actress is super beautiful but playing the I hate everyone especially dad for no reason except my crazy boyfriend. It's so old and played out until every scene with her is 'sigh... here we go again'. And then she is frozen and we're all gonna die. Not very good acting and writing in my book.No this movie gets a very weak 5 out of 10 mainly because of the rich kids and Ethan Hawke. Other than that it's a meh-movie. A good watch but not really worth the time. I recommend see the Ricky & Morty version instead.",5,0,1,6 May 2018
Spectre," Worst Bond movie ever !
","I came in skeptical to Daniel Craig as James Bond but got grown to love him as the new Bond. But this movie is just awful, just awful. The plot doesn't make any sense and the movie is full with the worst clich√©s that Hollywood has to offer. First off I had problems to even finish the movie because it's such a bore just going through it. And it seems since Casino Royal the bond movies with Mr. Craig has been lacking little by little and this is by far the worst spy movie or any movie I've seen. And I can't see why it gets mixed reviews and yes I am talking about why it gets good reviews ? It won a prize for letdown of the year for crying out loud. A pure bond fan told me it was a meh movie. And another friend told me it was great (your typical action friend who loves everything). But what doesn't work in this movie? Well for starters they bring us into a plot where for some reason one company should be the only company for all spy operations.. which in a 7 year olds ear even sounds like bad writing. Then we are suppose to care for this blond girl just because her father was a bad guy and she looks at some pictures.. ? And I know Bond movies can be corny but come'on this is just lame with the bad jokes and bad guys surviving with evil scars and then instead of killing the hero or even give in to a fair fight the mastermind of badguys gives the hero a chance to kill him?! No I tell you nothing in this story or plot makes any sense. It just feels like a bad video game. And talk about video games. The train scene?! Haha the hero gets thrown through wooden walls at the train survives and have sex. No anyone who says this is a good bond movie or movie at all doesn't know what good taste in movies or story is even if they got slapped in the face by Bond himself.",1,2,5,13 March 2016
Alien: Covenant," Do yourself a favor and just don't watch it.
","First off. I was a little bit hyped for this movie, but waited because like Prometheus it looked good at first but couldn't deliver like the old Alien movies could, did and still do. So finally the released it on bluray I watched it and I gotta say the person who handled the script can't be human. It must have been a retarded version of David the cyborg. Because this movie is like the worst. I got angry because the crew is so unbelievably stupid it hurts all over my body. I mean I know this is the formula that have been ''working'' since the 70's but if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life on this garbage they call movie. Then you will see how really idiotic the story is. Not just the story, Just how are we suppose to believe a ship with ''over 2000 colonists'' don't have guns or anything on ship like that. And also when you land on a unexplored planet... YOU USE THE FREAKING SPACE-SUIT ! ! ! Just because there is oxygen doesn't mean oh yeah let's just stroll right into a deep forest with lots of plants and other life forms we never seen before... La-di-da-da No from the start I couldn't live myself in this scenario of these guys being trained for this mission more than. Are you human? Check, Are you able to make stupid decisions? Check, Have you been tested psychologically? No? Oh Then you are the perfect choice for a expedition which will take almost 10 years and you will be responsible for over 2000 lives. I mean After a while when they keep making more and more idiotic choices. I just gave up and waited for the movie to be over. And also the ending. They never saw the cyborgs David and Walter. But still they're just like. Oh you gotta be Walter because you helped me it's not like David could've cut off his arm and posed as Walter. I could go on forever, just do yourself a favor and don't bother. The movie is worse than Prometheus if that was possible. You got the exact same line-up as before. Heroin survives everyone else dies and no just no. It's a classic Hollywood cash-cow and if you are stupid enough to fall for it then good luck to you.",1,2,4,19 September 2017
