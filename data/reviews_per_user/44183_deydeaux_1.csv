United 93," Would I have done the same?
","I was in the air on an American Airlines flight on approach to Chicago Midway when the grounding of all aircraft was called for. As passengers, we knew nothing unusual was happening until we stopped at the gate. Then, as we turned on our cell phones, they were either ringing or had messages to call someone immediately. We exited the plane and observed some other passengers in the old Midway terminal staring at the TV in the lounge. The rest of my story was similar to many others in the same situation. Call wife back and assure her I was OK, grab the last rent car from the rental agent, find a motel, then car pool back to Texas several days later. That was just a bump in the road of life for me.Now, as I reflect on the movie and review my experience, I ask myself, 'Would I have taken the same actions as the passengers and crew on United 93.' I hope so, but I really don't know.I have a lapel pin that honors the flight crews of all four aircraft on September 11. Now it will honor all the passengers on all four aircraft as well the heroes at the FAA, ATC and Military Command.They are all heroes. Real heroes. I recommend the film to anyone who feels that there are no real heroes in the world today. They are out there everyday, doing what must be done. This film touched me and that is what great films are supposed to do.",10,12,26,28 April 2006
