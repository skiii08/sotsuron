The King's Speech," Outstanding!!
",The King's Speech wasn't great. (Why'd I give it a 10 out of 10 rating?) Because it wasn't great! It was FANTASTIC! The King's Speech was outstanding!! When I first heard I was going to see it I thought 'Great! (sarcastic) history?' But it was really good. I love the stark differences between the prim and proper English (Nothing against you guys!) and the slap-bang Aussies. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush made a great team. They are both first-class actors and this movie was a real credit to them. I want to see more of these movies! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD... When it does I'm buying it... probably along with a lot of others who loved this movie.,10,1,2,28 January 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Great for kids
","Great for kids and not really adults (unless you like talking mammoths, sloths and saber-tooth tigers!) I think the producers of Ice Age have really reached the limit of sequels you can make out of the materials they had (the weird miss-matched group of Manny, Ellie Sid, Scrat and now Scratte (plus the eggs). Ice age 1: Fantastic! Ice Age 2: Good but getting a little old. Ice Age 3: Yeah, OK enough now! Some movies aren't meant to have tonnes of sequels, and I think that they've reached their limit. I can't even remember what number 2 was about for crying out loud! My suggestion: Watch number one and leave it there! If you want to watch the rest go for it - but don't be disappointed if they're not what you expect.",5,1,1,28 January 2011
