Angels & Demons," I did'nt like the Davinci Code but this movie was hilarious.
","This is the best Tom Hanks movie since Turner and Hooch. The plot is absurdly paranoid in all the right ways. I was entertained from beginning to about ten minutes before the credits started. I fast forwarded the rest. I downloaded this film. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you've seen it first. But if you are a little messed up(psychologically or otherwise) check it out.Spoiler Alert: Highlights of the film include: A priest strung up on a cross burning to death, followed by an evil priest injecting heroin while screaming at his kidnapping victim, a brilliant climatic sequence involving the Popes son taking a nuclear weapon putting it into the passenger seat of a helicopter, flying the helicopter to a safe altitude, and then bailing out with a parachute, just in time for the explosion to blow him to safety. 8 out of 10 stars.",8,0,0,22 November 2010
The Runaways," Good rock and roll movie full of tit's clichés
","The Runaways is a mediocre biopic full of melodramatic acting, over used clichés, and Glaring historical inaccuracies. Fortunately the subject matter was more than enough to keep me interested the entire movie. I had heard a few Runaways songs before but seeing this sparked my interest in the band quite a bit. As a rock and Roll film it holds up pretty well, but if you don't like The Runaways or Rock and Roll in general don't waste your time. It's a second rate film with a first rate soundtrack, and plenty of tits, drugs, and lesbian sex. A solid 7I'm planning to watch Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways in hopes of getting a more accurate description of what went on.",7,0,7,16 June 2010
