50 First Dates," 50 first dates
","This is a story of Henry Roth,(Sandler), who falls deeply in love with Lucy(Drew Barrymore). Shortly after he discovers that Lucy suffers from memory loss. There begins the fight to win her over, every single day. With appearances from Rob Schneider and Dan Aykroyd. 50 first dates is the typical Sandler movie lots of laughs and more work with Schneider. Predictable story line but enjoyable, not to be taken to seriously. I enjoy a light-hearted comedy which Sandler can produce, and there isn't a lot to dislike about this film except for his manly aquarium friend. Pros Good laughs, working with Rob Schneider and training with the walrus.Cons Predictable storyline,slow, typical Sandler, it wouldn't kill him to stray away from comedy",6,0,0,18 March 2005
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo
","Finding Nemo is a computer generated, animated film about a clown fish Nemo who is stolen from his home reef, his father is then forced to search the ocean for him. Voices done by Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, Alexander Gould and Willem Dafoe.Everybody had raved on about this animated film to me and I have never been a fan of them, I still haven't seen Shrek ha ha! I don't regret watching Finding Nemo but it just didn't tickle my fancy I have seen better animated films over the last couple of years, the graphics were really clear and well done it had humor in the right places, but something I didn't like. I don't think there were enough troubling events happening to Nemo throughout the film, Watch for yourself and find out but I thought it was lacking, sorry all you fans!",4,1,3,11 June 2005
Final Destination 2," Final Destination 2
","Final Destination is the follow up to the original starring Devon Sawyer the sequel stars (A.J Cook), (Ali Larter), (Michale Landes) and (David Paetkau). Kimberley (Cook) has a vision of a freeway car pile up and saves the victims, but death has his own plan and one by one they begin to die.For a Thriller/Horror it was a great effort to equal the appeal of the first but another very successful Thriller sequel, equally as enjoyable and gruesome death scenes as the original, not to be taken serious but very enjoyable none the less. Ali Larter very talented actress enjoyable to watch and very sexy on screen. Good to see David Paetkua playing another smart ass role I enjoyed him in (Bang Bang Your Dead) and good to see an appearance from Alex Rae who plays another smart ass character.",6,0,0,11 June 2005
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump
","Forrest Gump is the story of Forrest (Tom Hanks) who is not a real intelligent man but has appeared present at many historical events and had been involved in the war but through it all is still infatuated with Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) also starring Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson.Forrest Gump is such a powerful story of courage and determination, it was never a film that appealed to me until I saw it 5 years ago. Tom Hanks is a very powerful performer and gives you the ability to feel every emotion in this film, with aspects of comedy, drama, war and death there isn't anything negative displayed in this film and thats why it will be one of the great films of all time.Excellent scenery, realistic storyline with humor in all the right places, great film.",7,0,3,10 June 2005
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 things I hate about you
","10 things I hate about you is about teenager Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Lovitt) joining at a new high school, where he falls for Bianca Stratford (Larissa Olyniak) who is unable to date until her uptight, outcast sister Kat (Julia stiles) begins to date. The other school outcast is Patrick (Heath Ledger) who is paid to date Kat, and so the story unfolds. With appearances from Andrew Keegan and Larry Miller. 10 things I hate about you has some interested quirky tongue-cheek dialogue and humor which is probably its best aspect, as far as story line and originality, not much there. Julia Stiles pulls of a nice job as the outcast of the group, Larry Miller also does a great job as the father of the girls. I watched this film for another one of those teenage movies, which is basically what I got. Don't rush out to by this one unless you're saving it for a rainy day. Pros Interesting dialogue, Reasonable acting, Humorous, one of those, loser wins out moviesCons Predictable storyline, No originality, Seen them before, but better.",6,0,1,18 March 2005
American Pie," American Pie
","American Pie is the story of Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) Chris Ostreicher (Chris Klein) Kevin Myers (Thomas Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) and there pact to lost there virginity's before the end of high school. There are also appearances from Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Sean William Scott and Eugene Levy. American Pie will go down as one of the best teenage comedy's of all time, so many ages can get into a film like this, everyone can relate to the off the wall comedy.. Very Well-acted, Humorous, Predictable but Good storyline and very well created. For what viewers are expecting unlike most comedy's which are non sensicle and stupid, they don't come better than the pie. If your looking for a comedy this one is for you.Pros Well Acted, Humorous, Good Storyline,Cons Predictable, Not to serious",6,0,1,18 March 2005
Cast Away," Castaway
","Castaway stars (Tom Hanks) who plays Chuck Noland a Fedex executive who is involved in a plane crash, and is forced to live on a deserted island. Hanks performance in this film is brilliant, such an original idea and exceptionally hard to pull off considering he does not converse with anyone for the bulk of the film. Very hard one to keep the viewers attention and for them to enjoy it. I felt it was just lacking considering it is just Hanks. Like it or not you have to admire the skill of a individual man and a film set in one area.Pros Hanks, Originality, Enjoyable and Hard to make successfullyCons Individual and not a cast",5,1,3,18 March 2005
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","Batman Begins is the prequel to the story of Batman, It is how Bruce Wayne was destined to do something great with his life and become Batman. Starring 'Christian Bale', 'Gary Oldman', 'Morgan Freeman' and 'Katie Holmes' with appearances from 'Michael Caine' and 'Tom Wilkinson' I recently saw Batman Begins in the theaters and there was a big build up to the story and through the media and it didn't let down at all. After seeing it I can't picture Batman as anyone but Christian Bale he is a very talented actor ever since his earlier work in 'Reign Of Fire' and his thrilling 'American Psycho' performance. I know talented actors such as George Clooney and Michael Keaton have played Batman but none as well as Bale. It's good to see Morgan Freeman still appearing in a strong role but not the main and it is a relief to finally see Katie Holmes in a memorable performance, after Dawsons Creek and her facials ha ha!.Great storyline, a little slow but it was all the build up, great weapons and thrilling edge of the seat escapism. Strong acting and very well done special effects, the only minor criticism was the film went for a touch over two and a half hours and I think it could have been shortened to two hours. Definitely the best of the comic book films, I believe they are making to many X-men, The Hulk, Hellboy, Spiderman, The Fantastic Five etc........... the list goes on its become to typical, but a good film.",7,1,2,18 June 2005
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting
","Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting 'Matt Damon' is a mathematical genius but is working as a janitor at a maths technical school, when he is discovered but due to criminal record is ordered to take therapy from Sean Maguire 'Robin Williams' who attempts to control Will and help him lead his own life. Also stars Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser.Good Will Hunting is a very powerful film, If you get through all the swearing you begin to feel Will's pain as his life story is thrown out on the table. Strong acting, believable storyline and a very original story, Great cast not a weak role and there are very few films in this genre that can get that across to the audience, it's a film to make you laugh, cry and get angry.Matt Damon gets better every time I see him, top film best of its kind.",7,0,6,18 June 2005
Enemy at the Gates," Enemy At The Gates
","Enemy At The Gates is a Drama/War film set in the battle of Stalingrad and the cat and mouse shootout between Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and Major Konig (Ed Harris). (Rachel Weisz) star as Tania Chernova and (Joseph Fiennes) as Commisar Danilov.Enemy At The Gates is a strong film with Jude Law and Ed Harris giving there best effort to bring forth the reality of the war. A powerful storyline and originality, which made it very hard to watch. Good special effects which were not overused as it was a long time ago and technology hadn't been developed to its level now.I couldn't rate it higher for the simple reason that I don't think it stands tall against Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldier, Windtalkers etc.",5,1,3,5 June 2005
Bruce Almighty," Bruce Almighty
","(Jim Carey) plays Bruce Nolan a reporter who one day stumbles across God (Morgan Freeman) who agrees to let him control the world. (Jennifer Anniston) also plays Grace Connelly Bruce's girlfriend. Clever storyline, It is not a type of movie I have come across, which makes it all the more appealing, it lacks in the bulk of the story. It is good to see Carey experimenting with different aspects of film as you have seen in The Majestic and The Truman Show and now this film. He has stuck with his element of comedy but toned it down from over the top stupidity.Pros original, well acted, humorousCons lacking in something, predictable",5,0,2,18 March 2005
Final Destination," Final Destination
","Final Destination is a horror/thriller film about a high school student Alex Browning (Devon Sawyer) who has a vision of him and his classmates plane blowing up on the way to France. Convincing them not to get on, shortly after they begin to die one by one. Final Destination had a great cast including Devon Sawyer (Now And Then), Ali Larter (Varsity Blues, Drive Me Crazy), Kerr Smith (Dawsons Creek) and Sean William Scott (American Pie) Final Destination was a well done thriller, very original like nothing I have seen before, a story about cheating death very unusual. Strong young cast which is exciting to see, gruesome death scenes which make it all the more jumpy and frightening, good to see last minute escapism but then be decapitated anyway ha ha! Enjoyable film.",6,0,0,10 June 2005

Jamie is the double class, A grade student with hopes and dreams, she collides with Landon in this romance film, and begins to show Landon he can have a future and he has potential to do great things, meanwhile they begin to fall in love.

Braveheart," Braveheart
","In this epic medieval war film set in the 13th century and based on actual events, (Mel Gibson) stars as William Wallace the leader of the Scottish who brings the country together hoping to take the power away from the English who are killing and doing as they wish. Bravehear is a sad, couragous and moving film, I cannot find negatives for it, after watching it, I realised that standing up for what you believe in is a hard thing to do. One of the best war films made.Pros well-acted, great action scenes, original story, very movingCons what can you say?",8,2,4,18 March 2005
Gladiator," Gladiator
","Gladiator is a film set in roman times and the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) a general who is betrayed and his family murdered by a prince hoping to control the empire. Also Stars (Joaquin Phoenix) as Commodus and (Connie Nielson), (Oliver Reed) and (Richard Harris) Gladiator had a very strong storyline, and powerful acting I don't generally like Russell Crowe but he delivered a great performance in the revenge, killing side of the film, but I just can't take him serious. I have always been a fan of (Joaquin Phoenix) what a talented actor, then again he has been doing it forever, great evil role I wasn't confident he would be suited to that role.Long film, and a little bit slow, great special effects and battle scenes, enjoyable film.",6,0,2,18 June 2005
Donnie Darko," Donnie Darko
","Donnie Darko is the psychological thriller directed by Richard Kelly it is a story of Donnie who has visions of an evil rabbit possesing him and making him commit acts of violence and predicts the end of the world. 'Drew Barrymore' and 'Patrick Swayze' have smaller roles in the film along with Jake's mother Maggie Gyllenhaal.Donnie Darko was something that had always grabbed my attention but I had never decided to pick up at the store, but I'm glad I did. It was a very moving and powerful yet strange and sadistic movie, it is unlike anything I have ever seen, I rate it at the highest of levels for its acting and originality. Obviously it isn't to be taken serious as it is fiction but Jake Gyllenhaal does a very real and psychotic performance he just keeps getting better and better, pick this movie up when your at the store you won't regret it!",6,0,1,5 June 2005
Dodgeball," Dodgeball
","Dodgeball is a light comedy about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who owns a low budget gym in a small town and decides to enter a Dodgeball competition with his misfit gymnasts to win money to save his gym being taken over by the leader of the global corporate fitness chain run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller).Dodgeball was what I expected it to be funny but not to be taken serious and it was a little weak in parts, I have never been much of a fan of Vince Vaughn I don't think he has been strong in any of the roles he has been in and in serious roles he just doesn't show emotion, Stiller saved the movie because it wouldn't have been much to see if it wasn't for him, not bad but there are better sporting comedy movies to see.",4,0,1,5 June 2005
