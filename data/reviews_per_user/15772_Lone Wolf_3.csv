The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Bitch Project!
","Boy... I don't know if I've ever seen so many mixed feelings towards a movie. Some people were so offended that they felt the need to post multiple comments here! If you have that many issues that you have to keep coming back and re-insulting this movie, then maybe it touched a nerve and you just don't want to admit it.The Blair Witch Project is an experiment in fear. It gives the impression that three student filmmakers are going into the Maryland woods to film a documentary about a supposed witch that lived in the area many years ago. It is also insinuated that the witch influenced a serial killed in the '30s. Unfortunately for our clueless heroes, they get REALLY lost in the woods and spend a couple of days just wandering around. They have a compass, so it seems that the Witch is somehow causing them to walk in circles. As the intrepid trio travel through the woods, they find little 'gifts' left behind by the Witch... piles of stones, little men made of sticks, and a rather nasty bundle with a soft, chewy center. A particularly scary part features an attack on the group's tent. Later, one of them vanishes in the night. The remaining two students finally end up at the house of the 30's serial killer...No spoilers. You'll have to see what happens for yourself.I'm not pretending that this is a major Hollywood release... less than $50,000 was spent on equipment and production. But this isn't meant to be high-budget. The movie looks exactly like it's supposed to... a student film that was edited together by people who found the 'lost' footage after the students 'disappeared'. (I did think it was funny that some people thought this was real... the hype on the Sci Fi channel was great - it took quite a bit of convincing, plus video footage of the three actors alive and well on MTV, to show that they were still alive!)I think some people are angry at this film because they were expecting the next Exorcist or Poltergeist. Unless you're blind, it's blatantly obvious from the previews that the movie is shot with shaky cameras in a very 'real' environment. If you came to this movie expecting something else, then you deserve to lose your $7.50.Also, I think people were really p***ed that they didn't get to see the Witch. In this age of CGI monstrosities and special effect-packed blockbusters, many movie-goers expect to see the monster all the time. If that's what you want, go rent The Haunting remake or Godzilla. I'd wager these same people would get upset at the original Haunting for not showing the ghosts. Maybe some of the people who hate this movie really WERE scared and it bothered them so much that they decided to pan the flick. Either way, I think it's worth giving this movie a chance... don't take it too seriously, though... it's a much better ride if you sit back and try to watch it with an open mind. Be prepared, because the 'action' doesn't really kick in until halfway into the movie, and there isn't a whole lot of it. This is more of a suspense movie, not a slasher flick or an action horror movie.I've seen BWP twice in the theatre and once on video... and the last 5 minutes STILL gives me goosebumps.",10,2,3,30 May 2001
Unbreakable," Unquestionable - one of my favorite movies of 2000
","I'll begin by saying that Unbreakable is neither a sequel nor in the same genre as The Sixth Sense. If you want The Sixth Sense, go rent it and stop leaving messages about how much this movie WASN'T like The Sixth Sense.That said... this was a brilliant drama about a security guard who gets involved in a train wreck during a period of irreconcilable differences with his wife. And just a note to those of you who paid to see this movie for a train wreck - YOU DON'T GET TO SEE IT. Go rent Faces of Death if you want that sort of footage.David Dunne is contacted by the eccentric owner of a comic book art gallery who tells him that he is something more than human. David slowly begins to realize he's never been sick... he is stronger and tougher than the average person. We can rebuild him... we can... oops. 6 Million Dollar Man flashback - sorry. While some people didn't like that it took David this long to figure out he was more than human, remember that a blind man doesn't know he's blind until you tell him. David spends the majority of the movie experimenting with his powers and contemplating what he should do with them. David's son is curious and excited that his father seems to have these abilities and actually threatens David's life in an attempt to prove his father's powers.This is an excellent movie... Shyamalan uses camera angles and techniques to 'frame' nearly every shot as if it was a section of a comic book page. Other comic references, such as the use of colors for certain characters, are obvious. You don't have to be a comic book fan to like this movie, but you could probably appreciate it more if you were.My only complaint is the text at the very end of the movie... I think a movie like this would have been better if they left the audience not knowing exactly how everything ends. I was also extremely disappointed to hear that the rumors of Unbreakable being a trilogy were false. Unfortunately, Shyamalan doesn't want to make sequels (so forget about Sixth Sense Part II as well) which explains why he turned down the chance to write Indiana Jones 4. I think Unbreakable is worth a chance... but rent it knowing that it's not a horror movie, nor do they show the train crash. If you still want to see it knowing those facts ahead of time, you'll probably love this movie.",9,0,0,30 May 2001
Caddyshack," One of the classic comedies...
","When asked about the funniest movies of all time, inevitable me and my friends have to mention Caddyshack. Classic scenes, classic lines... hours have been spent quoting this movie line for line, and it continues to entertain twenty years after its first release. One of Ted Knight's finest performances - and Chevy Chase in a GOOD movie? Yes, true believers, Chevy delivers in this one. A strong cast, brilliant script, and great directing by Harold Ramis. You don't have to like golf to like this movie. I HATE golf and I love this movie. 10 out of 10. Rent it, buy it, live it.",10,2,4,30 September 2002
