United 93," Sorry but the British Connection IS important
","The most important thing about this film has been something never mentioned by ANY IMDb posters or US critics Every review every comment refers to this as a 'Hollywood' picture.Why? This is a British film,written and directed by its British director and except for a few minutes of 'shots to 'establish 'the setting is America,it was entirely made and created by British production staff designers and crew in a British film studio Ironically (although I am not writing about the films qualities) it happens to be a film in which 'real' realism is the most important quality and this is something that all films made in Britain have (even fantasy films like Harry Potter)and even bad films -why this is would need a book to explainIf this film had been made in France of Italy it would have been talked of as a French film etc Yet Americans seem completely unable to accept that any British film industry exists Because the huge British film industry -that has created most of the worlds biggest international successes for the last forty year- is financed by American distribution companies its products are ruthlessly marketed as American Yet this is an enormous lie-indeed although 'A movie is only a movie'looked at from any point of view, its one of the most fantastic lies in history!I live near the studios that made 5 of the Star War films,all of Kubricks post 1960 films Saving sergeant Ryan MissionImpossible 1 ,Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones Batman 1Batman Begins Gladiator BlackHawk Down'Alien and dozens and dozens of others (plus of course the Bonds Potters Chocolate Factories etc etc)Now it seems that New Zealand or Australia are given great publicity as film making nations -but never the British !Films have never been made in Britain because its particularly cheaper-there are tax concessions in every state in America and most countries.They have been made in the UK because of the unique quality of the product Even today when Eastern European countries are competing with British studios most of the high tec work will remain in Britain where these films are set up and where London remains the true film capital of the world. Does any of this matter ?Yes it does. Americas problems devolve from its strange arrogance about its capabilities in nearly every sphere- entertainment, science,business the military etc.It is regarded as a nation increasingly deluded by this-the contrast between arrogant fantasy and reality is becoming wider and is dangerous.It gives America a misplaced sense of its real position in the worldFew people hate America.The world of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, of sitting back in the Chevy ,elbow out the window, miles of highway ahead and the desert either side with a coke and burger handy -this represents a level of relaxed classless stressless living that everyone can relate to and dream of.What is essentially cultural thieving of the kind developed by what are essentially American film financing and distribution companies represents a desperate attempt to keep America on top of the world.If Americans realised how phony that position is they would start to do something about it.",Null,1,5,14 May 2006
Gravity," Another great British science fiction film!
","Why doesn't IMDb show the UK as being the country this American financed yet British produced production came from? Did they remove it? By any normal standards this is yet another British made picture with superb CGraphics created by Londons Framestore the whole production being made at Pinewood and Shepperton Studios near London In fact its in the whole tradition of great British science fiction films like Star Wars Alien and 2001 all requiring exceptional special effects These particular films have the effect of advertising supposed American technology which is not in fact American ,a naughty lie. If you want it American make it in America ...and tax benefits have nothing to do with it as all countries etc offer those",8,4,8,19 October 2013
Casino Royale," It IS enjoyable and yet....
","I have given this film 8 because it IS enjoyable- but unfortunately I didn't see it in English!! -so I don't have a clue what it was about!! I also think that Craig did come across-visually at least- as a real character.... Yet the criticisms of this film are valid My private belief is that Ian Fleming needing money got the idea for Bond from Cary Grants image -intelligent without being pretentously intellectual,fearless and a man of action yet always a gentleman-full of ironic laid back humour-a perfect example of an idealised British gentleman.... This image actually realised so perfectly by Sean Connery and maintained through the series has now been changed to accommodate changing times and more violent attitudes. The producers have discovered in Daniel Craig a superb example of an actor far more similar to any real James bond -if they in fact existed-and curiously its this that made the film surprisingly realistic. The fact is that Craig with his pointy ratlike face,sticky out ears small head and unsmiling hard expression is exactly like the many real brave British soldiers who joined the elite Commando Brigades in WW2.These men were often from working class backhand's and were trained as ruthless silent killers on special operations.Looking at Craig I was reminded of a well known character actor-Sam Kydd who looked like him and appeared in many British war films .... Yet where is the Cary Grant bit? I certainly didn't detect any trace visually...but who wants that kind of smooth sophisticated lifestyle and ironic humour today? The audience for these films is late teens and early twenties so I feel the producers have probably found the right man ...Only one thing might spoil the party...Bonds have always appealed to women...Will this new fellow produce the same attraction? The jury is I think still out on this one...I wonder...but perhaps the producers are clever...the next film may see Craig doing the full Cary Grant/Connery thing once again...perhaps he will even comb his hair....",8,1,3,12 January 2007
