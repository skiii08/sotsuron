Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," awesomeness
","Not as bad-arse as the first one, but definitely keeps the same guy-ritchie'esque feel and swag to it throughout the movie. There were times when it drags, and one point where there's a naked dude walking around which I don't really quite understand how goes with the story/characterdevelopment/plot/priceofcheeseinbangladesh, etc... At any rate, the additions were subtle from the first one, but it definitely laid the ground-work for future SHs movies to be made, which I for one am a fan for. I know this won't win any awards, and I'm sure it won't be as highly praised as this year's winner of the terribad artsy film, The Tree of Strife, but it'll win all kinda awards in my book. 1) Film with the most BROmance - Winner 2) Film with the coolest running away from danger shot in slow-mo - Winner 3) Film with the best dialogue between good guy and bad dude - Winner All in all, it's worth seeing but maybe not as good as MI:4.",8,1,2,29 December 2011
Skyfall," Taking a page from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
","Finally, they got a great story-line and a decent plot with-out just a shoot 'em up action flick. To be honest, the action sequences are great but not overdone either. Sam Mendes, is one of the greatest directors to date and he doesn't let us down with 007.The movie in my opinion has pretty much lived-up to the expectation and makes Bond look like a total B/A, again.I think Craig is amazing as Agent 007, and he's a wonderful actor for the role. He never 'over acts' his part, and his serious face isn't irritating. I thought they kept it complex enough to be intrigued, enough action sequences to keep you entertained and a powerful storyline to keep you coming back for more.All in all, it was awesome. If you are a regular dude, and enjoy the Bond films, yeah it's epic.",9,2,10,12 November 2012
John Wick," lacking of any pretense
","It is truly a 'color by the number' action movie, and in the end a Rembrandt is painted.Those who are so high-brow, can't let go that the movie's complete lack of any intricate, pretentious, plot-twist is actually a thing of beauty. I was so overjoyed that it rests in the action sequences, the lovable hero played gloriously by K.Reeves as a the somber, stoic 'bad-good guy,' and continuing our disdain for Russians (*see Cold War*) No, it is simply a revenge action movie, and the scenes are totally bad-arse. The 'insights' to this crazy underworld of hired-killers is original, insightful, and adds depth to an otherwise 'go get em' kinda movie.SPOILER ALERT - there's a scene so sad (the beginning) that it makes you want to cry and adds fire to your furious revenge nestled in your heart.",8,5,15,31 October 2014
127 Hours," pretentious and quasi-corny
","It's no surprise this movie would do well with critics etc., filled with a preachy pretentiousness that is generally seen as epic. I thought the scenery was gorgeous, and the overall filming was definitely unique in it's own right. However, as much as I love James Franco, I thought this movie feel flat and was wwwaayyy over the top with it's 'message.' The whole, don't know what you got till it's (almost) gone, and the, I'm gonna start living my life for the one's I love, etc. To be honest, came across as super cheese, preachy. What would have been funny, is I bet if this movie had the same message, but that of one with Christianity, it would have been seen as 'preachy' from the Hollywood Hipsters. I'd recommend Soul Surfer, way cooler and better scripted.",6,1,3,24 November 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Gotta read the book first...
","OK, let me start off with if you didn't read the book or see the mini-series then you might have a difficult time understanding who's who but more importantly the significance of certain scenes. That much I'll give people.I knew the story well, I literally finished reading the book about a week ago, so it was still fresh. I'm thinking even if I didn't I for one didn't find the movie that terribly hard to follow. To be honest the film doesn't follow the book page for page. For instance, the opening scene in the book isn't shown till about 20-25 min into the movie. Also, there are minor changes in the dialog.Of course I wish they would have given more character development to the other characters, other than that I have no complaints. I think it was beautifully made and I agree Gary Oldman was amazing. Colin Firth, wow three for three in these past three years. I'm serious, that guy has the golden touch (we won't mention Main Street) A Single Man, King's Speech and now this, all are awesome.I saw this movie in Brooklyn, NY, it was PACKED and no one left the theater and everyone seemed to enjoy it.If you read the book, you'll love it... just a couple changes...",10,1,4,1 January 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Brilliant
","Quite possibly Mr. Anderson at his absolute best. It is exactly what you expect from a visionary like Wes, and a mere perfect masterpiece. Dare I say, his best yet? I know, I know all the Wes Anderson fan-girls are gonna cry for Steve Izzou, probably bc it was his most abstract which by all hipsters makes it his best. The less-commercial the cooler according to some people.At any rate, what makes this movie work wonderfully is the casting, production, set, and of course the story. First off, the casting could not have been any better. Now I know two things here, 1) Wes always/generally has the same people who are either main/supportive/cameo roles, and in this one he doesn't disappoint. 2) I am also aware that rarely are the actual actors in the movie, all the 'first-choices.' Well the chemistry between Ray and Tony is palatable. They make such a duo, I would seriously watch anything those two are in again.The acting is so spot on, the comedic timing is genius ESPECIALLY with Brody and Dafoe... seriously it's awesome.All in all, it's perfect.I'd rate it as one of Wes' best pictures, easily.",9,1,5,29 April 2014
Django Unchained," Violently hysterical...
","Seriously, this movie is so funny and if you aren't careful you'll miss the pure genius of ....dare I say...one of the absolute top American Film Makers of our time.Honestly, you have to expect that when seeing a QT movie, it's going to be a QT movie. Kinda like people who thought P.T.Anderson's 'The Master' was boring or confusing; those individuals need to expect something different from the main stream.At any rate, DJANGO's plot is pretty simplistic and not overly complicated. Most scenes you don't have to concentrate on the actual movement of the story, yet the dialog (very QT'esque) is BRILLIANT. The comedy, and subtle one-liners vastly offset the retro-throw-back super cheese Spght.Western violence, which is meant to be 'campy.' As far as acting, wow, everyone is on top of their game. Too include, Jonah Hill, who has one of the best cameos in a long time. The whole 'KKK' scene, is HILARIOUS!!! I went with my brother, sister and her husband and we all were LOAO. With that, Leonardo is seriously a champion at his craft, he was amazing. I can't get over how well he played the character, it was exceptional. Christopher, was again simply breath-taking, he's so articulate and nails every line with perfect timing.So to make this so long, BLUFF - if you are looking for another QT insta-classic, go see it. You won't be disappointed.MY only NEGATIVE - is for somereason there were a TON, and I mean a TON of lil old grandma n grandpas there? We were all like, WTF, OVER? Why meemaw n papaw decided to go see a QT movie, on Xmas is mind-blowing.It's purely awesome, and you need to see it in the theaters.",9,2,13,26 December 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," great finale
","So legit, a great conclusion to a fantastic series. The third installment starts off, right where the second ends. If you are into just straight-up epic fantasy battles, then this is the movie for you. My only complaint is that I wish they would have given Gandoff more swag, and had him use his 'magic' more.The battle scenes were nothing short of awesomesauce. There really isn't a lot of plot development or twists, just because the first two do such a great job setting up this last picture. Also the 'social commentary' on how greed is such a powerful destroyer, and 'the root of all evil.' Like CS Lewis, it's an allegory for inner human struggles and simply good vs evil.#toteslegit",9,4,8,23 December 2014
The Hangover Part III," awesome....
","This could easily be my favorite of all 3. The plot, story-line is great and keeps you interested. You already know, and empathize with the characters if you'd be following from the beginning.I was a lil skeptical, just bc I though HO II, was pretty terri-bad. This picks up kinda where two left-off, just hilar. Also, you know they are going to 'end' the series, and they did such a good job at getting closer.Also, hat-tip to screenwriters, etc., bc this one doesn't have anywhere near the 'shock' value humor that 2 and 1, relied so heavily on. Instead, it's actually pg-13'ish, and you can tell they weren't going for over-played locker-room humor, but rather but some effort into the script.All in all, it's awesome and definitely worth seeing.Oh and Alan (Zack G.,) by far has the best lines in the movie, he's amazing.",7,3,4,28 May 2013
