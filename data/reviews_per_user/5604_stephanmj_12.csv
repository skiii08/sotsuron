Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sasha Baron Cohen is an embarrassing racist
","According to the CIA's website, Kazakhstan is a country with a majority Muslim religion of 47%. Cohen is supposedly portraying a typical Kazakhstani, therefore a typical Muslim. He portrays this Muslim character to be a backwards, degenerate, jew-hating imbecile, who likes rape, incest and murder. I am not a Muslim, or religious, in any way, but I can understand that for a Jewish person to do this at such a sensitive time with the fake war on terror going on, is not a particularly pleasant thing to do. However, as you can see by the high rating on IMDb, most people are too stupid to figure out what is going on.In fact Cohen is making a good living of importing racism to America. He portrays Muslims, Germans, and the French in his new movie Taladaga nights, in very negative manners, which will no doubt fuel anti-European and anti-Muslim feelings in what already is a hate filled USA.",1,15,38,9 November 2006
Minority Report," Way over-rated
","I read before seeing this movie that it was the next Indiana Jones so I was really excited. Lets face it Speilberg has done some great work with Close Encounters, ET, Indiana Jones series, ect, and this they said was as good as his best. I was very disappointed. It was not at all action the whole way through. There was one action scene where I was like 'THis is Awesome' but apart from that it meandered on and on, especially at the end. It was very much like AI - you thought it was going to end but it dragged on for 20 more minutes. At least Indiana Jones relied on simple good story telling instead of a totally convuluted plot. However the special effects were good and the future looks kinda cool. Some parts of the movie were neat, neat ideas, but it was hard to follow, or maybe I was getting bored. This movie gets 1 star for being able to dupe me into believeing it was going to be a great film, and it wasnt.",1,2,5,22 June 2002
Finding Neverland," A lot like Big Fish
","This film is pretty good. It has a similar kind of feel and style to it as the Tim Burton film Big Fish. To be honest I thought Big Fish was a better film. It does tend to really try and pull at your heart strings a lot, especially towards the end. It just depends if you want to go see a movie and leave feeling thoroughly depressed as to whether you like this film. The girl who I was with cried a river, I had to use a boat to get out of the movie theatre. One thing I will say is that Johnny Depp did an excellent Scottish accent - probably the best that I know of. No doubt this film will win quite a lot of awards, but does anyone understand how academy awards are calculated? Its not always the best film that wins. I tend to not like movies that are quite so emotional. There is already enough sadness in the world, so the only reason to go see a movie is to watch a good comedy, because then at least you can laugh. My recommendation is to see it if you are already in a bad mood, because this will go well with it. I give it 6 out of 10.",6,1,3,29 January 2005
Lost in Translation," Probably the worst movie I have ever seen
","Never before have I had such high expectations for a movie but been let down so much. I should have known when I saw that Sofia Coppola directed it that it was going to be dire. But it had got rave reviews as being 'hilarious' and with SNL's Bill Murray how could you go wrong. The grim truth of the matter is that the film has a weak unoriginal plot, the premise of the story happens 40 minutes into the movie, there are many many long shots of Bill wondering around the city like its a show on the discovery channel.
But what I found most disgusting about this movie was the way that the American characters are basically mocking the Japanese culture and the way they talk throughout the whole movie. I am not oriental, in fact I am a white male, but when I try to put myself in the shoes of a Japanese person watching this film, the film comes across with the typical American arrogance and self-centeredness that Americans are used to. I am really annoyed I wasted my time on this film, Sofia Coppola should be ashamed of herself, as should the academy for nominating this trash. In the end I can only pity people who find this film 'beautiful' and 'poetic'. It is devoid of intelligence and originality.",1,3,9,22 February 2004
Spider-Man," How this is in the top 250 is beyond me (Possible Spoiler)
","This movie wasn't that good. It was totally formulaic. There was very little original or interesting about the movie. I'm not really into comic books but I know that the original Spiderman invented little things he puts on his wrist which shoots out the web for him. The Matrix was ripped off many times in this movie, as was Superman. Then for no apparent reason what-so-ever, Peter Parker decides to shun MJ, turning her down after she admits her love for him. What a load of crap.The costumes were very cheesy looking. Especially that scene when the Green Goblin asks Spiderman to join up with him. With none of their mouths moving, it just looks corny. Having said that, the Green Goblin was the most interesting character in the movie. Pretty much every film made nowadays is total garbage. As exemplified this year, the Oscars are nothing but propaganda machines that try and program the average american viewer to believe that the Best Picture film really is that great. Lets face it A Beautiful Mind wasn't.Spiderman will do great at the box-office, as countless amounts of mindless drones go and see a film that they knew how it was going to end before it even began. Even when you see David Lynch films nowadays, its still predictable, because you can predict that it will make no sense at all. Hollywood needs to come up with new ideas, but maybe the same old thing is what everyone wants.",Null,0,0,5 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Winner of Snorefest 2002 award
","This review contains spoilers.This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Each plot element was over-drawn out. It took 3 hours to tell what could have been told sufficiently and more interestingly in 90 minutes. The main plot elements were: 1) Frodo finds thats the ring is getting heavy 2) Saurons forces are rising 3) Pippin and Merry spend the whole movie in a tree 4) Gollum has 2 personalities. The use of helicopter shots became very irritating after the 15th use the technique in the 3rd minute of the movie. Also in the middle of the final battle sequence they kept cutting back to a bunch of trees talking, what an idea to keep the action flowing. The long battle at the end was the same thing over and over. Not to mention both sides had stupid battle plans. The humans defense wasnt even slightly planned out. It was totally unbelievable. Then the boring subplot with Arwen aerosmiths daughter, I mean really, who cares if she dies. She was in the first one for 5 minutes anyway.
It is also very silly that this movie is already number 9 on IMDB top 250 movies of all time. I can easily name 10 movies much better than this. The only reason it is so high is because people want to have a little geek war between star wars and lord of the rings so the movies can have a higher rating. I contemplated leaving early as I started to fall asleep and I had to wake my girlfriend many times. Seriously dull movie.",1,3,12,21 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Joe Dirt was much better
","This review may contain spoilers.The contrived Hollywood machine has engineered some great bore-a-thon's of many an hour, I could name plenty without really thinking. Joe Dirt was a rare spectacle to behold, a movie which could actually decrease ones intelligence and had the overall humor value of a public abortion. The Two Towers although lacking in Joe Dirt's humor extraculations, disgraced the image of American cinema with a 3 hour bombardment of homosexual midgets, talking trees with beards and a 40 minute feud between a group of dirty hippies and Rosie O'Donnell look-a-likes whose battle plans were written by Barnie the Purple Dinosaur.",1,0,5,8 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," OK not great
","I saw this movie the other day. The two main leads are hot and there are two great lesbian scenes to boot. Apart from that the movie was just OK. I like pretty much all the David Lynch films that I have seen so far. But this one was just kinda boring. The first hour and a half is pretty conventional film-making. It draws you in and you are interested to see what will happen next. However, after they go to some midnight retarded opera the film starts to not make any sense whatsoever.(Possible Spoiler )I have read some explanations of the film and what was going on with the characters. It's all very interesting, but to me, it's pointless. I was told that when you make a movie you are supposed to make the audience care about your characters. This movie does that in the first hour and a half, but then we are told the characters we care about, aren't really the characters at all. They don't even have the same names as we thought they did, and they act a whole lot different too. This leaves the audience with really nothing to care about in the movie, just the hopes that more nudity will ensue. Twin Peaks was much better, as was Blue Velvet.",Null,0,1,30 April 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Absolute Garbage
","This movie was the poorest movie I have seen in a very long time. I know some people say 'it was more like the book than the other film'. That may be true. However books are books, and movies are movies. They are too different media and what works well on one does not necessarily work well on the other. I could care less how faithful to the book a movie is. I do not go to see movies for factual correctness. I go to be entertained. This movie was definitely not entertaining. I found myself looking around at the ceiling a great deal. Also, the grossness of people eating massive amounts of candy was overdone. Everyone knows fat people are gross - I don't have to pay $8.50 to understand that. I don't even need the over the top dramatic music either. Johnny Depp just acted like a freak for entire film, but I think its a role he feels most comfortable in. The worst parts of the movie were the Umpalumpa songs. They were embarrassingly bad, and I felt bad for the little Indian man doing them. He must be really hard up for work. This is a horrible flick, and the original is about 85 billion times better.",1,4,11,21 July 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Kubricks worst film
","This is without a doubt the worst Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen. I am a big Kubrick fan, and amongst my favorite films of his are The Shinings, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon. Maybe the film is ruined already because I actually read the book first.One of the main reasons Kubrick totally missed the ball with this movie, is because he forgot to include the last chapter of the book. This is the chapter where Alex grows up and becomes a man. This is like watching The Usual Suspects, but then switching it off 5 minutes before the end - you lose the entire point of the whole film.Besides this major flub, the film is a poor rendition of the book. Like a lot of Kubrick films, it has a totally unrealistic feel to it. He composes the shots more like paintings than movie scenes - like in Barry Lyndon. People forget that Kubrick was initially a still photographer before he became a director, and I think it shows a lot in his work.When I read the book, the world that Alex and his droogs lived in did not seem anything like the 'futuristic' world Kubrick presents (complete with 1972 VW Beetles and 70's styled trucks). Instead of ultra-violence, we see much more of ultra-cheese. Which idiot made up the idea that Dim should repeat every word everyone says? That didn't happen in the book.Kubrick has took the book and butchered it. Some reviews on here make it seem like Kubrick was the genius who came up with the concept, the idea for this great story. He just took a great story, snipped the ending, and made a rather silly movie that glorifies violence. I understand that this is a very 'in' film to like, and there are probably many idiots who idol Alex and his droogs.Overall, very poor work from Kubrick. Verges on downright cheese at times. Especially the shots of Alex with fangs in his mouth for no apparent reason. I give it 1 star.",1,35,74,18 February 2005
Signs," Good movie (possible spoilers)
","I really dont like to like movies that have been given a lot of hype such as 'signs' was. However, when I went to see it in a relatively packed theatre, everyone was into the movie. It did make you feel uncomfortable, and there were about 4 parts that made you jump. There were a lot of funny parts, and overall it was funnier than it was scary. But there are faults with the movie: 1) If the aliens are allergic to water, why would they choose to invade a planet which is 70% water, and harvest human when the human body is mostly made of water also? 2)If I aliens had just been trying to get into my cellar door, there is no chance in hell I would pass out and go to sleep for 12 hours. It is far more likely that I would pass out for 30 minutes, and every slight noise I would hear would wake me up. The film had a feeling very similiar to the superior film called 'The Others', and it also reminded me a lot of 'Night of the Living Dead', but it is worth the money, and its an anjoyable film. As for if it is worthy of an oscar, I say no. The oscars are awards that have no basis on whether a film is good or not, its just a bunch of old people sitting around playing movie buffs. Come on, like a Beautiful Mind should have won best picture.",Null,0,2,7 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars is for dorks
","I have to admit Star Wars : A new hope is a rather good movie. Although it has quite a slow start, towards the end of the movie it gets quite exciting, and you genuinely feel the tension as Luke barrels down the trench at the end. Having said that, it is important to note that although it is a good movie, its isn't THAT good. There are many other films that make far more of an emotional impact.The movie has been immortalized by sad, lonely people who struggle to fit into to regular society. I have a dork friend who is obsessed by Star Wars. He goes to see the new movies at midnight on opening night, hangs out at Star Wars geek meetings to discuss who important topics such as who fired first : Han or Geeko? Him and his hopeless depressed peers ponder upon the logistics of making many millions of clones and how the Emperor is an expert double crosser. I look at him and I pity him, because I do not believe that he will ever understand its a stupid film that made George Lucas a billionaire, and none of the characters are actually real.I have to be honest, out of 5 films only 1 has been any good. Which leaves me the question, why is Star Wars so popular? I have to say also, I thought Lord of the Rings was total cack also. But the intense geek following that is characteristic of Star Wars nerds is almost nauseating. God help sad lonely dorks, and may the force help them find girlfriends. Peace.",Null,2,4,23 September 2004
