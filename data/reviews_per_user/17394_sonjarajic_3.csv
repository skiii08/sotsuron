The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not as bad as the movies before, yet definitely not good.
","Well I can say that I'm NOT a fan of Twilight movies so it was a bit too cheesy for me, but I can also say that it's the best of the ones before and if you are a fan of vampires, fights, sloppy love stories and some disgusting things you will probably like the movie.If you are easily disgusted do not watch this movie.Well in this one we have fights between wolfs and vampires. Meh.It's new, different, more exciting, more disgusting and kinda better than the last three. If you don't consider 'better' being actually good, because it's not.Acting is OK. I don't want to to separate individuals so I'll just say that they were just OK. I didn't hate-HATE the movie but I won't ever watch it again for sure.Seriously, the movie has no point.",3,2,6,12 January 2012
Amadeus," Magical, beautiful masterpiece!
","So I watched this movie more than ten times. I never felt enough and somehow I always end up crying.Now seriously Milos Forman did an amazing job. It keeps impressing me when Salieri takes original sheets how we see the projection of what he sees and of what's written on the paper. How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere. Also, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it. The hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time. And instead of Salieri's expectations of his funeral- a big cathedral, music playing, many people, we see how he's thrown into a hole with the rest of poor people who didn't have money to afford a decent funeral. It makes you ask yourself: Doesn't he deserve more? Now we don't even have a stone to call his grave, we know there was no difference of the final resting place of one of a kind music genius and any ordinary man who made no difference in this world. But we still have his music.Tom Hulce and F.Murrey Abraham acted wonderfully, the movie became so real that it touched me even more with every passing minute. Lines are fantastic too, true, straight, touching, you can apply them on your real life. One of the best movies I've ever watched.",10,1,2,12 January 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A story about life, and death.
","I first fell in love with the book by John Boyne, than with the movie. Firstly, I don't consider this a children book, I just don't think they'd properly interpret it, and even if they would. they would be very emotionally moved. It tells a story about an innocent boy whose father is a commandant in WW2 and his forbidden friendship with a young Jew just across the fence, on this farm, where all farmers are wearing pajamas all day. Throughout the whole film there have been a few sentences, so true, yet so discrete, because they were addressed to an 8 year old boy, the sentences that he doesn't understand, yet you do, and you pause the film and just sit in your empty room and think in complete silence and just think. You think about life, about death, your life, somebody else's life, about people in general, about all the harm they do and about all the misfortune and misery a human race is capable of causing. The book's beautifully transferred to the movie screen, Herman did an amazing job interpreting Boyne's masterpiece, casting was right on spot, they couldn't have pick better-suiting actors for this.Vera Faminga was outstanding, with her scream only a mother can understand. I noticed tears flowing down my cheeks about halfway across the movie, because it's a sad and touching story, one that cannot have a happy ending but makes you think about it for weeks after. The only faith we all share is death, where it doesn't matter if you're German, or white, or black, or Jewish. In death, we're all the same. 10/10",10,1,2,30 July 2013
