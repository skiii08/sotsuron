The New World," Great film in all regards.
","This was much better than I expected. No flag waving, and it wasn't a Farrell stinker like Alexander. Just finished a year of American historyat university and noticed the film's director did a good job of dodging historical-political missteps-portraying natives or colonists harshly.There is no 'bad guy' other than a few rotten-mouthed English. It just shows how surreal the whole experience must have been for everyone. Imagine how natives must have felt to be brought to England-mind exploder, dude. Sad and dramatic, yet enough action and visuals- pleasant enough to watch with your girlfriend. The musical score made me go out and buy some Wagner, too.",9,2,5,3 September 2006
