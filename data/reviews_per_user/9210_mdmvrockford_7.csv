Blade Runner 2049," Excellent movie
","This movie underperformed with respect to its budget. I can see why for many reasons. It has a great story, amazing visual (as expected from Roger Deakins) and amazing sound. A 'sequel' that one could make an argument that bests the original (the original here being 'Blade Runner (The Final Cut)'; N.B. there are at least four different versions of original 'Blade Runner'). But after two viewings of 'BR2049,' I still feel the first Blade Runner (The Final Cut) is the better movie.Even though I knew the entire story prior to seeing it, this movies kept my interest for entire running time 2 hours 44 minutes. A great story and reference sound and visual blu ray. I bought the regular blu ray. If one likes the original 'Blade Runner (The Final Cut)' then one will very likely love this movie. I would highly recommend first watching 'Blade Runner (The Final Cut)'. And if you enjoy it then proceed later to 'Blade Runner 2049' and also by that time the rental should be cheaper. I consider 'Blade Runner (The Final Cut)' among my ten best movies any genre.Denis Villeneuve (director of 'Blade Runner 2049') has directed some other excellent good movies (in no particular order): 'Enemy,' 'Prisoners,' 'Sicario,' and 'Arrival.'",10,1,4,20 January 2018
Wind River," Great slow burning drama-mystery
","Overall a great movie. If you liked 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water' then you will likely enjoy this drama-mystery. I certainly did. 'Wind River' and these other two movies by same writer(Taylor Sheridan). There is a fair amount of violence (see CONS). PROS:
* Tight, good story with slow burn) 
* By far, Jeremy Renner's acting in this movie. IMO by far his best acting role. Hopefully his Hawkeye (Clint Barton ) roles will afford him the income to do more movies like 'Wind River.'
* Elizabeth Olson (another Avengers alum) acting 
* Native American cast (e.g. Graham Greene and Gil Birmingham)
* Utah (though movie states Wyoming) winter environment is well represented showing it is is friend and foe at timesCONS:
* Is showing the rape at end of movie really necessary? Already established twice she was brutally raped (1st Elizabeth Olson's FBI character stating so upon finding body and 2nd the Medical Examiner describing victim). To me it was gratuitious much like showing Jodie Foster character's rape in 'The Accused.'
* Elizabeth Olson's FBI character does some real boneheaded decisions. E.g. Despite still very affected by pepper spray, she still enters drug-hole home to clear it. E.g. At end of movie she was being flanked by the workers but able to stand down. Then minutes later, she does not take proper precautions knocking on closed door (e.g. should have had on weapon and not stand directly in front of door). These boneheaded decisions given to her by the writer knocks off one star for me. 
* Needing better closure for death of Graham Greene's Ben sheriff character and the other police officers. There was no mention by Renner nor Olson's character of the death of at least three police officers. Just simple <10 second mention is all that is needed.",8,0,1,6 January 2018
12 Angry Men," An all time great movie.
","I do not have much unique information to add to review of this all time great movie. But consider this information: This movie entire length kept my interest and interest of my young adult son despite it taking place in only two room, has no slang, no violence, no typical action. In fact, HD Net movies channel rated it as 'G' and I agree. This is top 10 on imdb.com and one of Roger Ebert's Great Movies.",10,0,0,31 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ep9 is just like a made-every-year blockbuster film
","NON-SPOILER REVIEW/THOUGHTS:
* Overall rating 1.5/4 stars (or with IMDB system of 10 stars: 3.75/10 stars)* Ranking among the nine Star Wars trilogy movies: original trilogy (OT): episodes 4,5,6, prequel trilogy (PT: episodes 1,2,3) and sequel trilogy (ST: episodes 7,8,9)Ep5> Ep4 >>>>> (then far behind) Ep7>Ep3>Ep6>>>>>> Ep8>Ep2>Ep9>Ep1* Non-Star Wars fans are not recommended to see this movie unless such persons have time and enjoy any 'filled-to-the-brim' action movie. This movie is long: ~2hrs 20 min.*For the long-term Star Wars fans and who appreciate very good story, I suspect they will be disappointed. I think one reason I am so disappointed with Ep9 is because so much time is spent retconning Episode 8. I can guess why filmmakers had to do this but still it makes Ep9 a worse movie.. Ep9 retcons at least eight key plot points/ideas of Ep8. I will not discuss as it would be spoilers and already this review is quite long. Also, IMO some other plot points of Ep9 make the PT and OT events meaningless. I attribute all this to forgettable, thin story.IMO, the filmmakers should have just released side stories like 'Rogue One' and on Disney+ 'The Mandolorian' to wet fans appetite while taking their time to formulate a cohesive, original great story for the Sequel Trilogy.* Ep9 has at best forgettable, thin story & meh script. There are amazing visuals and amazing sound (but amazing visual and sound no longer exclusive to Star Wars (e.g. Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, John Wick movies).
At least the OT and PT had an underlying great and very good story, respectively. The main problem I had with the PT (episodes 1,2,3) is the script is so bad. IMO, the prequel trilogy actually made great actors (e.g. Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson, Liam Neeson) look 2D and wooden. Also too much CGI limited actors ability to effectively act. Episode 1 was most guilty of these two problems. But the PT at least had a very good story: how does Anakin Skywalker become evil and how does Palpatine become Emperor.* Breakneck amount going on in Ep9. No time for prior scenes to sink in.* Like many blockbuster movies, most likely one will forget about it 24-48 hours later (i.e. it does not make meaningful, lasting connection and/or lasting emotional impact).* Why should Star Wars (main trilogy) movies be held to standard beyond other blockbuster movies? Whether one likes the SW universe, it is hard to argue its cultural impact. It is one of (if not the sole) grandparent of blockbuster movies and big-budget action movie and pop-culture and fandom. Kinda like any very well known and popular entertainment saga ending; one would hope for a great final episode. IMO so far only great final episodes/final movie are (not all inclusive nor in any particular order): last episode M.A.S.H. (TV show), LOTR 'The Return of the King', Breaking Bad 'Felina,'
Lots of prior misses (poor or mediocre) final episode/movie (not all inclusive nor in any particular order): Godfather 3, Seinfeld, Matrix 'Revolutions', Batman 'Dark Knight Rises'.What is disappointing for me is none of above had the budget (estimated at least $150M USD) and access to creative power available to Ep9 TROSky.",3,1,1,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not a great Star Wars movie & for that matter not a great movie in general.
","Warning Spoilers!My SPOILER-filled review of Star Wars 8 - The Last Jedi (SW8-TLJ)
* 5 out of 10 stars
* ranking of Star Wars movies (great to worse)
Ep5 Empire Strikes Back >>>> Ep4 A New Hope >>>>Ep7 The Force Awakens & Rogue One (like both equally) >>> Ep3 Revenge of the Sith > Ep6 Return of the Jedi >>>> Ep8 The Last Jedi >>>>>>>> Ep2 Attack of the Clones >>>>>>>>>Ep1 Phantom MenaceIn summary, this movie is made for casual movie goers and not the Star Wars aficionado, nor one who values great story telling. Of all the live action Star Wars movies, only Episode 5 and 4 are great movies. The rest are popcorn flicks and home-theater reference scenes. But IMO SW8-TLJ even lacks great reference sound scenes. Ep2 AOTC was overall weak film but had unique sounds like audio black hole of Slave 1's depth charges.If you enjoyed this movie then really I am happy for you. Star Wars is billed as event movie. This movie was a disappointment. My adult son holds Lord of the Rings in the highest regard. He was disappointed in the Hobbit trilogy. IMO, SW8-TLJ is like the Hobbit trilogy.Complexity and shocks do not equate to great story. I feel the people who value the shocks in this movie do not fully contemplate this in the SW story arc. We are movie lovers on IMDB and for an event movie like SW8 TLJ to disappoint is why we are seeing negative reviews and the Rotten Tomatoes audience score >35% difference from professional critics score.Some of my major criticisms of the film:
(1) Please don't imply it a new trilogy if what happened in Episode 7 and the Original Trilogy (Ep 4,5,6) can be completely disregarded. Example#1. Leia-Poppins (or Leia Superman) scene. 
In no other SW movie has Leia used the Force in physical way. Here she can survive the airless of outer space and Force her way back to the Raddus ship bridge. Here she can do the Superman-like flying because the script calls for it. Disregard all prior precedent. In part this is also lazy story device, IMO.Example#2 Luke acts way out of character.
Please see the web link at end of this post for Mark Hamill's own opinions posted on Huffington Post. First scene with Luke is he receives Anakin's lightsabre from Rey and he chucks it over his shoulder. This was clearly done in part for big laugh and shock. The mood at time did not call for any humor. Already by then forced humor of Poe prank-calling Hux and FN=2187 leaking bacta fluid suit. A better more realistic action and in keeping with 'hermit Luke' as written would have been: he looks at Anakin's lightsabre and hands it back to Rey with facial expression I do not want it and leave me alone. Rejection of the Force as Luke has done in SW8 TLJ does not equate into action of disrespecting his father who he fought at risk of his life to redeem in Ep6 ROTJ. Audiences also saw huge importance of Anakin's lightsabre in Ep4. Another example of Luke acting out of character in SW8 TLJ : his fleeting thought of murdering Ben Solo while Ben slept. This is from same Luke who redeemed his father in Ep6 ROTJ?! Example#3 Snoke is built up in Episode 7 to be one the most powerful (if not the most powerful ) Force user. 
In SW EP8 TLJ they continue this idea and theme (e.g. he wields Force lightening on Kylo Ren in their first scene). He toys with Rey literally like she is a puppet. Then Kylo kills him and no backstory and no more Snoke; just another disposable character. I am first to call this movie to be made 'Snoke and the First Order - A Star Wars Story.'Example#4 Rey is the ultimate Force wielder. 
We saw her defeat a multi-years trained Force user (Kylo Ren) in Episode 7 though it was 2nd time she ever touched lightsabre. Excuse in that movie was Kylo was injured from Chewbacca's laser shot to his flank. Well Kylo is healed up in this SW8 TLJ and again Rey is the ultimate lightsabre user as she defeats her portion of Snoke's Elite Praethorian guards and assists Kylo as he could not. All this from self training on Temple Island on Ahch-To?! IMO lazy story telling in having Rey advance to master Jedi lightsabre skill with effectively no training. Why did we even bother showing experience needed in Episodes 1,2,3 and 4,5,6? Rey is just born with it and has video game like 'God mode.'Also Rey can force sense the good in Kylo and instructs Luke that Kylo can be turned to the Light side of the Force. She is the now the Master and not Luke because hey that is what the story calls for. Yoda in SW8 TLJ even mentions she has mastery of the Force. So what with Yoda's >800 years experience. Again video game like 'God mode' for Rey.(2) SW8 TLJ breaks the rules it establishes.
Raddus bridge blown out by Tie Fighter and all on bridge including Leia sucked out to space. Leia then wakes up from frozen state and Superman/Mary Poppins flies back to Raddus bridge (where again clearly shown there is no gravity and vacuum of space). She is seen by Poe and Connix (played by her real life daughter Billie Lourd) and they do not later ask her about this power. When Leia is back from Superman/Poppins flight on Raddus bridge, Poe and Connix open bridge door to let Leia back in. Uhhh....shouldn't Poe and Connix be sucked out into space? Of course they were not.Rose Tico states she is pipe cleaner and Finn (FN2187 ) states he was floor moper for First Order in SW8-TLJ. And FN-2187 can't fly ship in episode 7. However both can pilot relic Crait fighters with ease and very well in SW EP8 TLJ.(3) Way too many bad jokes/inappropriate. 
For example Luke drinking green milk from nipple of Thala sirens, and way too long Poe prank calling Hux. (4) For all the changes that Rian Johnson mentions, very unoriginal callbacks to prior SW movies.Example#1 Dialogue of Snoke to Rey in his throne room on Supremacy is very similar to SW 6 ROTJ Emperor to Luke.
.
Example #2 Crait battle is like Hoth (even had new AT-M6 and some original AT-ATs).Example #3 Millenium Falcon (MF) flying inside Crait cavern like MF flying inside Death Star 2 in SW6 ROTJ.Example #4 Rey quits training (if can even call it training) with Luke and goes to confront Kylo and fails. In EP5 Luke quits training with Yoda and goes to confront Vader and fails.(5) Canto Bight story could have been trimmed down 95%.
It appears the only reason for it was for FN-2187 and Rose to get ship past Supremacy's shields and establish Broom boy (Timiri Blagg) and make statement that rich people & military industrial complex are bad. (6) Useless Poe mutiny story and stupid of Vice Admiral Holdo to withhold plan from Poe. This is only 1/4 of the problems I have with SW8 TLJ. But the above are the major ones. I have seen in twice (2nd time with my two kids). They both rate it 2 out of 4 stars. Sadly for me, I likely will have to move on from Star Wars. Let's hope JJ Abrams and the script writers can correct the SW story for Episode IX. FYI I do enjoy new science fiction since 1990 like (in no particular order):
'Children of Men'
'Arrival' (Amy Adams)
'Dark City'
Matrix (only first one)
'Minority Report:
'Moon' (Sam Rockwell)
'Gravity' (Sandra Bullock)
'Mad Max Fury Road'
'Edge of Tomorrow'
'Wall-E'
'Blade Runner 2049'",5,2,3,22 December 2017
Mother!," Worth a rental.
","This movie is worth a rental if one is interested in a non-mainstream movie. PROS: I appreciate a major studio (here Paramount Pictures) releasing a non-mainstream movie. I also liked Darren Aronofsky's unique vision (I thoroughly enjoyed his prior films 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Pi' ).' Jennifer Lawrence does some great acting.CONS: I routinely read spoilers prior to seeing a film. Like so many others, I am just too busy to able to spend >4 hours per week watching movies. IMO, a characteristic of a great film is one that will keep my interest despite my knowing its story. I have seen 'Godfather I' and 'Heat' too numerous to count times despite knowing the complete story. Well this one bored me in few portions. Overall the allegory is ok; maybe too much symbolism for me to understand. Jennifer Lawrence is limited to just few emotions or actions. The movie on blu ray is grainy and lacks in details and picture is very 'soft.' I realize this was intention of the director but to have sub-DVD level detail was frustrating on a large home theater screen. The special feature segments shot in HD were far superior with respect to detail level.",5,0,0,28 December 2017
Blade Runner," Believe the hype. This is one of the greatest modern films (any genre) .
","My opinions are only for the 'Final Cut' version on blu-ray. I think the original version with Harrison Ford Deckard's voice over is far inferior version. Also the additions made to the 'Final Cut' actually benefitted the film (unlike Star Wars Episode 4 Greedo shot first change).After over >1200 user reviews, there is little new information for me to add. I just have some random thoughtsThis is IMO, one of the best science fiction (and for that matter best movies any genre) ever made. But is a 'thinking-person's movie.' Amazing to see how many movies after Blade Runner borrow elements of its visuals and themes.",10,1,2,24 December 2017
