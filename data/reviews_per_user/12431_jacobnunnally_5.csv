Gremlins," Difficult to watch, now, as an adult
","I'm a child of the 80s and saw this movie when I was a kid. Like every kid from the 80s I was head over heels in love with it. It's a 'cartoonish' movie - this is why children like it.Since I still love 80s movies I thought I'd rewatch it this week. It was unbearable. I couldn't stomach more than about half an hour before I had to turn it off. It was so annoying, so cringe-y, I just couldn't stand it.Not sure how other adults feel but that's why I have given it a 5/10: I would have given it a 10/10 as a child and a 1/10 as an adult, so I just split the difference. Totally unwatchable as an adult, painfully annoying.",5,1,6,24 October 2019
It," Meh: Neither Here Nor There
","Saw the new 'It' last night and was completely underwhelmed. Neither here nor there. A superfluous re-make. Unnecessary.Whereas the original It was subtle, the remake was heavy-handed. While the original used suspense, the remake showed gore. If the original was 'smart', the remake wasn't very clever.A huge beef I have is that Pennywise has far, far too many lines in the remake. In the opening scene, he speaks with Georgie for several minutes. Jesus - enough already! We get it. Clown, teeth, scary. We know already. Why keep talking in that annoying voice? Another complaint: Pennywise overacts. He tries too hard in the human acting and the CGI tries too hard in the contortion/weirdness. It's not 'natural', and I think the overacting is a natural result of being given way too many lines.I was substantially disappointed with this effort. I felt it was a bit lazy...like the 3 screenwriters just threw their ideas together in an afternoon and that was that. Listen...when you remake a classic film, it has to be all guns blazing. It has to be perfect. This was far from the case. It was a trite affair, entirely superfluous. One final thing: the film relies on clichés - 'don't go into the basement', scary abandoned house, the bullies/the bullied. We've seen these clichés 10 million times...they write themselves...is there no room for something fresh or original here? Come on. Again, it's lazy. Clichés are easy, originality is hard.",5,0,2,16 November 2017
A Star Is Born," One specific thing
","Saw this over the weekend with a hot date, she loved it but I thought it was okay. The thing about this for me was how natural and fresh Lady Gaga's acting was compared to the overcooked, labored performance of Bradley Cooper. The former seemed so natural, so real. The latter seemed like he was trying too hard, like he knew he had ground to make up and was desperately trying to do so. For starters, no one talks how Cooper does in the movie. I found it to be unnatural and odd from the outset. I thought that was really strange. 'Why is he talking like that? Why doesn't he speak more like a normal person?' I kept asking myself. Then I thought 'Well...why is the director and producer okay with this? I'd think they would tell him 'Hey, dial it back a little bit. Or a lot. It will make your performance better.'' And then the credits told me! He himself directed and produced. Answers that question. Anyway, go see it for Lady Gaga, she's really wonderful in it.",6,0,1,15 October 2018
American Hustle," Looks Like I'm the Only One Who Didn't Like It
","With a current user rating of 8.3 and with ten - yes, 10 - ratings of 100 from the critics, I feel crazy not liking this movie. Critic Richard Roeper writes that 'I can't imagine anyone who loves movies not loving THIS movie.' I wanted to leave the theater and do something else after 45 minutes. No one else felt this?When flipping through a friend's screen writing book recently, I read that the most important thing a movie has to do is have a main character that the audience sympathizes with, a main character that the audience roots for. Even in a complex case - such as the protagonist of August Wilson's wonderful play 'Fences', whom we both detest and sympathize with - the audience must be drawn into actually caring about the main character.This film didn't have a protagonist (that's not a fault - Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' doesn't either), but still I could not have cared less about any character in this film. What was very strange, and a little unsettling, to me was that I felt this immediately, within the first five minutes of the film. Another thing you'll learn from screen writing books is that amateur screenwriters use too much dialogue. This movie is a classic case in amateurish, dialogue-heavy scenes. Constant, ceaseless dialogue really bogged down the film for me. This film didn't have a single bone of subtlety in its entire body. Dialogue, dialogue, dialogue.I saw in one of the trailers that this is a comedy - really!? I chuckled twice, and one of the occasions was in the film's first 30 seconds. There were several jokes that not a single person in the movie theater laughed at. So, in summary, I guess I'm the only person in the world who didn't care for this one. Contrary to Mr. Roeper's assertion at the beginning of this review, I love movies but I strongly disliked this one. My favorite movie is Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' - so maybe that explains it.jacobnunnally.blogspot.com",3,653,929,23 December 2013
The Thing," John Carpenter's early films are amazing - this is one of them
","It was difficult for me to decide how many stars to give this wonderful film. It is certainly an 8 or a 9, I thought, and I've ended up giving it a 9 because every second of this film - from the first to the very last - is riveting and engrossing.Yes, perhaps this reason was what persuaded me to give the 9 rather than the 8 rating - so, so many horror and sci-fi films begin slowly, with action not occurring until 30 or 40 minutes into the film. In other words, the first 1/3 or so of the film is spent in characterization, setting, and building up the conflict. From the first second of 'The Thing,' however, the suspense and the mystery are immediately evident, with the excellent score to the film (the Carpenter-esque, bass-pounding 'bum-bum......bum-bum') reinforcing the drama unfolding.This is a very, very smart film. It amazes me how fine Carpenter's early films were - Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Escape from New York, and, perhaps the best of all of them, Christine. Wow, what a list!",9,1,2,29 May 2012
