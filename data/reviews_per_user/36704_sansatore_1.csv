Hereditary," Definitely not a horror
","When reading all these positive comments about how scary and tense this movie is, i got like 'wtf did i watch then??'
Guys..and chicks whatever, listen, do NOT expect a horror film. You will be disappointed. It's a two hour (too) long and mostly boring experience. The story is a cliche and adds absolutely nothing new, except being too boring compared to other 'demons here and there and everywhere' movies. It could be categorized as a family-tragedy with some few disturbing pictures' at its best.. but definitely not a horror. Lame and cliche ending fits perfect to the overall experience. Not worth the money or time..",4,3,7,18 June 2018
