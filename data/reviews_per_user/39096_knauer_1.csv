Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a disappointment.
","I saw the 12  midnight showing and I was excited when STAR WARS popped up on the big screen.  It went downhill from there.The acting was flat and I just couldn't connect with or get behind any of the characters.  It wasn't like Episode IV where you could connect with the characters and cheer for them (like Han Solo).Why did Lucas 'dumb down' the script?  He made this movie for the 10 year old crowd.  That's too bad.  Lucas thought it would be good enough for the older crowd if he mirrored a lot of the scenes from Episode IV.   I won't spoil the movie with details, but the climax was the same and the fight scenes were the same.Something went terribly wrong in the production of this movie.  I gave it a 6 out of 10 because it was a breakthrough in special effects and it does add to Star Wars saga in a way that sets up future episodes.",6,0,1,19 May 1999
