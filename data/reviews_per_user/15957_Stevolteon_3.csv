Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," By no means disappointing
","Now, despite being pretty much a sci fi geek, I wasn't actually aware of Star Wars until the Digitally Remastered box set was released, and as such Episode 1 was the first Star Wars film I saw in the cinema, and I was stunned. It had almost everything, interesting new (or rather, old) technology, nice glimpses into different cultures, fantastic graphics, I'd go as far as to say it was the first film in ages that I felt came close to the standard set by Jurassic Park and awesome sound, the pulsing of Sebulba's Pod Racer's engines as he flew past took my breath away. I left the cinema absolutely wowed, I wouldn't have faulted the film at all. When it was released on video I bought it straight away, and it was the first film I noticed as being somewhat... lacking on video, to me it is very much a film built for the cinema. Furthermore, on about the third or fourth overall watching that critical factor began kicking in. The Jar Jar factor. I'd never much noticed him the two times I saw it in the cinema, in fact the second time I was very much on a 'I don't see what's wrong with Jar Jar' vibe upon leaving, but for some reason I really saw him on the TV, and I suddenly saw what the big problem was. I also started getting a bit annoyed by the Annakin character, well, more annoyed at the acting than the character. Obviously you can't really expect a child role to be impeccably acted, but I've seen better.Now, since the original trilogy were never such an intimate part of my early life I fail to get so passionately embittered about the folly that is Mr. Binks, but I would say he spoilt an otherwise decent film, I actually find him literally cringeworthy, which doesn't often happen. However, I definitely find the incessant 'jumped up toy advert' claims unjustifiably harsh (especially since I can't for the life of me find a decent model Destroyer Droid!) and Binks aside I thought the film was more or less all I'd hoped for.",7,1,2,29 August 2002
American Pie," Intensely hypocritical *spoiler warning*
","Okay, so this kind of comedy isn't my cup of tea - I spent the film either cringing or grimacing when I guess I was supposed to be laughing, but that's just me. I understand and appreciate that for a majority of people it was the funniest thing ever, and I won't criticise or try to change your opinion.What I do criticise (other than the predictability) is the fact that it is incredibly hypocritical. At the beginning the heroes (I use the term loosely) of the piece realise that a 'geeky' character has had sex, whereas as they are still virgins. Obviously this state of affairs threatens the entire stability of the stereotypical teen comedy genre, so they set off on a quest to 'get laid' at all costs. At this point I could see the end, they all get their wish and it turns out the geeky character hadn't actually had sex, so all is right with the world, but what I hadn't anticipated was the insertion of a life lesson for the foursome. Toward the end they suddenly realise that... y'know, loosing your virginity isn't that important after all...If the film had cut at that point I'd have been impressed and would have felt ashamed at my misgivings. What in fact happens is that it continues and... most of them do, indeed, 'get laid', completely voiding the lesson they've apparently learnt. Either this film is vastly hypocritical, or the message it's putting out is 'Loosing your virginity isn't important... so long as you've had sex.'As far as entertaining people with a receptive sense of humour goes it's obviously a resounding success, but they should have just left it as a string of 'hilarious situations' instead of trying to throw in a moral.",Null,1,1,31 December 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," See it. Go see it now. NOW!
","Absolutely unequivocably the funniest thing ever to have come out of Disney ever ever ever, and this is coming from someone who finds the whole 'Um, like yeah, y'know, like totally' culture to be repulsively odious.This film is absolutely packed with laughs from almost the very beginning to the very end, Disney are being so much braver with what they do, dropping the 'realism' of the normal films leading to some beautiful surreal humour, like the whole Kuzco: 'How did you get here first?????' Yzma: *shrugs* bit. And Krunk has to be one of the best characters ever, especially if you include his shoulder angels too.One thing... I wasn't actually so fond of the Pacho character, although he was voiced well he was a bit... I don't know, just at some points he seemed to deviate from his character.Anyway, absolutely stunning film, wonderfully smooth animation, and plenty of new and original things for Disney culminating in not only one of the funniest Disneys, but quite possibly one of the funniest films ever. I only wish the 'Mingin'' poster hadn't put me off seeing it in the cinema. Ugh... mingin'...",10,0,2,30 August 2002
