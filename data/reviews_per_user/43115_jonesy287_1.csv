Requiem for a Dream," Fantastic
","this movie is not just an eye opening experience that gives anyone who has actually done drugs before a sort of sweet and sour perspective, but it is a huge deterrent to anyone who has not already tried them. the characters are as realistically played as possible, this is truly an outstanding and gutsy movie for any director to make, and i give mad props to Aronofsky. although this movie is somewhat depressing, you really get the sense that it is real and you really start to feel for the characters and you feel for there sense of desperateness. great performances all around, i give this movie a 10, just because is impacts anyone who watches it so much. Requiem for a Dream really reminds me of The House of Sand and Fog, strictly because everyone is always in constant turmoil that the characters are in. they never really seem to be quite happy, there are some points where they seem to be really happy, but for 75% of the movie they are angry for something, and they are desperate for someone or themselves. overall this movie can really hit home if you take it in for what it really is, and thats drugs hurt people, whether you're directly involved or not.",8,0,1,16 December 2004
