Walk the Line," Outstanding.
",What a rush! This film was fantastic. I really like the appeal of Johnny cash. He was the original alternative music star and walk the line chronicles how he made his own path in the world of rock and roll that was snowballing at the time.Johnny cash's story also provides interesting counterpoint to that of Elvis Presley. It really made me think what would have happened if Elvis had had a June Carter of his own would his tragedy have been averted.Walk the line is a poignant and uplifting story of overcoming your demons to reach the pinnacles of your goals and i would recommend it to anyone who has ever thought about quitting anything.,10,0,0,27 February 2006
