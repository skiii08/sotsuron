Requiem for a Dream," we are all dumber after watching this movie
","this movie is so bad i cant put it into words. how can some people say 'if you don't like this movie its bc you cant watch it with a open mind' sorry i value my time and i don't care about the life of a drug addict and there horrible tough life that they chose for them self. If you like the feel sorry for yourself movies then you might like it. the only thing this movie has to offer is good music. other then that its about heroin addicts and what they will do for drugs. WHO CARES!!!!! This Movie actually got very comical after awhile. If you didn't know drugs are bad now you do, and don't have to watch this movie and lose 90 min of your life!!!",1,7,14,3 July 2011
