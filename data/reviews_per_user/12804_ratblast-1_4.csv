The Blair Witch Project," a complete piece of crap
","it has been a long time since i have seen this piece of crap. the movie should be re-named the blonde bitch project. all i can remember about this film is the blonde women arguing over who lost the map for at least 1/3 the movie. it has no scary parts at all, blair witch 2 was far  better than this.... i need not go into detail of the plot as i am sure you have seen reviews by many people.",1,16,31,5 June 2002
Van Helsing," why such a low rating ?
","did i watch the same movie as everyone else ? this is getting lower ratings than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , it was pure crap! this movie is just an action film with a simple plot , nothing more. i feel it is right up there with movies such as The Mummy (1999) the action is solid right to the end.... all you FX hounds should love it. they are not top of the line but it is full of them . the music and sound effects were well used in all it's dolby digital and thx glory.9 out of 10",9,2,4,16 May 2004
28 Days Later...," what is all the fuss about ?
","This movie is nothing special at all. started real good , than turned into a long drawn out middle and a stupid ending. mabe the britt's have some poor movies in the past when it comes to so called zombie flicks, but you yanks and us canucks have many better movies of this kind to choose from.  nothing wrong with the acting, the plot was good enough ...... but was not put to film right. i give it a 6 out of 10.",6,1,2,6 July 2003
Mulholland Drive," made no sense
","this movie made no sense to me at all.  i watched it with 3 other people , not one of us could figure it out.  i have watched many good movies that made no sense until it tied togeather at the end. i see no reason for it to have anything above a 3 out of 10.",3,0,3,31 December 2002
