Iron Man 3," This is an AMAZING MOVIE!
","Ironman 3 was a cinematic experience. So many people bash this movie because they didn't accurately represent the Mandarin character like in the comics! The hate is absolutely ridiculous! This movie has a great script, witty dialog, breathtaking action, an amazing story and dives deep into the Tony Stark character. Ironman 3 is a very Tony Stark driven movie. It brings back some of the magic from Ironman 1. The movie shows Tony's intellect and how smart he really is. It shows that he's not just a man in the suit, but a great intelligent person. The movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and characters. The twist with the mandarin was brilliant and I didn't see it coming. Many people hate on the movie for this, but I found it very funny and clever. It was a very ballsy move by marvel, but paid off in the end. The movie also does an okay Job of blending dark themes and the humor together. I will admit not all the humor land with you, but works for 90% of the time. In the end had so much fun with iron man 3, it wasn't as good as the first, but was still a worthy sequel",8,14,22,20 April 2015
Ant-Man," It's ANTmazing!
","Marvel does it again with Ant-Man! I was a little skeptical going into ant-man, considering the directors changed around and the fact that the trailers weren't overly exciting. This movie blew my expectations out of the water. This movie was so awesome. The action scenes and CGI was brilliant. It all looked seamless. When Ant-Man is running along with all the Ants, it's super fun to watch. Paul Rudd as the hero was a perfect choice. His humour can be seen in this movie also. Michael Douglas and Evangeline lily were an amazing father and daughter in this movie. (Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne). The villain character was also developed deeply enough to understand his motivations. He wasn't just a typical villain. The way this movie links to marvel universe was awesomely done. Nothing felt forced, everything felt natural. The script and dialogue is also very good, sharp and witty. I had a blast with ant-man!",8,0,7,18 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Better then the first!
","Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. Her role was substantially bigger this time around. This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also.The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic.The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. This is much more emotional, than the first movie. I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie!",8,197,417,14 April 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Excellent movie better than expected
","Kingsman is an amazing movie experience. It blends all different types of genres. Action, spy, and comedy. It has amazing characters and has excellent timing with it's action and its comedy. It's a well paced movie. During this movie you will laugh, cry, and jump with joy. It has a great movie villain and has a great protagonist. Taron Egerton is an upcoming action movie star! Collin Firth was also a show stealer in this movie. Samuel L Jacskson is also brilliant. He definitely stepped up his acting. He was responsible for most of the comedy and humor. Kingsman the secret service was and amazing movie experience! I definitely recommend this movie to all action/spy lovers!",10,2,8,3 April 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," High obtain action joyride!
","Guys it's simple, Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece! Not only does this movie have great action, it has amazing characters, dialog and heart. This movie features great FX that are all practical. About 90% of the explosions and action are all practical and makes you enjoy the movie much more. The movie is set in a post apocalyptic world and it does a good job at setting a dark tone and world. You really feel the characters motivation because of the world the movie is set in. The cinematography is also fantastic. There is no shaky cam, it's all marvelously shot. The acting is perfect. Tom Hardy as Mad Max was perfect. In fact I think he was better then Mel Gibson. The villain and characters are great also. Obviously you have Max, but the stand out characters are the villain, and the character named Furiosia. Some of the best action includes these characters. In the end Mad Max Fury road is a high octane, action joyride. It has great characters, acting, story, setting and of course brilliant action! This is definitely one of the best movies of the year!",9,17,33,16 May 2015
Furious 7," A great fun action adventure!
","Furious 7 is a great addition to the Fast and the Furious series! It has all the great action and humor from the previous movies, but also has more character development and heart. The movie of course has its over the top scenes and cheesy dialog, but that is easily forgotten with the amount of fun you have with this movie. The cinematography is also much better in this movie, thanks to the new director James Wan. James wan gives you all the great moments from the last movies, but steps it up. The movie also handles Paul Walkers death in great way. He also has a tribute at the end of the movie. Furious 7 is an amazing time at the cinemas!",8,68,81,3 April 2015
