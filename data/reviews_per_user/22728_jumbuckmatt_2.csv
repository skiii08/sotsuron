First Man," Raw, inspiring and timely look at Mans greatest achievement
","I was really captured by this movie. In this modern age of futuristic and technologically advanced space companies starting to take centre stage, we have forgotten the crude but effective machines that got us to the moon in the 1960's. I found the descent to the moon to be one of the most dramatic and emotionally charged movie sequences I have experienced. I couldn't help but be completely awestruck by this depiction of one of the greatest moments in human history. The character study of Neil Armstrong prior to this helps put you in the tension of the moment. This may be as close as we will ever get to knowing what might have been running through his head as he landed on the moon. First Man is a 'warts and all' depiction of the mission to land men on the moon. Imperfect human beings using crude technology to get to the moon, and then back home to Earth. We did this......Wow!",9,1,4,15 December 2018
Aquaman," Another B-Grade Dolph Movie
","Dolph Lundgren sets the bar low and everyone else follows in this awful 'high' budget B Movie. In fact you would expect Dolph to be way out of his depth here in the company of such talent as Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe and Patrick Wilson but no, the Dialogue and storyline are so bad that the skill required to act in this movie brings every down to Dolph's level. I felt embarrassed for the actors forcing their way through cheesy lines and sat cringing as joke after joke fell flat. I give it 2 stars because the CGI guys/girls actually do a fantastic job, its just a pity there's no substance to the rest of the movie.",2,3,7,27 December 2018
