It," More closely aligned with the book.
","As much as lots of my generation loved the TV version of IT, it wasn't really as dark and gruesome as the book. Tim Curry was ingrained in our brains as Pennywise. This one is a lot better. Skarsgard is a fantastic Pennywise, the child actors are convincing and for the most part the cinematic changes are more than acceptable, at the least understandable. However the final face off decides to go 'off book' and leads into the classic cinematic horror film tropes, which doesn't work with the build up, leaving you incredulous on behalf of the 'tweens'. I found it tense, a few jumps (much to my surprise) and I enjoyed it. I won't say more. It could have been perfect, in the end it's just a bit of a let down for ten minutes. 8/10 (would have been a 9).",8,4,10,11 September 2017
Macbeth," A must see and then again, and again...
","I was lucky to see this in a cinema where no one spoke during the entire duration of the film (a rarity I find nowadays) - it may be because people were holding their breath in anticipation of what was to come next. Wow. Had me transfixed the entire way through. Those familiar lines no less haunting for the multiple times my eyes have seen them and my ears heard them. Some clever interpretation of the original text including additions that were only spoken of in the original play script. Some purists might not like these additions and interpretations but I found them equitable to the original. Fassbender was amazing. Understated where needed, alternately a powerhouse. I can and will watch again.",9,35,59,28 September 2015
