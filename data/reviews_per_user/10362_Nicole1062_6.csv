Blade Runner 2049," A very worthy, thought provoking sequel - still talking about it
","To get the negatives out of the way: the film was a little slow in places - everyone knew what was coming but some denouements were dragged out a little; and there was a lot of gratuitous female objectification, which did not sit comfortably with me. However, overall this was a brilliant sequel and I think better than the original, although it complemented it perfectly. This is a gripping, very moving 'human' condition film about aspiration and hope and the desire to fit in/belong to the 'normal' group. It could be seen as an allegory for any situation where a group feels marginalised through the controlling power which wants to consolidate its position by sidelining/enslaving the 'others'. Ryan Gosling is superb and brilliantly portrays his character's journey which cannot be further described without introducing spoilers. My husband and I have spent the last three hours talking about this amazing film!",9,2,8,14 October 2017
Wind River," A special film
","Watch it! I find it difficult to describe this film except,as my husband said (with a catch in his throat) 'it's as though you're watching real what is actually happening'. It is a thriller but so much more than that. It presents you with the reality of life on a Native American reservation - there is a comic/tragic moment near the end where the victim's father (a Native American) is painted in a 'death face' which is like a bad football fan's face painting and he says there is no one left to show him how to do it. But is also about loss, hardship, strength, survival and more. I can't possibly do it justice but it's association with Harvey Weinstein must be the only reason it was snubbed by the oscars in 2018 because otherwise it would have cleaned up!",10,0,3,3 February 2018
The Revenant," We left an hour before the end
","I expected much but to be honest was bored. I am more than capable of appreciating a long, largely gloomy film about existence and survival (the road came to mind during this film and I thought that was brilliant and very moving) but I found this film ultimately tedious. There was no character development so I simply didn't care what happened to Leonardo Di Caprios's character. Scene after scene started with him face down in the snow, moaning. An internal monologue and more of a back story might have helped. There were also many plot holes such as the scene where he found himself above the river (at least 200 fatal feet high) and suddenly he was down in the water. He then found himself propelled for some time through ice-filled water which should have killed someone with the injuries he sustained from the bear attack. Scenes began with potential menace but then nothing happened. I checked my phone thinking it must be nearly over and, with an hour to go, bailed. Still don't care what the outcome was. Definitely not an Oscar deserving performance, or film but no doubt I will be proved wrong!",3,4,8,31 January 2016
Get Out," Did not live up to the hype
","Potential spoiler alertI will start by saying that the lead was excellent. However my daughter and I left the film feeling decidedly 'meh'!After the hype we were expecting a cracking and different horror or at least a good psychological thriller, but, other than a few shock moments at the start, the film just did not follow through. It felt very derivative, particularly the Stepford Wives/sinister community motif used for the majority of the film. And the 'explanation ' was somewhat rushed. Sad to be less than enthused but it did not tick any boxes for me.This was neither a good horror, nor a clever psychological thriller and I'm not sure where the hype originated from. A waste of a good cast!",4,9,20,27 March 2017
Unbroken," Perfectly adequate film but without heart
",Sometimes actors turned director makes sense - Clint Eastwood as a classic case in point. He is clearly an intelligent humanist who gets to the heart of his stories. Unbroken does not mark Angelina Jolie in the same way. This is a truly terrible tale of human suffering but it leaves you unmoved (and I am a movie crier). I think the lack is in the characterisation - we learn nothing about the subject except that he was an Olympian. When you look at much older films such as Angels with dirty faces which is a very short film but gets you involved in the e protagonist's life straight away and even though he is a bad lot you stay hooked throughout!,4,1,1,27 June 2015
The Nice Guys," Boring and unoriginal
","I only gave this a 2 as we switched off after about half an hour. I had reasonable expectations as the reviews were good but we were really disappointed. I think any film which very early on has a naked porn star sets its stall out. I was still prepared to give it a chance as the main performers are good but the promised laughs did not come, although the T and A came thick and fast! Having a 13 year old girl being subjected to free screenings of porn and discussions about anal felt very wrong and ultimately we were not entertained. Shabby! Both stars are capable of so much more. I could not recommend this film in any way and will certainly not bother watching the rest of the film.",2,29,61,8 October 2016
