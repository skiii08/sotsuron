"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," On target all the way
","Irreverant look at three female impersonators who travel across the Australian outback learning to deal not only with outside world, but also themselves, and each other. Insightfully examines the complexities of the 'alternative' lifestyle in a sharp,witty, fast paced style. The three leads play their parts quite well.  This is so superior to it's americanized version (TOO WONG FU THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR) that it is not even necessary to describe.  Worth a look just to see the incrediable academy award winning costumes.  Features a unforgettable scene involving ping pong balls.  Also don't forget the scene that comes AFTER the final credits.",7,3,6,23 June 2001
Miracle," Makes Good Use of it's 'Rags to Riches' Formula
","9 out of 10     Inspiring and exhilarating story about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that broke long odds by beating the mighty Russian team and eventually going on to win the gold medal.     This film gives off a rousing spirit that can be equaled to the one given off by the classic ROCKY picture.  One almost wants to jump from their seat and cheer.  This a very unique brand of movie because you know exactly what is going to happen and yet it only makes it all the more exciting.  It has a marvelous structure that takes things from the 'blueprint' stage to the final stage.  You see everything from the hiring of coach Brooks, to the selecting of players, their rigorous conditioning and eventual molding.  You see how this really wasn't a 'miracle' at all, but instead just good strategy and a lot of hard work and sacrifice.     This is a film that can be appreciated by a true sports fan as well as a player or coach.  It sticks to the basic story and by and large keeps things real.  There are no unnecessary story threads or exaggerations.  On the whole it is accurate and amazingly detailed.  It captures the era well and should bring back a strong feeling of emotion and nostalgia to those who lived through it.       Russell at first seems miscast as Herb Brooks.  He wears a puffy hairpiece that looks absolutely awful on him. The plaid pants he wears look almost as garish.  His Minnesota accent seems a little goofy at first, but by and large he stays pretty consistent with it.  Eventually he starts to really melt into the role.  His body language resembles the real Brooks and by the end you start to believe he is Brooks.  The way he chews his gum behind the bench during the games looks exactly the way a real coach does. This is one of Russell's best acting jobs and deserves Oscar consideration.     It's hard to find anything too critical about this film.  The 'Dream On' song by Aerosmith, that is played over the closing credits, seems to edgy for the material however the rest of the music  is excellent.  It would also have been nice to see what the players look like today instead of just reading tidbits about what they are all now doing.  The crowd in this film cannot equal the enthusiasm of the real crowd.  It might have worked better had it been filmed in the U.S. and an actual American crowd been used.     It is unfortunate that those in Canada dislike this movie because they consider it pro-American.  This film is not about politics of even hockey for that matter.  This film is about having big dreams and the exhilaration that comes when they are finally met.  It's just the same old 'rags to riches' formula, but it's very well done.",Null,0,0,13 March 2004
Erin Brockovich," ROCKY with high heels and a skirt
","Surprisingly stirring ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE/SILKWOOD combo about a out of work women who gets a low paying job at a law firm and uses it to take on a utility company that is poisoning the water of a small town.  Her dedication and perseverance results in a landmark settlement.There's something definitely UN-cinematic about this by the numbers bio, that at times almost seems like a TV movie of the week with big name stars. Yet the films story is not glossed over going into technical and educating detail on not only the contamination part, but most importantly on the legal process and the many 'strategies' needed to make this case a success.  In other words the filmmakers respect the subject and the viewer enough to give you a pretty clear view of what happened. Has a nice balance between Brokovich's personal and professional life and shows the many obstacles and sacrifices she had to deal with. Filmed with a tinted lens that helps accentuate the dusty,desolate dessert environment and the 'earthiness' of it's citizens.  In fact the actors used to play the average, ordinary townsfolk, look so much like the real thing you hardly believe they are actors.Roberts has always had the body type of Audrey Hepburns, which at times seems almost to slight.  Certainly not quite the right type for a tough talking, in your face, down home country girl like Brokovich.  Yet she is able to interpret and convey the 'essence' of her character so well that her physical liabilities soon become null.  In fact the glares she gives the opposing lawyers, or anyone else that represents the 'evil' utility company, are almost a treat in itself.Finney also excels here playing completely against type.  Usually a very strong presence, here he a plays a frazzled, tired, sixty something lawyer just waiting for retirement.  He's pulled back to his fighting spirit by the tenacity of Roberts.Basically it's ROCKY with high heels, and a short skirt.  It succeeds because it's based, believe it or not, on a true story that truly allows the viewer to believe  that one individual CAN make a difference.  Though there still is a disclaimer at the end of the credits stating that some characters and situations are fictional.The real Erin Brokovich and Ed Masary appear briefly in a restaurant scene. She is the waitress while he plays a customer looking over Roberts shoulder.",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
Meet the Parents," Good Vehicle for Stiller
","Satisfying 'forget your troubles' comedy that is loosely based on the funny French farce titled WHAT A SHITTY DAY.  Americanized to a stretched out TV sitcom with all the standardized mechanisms in place. Here Stiller plays your thirtysomething 'average Joe' off to meet his girlfriends parents whose father is especially picky, conservative, opinionated, and abrasive. This of course opens the floodgates for what is just one embarrassing (and uncomfortable) situation after another. As everything that can go wrong in meeting your girlfriends parents does.Runs so close to form that there's really no use to describe it further. Though there are a few 'laugh out loud' scenes.  They include a funny family water polo game and a inadvertent DeNiro/Stiller drag race.Stiller does well in what is obviously a tailored made vehicle.  He is this generations Bob Newhart/John Ritter.  Charmingly underplaying all the wackiness around him while still having just the right amount of pratfalls.DeNiro is good (of course) in a role where he finally gets to show his true age.  Danner though, as the mother, is completely wasted. Outside of jumping into a pool with all her clothes on, she has nothing funny to say or do. In fact the pet cat (named Jinx) comes off with a more interesting personality.Generally solid non-think entertainment with a quick chance to see that Phyllis George is still alive.  The former NFL TODAY/CBS MORNING NEWS hostess appears very briefly as a mother of another fiancee.",Null,0,0,2 March 2002
Fight Club," Less Should be More
","A young man finds escape from his boring job, frustrations, alienation, and lack of identity through a underground fight club.  The problems ensue when it becomes even more complex and dangerous than at first perceived.The story rather sharply looks at the very thin line between the mainstream and the underground.  How conformity and the American dream can actually be the catalyst to nonconformity and the American nightmare. It astutely examines the fact that there is a lot of unrecognized ticking time bombs right here in our midst.  The problems with the film really lies in the direction, which runs both good and bad.Finchers direction is good in that he matches the bleached out color of his print with a almost in your face analysis of the degeneration of his characters, with almost no let up.  He also includes some 'subliminal messages', which are kind of fun. (so pay attention!)His direction is bad with his overuse of dazzling camera work and computerized effects.  This should only be used if it can help accentuate the scene or define a character, but here it does nothing but drown out the story and make it look like a video game instead of a movie.  Having the camera glide thru the garbage in someone's trash can is nothing more than indulgence by the director to boast his cutting edge technological prowess. Also with all of todays 'advanced' effects it's amazing how easy it is to tell when it's been computerized.  For instance the penguin (another example of unnecessary indulgence) the second you see him you know he's been generated and is not real.It's interesting that out of all their effects only two things seem to remain.  The rundown, abandoned house the two men live in leaves the most lasting impression and the scene with the exploding skyscrapers looks as tacky as any 50's Japanese Godzilla flick.  You may have come a long way baby, but you still have a long way to go.The plot has too many quirky and unnecessary story lines and characters (especially Carters) that almost make it convoluted.  The scenes hopscotch between savage humor, gritty drama, and psychological thriller.  Put together and they tend to contradict each other and hurt the overall cohesion.  Although it stays metaphorically strong it becomes so overly exaggerated that by the end it losses it's overall  impact.  In fact the ending is kind of like killing a ranting lunatic.  Your just glad it's over so it can't get anymore wildly incredulous than it already has.Meat Loaf has his finest role since ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW playing the unforgettable Robert Paulson.",Null,0,1,30 March 2002
Monster," A Good Approach That Just Doesn't Go Far Enough
","5 out of 10True story of Aileen Wournos.  A prostitute who killed over seven men in and around the Florida area during the 1980's.The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that it merges the morality.  Nothing is black and white and the Wournas character is portrayed in a sensitive light.  In a lot of ways you really grow to have a compassion for her and a feeling for a her rough existence.  In fact during the first incident where she kills a man you are actually rooting for her to do it as he has tied her up and torturing her.  Wournas is really a victim and is no way the 'monster' that the title infers.  This is one of those 'stories behind the headlines'  that allows you to see it from a different perspective and have a better understanding about what happened and why.
This also allows for a good commentary on society where the film seems to place the brunt of the blame.  We see her trying to go clean and yet when no one will hire her she is forced to go back to her old ways and then punished for simply doing the desperate acts of a desperate person with few if any options.  The real monster here seems to be our socio-economic structure and certain puritanical people who underneath are really quite ugly and just as scary.The atmosphere is gritty and authentic and never let's up.  There is also a nice running commentary by the Wournas character, which allows for further insight into how she rationalizes what she does.  Some of her observations are right on target.The film's biggest flaw is that it  puts too much emphasis on her relationship with lesbian lover Selby (Ricci).  It's a rather offbeat relationship for sure and there are some telling moments about it, but it's only one element.  Some of the scenes between the two go on too long and become boring.The film also completely skip Wournas's childhood, which seems like an almost fundamental stage to examine.  The scenes involving the killings of the male customers are pretty benign.  Only the one involving Wilson, who was simply a kindly old man at the wrong place at the wrong time, has any emotional impact.Theron certainly plays the part without fault and was an obvious choice for the Oscar yet some of the credit really needs to go to the make up department.  Ricci is usually pretty good, but some of her responses here seem affected.  Still she has a real nice innocent girl look here that ends up exposing a dark side you just don't see at the start.Overall the film doesn't seem too have as much impact as it  should. The approach is a little too biased and they seem almost intent at making Wournas into some sort of martyr.  Despite an earnest effort it still seems like just an overview.",Null,1,1,18 April 2004
Glory," Highly Involving and Emotionally Gripping
","Powerful, gripping look at the 54th regiment the first all black fighters in the Civil war.  There's been many war movies and movies about racism, but this one really stands out.  You truly feel for these characters who all seem very real.  You admire their discipline, pride, and courage even when in the face of complete adversity.Broderick's boyish looks have never been better used.  He reluctantly becomes the commander of what is initially a rag tag group of individuals. He forces, badgers, and trains the troops to become real fighting soldiers all while forcing himself into his own manhood.Emotionally wrenching without ever being manipulative or preachy.  The final shot shows the sadness and absurdity of war better than all the others combined.",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
Pitch Black," Danger Will Robinson, Danger
","A rocket ship crash lands on a desolate planet.  Here the ships occupants must learn to survive the elements, each other, and some really nasty bat-like creatures that come out when it's dark.  Basically it's your routine action/thriller with some sci-fi trappings thrown in as frosting.  The structure seems to work on a timing pattern that spits out a new catastrophe every two minutes.  The first one comes almost immediately, even before we know who the heck these people are.  You almost wish that with each new calamity everybody's favorite robot would come out and warn 'Danger Will Robinson Danger'.  Not so much to give a break in the action, but to at least warn you to it's Speedy Gonzales pacing.  Of course if you do blink and miss one of these 'danger moments' you don't need to worry since another one will follow  precisely one minute and twenty seconds later.The cast is made up of purely stock characters.  Their sole purpose seems to be as darts, which are mechanically and constantly thrown into one terrifying scenario after another.  When the tension needs tuning they simply respond with looks and sounds of horror.  When the tension needs loosening they simply belt out a wise guy like one liner. Of course it does investigate a certain degree of 'darkness' to their personalities, but this attempt at multi-level is simple in nature.  There is nothing profound or philosophical here, which should be a turn off to most hardened sci-fi fans.If you have seen ALIEN of PREDATOR then you have essentially seen this.  Of course if those films are your drug than this movie can be your fix. Despite it's very obvious mechanics it does strap you into it's roller coaster ride and give you some excitement.  It's only after the ride is over and the seat belts unfastened do you realize how typical this Hollywood trip really is.Fans of this picture will pretty much tell you that the best thing about it is Vin Diesel.  He performs a very refreshing, very engaging sort of anti-hero, the likes of which haven't been seen for a long while.  This pretty much is HIS vehicle and he drives it quite nicely.  Good for Diesel fans and for those who might not yet be familiar with his work.",Null,0,0,14 April 2002
North by Northwest," Entertaining When Viewed in the Right Perspective
","Ultra slick espionage/spy thriller involving a ordinary man named Roger Thornhill who gets mistaken for a spy named George Kimble.  Complete fluff from beginning to end, but made enjoyable because nobody tries to make it more than it is.  It also features a couple of unique chase sequences that remain amazing even today.  One takes place on Mount Rushmore while another has Grant being rundown by a crop duster plane in a cornfield.     Although filled with all the great Hitchcock touches, including a couple of dazzling bird's eye view shots, it's really Grant that makes it the most enjoyable.  He seems to be at his charismatic best here.  Dashing and debonair, yet still full of sharp one liners.  He is both fun and funny. Gregory Peck and James Stewart were considered for the part, but it is hard to imagine them being as enjoyable with it.     Of course when compared with the state of the art special effects used in today's films, this may seem like a downgrade and maybe even lame.  The cars are all very obviously ridden on a soundstage in front of a blue screen.  The majority of the outdoor scenes are also done indoors without a single hint of any wind.     Yet if you are able to forgive this and it's very dated 50's look and sensibilities then you may find this enjoyable.  It is still a impressive directoral effort.     Be sure to keep an eye on the extras in the Mount Rushmore restaurant scene.  The kid at one of the tables is  a real riot.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Far Superior to the Original
","7 out of 10     Agreeable, easygoing actioner detailing a motley group of eleven very different guys brought together to a rob a highly secure casino in Las Vegas.     This is a remake of the 1960 original that starred Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  This one is far, far better.  Of course that film was so boring it is hard to believe that a remake could be any worse.  That film did not concentrate on the robbery itself, but instead just relied upon ol' blue eyes and Dino mugging for the camera.  This one is much more focused on the heist, which is elaborate and once it gets going even exciting.  They also do not fill you in on the complete plan and therefore gives the viewer some real neat intricate twists to the heist as it progresses. 
     The real drawback to it is just the fact that it seems virtually impossible to pull off especially with the way that they do it.  The fact that they do it with such ease really hurts the tension level.  It also gets a bit too exaggerated and hi-tech.  At times it almost seems more like an espionage film than a caper flick.     The comraderie amongst the group is one of the film's better elements. No one is overly obnoxious and no one is so cool that they can't be touched. These guys are slick, but they can still get nervous and display other vulnerabilities.   There is also some genuine concern and support for each other.  There is even some snappy exchanges although there could have been and should have been a lot more.     It is also nice that it breaks the age barrier and incorporates old timers Reiner and Gould into the fold.  Gould is pretty much wasted, but at least it's nice seeing him back doing movies that are released to the theatre and not just to your local video store shelf.  Although I must say his oversized Harry Carey glasses are awful and not even good for laughs. Reiner is good because he proves here that he can actually act as well as write and direct.  The ethnic accent he uses isn't bad.     The character of the casino owner who gets robbed is a interesting one. He is a man that carries everything out with a precision and is apparently quite sadistic and violent if he feels you betrayed him.  He is written as kind of  'untouchable' character with a mystic like the one in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  However Andy Garcia, who plays the part, fails to bring out even one shred of that mythical quality.  In fact Garcia makes the character seem downright dull.     One should also mention the terrific smooth jazz score.  It perfectly compliments the laid back style of the film and is distinct.  Of course, at times, the film may get a little too laid back.  It takes a while to get you involved with it and the ending is just too restrained.     I am usually not too into sequels, but a sequel here seems like a good idea.  This is a fun bunch too watch and they should be enjoyable in further adventures.  Their robbery schemes are clever.  A little fine tuning and it should be a blast.  Clooney is always good, but he overshadows Pitt too much and hopefully that will get rectified.",Null,0,1,11 April 2004
The Pianist," Excellent!
","At first one's impression of this film when reading about it's content, which is about a Jewish pianists real life accounts of the holocaust, is you've seen a lot about this so why see another.  Yet this film is really compelling and by having it focus meticulously on one individuals struggles, makes it even more gripping.  Sure one may have read all about the atrocities in their history books, but actually seeing a mass group of Jews herded into a windowless train car and then locked in is really shattering. 
     Director Polanski spreads this and other disturbing scenes throughout the film at unannounced intervals.  This is much more effective than just bunching them up into one section.  It truly gives you a very real taste of the daily tension and fear that the people must of felt.     Some critics have already christened this as Polanski's best film. Before seeing it you would have to wonder if these people had really seen all of Polanski's pictures.  After all this man has done alot of great movies.  Yet after seeing it I would probably have to agree.  The lighting, pacing, editing, acting, music, camerawork, and set design come together in a flawless chemistry.  Not just a a particular point, but throughout.  It also has a couple of really amazing shots.  One is a long shot showing row upon row of bombed out buildings.  It is really breathtaking especially when you fathom in how they were actually able to do it.     This is a very solid film that is well worth you time both as a educational and informative work.  There are parts of this that should stay with you long after it is over.  It definitely merits the best picture Oscar.",Null,1,3,25 February 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of the All Time Best
","10 out of 10     British P.O.W.'s at a Japanese island prison are ordered to build a bridge for the Japanese army yet the bridge and the construction of it only serve as a metaphor for human nature and the overall human condition.     This film is actually split up into six very distinct parts.  The first and by far the most interesting is the clash of wills between Colonel Nicholson and Colonel Saito.  The second part is the actual building of the bridge while the third is the planning for it's destruction.  The fourth is the slow and dangerous advancement through the jungle by the people hired to destroy the bridge.  The fifth consists of the actual completion of the bridge while the sixth deals with it's destruction.     It is really rare for a film to grab your attention right away and hold it consistently all the way through.  Even through three hours length it never has a slow moment and thankfully is not filled with needless extraneous footage either.  It is one of the most compacted, tightly edited three hour films you will ever see.  Finally Director Lean has a found a story that is strong enough and profound enough to match his very expansive visual style.     This film is tops in literally every aspect.  There is a terrific music score, lush photography, great location, acting, editing, and some really good special effects.  It is is also just a great all around adventure that balances it's profound moments with some really good action.  The ending is especially powerful and thought provoking.  There is also, believe it or not, some really good comedy.  Pay special attention to that calender in Hayakawa's office and how it changes from month to month.     Of course there is some strong doubt whether any of this could really happen in a actual P.O.W. camp especially with that big variety show the prisoners put on after the bridge's completion.  Yet the film still represents some very universal issues.  The animosity between the Guiness character and the Hayakawa one is the best because it shows how even with the greatest of adversaries they are more alike than they are different.  It also shows that how sometimes the one thing that really separates people more than anything is nothing more than circumstance.  It is also great at how it examines that even with the strongest, most disciplined, and most intimidating of people they can still have weaknesses somewhere.  This is also a film that makes terrific use of it's silent moments and makes it one of it's strongest elements.",Null,1,4,20 March 2004
