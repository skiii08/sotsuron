Requiem for a Dream," A visual and audial masterpiece
","Truly out of every film I have ever seen this has to be among the top. It earns its place in my most revered films not because of a stunning storyline, or special effects but because of its depressingly life like representation of addiction and the filming and musical score accompanying it.The story revolves around the lives of two drug abusers, Harry and Tyrone, Harry's mother and his girlfriend. It follows through their moving journey, one in which addiction and debauchery are common themes. The acting is superb from all four central characters, it is truly believable to the audience and at times the viewers can find themselves awe stricken by the realism of it all.The camera crew are geniuses and this in no small way contributes to the film as a whole. During the frequent grittier settings the camera is placed in ways that perfectly accentuates the scene. The sets, although mainly unchanging throughout, are created maintained in such a way that the audience is truly led to empathise with the characters and the slum like locations in which they dwell.The musical score too is on the brink of perfection with truly stunning music that accompanies each moving scene beautifully. The main theme, that is used fairly frequently throughout, is a haunting piece that truly feels to the audience like it reflects the personae with the film.In short it is a one of a kind film that quite simply cannot be missed. However it is not for the weak of heart and it is definitely no fairy tale. This is a stroke of genius upon the otherwise mediocre movie map that will quite simply shock you to the core.",10,1,2,23 July 2006
