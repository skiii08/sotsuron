Hereditary," Oh my god
","I went to see this this evening after reading and hearing so many great reviews full of hope that there was finally going to be a decent horror film made. And what a massive let down it was. Not scary in the slightest, not a tense moment in it and the acting is more wooden than the treehouse. The only saving grace was that it was free. I'm still in shock as to how bad it was.",1,5,11,12 July 2018
