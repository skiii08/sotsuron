The Rock," Excellent Film
","The film is about a high-ranking military officer, wishing to right injustices on behalf of his men, who takes over Alcatraz. Add in a few chemical weapons and you have the making of a good story. Nicolas Cage is then sent with Sean Connery to break into 'the Rock' & prevent the missiles being launched on an un-suspecting San Francisco. The film has moments of humour, the obligatory car chase and a happy ending. What more could you want!",10,2,3,2 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Dreadful Film
","After being glued to the fellowship of the rings, I was looking forward to the DVD being released, yet I felt sadly disappointed. The film appeared to have no story at all and was just a sequence of fight scenes. Working on the principle that I have bought the DVD so I am going to watch it , I stuck with it to the end. As for the DVD, it is going to be a case of Ebay here you come!",1,2,9,28 October 2003
