Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A fulfilling movie, as well as great eye candy.
","Okay, let's get one thing out of the way quickly. Jar Jar Binks is a very annoying character. He is obnoxious, he interrupts the story flow and he's virtually unintelligible. However, he's the only comic relief in the entire film. Without him, this would have been a depressing movie, so I appreciate his appearance for the light-heartedness it brought to THE PHANTOM MENACE.TPM has a very deep, very complex plot; and it moves like a rabid hare. Blink, or worse, forget to listen, and you'll have missed something important. Following the plot also requires that you know a great deal of the back story from the previous trilogy. In other words, you need to already have some idea of what this film is about before you see it; otherwise, you will be totally lost. I was fortunate to have a Sunday matinee audience. We were all silent, enthralled by the spectacle unfolding before us.A great spectacle, indeed. Much has been made of the grand special effects in this film. They are spectacular, and I admit I was expecting them to overshadow the human actors. I am happy to say that I was quite disappointed in that regard. Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn), in particular, is a forceful presence--a hyperdrive generator of energy just waiting to explode. In fact, during the climactic sequence, there is a perfect metaphor for his acting. He is at rest, biding his time in a meditative position while those around him stalk and leer, until opportunity presents itself and he leaps into action.He stalks through TPM. His outward countenance is cool. He shows calm, but you can sense his desperation, his drive to save the dying Republic. He knows the Republic is growing complacent, even the Jedi Council has become lazy, unaware of what is happening right in front of them. Neeson conveys all this to us, while hardly changing expression. It is, perhaps, the single best acting performance in any of the SW films.The remaining cast is serviceable. Ewan McGregor is wasted as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan, despite the prominence of his visage in the publicity, is little more than a sidekick with little chance to do more than say, 'Yes, Master' to Qui-Gon. Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) accurately plays a young child with a head full of dreams, but a few scenes requiring some emotional depth are beyond his abilities. Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) is mechanical and monotonal when trying to portray regality; however, when she lets her hairpiece down, she is a convincing teen troubled by the weight of her responsibilities. She is also utterly charming, and a believable object of Anakin's nascent infatuation.Having read the reviews and seen much of the publicity, I was expecting to be blown away by the pod race. I wasn't. True, it was a thrilling virtual ride, but it is not the sequence that sent chills running down my spine. That happened very early in the film, during the first sequence, when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan cut their way through a horde of soldier droids. Here, at last, are real Jedi. This is not the half-trained Luke Skywalker, nor the half-machine Darth Vader. These two, and Darth Maul later in the film, move gracefully through a balletic dance of destruction.Interspersing wicked swordplay with superhuman leaps, they show why the very word 'Jedi' once struck fear into the hearts of strong men. This sequence also defines the film. Like the Jedi cutting their way through their enemies, this film cuts through the fluff. There is a load of information here, almost an overload. The title, The Phantom Menace, is apropos in at least two ways, and it is key to remember that while trying to determine what is happening.I have a problem with only two minor points. One is Lucas' continued use of transitional wipes. While there is a sense of familiarity and continuity from the previous films, they are also very jarring. I never failed to actually notice them. Of course, it may be that they are the best way to transitioning between such a variety of scenes.The other flaw is Lucas' explanation for Anakin's birth. I believe Lucas has started to believe too much of his own press and thinks he really is creating a modern religious myth. He tries too hard to draw on various religious icons, including the manner of Anakin's birth. Then, Lucas backtracks and attempts some scientific mumbo-jumbo to explain everything. It's jarring and out of place. Credit Neeson for getting through the scene with a straight face.Overall, I found TPM to be a fulfilling movie, but I know that less-than-dedicated SW fans will find it confusing and too quickly paced. There is a great deal to mull over for the next several years while we wait for Chapter II.Cavebear's Ranking for The Phantom Menace:Quality - 5: Superb film, FX, directing and acting overshadow a few minor flaws.Appeal - 4: Will buzz right over the head of non SW fans, but will still draw crowds for the eye candy alone.Final Ranking (Q + A) - 9",9,0,0,24 May 1999
The Mummy," A solid film, but you may want to wait until the video.
","In 1926 Egypt, a spunky librarian/Egyptologist (Weisz) saves the life of an American Foreign Legionnaire (Fraser) who claims to have been to Hamunaptra--the ancient Egyptian City of the Dead. She is looking for the book of Amon Ra, but finds a 3,000 year old mummy who's having a really rotten day.Let me begin by saying that I'm really not fond of horror films. I generally stay away from movies that have the primary purpose of scaring the audience. So, what was I doing at THE MUMMY?That can be answered in two words: Brendan Fraser. I have enjoyed Fraser's performances in past films and find him to generally be a likable character. Unfortunately, he was miscast as the lead character of Rick O'Connell. In a role that called for cool-headed stoicism, he came across as stiff and befuddled. I believe his 'Encino Man' and 'George of the Jungle' characters have rubbed off on him. He was monosyllabic to the point of muteness.The script tried to give Fraser plenty of Arnold-esque throwaways to evoke laughter, but Fraser simply does not have Schwarzenegger's panache. Beyond a few mild chuckles, there wasn't much to evoke the campy feel that I believe the producers wanted. Fraser is affable, almost goofy, but he tried too hard to be hard-bitten when he should have accentuated his little-boy persona.There was a distinct 'been-there-done-that' aura surrounding this entire production. The set-pieces and sequences were strictly by-the-book thriller/action cliches ripped from countless other like-minded films. We have flesh-eating scarab beetles, ancient spells, American treasure-hunters, British intellectuals, a groveling evil sidekick, mysterious desert tribesmen, and lots of skeletal undead shuffling about.I also found the effects and cinematography to be disappointing. I like to get a 'movie' experience when paying for a theatre ticket, and THE MUMMY failed to deliver. Much of the film plays out in the claustrophobic labyrinth beneath Hamunaptra. While the lighting was always done well-enough to see the action, it would look much the same on a small screen as it did on the large. And the CGI mummy was stiff and mechanical. Especially in the full-body shots, it moved more like a stop-motion model than computer wizardry.There were a few good scenes. One set of warrior mummies move with the grace and speed of giant cats. An old warrior gets a final chance at redemption and brings a lump to your throat. And there's some pretty good sword fighting in the climactic scene. In general, the supporting cast was solid, with decent acting jobs all around.So, what did I really like about THE MUMMY?That can also be answered in two words: Rachel Weisz. As the inept librarian, Evelyn, she simply sparkled. She was a bright, effervescent light in a gray film. She added color and levity to every scene and bubbled over with more personality than most of the rest of the cast combined. Her naivete layered over a harder core makes her one of the more interesting heroines to appear on the silver screen in some time. THE MUMMY is definitely worth a look see for her appearance alone.But you may want to wait until the video is released.Cavebear's ranking for THE MUMMYQuality - 3: Solid, if unspectacular, film.Appeal - 2: Nothing new or exciting to offer fans or non-fans of the genre, but should play well until the Stars fall on May 19. Then it will be (un)dead in the water.Final ranking (Q+A): 5",5,0,0,11 May 1999
