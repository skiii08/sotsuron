Mission: Impossible III," Cruise has stalled
","Very predictable movie with many clich√©s scattered throughout. Compared to previous Cruise films, this one pales in comparison. He tries to make up for poor acting and a weak script, by throwing in many explosions and shootings. He is obviously so full of himself, that he focuses long sequences where he pushes his emoting. He has lost the edge that he had in the first two Mission Impossible films and other greats like Top Gun and Jerry Maguire. He should have stayed home with his young honey. The supporting cast does an excellent job, particularly Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Philip Hoffman, and Michelle Monaghan. Laurence Fishburne is his usual excellent self. They almost save this movie.",1,9,18,16 December 2006
