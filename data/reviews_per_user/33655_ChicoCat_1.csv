Hereditary," One of the Best Horror Films I've Seen in a Long Time
","I have been watching movies, and horror especially, for over 40 years. I adored Hereditary. The love and care Aster put into the story and directing are plain to see. The acting, gorgeous sets, and fantastic score are the icing on this cake. Each scene advances the plot, and I saw it three times to absorb the rich details in each scene. Therefore, I am a bit sad to see the reviews stating that it was slow or nothing happened. Hereditary is an example of quality filmmaking, and I am thrilled I was able to see it on the big screen.",Null,2,3,3 July 2018
