Walk the Line," go and walk this line
","i thoroughly recommend this movie to all, the finest performances from the leading roles i have seen for many a year. especially Reese Witherspoon.HOW THE HELL SHE Didn't WIN THE Oscar FOR THIS PERFORMANCE IS BEYOND ME. AND I HAVE SEEN THE CONSTANT BORE!!!The film of the year for me 2005/2006 i know thats two .i mean the last 12 month. superbly acted,easy watching and very informative,absolutely superb. couldn't take my eyes of miss Witherspoon,fantastic ,tremendous.go and watch,well worth the entrance fee.a good night out .",8,0,1,23 March 2006
The Irishman," Homage to ageing actors
","Not gunna be using any Barry Norman like fancy words to review this , unfortunately bang average at best , Pacino and De Niro are play as they do in every performance, not bad , but not great either , in essence what it says on the tin.Worth watching if you're a mafia storyline film buff , coz that's it seen it over and over.
There is not one scene or twist in the whole movie that remains in the head, not really to bothered its very long , had nothing better to do on a wet Monday afternoon. Film of the year not a chance ( joker ) Oscars ? Sentimentally yea but one for the boys retirement pot.
Casting was Norman Dobbins too , how the hell did the Scouce lad end up in there , there has to be 100 + American actors who could have played that part , so wooden it had splinters.
Each to their own , but a Rotten Tomato imo.",7,3,11,25 November 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," 3 billboards gets 8
","Well worth watching although I could write a hundred things I didn't like with movie.All th character's provoked plus / negative reactions throughout.I,m struggling to compare it with other similar type movies.Agree with others that it has a Coen brother type story and script without really succeeding,
A lot of unnecessary bad language and violence but I suppose that is expected from a black comedy in 2018.
It doesn't paint a nice picture of mid town USA and it may have a political theme .
But overall I believe most will feel it worth viewing even if only to drive a bus through the script.
Different movie during a time in the Cinema when we believe is as poor as ever,hardly surprising writers and directors must yearn to produce a movie that hasn't been done before.
So without really getting there it's a decent attempt .",Null,1,3,24 January 2018
The Revenant," My Goodness me
","I will concede a 7 for visual,the story a 5 ,the dialogue a 3 ,and the ridiculous goofs a 2 ,for instance the number of times a man on the verge of frost bite happily splash into freezing cold water makes the film just stupid,plus. Best actor really ? why what acting did De Cap actually have to do,apart from lying down in the snow and then leaping to his feet on any number of occasions. How many viewers really cared what happened ? I just wanted it to end.The tired story of old two men stabbing each other but then carrying on scrapping as though they have been attacked with a feather duster. O.K visually magnificent ,Oscar potential ,2016 scraping the bottom of the barrel now.",7,1,3,24 January 2016
No Country for Old Men," no point in going to see no country
","Well at least it was better than There Wil Be Blood,we watched that tripe last night! we went to see no country in the hope that after watching the other highly acclaimed nonsense the previous evening that decent modern day movies were still alive,,,,but there not. This was marginally better,the audience were astonished with the ending and felt cheated as they left the cinema. Whats the point ,please,why build up characters then forget about them,were not mind readers,and it ain't clever.Give the audience what they want ,ENTERTAINMENT!!! ,and this wasn't. And this is to the 'so called' film buffs who write ridiculous reviews giving the members of this forum false reads. No it ain't opinion ,thats rubbish,just like these two movies ,give us the real deal and not the crap thats ends with us spending our well earned cash on total garbage.",5,7,15,24 March 2008
The Lives of Others," What price freedom
","Firstly for my wife to enjoy this movie written in German but with English subtitles is a first in itself,and enjoy it she did immensely! Second i was attracted to this movie because the story is about modern(well modern to me)day oppression on ww2 scale or that similar to the situation in Germany in the mid to late 1930's,how could a society allow that to happen again,yet in did.I have never been to the west of Germany and the way it was portrayed in this excellent film,its bleakness,its greyness,makes you wonder why and how horrible characters like seen in the movie gain power.Yet was there a point at the end of the movie,the stasi officer,in a dead end job,the walls covered in graffiti,the traffic.I have spoken to a few young Germans from the East and asked is life any better nowadays and there answer is ,that before they could not say or go where they wanted,now they can go where ever they like and say almost whatever they like but they cannot afford it.Freedom of speech is of course the number one requirement of any society,but our writers and artist take the freedom for granted.An excellent movie but will not be watched by the wider audience.",8,1,4,24 April 2007
1917," Seen it all before
","Nicely ( not extraordinary in my view) shot , interesting tale but mainly a modern day Saving Private Ryan ( nowhere near as good ) ,unfortunately not over enthusiastic over the acting too, fairly wooden in my opinion.The score is not memorable either , plus with spoilers in my mind , some quite ridiculous scenes.As you can see it's just another war film for me ,of which I've seen many ,no different and a pointless remake . Tbf the one shot technique is lost on me so much for that.
Wouldn't recommend anyone unless they are war film aficionados , if it's raining don't waste your time 7.4 for us .",7,5,11,14 January 2020
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," good night ,no thanks.
","another over-hyped movie which disappointed me.although an interesting story ,in my humblest! its just a TV documentary.well acted,nicely shot in black and white and an interesting subject but ,well nothing to get excited about,wait whilst its on video or TV.sorry George. we had the choice to see v for vendetta and the matador ,so i was sorry we didn't choose these options. maybe it was because i didn't know enough about the subject ,i think this movie could possibly only interest those persons who work in the movies or have a detailed interest in the story subject. in fact i don't even know who played the lead role and to fair cant be bothered to find out (although i will)George clooney played a decent role and i like him in most things ,but Syriana was much,much better and as controvertial. so Mr clooney i believe you invested your own cash in this movie ,so i hope it works ,because its a dodgy subject and there should be more movies of this type ,unfortunately though the subject was not interesting enough for me to recommend it ,even to an enemy.",6,0,5,23 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," see it for yourself,its worth the time and the fee.
","FACTS........obviously a reasonably good movie,just by the reactions on this site alone.........................Great to see the cinema full(well almost) again and with families with teenagers............blimey ain't seen that for ages.........The storyline (aint read the book and i'm bloody glad i didn't,see i'm a philistine)very complicated if you attended a roman catholic church and served on the alter,very ,very complicated if you didn't..........is it entertaining......yes........is it too long ........yes by about 1/2 hr..........is it nicely filmed ..........yes superbly great locations ,very pleasing on the eye.........are the cast good ........NO......and i love tom hanks,but nowhere near as good as he was in his classics......is the dialogue .........NO .....pathetic at times.......is it over-hyped..........YES,YES,YES........and finally............is it worth getting of your arse and going to the cinema.........A Definite ...YES ,despite its faults.on a religious note,the Leonardo DA vinci fresco(copy of course) was mounted on the front of our alter at st Vincent De Paul's openshaw Manchester.......now i stared at that painting (more out of boredom) for nigh on 10 years and at know time did i think the figure to the right(or left as i saw it) wasn't anybody but a woman,i actually thought it was Mary Jesus mother,and never saw anything sinister in it . oh dear if only i would have thought sideways.................dreammmmmm,dream.dream,dream,dreammmmmmmm",6,1,2,25 May 2006
The Departed," Oscar????
","Best movie i have seen this year ,so ,i reckon it is probably justified as the best picture. But yea its a great story with some great performances,similar to Crash really,but for an Oscar as best Pic don't you think it should be more than just a good story. Now i'm confusing myself,i suppose the purpose of this web site is too recommend a movie and avoid anyone watching the dross they produce nowadays ,so that in itself ,i will conclude that The Departed is a very well recommended movie which we enjoyed immensely.........but is it an Oscar winning. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course Jack Nicholson puts in another quirky performance that we expect of him and i am never disappointed with Jacks name in the credits.Martin Scorcesse once points fun in the direction of the criminal and organised crime,sometimes i think that it glamorises ,but hey its a movie.Thought the sex scene was a tad unnecessary,but no real overuse of bad language.great really enjoyed.",8,0,0,20 March 2007
There Will Be Blood," There will be Poo
","I will certainly have to think twice about believing the reviews of movies on this site ,after wasting 2 and a half hours of our lives. Boring ,no point,no nothing,i'm so frustrated!!! when seeing the film had already shot to 45 n the best list,we couldn't wait to get there.We have seen 245 films better than this!!!!!There were at least 4 couples who walked out,although i always think you should see a film out ,i cant blame them. Daniel Day Lewis performance was excellent ,all be it exactly the sane character as Gangs of New York,but we need more than a great acting performance to make a good movie,and this is not a good movie.Only the 'luvvies' could even dream that this is a decent attempt and unless your one of those pretentious movie goers who think that 30 minutes without dialogue and 5 minute long shots of actors faces are what films are all about.AVOID THERE WILL BE POO!!!!",1,37,74,23 March 2008
1408," not one of Stephen kings best
","Not one of Kings best stories and certainly not one of the best film adaptations of one of his books. Very silly,not frightening ,predictable overall a very boring horror flick that eventually becomes preposterous. I couldn't give any spoilers because the viewer will soon realise quite quickly into the movie that they have seen it all before. I haven't seen a decent film in ages and its getting frustrating,mind you i knew that this would be garbage anyway.There has not Benn a truly frightening movie for years ,perhaps i am getting old(hang on i am) I scored it a 5 ,now come to think of it i am being very silly,cos i gave no country 3!!! and thats unfair,i going to swap the scores.",3,1,2,29 March 2008
