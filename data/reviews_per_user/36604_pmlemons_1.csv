First Man," Overly moody, overly dramatic shallow trajectory
","It you are looking for a good movie about the space program, watch the right stuff. I'm not sure what the goal of this movie is. To capture the epic accomplishment of the program or capture the epic people who were involved. Either way the movie fails on both counts in an overtly contrived attempt to be raw. If you are a space, aviation, or history junkie there is just not enough in either category to make the movie compelling.",2,1,2,22 July 2019
