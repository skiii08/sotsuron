It," Still waiting for something to happen
","I am not typically a fan of Stephen King movies, at least not the ones designed to be 'scary' over the more thoughtful ones (like The Green Mile). I had seen the older version of 'It' and thought it was at least creepy with Pennywise, and had the psychological part with the adults coming home to face their past. So, I went into this one (with all the hype that came before it) thinking it would be an updated scarier, creepier, more thought-provoking version. Boy, was I wrong. This movie was kind of boring. Not very creepy - especially after all the anticipation of the new Pennywise - he was almost laughable in some scenes. I can't say I jumped even once out of surprise, which I expected I would. I knew what was going to happen ahead of time more than a few times. The kids were fine with the material they had to work with. I kept looking at my watch, waiting for the adult portion of the movie, when they come back and face the past - but turned out that is a sequel. Maybe that one will be better now that the plot is set up? I don't have high hopes.",1,3,6,15 July 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," How about what leaves us hanging?
","Okay, so this was a fun movie for me, and everyone who reviews it has an opinion. But here's what spoiled my complete enjoyment - the way it ended with Andy and Nate, and their living arrangements. This is NYC, expensive and hard to get an apartment NYC. And yet, after she returns from 'taking a break' in Paris, where is she living? Nate stays in NYC until his move to Boston (assuming he is still in 'their' apartment), and she stays in NYC to get a job, not to work on their relationship. So where did Andy go when she left Nate? She couldn't afford her rent sharing with him (remember, her father gave her money for 'rent' when they were sharing), so how is she living? I know this may seem silly to some, but this little plot hole is distracting. And why didn't she communicate with him to see if they could work things out (and maybe move with him to Boston)? But now, he says maybe they CAN work things out. Does she need to find her own way and take the NYC job? Yes. So much for working it out. Another distraction. So while I really like this movie, don't care for the ending at all.",6,0,1,11 May 2020
A Quiet Place," Good, but with holes?
","I liked this movie. I am glad I went to see it at the theater, because the 'effect' intended needs to be experienced in that setting. I have read many reviews, and not one has mentioned any similarity to the movie 'Signs' with Mel Gibson - not that this is a movie that merits a direct comparison. Its premise is a good one, and holds up. I just wondered about a few things. Where did the power come from for the lights? How did they continue to have water that was drinkable? Lots of canned food, but they were afraid to go in the house - so how did that happen? There were obviously other people still alive. No attempts to collaborate locally? When he tried to reach others by short-wave, he couldn't find anyone? Anywhere? Maybe I am overthinking. I did think this was a well-directed film. The acting was good. It kept my interest and the pace was good. I would recommend it.",7,4,8,7 April 2018
Me Before You," Add this to my list of movies that.....
","If I said anymore in my subject, it would contain spoilers. So here it comes....Another movie that has what I call unfulfilled love. For whatever reason (in this case, a man who decides to (with medical assistance and legally) end his own life), love that doesn't make it to the finish line. (Think Brief Encounter, Remains of the Day, The Fault in Our Stars) I see where some people think it is a terrible message to romanticize assisted suicide be cause this man's life just wasn't what he thought it should be. Did they see the same movie?? It is clearly stated that he is in pain all the time, and his health is so frail that he gets pneumonia quite frequently. He had plenty to live for with the exception of his declining health, so he was suffering and would only get worse. That said, this is a sweet movie that allows the stars to shine in the way they express the precious thing called time and how to use it, even finitely. Not the best movie ever made, but a true tear-jerker. That he thought to provide for her and her dreams after his death was a nice surprise - showing that love comes in all forms and can keep making memories no matter what.",8,0,0,3 July 2020
