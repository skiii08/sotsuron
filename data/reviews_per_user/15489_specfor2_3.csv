It," Decent but getting over-hyped
","I enjoyed IT. Great acting overall, dialogue is excellent. Very much in the vein of Stand By Me. As well there are some decent scares.Things I didn't like though, were some terrible CGI. I'm a stickler for bad fx and there's a few shots that look quite bad.This movie is an example of trailers barely saving anything for the theater. Almost every major scare was shown in the trailers to some extent. Overall IT is a fun movie, but getting way too over-hyped.",7,1,8,7 September 2017
28 Weeks Later," Weak sequel
","This is the follow up to one of the best horror movies ever made. And what a letdown it is. While 28Days had slow buildup, atmosphere and a very realistic depiction of military personnel; the sequel goes the opposite direction. You are continuously exposed to action scene after action scene which quickly follows a predictable formula: slow music builds, infected attack, gore everywhere, repeat. The music isn't even close to the original greatness (GYBE!) from the beginning of 28days. They attempt to emulate it in EVERY action scene and it becomes tiring and not very effective by the end. Unfortunately the sequel does not have a very compelling story or believable characters and this ultimately makes 28weeks just a mindless action flick. If you like turning your brain off you will love it, however, if you are looking for something comparable to 28days...prepare to be disappointed.",3,2,7,29 August 2007
Get Out," Solid Thriller
","I enjoyed Get Out. It has a great director, building tension and making you feel for Chris (the main character).At first I thought there might be a bit more to the story, with it being about white and black people. But there really isn't, it's basically just white folks in the country being bastards. It might be considered a spoiler saying that, if you were like me thinking there was going to be some twist or heavy social commentary.Overall it has a great, slow build up, and if you are wondering, there is violence but it isn't like Hostel.Good movie, with (I thought) an awesome performance from Daniel Kaluuya.",7,5,17,25 February 2017
