Walk the Line," A little over-the-top but well produced
","'Walk The Line' presents the early years of Johnny Cash, known as J.R. to his friends and family, who struggles with several demons as he transitions from childhood to early adulthood and becomes one of the best-known country music stars in history. In turn, those struggles and hardships become the inspiration behind his many memorable tunes. Joaquin Phoenix, previously known for his work in 'Gladiator,' seems to step into the role of the Man In Black and capture those struggles in convincing fashion, while Reese Witherspoon does a fine job playing June Carter, a woman who is not without her own struggles; while I'm not convinced that her performance justified an Academy Award, she plays the part well. Given that both leads needed to learn to (a) sing and (b) play their respective instruments in convincing fashion, you start to believe that they are emulating the spirits of the legendary husband-and-wife team. As I suggest, sometimes the drama goes over-the-top and the action seemed to drag some halfway through the film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the story. If nothing else, the music is enough to make it worth a watch.",8,0,0,10 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Back in black
","A much better and darker film than the first prequel, we are witness to Anakin Skywalker's slow descent into the depths of the Dark Side due to his impatience and emotional instability.  We also get a glimpse of the love-hate relationship between him and Obi-Wan, who himself has much to learn as Anakin's mentor as he fails repeatedly to offer praise along with his criticism.  'Why do I get the feeling that you are going to be the death of me?' Obi-Wan ponders outloud to his apprentice, who in turn reassures him that such a possibility would never be.  Just wait another twenty years, my young Jedi...In short, I thought the work of the principal characters was excellent, especially Hayden Christensen as Anakin and Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan. Natalie Portman also did well as Amidala, who strength and resilience reminds me more in this film of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia character from the original films.  While it does drag at times, the plot was well-developed and balanced as Lucas revisited the roots of his initial success with the series.  In time, this could be viewed as one of the better films of the series in line with The Empire Strikes Back, the unofficial pinnacle of the series.I look forward to third and final prequel as do many others whose faith has been restored.",9,0,0,1 July 2002
The Incredibles," Where's my supersuit?
","Interesting how being a hero is not so super and that doesn't just pertain to those select few who decide to wiggle into a tight spandex suit and fight for truth and justice. However, in this film, being a superhero has been for naught, thanks to litigation entered by the very people whose lives they have saved. Now these crusaders must retire the masks and lead 'normal' lives as, say, an insurance agent; however, even as the days turn into weeks, then months, and finally years, the longing for the past eats at them from the inside, especially Mr. Incredible, our title character. So what sort of outlet eases those tensions? Well, for that answer, you'll just have to see the film.Pixar takes a step in a new direction; as it's first full-length feature film not to be rated G, there are several instances of suggested violent death sequences that take place off-camera, so it's still safe to take your little one even if you might have some explaining to do later. There's also been a little more injection of subtle adult humor that should fly high above those adolescent heads. The plot is a little choppy, but it's a well-presented, albeit predictable, story and, of course, the high-tech animation continues to appease the audience. In short, it's what you would expect from Pixar and should not disappoint fans of the studio's past work.",Null,0,1,10 November 2004
Slap Shot," Own-zah! Own-zah!
","My wife and I love to pop in this movie every so often and laugh together with this rag-tag group of hockey players that turn around the fortunes of a season with a physical, violent style of play.  The movie does drag at some times, but there are plenty of laughs, especially from the on-ice action that does not always revolve around the game.  Most impressive is the extraordinary number of characters on the club that are so memorable: the infamous - need I saw more? - Hanson brothers, Denis and his difficulty with the English language, Morris and his unhealthy fascination with the opposite sex, Dave 'Killer' Carlson and his pursuit of Zen, and Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) who works every corner to save the club from folding.  It's 'The Bad News Bears' on ice and it's worth sitting through at least once.Four out of five stars.",Null,0,3,9 June 2004
Jaws," My son was in the water, too...
","It's hard to imagine that, if 'Bruce' (the name given to the mechanical shark by Spielberg) had worked as he had envisioned, this movie may have become another low-grade horror flick.  Instead, it's more than halfway through the film before the creature appears in full view of the audience.Until then, only William's haunting score is there to warn you of the approaching danger as people get picked off one by one in the surf.  It also allows sufficient time to develop each of the main characters: Brody, the city-boy cop trying to deal with small-town politics, Hooper, the oceanographer who also thinks about the scientific possibilities, Vaughn, the slick mayor who turns a blind eye to the problem in favor of the business people that put him in office, and Quint, the hunter who will solve the island's problem for a handsome fee.The movie only gets better in the second half as Quint becomes a modern Ahab, who looks upon the shark as an adversary and pledges to rid the seas of this great white terror without much thought of this daunting challenge or its significant consequences.  Meanwhile, Brody and Hooper now face two problems: the menacing shark, who seems to be toying with them, and Quint, who has no problem taking them down with him should it come to that conclusion.Having grown up on the water, had I seen this film as a young boy, I may have thought twice about dangling my hand over the side of the boat or diving off the town docks.  The horror genre is usually synonymous with bad cinema but, on the rare occasion, some unforgettable classics are created and the first of this series (the only one worth watching or owning) is such an example.",Null,1,2,23 September 2003
