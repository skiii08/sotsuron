Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Dividing this movie was a crime
","I saw the volume 2 just now and I am really upset that they didn't show the whole thing together.Volume 1 by itself, doesn't make much sense, it is beautiful and thrilling (at least if you do get thrilled about combat choreography).. Yet it is, painfully lacking in character development, humor and in plot.I enjoyed seeing it (especially enjoyed the GoGo part and the anime) but it could be so much better if they showed the second part together. To both of the movies I'd give 9. When they are separated I'm giving 7 to vol.1 and 8 to vol.2.",8,1,2,22 May 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Stupid and boring action (and SO OVERRATED)
","I can't understand how this movie got rated so high. It is just yet another stupid action movie and I found really NOTHING remarkable about it. I don't think someone else could get a movie with more kitsch even if one tried, I guess that's what they mean when they say that the movie is one of a kind. It is full of silly one-liners, same idiotic comedy 'combat' and the (how could we do without) sexy heroine that's there only to give some sex moments. There was no plot I could spot, I mean, unless you count the 'nazis digging artifact. Indiana Jones must get artifact from them' as plot'. Could it get more stupid?? I could go talking for several pages what I disliked about this movie but I'd be just wasting my time I guess. Each to his own. For a good adventure movie I'd suggest people to see 'The Man who would be King' instead. *seriously p****d off*",3,30,69,26 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," 6/10 and even that is mostly due to Depp
","It is rather sad since this movie showed a LOT of potential in its beginning, yet soon enough it became yet another kitschy Disney movie.First the good: The performance of Depp was wonderful, even if a tiny bit too ecstatic. The visuals and the sounds were, as you can expect from Disney, amazing as well and reminded me of LOTR visuals somewhat. Also, surprisingly, the movie has also quite a sophisticated story.{ MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS BELOW }Very quickly, though, the movie dropped very low. The scenes became repetitive and dull. I grew tired of all these sword slashings, first with men, then with shields. In fact, there is just TOO MUCH fighting in this movie. It isn't the stunning fighting of Matrix/LOTR though where you grew more excited every minute, it is more like the regular Disney fighting of, 'Aww he dropped the barrel and it dropped on the skeleton, ain't it funny folks?'. All the fighting scenes are FULL with Disney cliches like this one.{ REAL SPOILERS NOW }In fact, ALL the movie grows to be more and more one big cliche as it spins towards its grand finale cliche end. Starting from the silly sentences (BadGuy: 'Say good-bye!', barrel falls on him, GoodGuy: 'Good-bye!'), continuing with even sillier sentences that I could guess ten seconds before the actors said them and ending with the super sticky, happy 'and they lived happily ever after' end. I hoped they will broke SOME of the sweetness by letting SOMEONE die but apparently they decided to be the STEREOTYPE of cliche Disney movies.Oh well, another 2 hours bit the dust.",5,1,2,6 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," And I thought Spider-Man 1 was bad...
","I give this movie 2/10.{{Review may contain SPOILERS, but it isn't anything you don't know about the story from the cartoons}}Prelude: I have nothing against action movies. This is along the movie is entertaining and not awfully stupid.Spiderman 2: This movie, unlike action movies I like, was boring and awfully stupid... And of course it was cheesy and FULL with the same American bad movie clichés. In fact, the only reason it is 2/10 and not less is because there are indeed some nice CGI effects.So yes, the arms of Dr.Octavious look nice, there were a few minutes of nice fighting... But really, hardly anything new compared to the first SpiderMan.I could go over the stupid, melodramatic, cheesy and illogical points of this movie, but it would take too long, that's why I'll just sum it up with these lines from the movie:Stupid_Woman_Reporter: 'But Doctor (octavius), wouldn't the AI of these mechanical arms interfere with your judgment?' Doctor_Octavius: 'Yes! That's exactly why I have this chip (*pointing on an exposed tiny lamp on his back*) as long as this chip functions the AI of the arms won't take over my brain!'",2,2,7,1 October 2004
Finding Nemo," Cute but not as funny or thrilling as Toy Story
","This is an enjoyable film but it simply doesn't make it up to 'Toy Story', 'Monsters Inc' or 'Shrek'. It isn't as funny or dramatic, while it is still fun to watch, I wouldn't like to watch it again. For me it was merely another animated flick like 'Bug Story'.",7,1,2,23 August 2003
Watchmen," The wrong kind of director for that kind of movie
","It is really amazing how a movie like Watchmen could be so pretty, so true to the book and yet, so Unenjoyable. In retrospect however, it isn't as surprising.While 'Watchmen' is a humanist story about the various aspects of human soul, Zack Snyder is an expert on gore, style, visuals ('Sin City') and raising the testosterone of viewers to illegal levels ('300″). He is not, however, someone who can give a soul to comics heroes.Zack did everything he could, but it just isn't his kind of movie. Despite the 'comixie' appearance, 'Watchmen' should be done by a director who excels in moving the audience, not one who excels in exciting them. Instead of Zack Snyder, Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer, this movie should've been directed by Todd Solondz or Darren Aronofsky.",6,0,5,9 March 2009
Shrek 2," A lot of fun but hardly original
","Shrek 2 is a great movie to watch, it is very funny and well animated.In Shrek 2 we watch yet another fairy tale that was hilariously twisted by Dreamworks. Yet again the movie references a few hundred other movies and mocks everyone on left and right.However, I couldn't help but to feel that I saw this movie already. Shrek 2 simply followed the successful formula of Shrek. So it is still funny, even very funny, but it is lacks the originality of the first movie.Overall: 8/10",7,0,0,10 July 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," A movie for KIDS
","I love a lot of modern cartoons, 'Spirited Away', 'Shrek', 'Toy Story', 'Wall-E' etc etc. I love them because they are sophisticated, have interesting, intelligent and surprising plot and love-able characters.Unfortunately, 'How to train your Dragon' has none of these. The plot is very basic and you understand exactly how it is going to turn, the general humor will appeal, no doubt, to kids, but I didn't find anything funny about it.Still, it is watchable and you probably won't suffer from watching it. Expect it to be more on par with the likes of 'Ice Age' than 'Shrek', however.",5,3,18,10 November 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Truly remarkable sight
","I will not go to lengths and mention the good parts of the movie. The movie at the whole is one amazing view that throws you from one breathtaking picture to another. I'll just mentioned what I lacked:* Saruman was seriously lacking as was the part of the Palantir in the war (Aragorn appearing before Sauron in the Palantir).* What the heck did Elrond do in the middle of Rohan and by what cosmic way has Arwen's life became connected with Sauron relative power (WTF?).* The scenes of Frodo being taken to the Goblin tower and the opposite scenes between the victory in the white city and the coming of the forces to Black Gate felt RUSHED. That's was really sad as the ending was surprisingly perfect and even a bit SLOW sometimes (how long does it take two hug 3 hobbits??).But really, that about what really annoyed my in the movie, the rest was perfect or almost perfect. Go and see.9/10.",8,0,0,19 December 2003
The Truman Show," Frightening
","The movie wouldn't have such an impact on me if I saw it in 98. However, now they made a new reality show in Israel, in Truman's style. A poor man is being fooled for a few weeks to think he is being elected to play in a new soap opera. And the most ironic thing is that they are actually MARKETING their show by showing us 'Truman's Show' and advertising their 'Steve's show' all along the movie.I would think that they actually LEARNED something from 'The Truman's Show'. I guess some people are inspired by movies in all the wrong way.",8,0,0,8 November 2003
