The Blair Witch Project," A new horror classic
","This film opened in an Austin theater 2 weeks before the national release and I had several friends tell me how amazing it was.  I was ready for disappointment when I finally got in on the sold out Monday late show. Well, it left me excited and actually deserved the previous accolades . The documentary style makes it much more personal and initimate than any horror film I've seen in a long time.  I hadn't seen a good, disturbing horror since Silence of The Lambs and was openly complaining that they 'just don't make them anymore.'  This film proves me wrong and will surely spawn more suspenseful, occult-based horror wannabes just as Scream spawns the Slasher comeback.  If you liked The Shining, Poltergeist, and Jaws than I recommend Blair Witch.  If you liked Suspiria, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Bride of Chucky, then you'll probably be disappointed in this low-budget, no effect, plot driver thriller.  But then you probably saw Deep Blue Sea over this anyway.",Null,1,1,8 August 1999
Casino," Most underrated Gangster film of all time
","People always tend to say that Casino can't be a classic because it's too similar to Goodfellas.  Obviously, there are quite a number of similarities between the two but why does that drag Casino down?  The direction alone makes this movie worth watching.  Scorsese simply makes all other gangster films inferior with his mastery.  You can leave this film on mute and still really enjoy it.  But then you'll miss the best dialogue of any gangster movie in 25 years.  It's overwhelming how quotable this movie is.  People that write this film off need to explain where the weakness in this film lies.  Even the soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is ridiculously good and should be the measuring stick for all films within this genre.  It clearly belongs on the shelf next to The Godfather series, Donnie Brasco, Scarface, Miller's Crossing, and of course, Goodfellas.",10,1,1,8 August 1999
