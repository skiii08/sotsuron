The Ring," A refreshing piece for American audiences
","The Ring started what became a wave of horror remakes from Japanese cinema, and while other tales such as The Grudge were not as critically well received, The Ring truly earned its merit among audiences. The movie starts out with Seatle reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) aiding her sister after the mysterious death of her niece-- a death that was provoked by watching a mysterious videotape and not following the rules in order to save one's life. After seeing the tape herself, Rachel is horrified to learn that those who see it have seven days until they die, unless they somehow manage to avoid death, by performing the task that the spirit haunting the tape wishes the viewer to do; if you're not familiar with the full plot by now, keep yourself unspoiled and discover it for yourself! As the film progresses Rachel seeks the help an exboyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) in order to discover the origins of the mysterious tape before it is too late. What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined. Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge? The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest. While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals. Highly recommended for all, and enjoy looking for a hidden DVD extra!",8,1,1,21 September 2009
Se7en," Sinister, dark, and thoroughly engrossing.
","This movie is not for those offended by strong language and chilling violence. But it most definitely is for fans of fine acting. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwynneth Paltrow are superb, as is the surprise appearance of the serial killer in the story -- I won't name him and spoil anything for he is not identified until the final credits even though you will recognize him immediately once you finally see him towards the end of the film. The cinematography is excellent, heightening the suspense all through the film. The musical score again fits perfectly, my only complaint being sometimes it's loud enough to muffle dialog you really want to hear clearly. Other than that, a fine -- if blood-curdling -- film.",8,1,1,22 September 2009
Rocky III," Rocky + Mr. T = Typical Rocky Sequel, good and bad. Enjoy!
","Rocky III may be the Rocky Sequel that time forgot, but it's not that far off from other Rocky sequels in terms of quality and emotion. Rocky movies usually have a moral overtone, and this one is no different. Rocky get's complacent and loses his championship as a result. He also has to deal with loss in the characteristic Rocky formula when Micky dies. In the end, as usual, he trains hard and comes back to overcome his opponent. Throw in a few appearances by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T and you have yourself an 80s movie. It's hard to know how to feel about this movie. Then again it's hard to know how to feel about Rocky in general. On the one hand, the fight scenes are totally unrealistic. But Stallone pulls you in with his emotional and pityful character. The acting is never bad. But the writing is meant to be more soap opera than serious drama. If you were to see this movie on it's own, it's pretty cheesy. But in the context of Rocky films in general, it's actually not that bad. Mr. T actually gives one of the best performances of this movie. He is very believable as the bitter and cruel Clubber Lang (try to ignore the ridiculous names of characters like these). Tony Burton doesn't get as much face time as 'Duke' in this picture, but in my humble opinion he is the best actor out of the entire cast. As for Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Talia Shire, they all give their consistent decent performances. Stallone really makes you feel for him, truly mastering the 'gentle giant' character. It is heart wrenching watching him get his face beat in, even if the fighting is totally unrealistic. Overall, this is a typical Rocky movie. Nothing compares to the raw emotion of the original Rocky, but if you like the series and you have a few hours to kill, this is an entertaining movie.",6,1,1,21 September 2009
