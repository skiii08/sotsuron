The Rock," The stupid explosion-based action of yore just cant compete with the stupid CGI retina-orgy action of now.
","Part of the Criterion Collection apparently, must be because it's in the category of 'so bad it's good' because it is exceptionally bad/goodNot all movies need to be brainy and existential, but do they really need to be so stupid they are baffling? I guess I have hard time shutting off, a hard time trying not to take it seriously. Was it made to be serious? If so then MB must think we're all f-ing retarded. Die Hard was good, this is like, campy, with all the brain eating chemicals, and Nick Cage as perhaps his very very worst, very setty sets, lots of dry-ice smoke. If you want stupid action and explosions and eye candy, why not go full bore and watch transformers? Going back is just a study in the sh#!tier.",3,2,7,17 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Weirdly rushed for a movie with no point
",It's a whirlwind of explanatory dialog intermixed with action building up a flimsy plot structure leading us to...?Hard to describe the emptiness of this movie.,2,34,53,18 April 2020
The Exorcist," Awesome acting through awesome directing really shows, though a bit longer than it needs to be. Would have been ridiculous to see in the 70s.
","I finally watched the Exorcist to see what the hype was about, and I think I see. A few things that impressed me-Psychologically driven horror versus terror/slasher. I was expecting pure demonic fantasy but it's a more grounded and 'real' than that.-Visibly awesome directing. The acting is great from children and adults alike in extreme reactions and portrayal of fear and disgust.-Kooky creative horror and SFX, still passable and surprising by today's standards. -Some great cinema. I liked the shots, especially many of the medical device shots which purely of their photography produce fear. It felt almost like an art filmI was less keen on the screenplay which was choppy, a bit vague or non- sequitur at times, and definitely overly long.",7,1,2,17 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Expendables of indie movies. I feel like Wes Anderson just jerked off on my eyeballs.
","Whatever this movie is, it's Wes Anderson. You'll be reminded of that every time there is a 180 degree pan or dolly instead of a normal cut, every time there is straight-facedness in the sight of ridiculousness, every time there is a theater-esque set, every time another massively A- list celebrity appears in a minor role so as to be included in the exponentially burgeoning WA troupe...The story is choppy and riddled with voice-over and voice-over within voice-over, but def hella whimsical. I'm not a hater, check out my other ratings of great films like Rushmore, RT, even LAWSZ...this one was just too much, like the Darjeeling Limited on steroids.",7,2,5,17 July 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," I Don't Understand
","I don't understand how this movie can be liked. It is a hodgepodge of relatively mediocre special effects, standard film cliché, sub-par acting, with an awkward and predictable plot. The only unpredictable part of the film is it's piecemeal nature: almost every character begins as one standard Hollywood persona and without motive changes to another equally cliché person at least once during the film. One can never know what is going to happen next since the sequence of events is only a random permutation of rote super-hero movie themes and events. The only certainty is that the next event in the chain will be as unimaginative and overused as the last. The sound quality is terrible (it is impossible to understand the villain or Batman at several points) and the continuity of the film is awkward as the first hour or so covers plot over some weeks and the last hour covers the events over some months without indication. The finale of the film is most disappointing of as the film descends in the realm of utter cliché, even corniness. The slightly surprising twist which is thrown in is once again completely non-sequitur and seemed to be thrown in as a cheap afterthought to give an illusion of depth to the movie. Of course what is one to expect when the villains are nothing but inexplicable anarchists with unclear motives other than a random desire to blow up the world. They are completely unrealistic as characters, as are the heroes. Strong points of the film include Bane's voice (which though undecipherable is powerfully creepy), and a tastefully low use of special effects. This film is not a special effects orgy; the viewer is unfortunately confined to derive enjoyment from the plot.",2,11,22,30 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The worst Star Wars. This is Episode IV except in 3D. Literally.
","Growing up with Star Wars adds some weirdness to critiquing it. For instance, I was of the generation too young to find Ewoks or Jar Jar Binks annoying, though I'm pretty sure I knew Jake Lloyd (had to look that up...) was a terrible actor, even for a 9-year-old. I loved all the movies I through VI. Now I'm an adult for the next phase of Star Wars, and I think this is by far the worst. This new episode is just an oh-so-self-aware remake of Episode IV. And when I say 'remake of Epidode IV' I mean it has the exactly that. There's a young whipersnapper who discovers a latent ability with the force. She lives on a desert planet. There is a droid with some secret plans that falls into her hands. She is helped by mercenary but basically good smuggler. There's a bad guy with a father-son relationship to a good guy. There's another evil empire with 'a device capable of destroying an entire planet' (guess what happens in the end). This, bespeckled with periodic awkward points where some classic character happens to force their way back into the narrative. Oh hey CPO, R2, Leah, Han, etc. I get the whole self-aware self-referentialiality of it all, I guess, but to me it ended up basically boring. But since when was Star Wars about plot? Good point, it's always been about spectacular space world visualizations, kooky creatures, ships, battles. And here too this latest Star wars falls short. Once again its an updated Episode IV, but instead of stop motion, the x-wings are in CGI. Few to no new ships, worlds, creatures, battles.I think many folks discounted Episodes I, II, and III for terrible acting and a poor plot. But I would counter that they did what Star Wars does best, best. The visuals were stunning. The sheer imaginative power was inspiring. Incredible battles in land air sea and space. Nothing creatively innovative like that is in The Force Awakens except now R2-D2 is round and 'Darth Vader''s lightsaber has little side blades. Yawn.",4,132,228,16 January 2016
Apollo 13," The only movie where engineers and science are the heroes. Detailed and realistic beyond most. Gravity, you suck!
","A great movie of history which sheds a lot of light on the extremely awesome technical accomplishment it was to send people to the moon (and with computers that could 'fit into a single room' that are less powerful than and old Nokia brickphone). There's a bit of drama added, but overall the movie does extremely well at also going deep into the technical struggle with a well executed fortitude far beyond what most Hollywood would dare (i.e. Gravity).This movie teaches, entertains, and inspires the audience toward scientific endeavor like no other. Special effects are amazing, especially for its time, but they are not the sole source of meaning (as with mofoing#! Gravity). Apollo 13 respects its audience, and though filmicly it's rather standard storytelling, it's great to see a film made that tells such a story.",9,1,2,17 July 2014
The Thin Red Line," very annoying
","A compilation of hayseed poetry/philosophy voiceover ('where is the glory? Where is it?' What is it?' ), distracting 30 second appearances by A list celebs, whooshing noises, and shots of trees from below.Possibly the most pretentious movie I've ever seen. A gross jerk off fine arts rendition of a subject that deserves much better.",3,1,5,9 August 2018
Contact," Clearly Carl Sagan was behind this one...
","I like science, but you can't make a dramatic film about science. I suppose some people part of making the movie also understood this so there's some plot like stuff thrown in (romantic interest, a bit of political intrigue) but damn if it's all just a poor disguise for a movie about science which just doesn't make a good movie. I can almost hear Carl Sagan droning in my ear 'if you don't care about science then what *do* you care about?' I care about doing things right Carl, and pontificating that science is the end all does not justify making movies with a shaky plot support and lots of philosophic discussion not to mention a sh#! ton of astrophysics jargon.I don't hate this movie; heck I'd say watch it, but only once.",6,0,5,17 July 2014
