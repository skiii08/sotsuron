Black Swan," Amazing movie. Can't stop thinking about it, even after a few days.
","As I was walking out of the theater, I just kept thinking of Hillary Swank's performance in Million Dollar Baby. Can Portman be denied the Oscar for Best Actress? Cassel certainly deserves a shot at Best Supporting Actor as well, and Aronofsky for Best Director. Hard to think of anything that wasn't first rate anywhere in the performances, writing, directing, or scene design. I was struck by how seasoned Mila Kunis has become since enjoying her breakthrough role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She is likely to have some pretty solid scripts coming her way after this knockout performance in Swan, and I expect she will soon find herself among the highest paid women actresses. Kudos to Barbara Hershey for turning in a strong character performance as a woman fifteen years younger than her present age; always helps to have an attractive and skilled expert play the key role as the manipulative Mother, and I loved seeing her in this role.",10,1,2,16 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," What not to expect
","Let's face it, any movie based on an amusement park ride that people only go on to get out of the blistering heat is not going to be as deep as Citizen Kane. Do not bother with the holes in the plotline, as there are more of those than a trainload of Swiss cheese, but rather focus on the fact that the digital engineers at Disney were able to study the Errol Flynn movies and recreate them using the latest in imaging techniques. The result is a mindbending display of scenery and swordfights all acted out with a cast of quality performers, who seem to be plucked right from the pages of what we perceive to be accurate history. It plays right to the imagination, and I loved it. Johnny Depp steals the show as the swishbuckling androgenous pirate, and the supporting cast was selected with an eye on keeping the right mix of wisdom, youth, characterization, and sex appeal. Especially loved the scene of the drunken revelers on the island of Tortuga, as it was a living snapshot of the theme park ride.",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
The Town," Best movie of 2010? I think rather far from it.
","I was expecting a lot more from this film than it delivered. What I liked were the supporting cast performances, chiefly Jeremy Renner's performance as the 'like a brother', who will not be going back to Walpole any time soon. Next in line were the stellar performances of Blake Lively, Chris Cooper, Pete Postlethwaite, and a surprisingly good showing from Albert Magloan, as the curiously happy driver. Jon Hamm played a very stiff and believable FBI agent. What I could have done without, was the writer and star of the movie, Ben Affleck. I found his character malformed, uninteresting and his portrayal uninspired and lackluster. He dragged through this movie like an anchor in soft sand during choppy surf. About the time I started praying that he was going to be blown into a million bits of shredded and unneeded flesh, I checked my watch and saw that I still had another forty five minutes to go. Oh No! Affleck was so bad that it ruined the performance of Rebecca Hall, who might very well be a good actress, but we certainly weren't given the opportunity to find out in this film. Further, Affleck's ego is so overblown that he couldn't just let his character die in a blaze of gunfire the way he should have. Oh no, he had to escape to a southern bayou with a half a sack full of cash, so I'm sure there will be a 'The Town II' coming to a theatre near you soon. Now consider this plot line disaster for a moment. Every cop in the city is looking for this guy because he just shot up a bunch of policemen, so the Boston PD sends men to Logan and Bradley airports (Bradley is over an hour and a half away) to wait for him, but they forget to send even one patrolman to South Street Station, the only place where one can board the Amtrak out of 'The Town'? It's hard to believe that Affleck would even try to pull that obvious plot flaw over on anyone, because South Street Station is exactly where any reasonably sane law enforcement professional would begin looking for a fleeing suspect. No one can escape by air anymore, this isn't the 70's, and you can't waltz onto an airplane carrying half a sack full of cash and an AR-15. Even the Boston PD would probably agree that you can't get most firearms past the TSA, thus to leave 'The Town', extended rail or car would have been the only options for a fleeing suspect. I was ready to shoot myself by this point. If there is one thing that they 'got right' in this movie, it was when a cop on 'construction detail' plainly saw the robbers dressed as nuns and just looked the other way. However, that brings up another great plot flawÂ… did that cop not have his police radio on? Was he not listening to all the chatter on the radio that there was an armored car heist, huge gunfight, and police chase going on right on the other side of the river and that the fleeing criminals were crossing the Charlestown bridge and coming right down his throat? Simply unbelievable, due to all the plot flaws.",4,4,7,27 December 2010
Ghost Rider," Could someone please tell me what the point of this movie is?
","Bad CG, bad acting, a plot line that just doesn't seem to exist, characters that are uninspiring out of the box. Why? WHY? I just wasted two hours of my life and I want it back. Spoiler- 'Look into my eyes, LOOK INTO MY EYES !!' Well I did look into your butane lighter CG eyes and they are stupid. Can someone please let the Devil out of the Cage? Every time Nicolas Cage gave that soulful, ponderous, wrinkled brow look, I just wanted to hurl. BTW - Who was the Ghost at the end (Fonda) supposed to be? By the time I saw him I was ready to immolate myself with gasoline. And after being taken over by the Devil, Cage finishes with a kiss at sunset and Sam Elliot posts a final voice overlay in his typical 'I'm the Marlboro Man' style. Ohh, gulp. I just vomited in my mouth again.",1,2,4,6 March 2011
Mulholland Drive," It's not that hard to understand people.
","---Spoilers Abound---- This is a movie about what writers and directors go through when they are practicing their craft. They create characters with backgrounds, they have props, they have scenes, they experiment with plot lines, and they use them in different combinations to see what works. Sometimes things don't work so well, so they have to tinker with the formula. Sometimes external forces, studio directors and such, pressure them to modify things. When did things in this movie change, after the girls went to Silencio? Listen to what the characters in Silencio are telling you, it's all just tape, nothing is live. And some events can escape control. And sometimes things have to be 'undone'. It's not that hard to figure out once you know the key. My only gripe with this movie is that there's no chapter index on the DVD. Oh well, I'll guess I'll just have to watch it all again from the start.",Null,0,1,30 July 2002
The Departed," Not a bad performance in the bunch.
","Can we give Scorsese the Oscar NOW PLEASE? The best scene has to be the one where Nicholson grills DiCaprio in the bar after starting off with 'I smell a rat'. It's the greatest butt puckering movie moment since Pesci's 'funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?' Oh yeah, that was Scorcese's, too. After disliking Matt Damon's performances in every movie since 'Good Will Hunting', I have to say that he did a great job here, particularly on the long pauses before dialogue. It was those shots where you can watch people calculating things in their minds that makes this movie truly powerful. Mark Wahlberg stole the show every time the camera was one him. Even the old war horses Sheen and Baldwin were believable as too tough cops. Kristen Dalton was perfect as the gangster gal, how come we haven't seen more of this beauty in other 'A' films? I have to get the DVD.",10,2,4,14 February 2007
