Blade Runner 2049," Great Movie .... loved it
","This is real sci-fi movie ! .... You need to watch it .... it is a good story with the great cast. In the age of big special effects, they did a really good movie. Story end to end is a great interest, i give it, the ending needs to be little more dramatic but, where the bad guy and the good buy is less clear. it great!!!!!!!!I loved it!",9,2,7,16 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," very disappointed
","I have to say this trilogy do not do justice for the Start Wars franchise. When they said not everyone will be happy with the ending, I understand but who is going to be happy with this ending is my question. Ok, if you are the fan boy who do not care you will probably be happy. But man this was a letdown. They need a Avengers level story ark than random story line. I am not saying Avengers is the best but it had a good story ark and that did reflect well. Star Wars should have had the main villain pulling the strings from the beginning and have a more proper story ark. There are so many things then just killing off the skywalker family to start a new trilogy.... I guess it is all about how much money you get and setup for the nest trilogy or whatever is next. It was never about the story ...Very poor story ark, random acts and depending on emotion than telling a good star wars story. I am sad.",3,5,7,3 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Bad story, lost opportunity, Poor Movie for a great franchise
","Let's review the Star Wars Last Jedi. First of all let's understand who are the professional movie critics. These are individuals who are considered as professional moviegoers and their critic matter to the movie. But that doesn't mean they are always right. For the given reasons below I don't think Star Wars Last Jedi is a great or good movie. I am going to tell you why Disney went on this route towards the end of this review. Let's begin! Luke Skywalker is marked as a washed of Jedi who has lost his way in the movie. He is merely there to be killed off and make way for other characters there is no significance with Luke Skywalker. Great Skywalker was sidelined and demoralized throughout the whole movie. only to be back towards the end of the movie to bie. There was no significant training from Luke Skywalker to Rey on Jedi training it was merely a Passover. Look how hard it was for Luke Skywalker to lift the X-Wing Fighter from the swamp but in this movie for Rey to lift huge rocks was a no brainier. That was no great Luke Skywalker moment for us to Remember by to show how powerful is Luke Skywalker. There is no emotional attachment to Rey to her parents and the discovery of who they are. After all that was the main quest on her side on the first movie. She gave it up. That would have been a much greater story. There was no great lightsaber battle in the end of the movie that we can speak off. That is a signature of the franchise.They have a lot of plot lines left unanswered and blank. Knights of the first order, exploring General Snoke's abilities and Rey's parents. Now anybody can be a Jedi, coming from nowhere you will be the greatest Jedi ever!.. I think this is a cultural effect where you can come from nowhere and you can be anyone in America. This is not necessarily A Bad Thing it doesn't fit with the overall arch of the Jedi Order. But in the context of Star wars it is better to have little mystery around it, on where and how the Jedi's become. Being feminist is good it is not a bad thing but when you're pushing for it you can almost see it through the movie. Female characters over the male characters again this is not a bad thing it is just when you are trying too hard to do it the movie fails. Why Disney sent on this route ? Movie is all about out with the old and let's make a New trilogy. I am not talking about this trilogy, I'm talking about Disney's next trilogy after this. I will not be surprised if they kill off Rey on the third movie and bring the kid from the end of the second movie to the next trilogy that is all about continuity and make more money and make more movies in the franchise. I am sad to say, this is going to be just like transformers. Good special effect tho! Transformers any one ?",1,1,2,20 December 2017
