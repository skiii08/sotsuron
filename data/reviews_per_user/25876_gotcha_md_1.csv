Requiem for a Dream," Piece of Art.....
","a movie about drug addiction.... After 8 years from releasing the movie I have just seen it and found out that I missed out a lot....it is one of the greatest movies ever made.... it makes you think and imagine how bad it will be if it was about real people... and then you will realize that it is not Sci-Fi stuff no... it could be so real... this movie is really touching... there has been so many new movies which tried to narrate stories about drug addiction issues... but there is still no room for comparison with this one here.... director, writer and actors were truly amazing.... I would recommend this movie to everyone on earth.... not because they will 'like' it.... because it has that 'other' dimension... I m not in a place to criticize the movie but I can say it is a piece of art.... must see.",10,0,1,7 January 2008
