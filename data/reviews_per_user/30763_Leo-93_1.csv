The Blair Witch Project," fear of throwing up
","The only thing that scared me during the movie, was the fear of throwing up right there, due to the never stopping camera shaking. Apart from that I have to say that the actors did a great job and made the audience believe in their fear.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
