The Avengers," Not as good as I expected
","Date: 27 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Like everyone else, I was interested in seeing 'The Avengers' so I finally went to go see it after it came out over a month ago and has grossed over six hundred million. After the movie was over, I realized it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The storyline was like ever other action movie. Bad guy wants something. Some complications between the group. Lots of cars flying around. Good guys win. Why does this movie do better? Don't ask me. I'm not saying the movie was terrible, it was enjoyable for the most part (Downey had some awesome one liners!) but it wasn't spectacular. If you want see this movie, definitely go see it at the theaters. If you want till DVD, I'll think you'll be disappointed even more since you weren't in the theater to get the whole experience. Overall, seven out of ten stars.7/10",7,5,11,27 June 2012
Men in Black 3," A Series That Has Run It's Course
","Date: August.12, 2012 -First Watch- Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return in the third installment of 'Men in Black' as Agents J and K. When Boris the Animal escapes from prison, Agent K decides to go in this mission alone but Agent J being Agent J decides to help and travels back in time to kill the Boris the Animal. As with most sequels it was alright but nothing compared to the original. The problem with sequels and prequels is that you already know a lot of the jokes or what the characters do. You know Agent J is the funny guy and that K is the serious one who J pokes fun at. At far as sequels go this movie was good, better then most and the back in time thing was neat. But, I think this serious has run it's course and should be put away.",7,2,4,12 August 2012
Walk the Line," Fantastic
","Date: 9 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Whoa. That's about what sums up Johnny Cash's life. The things the man had to go through our mind blowing. After losing his brother Jack in a death that haunts him forever, Johnny joins the military and is stationed in Germany. For the next couple of years, Johnny climes the ladder of fame and hits every road block imaginable, from drugs to martial issues to struggling with his feelings for a woman he may not ever be able to have. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant!! He has an amazing voice and was definitely on the top of his game when he did this movie. Which is why it bothers me that the Academy did not give him the Oscar! He deserved it! He also sounded exactly like Johnny Cash! Not to say Reese Witherspoon wasn't good, but if I had to pick between the two I would definitely give the Oscar to Phoenix. Overall this movie is amazing and definitely worth checking out.",9,0,0,9 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Better then the first
","Date: 26 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- When I saw the first 'Sherlock Holmes' I didn't like it. I found that the accents were so apparent that it was hard to understand what was coming out of anyone's mouth. Yet, at the urgency of my sister, I watched the second one. Much better. The accents were so apparent and you could understand the characters better. I seemed to like the characters more in this one too. While I was shocked Rachel McAdams' character was killed off right away in the beginning, I was happy with bringing Noomi Rapace in. I think she was very good and I look forward to seeing her in other films. I found Watson more enjoyable to, though I can't understand for the life of me why he wouldn't be more upset by the two faked deaths of Sherlock Holmes. I mean, Watson thought he was dead those two times and he didn't seem that upset. If that was my friend, I would be devastated. Which reminds me, I was kind of let down that Watson's dog wasn't in it more. I think he is so adorable! Then again I'm a dog person so I think about every dog is adorable. I also liked the villain more. He seemed like he was out to destroy the world. I also liked how the movie went to different cities instead of just staying in boring old London. Because, let's admit it, staying in just one city can sometimes be boring. Overall, this movie scored eight out of ten stars for me simply because while I really did enjoy it, it's not one of my favorites and it was just your average action movie. Not a lot of emotions, just guns blazing and the good guy coming up on top.8/10",8,1,1,26 June 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E. T. the friendly alien
","Date: 18 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- E. T. is one of those movies that you regret not watching earlier. It took me fifteen years to finally watch this movie and I have to admit, I am short of mad at myself for not doing it earlier. Everyone knows the story. Little E. T. is left on planet Earth and soon meets Elliott, a boy who desperately needs a friend. Along with his older brother and younger sister (Drew Barrymore was so adorable as a child!) they embark on a quest to get E. T. home. If there's one thing I want to make clear in my review it's that E. T. is one of the sweetest and cutest aliens ever!! My favorite scene was by far when he went downstairs, while everyone was gone, and drank tons of beer that also affected poor Elliott. Then, the selfish humans came. Can't people just leave little E. T. alone? He didn't do anything wrong. I was almost near tears after it appeared E. T. was dead but what kind of story would that be if our innocent little alien friend died? Not a good one. E. T. rose again and made it back home. A sweet, sweet ending. So, in conclusion, I would suggest this movie to people. However, the reason why I only gave this movie a eight out of ten was because it was slightly predictable.8/10",8,0,0,19 June 2012
12 Angry Men," One of the greatest movies ever? Not really
","Date: 18 May -First Time Watch- I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.5/10",5,3,12,26 May 2012
L.A. Confidential," A real good movie
","Date: 27 May, 2012 -First Time Watch- Being a huge fan of book adaptations, there was no doubt in my mind I wanted to see how 'L. A. Confidential' was done. Much to my surprise, unlike most book-to-movie adaptations, 'L. A. Confidential' was fantastic. The characters came to life and were all enjoyable to watch. It's so shocking how much corruption was going on during this period of time. Personally, I loved Ed, played by Guy Pearce. He was great and it's a real shame that Guy Pearce didn't continue to pick movies like this. I think he could have been really big. This movie was fantastic and totally worth your time.10/10",10,5,8,28 May 2012
Alien," Alien vs. Aliens, sequel won
","Date: 25 May -First Time Watch- After months of deliberating if I should watch Alien, last night I finally did. I prepared myself to be scared like crazy. I wasn't. After watching the movie, I came to the conclusion that the sequel, done by James Cameron, was much more suspenseful and scary then the first. That's not the only reason why I picked the sequel over the original. The original was short and there was less then an hour of the alien being around and attacking people. The rest was the crew discussing what the face sucker was. In the sequel, the alien was in more then half the movie. Suspense in the first was there but it was even worse in the sequel. Now, would my opinion be different if I had watched the original first? I think so. The problem I had was knowing what the alien does and how it attacks it's victims. Overall, though, the film was very good and still enjoyable to watch.8/10",8,1,4,26 May 2012
Underworld Awakening," Not that good as first one
","Date: 11 May -First Time Watch- After seeing the first Underworld movie a few months ago, I was somewhat looking forward to seeing the latest movie added to the series. I was somewhat disappointed. While the film definitely did not disappoint as far as violence goes it did lack a storyline. It was way to short and the newest cast member I didn't really like mostly because I didn't like how the writers intertwined the character into the story. However, I will say that I did like the addition of Michael Ealy's character, Detective Sebastian. Overall, it was just an average film. Personally, I think you only have to see the prequel and the first movie and possibly the second and stop there. 6/10",6,1,5,16 May 2012
21 Jump Street," Funnier Then I Thought
","Date: August.12, 2012 -First Time Watch- After hearing all the good right ups on this movie I decided I had to check it out for myself. The story follows two police officers, Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum) who want to get their first bust and stop patrolling parks. Since their chief finds them incompetent of doing anything right he sends them to Jump Street, where they will go undercover as high school students and find out who is supplying kids with drugs. Of course a series of events occur that provides plenty of laughs, more then I expected. Channing Tatum is fantastic and he should do more comedy. I really enjoyed this movie, but I could have gone with a little less swearing. Definitely not a good movie for kids under fifteen to watch. Overall an enjoyable movie and I can't wait for the sequel! 8/10",8,0,1,12 August 2012
The Village," It's just okay
","Date: 12 May -First Time Watched- With 'Signs' being one of my favorite movies of all time, I had some high expectations for The Village, mostly because it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Joaquin Phoenix, one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, the movie did not deliver and I firmly believe it was this movie that showed that unless Mr. Shyamalan has a good solid script, it's not going to be as good as 'Signs'. The characters weren't really believable and after awhile I got bothered with Ivy, the main character, and her peppy attitude towards everything. Personally, I would have lost my mind around her. In short, this movie was just okay and not fantastic.6/10",6,0,1,26 May 2012
Bridesmaids," Perfect Girl Movie
","Date: 10 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Yes, this is definitely the perfect girl movie that provides laughs, sarcasm, and a touching story. The story focuses around Annie, a woman living in Milwaukee who discovers that her best friend, Lillian, is getting married. While Annie is happy for Lillian, she can't help but be sad too especially when she is introduced by Lillian's new friend, wedding planner expert Helen. Thus beginning a power struggle between Annie and Helen as they both try to impress Lillian and give her the wedding of her dreams. While I thought Kirsten Wiig did an amazing job playing Annie, I couldn't help but love Melissa McCarthy's portrayal as Megan, who makes a joke or gesture that makes you laugh every time she's on screen. But, was it Oscar worthy? No but it was still fantastic. Overall this movie is good but not fantastic.8/10",8,1,2,11 June 2012
Saving Private Ryan," What War Really Was
","Date: 9 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- This was my first time watching 'Saving Private Ryan' and it may be my last, for a good reason. The story is extremely sad but what makes it very sad is because it's true. Most of the things that occurred in the movie actually happened in World War Two. As a person interested in World War Two, I found this movie did an extremely good job depicting life after D-Day. The ending is extremely sad and it actually took my by surprise. I didn't expect that to happen. I expected some of it, but not all of it. In my opinion, this is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, along with 'Schindler's List'. Very moving and touching.8/10",8,1,4,10 June 2012
The Artist," Unique idea that prevails
","Date: 26 May 2012 -First Time Watch- If you watched the Oscars or read about it afterwords, you would have realized 'The Artist' was one of the biggest winners. So, when I learned that a theater nearby was going to show it, there was no doubt in my mind I wanted to see. Easy to say it was a fantastic film. The characters were fantastic (especially the dog Uggie!) and there was plenty of humor to keep you interested. The film does a fantastic job illustrating life for actors who had gained fame during the silent era but couldn't switch over to talkies and were therefore forgotten of. It's a great film and definitely worth seeing.9/10",9,0,1,27 May 2012
Downfall," One of the greatest movies ever!
","Okay, everyone knows what happened to Hitler at the end of the Second World War. In his bunker he committed suicide. For most people that's the end of the story. Yet, German director Oliver Hirschbiegel decided to go deep into the last ten days of Hitler's life, exploring his crazy military strategies and the people surrounding him, some supporting him others waiting for him to finally take his life so they can escape. This movie was fantastic. I have no complainants what so ever about this movie. Everything was perfectly done, the acting was out standing and the historical accuracy was out of this world amazing. Bruno Ganz was memorizing and played the best Hitler I've ever seen. He captured the character perfectly and did not overdo it. Great movie, you have to see it.",10,2,4,13 May 2012
Signs," Why can't they make more movies like this?
","Date: 13 April -Re-watched- After re-watching 'Signs' I still firmly believe it's one of the greatest movies ever. Ever since my parents first showed me this movie last October, I've been in love with. The entire cast is spectacular and the storyline was amazing. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances, after 'Braveheart' of course, as Graham Hess, a washed up reverend who tries to stay calm during unusual events. Joaquin Phoenix plays the hilarious yet trying to be serious brother Merrill. It's really hard to believe Phoenix did this movie almost right after 'Gladiator' since the characters are the exact opposite. Then there are the kids, Morgan and Bo, who give us extra humor and seriousness. The movie is amazing and I really wish I was part of that family. Awesome movie. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.10/10",10,3,8,26 May 2012
Braveheart," Very, very good but not greatest movie ever
","Braveheart is definitely one of the best films that's come out in the past twenty years. The acting is fantastic and so is the story. Mel Gibson does his best acting in this movie, playing William Wallace, who leads the Scots against the British. Mel Gibson isn't the only person who gives off a fantastic acting job. Sophie Marceau plays Princess Isabella,the poor girl stuck in a loveless marriage and dreaming of Wallace, the man she's always wanted. Throughout the entire movie I was cheering for her, hoping she would somehow get a happy ending. Another fantastic acting job was Patrick McGoohan, who plays King Edward of England. He's ruthless, heartless, and power hungry. In my opinion, Mr. McGoohan should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his part. However, as much as I loved all their performances, my favorite performance was done by David O'Hara, who plays one of my favorite characters, Stephen, the Irishman. Yet, as much as I loved this movie, it was not my favorite. It was rather long and seemed to drag out just a tad bit. Some parts could have been cut a little shorter. Yet, overall it was a very well done film.",9,2,5,13 May 2012
Gladiator," My Favorite Movie!
","Gladiator is by far one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything about this movie is perfect. No complaints whatsoever. What was there to complain about? The entire cast was perfect. Russell Crowe was awesome!! He plays a fantastic Roman who wants revenge for the meaningless death of his wife and son. Yet, as much as I loved Russell Crowe in this movie, I find that Joaquin Phoenix's performance was just a little bit better. Phoenix has such amazing talent and I was really upset when he didn't end up winning the Academy Award for this performance. Also, Connie Nielsen was also very good and made a perfect Roman princess. Great movie and so worth the time. It is my favorite movie and one I will continue to watch over and over again.",10,1,4,14 May 2012
From Here to Eternity," Perfect
","Date: 26 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- I had been waiting to see 'From Here to Eternity' for several weeks. Being a big old Hollywood movie fan, this was near the top of my list. It has a perfect cast; Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra. So, I had high hopes. Might I say, I was not at all disappointed! It was everything I expected and then some. I'm so going to buy this movie. It's one of my all time new favorites. How this movie played out, though, surprised me. As expected I loved Sinatra's character. He was awesome! A fun loving character you wouldn't mind being around. Of course, most of the times, your favorite characters are killed off, which of course happened to Sinatra's character. That made me kind of upset, to be honest. I was also shocked that Montgomery Clift's character was killed off at the end. That was really sad since he was mistaken as a Japanese from far away and was therefore shot several times. Then, I also thought Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr would end up together. Wrong again. Yet, it doesn't matter. Movies that have surprise twists and turns make it all the more enjoyable. Absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.10/10!",10,0,1,26 June 2012
