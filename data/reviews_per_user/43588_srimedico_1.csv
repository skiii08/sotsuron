Deja Vu," Amazing movie .... Enjoy to your heart's content :)
","Woah !, just done watching Deja Vu for the first time on TV .... wow , what a movie ... i was simply astounded ...i know that deja vu happens in temporal lobe epilepsy as a doc .... but never expected the movie to take metaphysics as the base of its story ..... i mean , when i heard about the title of this film few years back , always thought that it would be some kind of mystery/thriller film basing on medical facts like Jessica alba starer AWAKE movie for instance....being an ardent fan of Einstein and Stephen hawking , simply loved to hear about Einstein-Rosen bridge once again in the film .... I loved the film as much as it is far from reality ( at least for now ) ..... and to revert the death of that girl and all other people from that disaster is euphoric , even more than that is - denzel Washington again coming to enquire the girl at the closing scene is simply exhilarating ...Denzel Washington, what an actor he is ! my oh my , till now just heard of him, but to see him get into the skin of the character is an absolute feast :bow: 9 on 10 for me .... i recommend it to all those who like science fiction (sci-fi) genre of films , if u haven't seen yet ...",9,3,5,13 February 2011
