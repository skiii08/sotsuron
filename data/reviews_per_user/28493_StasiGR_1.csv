Hereditary," Best horror movie of the millenium so far
","Undoubtedly, future critics will place this film in the same league as 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Shining' or even 'The Exorcist'. Having said this, I must add that, this movie, is not for the usual mainstream viewers, who are used to watching all type of horror cliches. It's not surprising that a lot of people have rated this with 1/10, since it is so much different to what we are used to, in the last 20 years or so. A slow burner, it is almost a drama, until it unfolds into an arthouse sentimental nightmare which will leave you shaken. I had to sit on the bench for 20 minutes after I left the cinema, trying to get a hold of myself. Congrats to the director, who debuted with this film (we are surely going to see a lot of him in the near future), the composer, the cast, especially to Mrs Collette, who gave the performance of a lifetime.",10,6,11,24 June 2018
