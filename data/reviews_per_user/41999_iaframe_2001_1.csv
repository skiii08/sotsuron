Walk the Line," Excellent Movie
","I 'was' never a Johnny Cash fan, but I am a huge Reese Witherspoon fan. So I purchased this movie to add to my 'Reese' movie collection. I think this is a really good movie. We have watched it about 6 times already. I think that Reese and Joaquin did an excellent job in singing the songs on the movie. I find them getting stuck in my head. I have some CDs with Johnny Cash songs and also duets with June. I find myself listening to them. I also am looking up information on Johnny and June on the internet. My whole family enjoyed this movie. Like I said I was never a Johnny Cash fan, but I think I am now. I purchased the movie with a music CD that had five songs from the movie on it. I am going to now go purchase the soundtrack from the movie.",10,2,4,5 March 2006
