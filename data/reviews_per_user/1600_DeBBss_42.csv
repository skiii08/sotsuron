Ford v Ferrari," Finally! A Great Car Movie
","It has been a long since we got a car movie, let alone a good car movie. Watching Ford V Ferrari is a blast for car enthusiasts. You can tell the screenwriters knew everything about a car's anatomy, which I appreciate, as it really immerses you into the story. Everything in Ford V Ferrari is flawless, the acting, the cinematography, the tension, and the screenplay. It's entertaining and emotional, it has the best of both worlds.The script was written extremely well; it pulls you into the story and you become emotionally attached to the characters. You feel uncertain every time Ken Miles races because racing is so unpredictable, and you don't want anything to happen to Ken because Ken was developed so greatly as a character. Although Ford V Ferrari is a very long movie, it's never boring because the pacing is great and you know exactly where the story is taking you. The story is constantly building up, so the final race is insanely intense. Another thing I like about the script is how the antagonist isn't Ferrari, but Leo Beebe, a Ford corporate. This makes the movie have a constant rivalry between the protagonist and antagonist; it also makes Ford V Ferrari more original.The acting was solid all around. Christian Bale's performance was amazing; he makes Ken Miles so relatable, and when Ken Miles eventually dies, it's heart wrenching because you know it's coming. The delivery of the lines by Christian Bale just sells the character, and he delivers the line like a real person would in such a competitive atmosphere. All the characters were written with actual thought put into them. That's why the rivalry between Beebe and Miles is so authentic; they think differently although they're on the same side. I like how a lot of the runtime is spent with Miles' family, making you more emotionally attached to Ken and his family.The sound editing was top notch. You hear the engine, the gears switch, the tires screech, and the brakes clenching. It's mixed together so well and it makes the experience way more realistic. It's so satisfying hearing everything work together so perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful, and it highlights the beauty of the cars and the landscapes that surround the vehicles. What's so crucial to making a film feel like it's in a specific time period is the color palette and atmosphere. Ford V Ferrari captures the atmosphere of the 60's perfectly, and it gives you the nostalgia of it's time period, even if you weren't around during the 60's.Overall, Ford V Ferrari was fantastic, and it will go down as one of the best racing movies of all time for me. I loved every bit of it, it's a true homage to the sport and people who risk their lives to be the best. Ford V Ferrari is a must watch for car enthusiasts, and even though some people don't care about cars, Ford V Ferrari can still entertain you by the tension and great storytelling.",9,0,0,12 May 2020
Blade Runner 2049," A Great Sequel...
","Blade Runner 2049 is one of those movies whether you love it, or you hate it, and I loved it. Blade Runner 2049 is unique, and the only movie similar is the first one.Story: 9/10Blade Runner 2049 continues 30 years after the first Blade Runner movie. The whole story is based off of Rachael and Deckard. Apparently Rachael and Deckard had a child, which is impossible, because Rachael is a replicant, but it was a miracle. K, a Blade Runner is assigned to kill all Nexus 8 replicants, but while killing one he finds Nexus 7 bones hidden, he does a test, and it reveals she had a baby. Lt. Joshi orders him to eliminate the child so no one can know Nexus 7 replicants can have children. While K is on his mission, he finds clues that hints he's the child, but he finds out he isn't and actually it's a girl. The story is good. You watch K find out and reveal things about this child, and at points you believe he's the child.Characters: 9/10K: The best part about K is that he's struggling to confirm whether he's human, replicant or the child, we do confirm that he is not the child, and we do get hints he is a replicant, but it is not fully confirmed.Lt. Joshi: Lt. Joshi is K's captain. She gives K orders, and K does them. There's nothing too special about Lt. Joshi unfortunately, Lt. joshi could have been special, but the movie doesn't focus on her too much.Joi: Joi is a hologram, she's basically a product that a consumer can buy. I don't see the purpose of her in the movie except for a romantic relationship with K.Deckard: Deckard is the father of the special child. I thought that Deckard was going to have more screen time, but he gets introduced near the end of the movie.Action: 8/10I honestly predicted it wasn't going to be action packed. Blade Runner 2049 is more of a thriller then an action movie, so be expected to be bored for a bit. The movie also drags a lot, there's scenes that get extended for way too long, if the movie didn't drag so much it could have been 20 or 30 minutes shorter. The movie suffers because of the constant dragging.Blade Runner 2049 tells a great story, but the movie is way too long, that's the only major problem, everything else about it is great. The cinematography is amazing, the colors and the futuristic feeling is captivating. The music has a futuristic vibe, and it has a eerie feeling.",9,4,14,8 October 2017
First Man," Not the Best of It's Kind, But Very Solid
","First Man is not the first of it's craft, in fact, the genre is quite saturated at this point, but what the movie achieves is impressive nevertheless. Everything that you would want from a space biography, First Man has it, the physics, the build up, and the drama. First Man does bring some things new to the table, such as, introducing in Neil's family and the Gemini missions into the equation. Everything that you would expect to see in a film such as this, you get, it's pretty much Apollo 13, except for the part where the spacecraft explodes in the middle of space.As far as the realism goes, it's fairly realistic. They get a lot of things right, like the haircuts they had and Neil's history. I would've liked to see more physics involved, but the film focuses more on Neil's family, which isn't a bad thing at all. I'm not sure if Neil Armstrong had such a severed family life, but if he did, then the writers did a good job with that subplot. The biggest issue I have with First Man, is the extremely long pacing. I understand the whole build up to the finale, but it didn't have to be almost two and a half hours long.Technically, First Man was well crafted. The cinematography was very well filmed. First Man won an Oscar for best visual effects, but in my opinion, that's not where the movie strives. First Man should've got the Oscar for best sound editing. The scenes where Neil is in the spacecraft feel so realistic, mainly due to the amazing sound mixing and editing. There is constant ambient sounds in the cockpit that really sells the fact that these characters are actually in a spacecraft.When it comes to performances, Ryan Gosling takes the cake. This is one of his best performances in a movie so far, and he really sells emotional scenes. Surprisingly, the actors that played the two little boys did a great job. Having young children play characters can be unpredictable, but the two actors did a great job.First Man on paper is an amazing movie; and it is an amazing movie to watch. The vibe First Man gives off feels so realistic, and that's one of the strongest parts of the film. Seeing that First Man won an Oscar for best visual effects baffles me, as First Man does a better job with sound editing. I wouldn't recommend this movie for casual moviegoers, as it can be very boring, but if you're a fan of this genre, then it's definitely worth a watch.",8,1,1,15 January 2020
It," Not Scary, But A Good Thriller...
","In my opinion, I think that IT was overrated, People saying it was the scariest movie of the year, but to me it wasn't scary at all. IT was a good movie overall, but it lacked the scare. Honestly, I didn't really mind that I wasn't scared, because everything else was done so well. Everything about IT was perfect, the acting was on point, the characters are interesting, and the subplots were well done. Since there was so much characters, not all could have the same amount of attention as other characters, and I think there was a good balance between how much screen time the characters got.Story: 10/10The story was well done, I was never confused or lost in the story. I love how I'm constantly learning about Pennywise and the other characters throughout the movie, even at the end. The script was also amazing, some movies struggle to make a young character believable through the dialog, but the writers were on point, and they did an excellent job making the characters likable. The story is about an evil clown feeding off of kids' fears by shapeshifting into their biggest fear. A group of kids later realize what's going on and band together, calling themselves 'The Losers Club'. The idea is creative and unique, and only Steven King can make up something like this. There's also a lot of foreshadowing in IT, one of the quotes 'You'll float too' is genius. The idea of 'You'll float too' is that the kids who got caught by Pennywise float in the air in Pennywise's secret layer. IT is a long movie, with a 2:15 hour run time. I really can't blame the movie for being so long because of all the things they had to include, but I felt like it was too short. I wanted to see a little more from the forgotten Characters' subplots. Overall, the story is very strong, and it's creative and interesting.Characters: 9/10I loved all the performances from all of the actors. Every actor played their role great, and I was surprised how well they acted. Each character had their own fear, some of the fears weren't explained much, like the painting lady, but I could see why she was scary. Some of the fears were explained very well and even emotionally, like Mike's fear, which was about his death of his parents. The antagonist, Pennywise was strong and creepy. I wasn't scared of Pennywise, but his creepy presence and his mysterious past truly makes him a good villain. Bill Skarsgård did a fantastic job as Pennywise, he made the character Pennywise so psychotic and unpredictable, and that's why I think he did a better job as Pennywise than Tim Curry. Obviously, some characters were weak, like Stanley who was afraid of the painting lady. If the movie spent just a little more time on the weaker characters, than then the movie would be a perfect 10/10.Action: 8/10As I said before, I don't think IT was scary. At some points in the movie, there was comedy, and some people say that it takes away the whole horror aspect, but I don't mind it. Some people even say the CGI was bad, and yes at some scenes the CGI was iffy, but it wasn't too bad. I also liked how Pennywise attacks, he has these rows of teeth that come outward just before he attacks his victim, it adds the whole unpredictable freight to the character. Overall, the horror was weak, nothing really was burned in my memory, like what Alien: Covenant did. I was however, very disappointed of how overrated it was.Overall, IT was a good movie, with an interesting story and believable characters. Although IT didn't go down in my books as a scary movie, it did go down as one of the best remakes ever made. I strongly recommend IT to anyone who hasn't watched it yet. And hopefully chapter two will go down as one of the best sequels ever made.",8,1,2,15 February 2018
Wind River," A Cinematic Masterpiece...
","Although Wind River has a very slow start, but once the action kicks in, it get's bloody and intense. If Wind River had that great action throughout the movie, then Wind River could have got a perfect score. With only the action being at the end of the movie, Wind River gets really boring, and that's the only issue with the movie.Story: 9/10The story is about a death of a Native girl found deep in the woods. A young FBI agent, with the help of Cory Lambert, played by Jeremy Renner, the two characters have to figure out the cause of a young Native American. I love the whole idea of the mystery, but Wind River doesn't feel like a mystery. I'm never wondering how this happened, I'm more focused on the characters and the cinematography. Wind River does have one problem, and that's the pacing, it takes too long for something to go down. By the end of the movie, we see that she wasn't murdered, but how she got so far, and why she got so far into the woods.Characters: 10/10Corey Lambert: The whole idea that Corey hunts predators, and that at the end he's hunting another predator (that's the villain), and that's clever to me. I think that Wind River is Jeremy Renner's best performance so far, he did a great job in this movie. He definitely stole the show with his acting. Jane Banner: I like how they added that Jane is new to the environment, and that she doesn't know anyone at Wind River. If Jane was the sheriff of Wind river, then it would be boring to the plot. Also Elizabeth Olsen did almost as good as a job as Jeremy Renner.Action: 9/10The action has a realistic feel to it, which makes the movie even more better. Wind River is a very realistic movie, you are not going to get the same action from a superhero movie, and that to me is important to a movie like this. To me, the action is perfect, but the only draw back is how long it takes to get to the final battle. The cinematography is also on the same level as 'The Revenant'. I love seeing the snowy landscape, and Taylor Sheridan did such a great job directing the movie. Overall Wind River has great realistic action, amazing cinematography, and clever characters, but terrible pacing. Wind River is one of the best thriller movies in 2017 so far.",9,0,3,9 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Good and bad...
","I thought I was going to love this movie, but to me it's average, I wanted to like it, but I just wasn't into it, it felt slow and it was dragging a bit at some parts.Story: 6/10The movie starts with Jyn's mother dying and her dad forced to build the deathstar. Jyn hides in a cave waiting for Saw Gerrera, he then takes care of her until she was sixteen years old. Then she was a prisoner of the empire for whatever reason, she gets rescued by the rebels because they wanted her help because her dad built the blueprint for the deathstar. There is so many plot holes and confusing parts in this movie, if they did a better job explaining things a bit more the movie would be better. Also the timeline is before Star Wars The New Hope, it tries to explain how the rebels got the layout for the deathstar.Characters: 10/10Jyn Erso: Jyn dies in the movie with all the other main characters, you barely know anything about her, and that's why when she died, it didn't matter to me.Cassian Andor: Cassian dies too, he's really paper thin and he's just there for whatever reason.K-2SO: K-2SO is the best character in the movie just because he reminds me of C-3PO Chirrut ÃŽmwe: Chirrut is an interesting character, he's blind and fights without a lightsaber, pretty interesting.Baze Malbus: Baze is Chirrut's best friend, nothing is known about him.Saw Gerrera: Saw Gerrera isn't important in the movie at all, he's just their to fill in some plot holes.Galen Erso: Galen Erso is the creator of the DeathStar, he later dies in the movie but he's an OK character. Action: 5/10There was little action in this movie, the only action was in the first act and the last act, all these fight scenes are pretty boring because the action scenes are so short.This movie lacked in character development and a boring second act, if they fixed those problems the movie would've been batter.",6,2,3,11 June 2017
Us," A Great Concept That Falls Flat
","As a fan of Jordan Peele's Get Out, finding out that he's going to director a second horror film was exciting. Watching the movie however, wasn't really exciting. There's so much that falls flat, and I came out wondering, how did Jordan go from Get Out, to Us. Us isn't a bad movie at all though, but the idea and not delivering well on it is what ruins the movie. I think Us is a perfect example of perfecting an amazing idea, because if it's not perfected, then it taints the entire movie.The plot on paper is very clever, but filling in the dots is what's important. There is so many plot holes that are left unanswered, that when the credits appear, you're left with so many questions. How has no one found out about the clones, if they're so easy to find? Where do they get they're clothes and scissors from? Why didn't the government kill the clones once they were done with them? All of these questions are surface level and can be explained, but it's never answered. I guess you can't get too deep into the plot, and just watch the movie casually to enjoy the ending.The idea itself, that the government created the tethered, which are basically clones of citizens in America is a great idea. And I have to give a point for the concept itself. The pacing was done very well; it didn't take long for things to start happening, and when things did started happening, it wasn't constant fighting.The acting was solid all around, as all the actors did a great job with making the tethered feel like completely different people. The characters, however, are a completely different story. For some reason, none of the characters are likable, except for Gabe (Played by Winston Duke). Zora and Jason (The children) felt underdeveloped, and we rarely get any exposition of those two characters. It seems that most of the focus was on the adults more than anything else, so it really held back the movie.Us had the potential to live up to Get Out, but the amount of plot holes creates an unsatisfying ending that leaves too many questions. Half of the characters were underdeveloped and weren't relatable. The action was entertaining though, and the pacing was well executed. Us isn't a bad movie; if you're a fan of horror, then why not, but for others, this is a pass.",6,1,3,13 January 2020
The Irishman," Scorsese Still Has It
","Scorsese is a directing legend for making gangster movie, and it's been a long time since Scorsese made a movie like The Irishman. I've missed this type of Scorsese and I'm happy that he still has his magic. The Irishman is literally the perfect gangster movie; it has De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. It's story is based off of real characters and actual events, and it takes its time to tell the story.The Irishman is very long, but it never got boring to me. There's always something happening and it really immerses you into the story. I love the extreme amount of exposition given at the beginning in Scorsese films, and in The Irishman, you get plenty all throughout the runtime. Some may say that The Irishman is slow paced, but I don't interpret it that way. The story is constantly developing itself and its characters; it took its time to develop everything, and it truly makes a believable story. I also love the dialogue and nicknames in The Irishman, it really gives you that Scorsese feel. The only issue I have with the screenplay is the lack of solid queues for what time period it is. I don't think Scorsese wanted to have texts saying what year it is, but it really confuses you, and you're forced to search up what happened in whatever year.Every character gets a great level of exposition, as I've said, and this makes all the characters super fun to watch. My favorite part is the chemistry between De Niro and Pacino. Pacino and De Niro make these two characters have a genuine friendship and it being destroyed by De Niro's character (Frank Sheeran) is sad to watch. Because of the great friendship, the character development was done very well. At first, I thought that the story was mainly with Pesci and De Niro, but it was shared between the trio, and that's what setup the third act so perfectly. There's a lot of characters in The Irishman, too many to count, and it can become very overwhelming with all the information, but the writer did a great job with handling all of the characters.The Irishman was shot very well; it has that Scorsese feel with how it was filmed, so basically, The Irishman has amazing cinematography. One of my favorite parts about The Irishman are the song choices. There's so may rock gems in the soundtrack that it makes The Irishman very pleasing to listen to. One thing that I want to point out are the visual effects. Creating faces as a visual effect is extremely difficult and it takes a lot of time, and they have done a very passable job. There is a little bit of uncanny valley with De Niro's younger face, but it's still very impressive.The Irishman is a great mobster film; it has all the attributes that's desirable for a gangster movie fan. It's long but entertaining and intriguing. The character exposition and development is expertly written. The acting by the trio of Pesci, Pacino, and De Niro is great, and they give you that gangster feel in the characters. I can see why some people would hate The Irishman, but if you love any Scorsese mobster film, then you're going to enjoy The Irishman.",8,1,1,13 May 2020
Deadpool 2," A True Deadpool Movie...
","Deadpool 2 is just a perfect representation of Deadpool; it's a perfect Deadpool movie. This movie did not take anything serious, and I feel like that's important for most comedy movies. The writers for Deadpool 2 pretty much nailed it for the comedy and the characters. I thought Deadpool 2 was going to be nothing compared to the first, but I think it's better. The jokes are funnier, the characters are far more likable, and the CGI looks better. And the Easter Eggs; if you think there was a lot of Easter Eggs in the first, wait 'til you see the Deadpool 2, there's at least double. Deadpool 2 was a bit of a disappointment for the characters. There was all these jokes and scenes in the trailer, but it never showed in the final cut. There was two scenes in the trailer that showed Bedlam and Shatterstar fighting, but it was like chunks in the movie were cut out. And I really wanted to see Terry Crews fight in a Deadpool movie.Story: 10/10This is a perfect Deadpool story, it could also work for any comedy movie. I love the idea of time travel, and they used that idea perfectly, because one of the funniest scenes has to do with time travel. The story goes like this: Cable, from the future wants to kill Firefist, because the future Firefist kills Cable's family, and it's up to Deadpool to protect Firefist. The story is so unique because you'd expect Deadpool to protect Firefist through the whole movie, but then they become enemies, then friends again. We also see Juggernaut protect Firefist at the end of the movie, which is interesting. Although Deadpool 2 was just under two hours, I did want it to go longer; it was just an enjoyable film. The pacing was good, I was never bored when there was no action, because of the constant jokes. I usually complain about subplots, but I felt like there wasn't enough. Some subplots were really interesting, like in the future where cable's family died. I really hope they show what it's like in the future. Overall, the story is funny, entertaining, and unique.Characters: 9/10All the characters were good. They pretty much nailed Deadpool, with the jokes, and the fighting style. I liked how at first, Deadpool was fighting Cable, but then at the end they become best friends (In a way). The only thing that bothered me was how the original X-Force team died immediately after parachuting, it was a funny scene, but I hoped to see them all fight, especially Peter. We also see Juggernaut for a bit, which I never expected. And then we have the innocent Colossus. Colossus pretty much stayed the same from the original, and we also heard him swear for the first time, so that was good. I loved how in this movie, everyone gets the spotlight, and their own jokes; no matter how little the screen time is. And we see colossus fight dirty for the first time too, against Juggernaut. Overall, all of the characters were funny, but there was way too little screen time for the original X-Force.Action: 10/10Deadpool 2 was way funnier than the first. There was so many references to different movies that ruined the X-Men universe and Ryan Reynolds career. One of the references was about the leg cross in Basic Instinct; that was one of the funniest moments in the entire movie. The combat is brutal, even more brutal than the first, which is the way it's supposed, because it's a Deadpool movie. The director, David Leitch is so talented and underrated, and I really hope he directs another Deadpool movie. The CGI is decent, but some scenes looked a bit too cheesy. The choreography was good and action-packed, it was also funny; especially the fight scene with Juggernaut and Colossus. Overall, Deadpool 2 is an amazing action movie, with entertaining and funny choreography, and the comedy was hilarious.Overall, Deadpool 2 takes what made Deadpool 1 so great, and makes it better. I loved every moment in this movie, and I never wanted it to end. I love the character Deadpool, and this version; it's exactly like the game; I haven't read any of the comic books, so I really don't know if it's like the comics. But I really hope everyone gets a chance to watch this movie, it really made me laugh, and the people in the theater.",10,2,4,4 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," One Word, Masterpiece...
","Thor: Ragnarok is by far the best Thor movie released, Thor: Ragnarok has everything Marvel is known for, the great comedy, the characters and the creative story. Thor: Ragnarok is exactly what I expected it to be. There was also a lot of comedy, but luckily it worked.Story: 10/10The whole story is about Thor's sister wanting to take over Asgard. Thor does have a sister that was never introduced to the MCU. While Hela (Thor's sister) is trying to take over Asgurd, Thor is trying to get home to try and prevent her. Thor meets Hulk after 2 years in a battle arena, and Thor is trying to get his help. While on Thor's way he meets people that will help him in the long run. The writers did a great job introducing these knew characters and the destruction of Asgard. There are no problems in the story that effect it, so overall the writers did a good job.Characters: 10/10Thor: Now the new Thor has been introduced. Thor doesn't need his hammer know (because it broke) and he has an eye patch. I like the idea of Thor using his fists and not his hammer, but I don't like how they added the eye patch. But the changes to Thor make him more awesome.Loki: Loki will never change, and I never want him to change. Loki has this foolish attitude that just makes him even more likable. Loki has this charisma that makes him so entertaining to watch. Hela: Hela is a very mysterious character. We only get to see her past in a few scenes that set up her reasons to take over Asgard. I like the character and her helmet, but they don't set up her past very much, so I can't really feel sympathetic towards her, but I don't know if they wanted me to feel bad for her.Korg: Korg isn't really important to the plot, but I added him in because of how funny he is. Taika Waititi did amazing on Korg. Korg's voice and the way he talks is so funny. Korg alone is probably sixty percent of the comedy.Action: 10/10The action and CGI is done well, Thor: Ragnarok relies heavily on CGI. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well. With such entertaining action the time went by quickly. The best action scenes in Thor: Ragnarok is when Thor and Hulk are fighting and the last fight on the bridge. Overall the action is what you would get from a Marvel movie.Thor: Ragnarok has a perfect blend of storytelling and comedy. There might be a little too much comedy, but it works, there was no moment when a joke didn't work. Overall Thor: Ragnarok is a perfect 10 out of 10 for me.",10,2,9,19 November 2017
Ready Player One," Steven Spielberg Never Fails To Surprise...
","Ready Player One is based off the book the book, Ready Player One (2011), which I have never read (So pretty much that means I liked the movie, and I did). I was so glad that Steven Spielberg directed Ready Player One, because he has a reputation of turning books into movies (Jurassic Park). I instantly knew it was going to have the same style that Steven Spielberg is known for, just from the opening scene. For me, the best part of the movie was the references and the OASIS itself. You could spend hours trying to find all the references and Easter Eggs in Ready Player One. In my opinion, the OASIS was felt like a real video game world, like a sandbox/open world. Ready Player One gets a lot of things right, but the main issues I have is the villain and the comedy. The villain is pretty much every stereotype put all into one character and the jokes weren't that funny, but everything else was good.Story: 10/10I was surprised that I don't have any issues with the story. I was expecting some pacing issues, due to how long the movie is. The idea that there are three keys and whoever collects all the keys first, wins the contest and gets to control the OASIS. Everyone is looking for the three keys, even major companies, such as IOI. At first I thought it was silly that companies would go so far as kidnapping and murdering people just to win a contest in a video game, but then I released that it's a company, and companies will do anything for more money. The theme that the players have to fight back the companies from ruining good games is actually very realistic, and it's happening even now. The plot was entertaining, and I never lost focus on the story, I was always interested on how the players would find the next key. There was a few subplots that felt boring, but it never affected the overall story. I also liked how if IOI won the contest, not only the players would be affected, but the future of humanity, because of how much the OASIS impacts peoples' lives. Overall, the story was entertaining and it kept me interested the whole way through.Characters: 8/10Although Wade Watts is a relatable and overall a good protagonist, there's still some issues, like the antagonist (Sorrento) and supporting cast. The supporting cast had little to offer in the beginning, only in the climax they played a role. The supporting cast also had way too little screen time, even for supporting characters. The antagonist is very bland, and he fits all the stereotypes. The antagonists' motives are believable, but that's the only good part about that character. The love story between Wade (Parzival) and Samantha (Art3mis) felt a bit rushed, like when Wade said he loved her so early in the movie, it was cringeworthy, but it did show how bad he was with woman. Some comedic characters, like I-R0k (T.J. Miller) was unfunny, he maybe got two laughs from ten jokes. The main characters were good though, they were interesting and relatable. Overall, the main characters were good, but the antagonist and the supporting cast were bland.Action: 10/10Some people complained that there was too much CGI, but I think it was necessary, because it is a video game, and most of the time the movie is in the OASIS. There was so much action especially at the beginning and at the climax. The climax had to be the most epic part about the movie, there was so action and pop culture references. The climax reminded me of the final battle in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, with so much mayhem going on. One of my favorite scenes is when the players go into The Shining, and they pretty much remake the most iconic scenes in horror. One thing I want to point out is how they used Chucky as a weapon in the climax, I think it was creative. The comedy was on the weaker side, with only a few jokes landing. Overall, the action was entertaining and creative, but the comedy felt awkward.Overall, Ready Player One was a superb movie, with only the characters and the comedy be on the weaker side. I've always appreciated Steven Spielberg's work, and now I appreciate it even more, because of how much hard work and dedication it took to make this movie. I know Ready Player One is going to get hated on because it wasn't exactly like the book, but even if I did read the book, it still wouldn't change my mind. I think I've spent my money perfectly on watching this movie, and I think everyone should get a chance to watch Ready Player One, because of how much this movie relates to every different type of audience.",9,0,2,2 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," A Good Movie That's Held Back Silly Flaws
","BlacKkKlansman is a film about a true story of how Ron Stallworth infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. It's an interestingly true story, so converting that into a movie equally makes it interesting. BlacKkKlansman is like a breath of fresh air when it comes to movies that speaks on the topic of racism, and there should definitely be more movies such as this one.BlacKkKlansman is a thrilling movie to watch, even though it's considered to be a drama. Adam Driver's character, Flip Zimmerman is the one who actually meets with the members of the KKK, and most of his interactions with the members are very intense scenes. We're always guessing whether Flip Zimmerman will get caught, and that's what makes the movie so entertaining.There are a few issues with the movie that do hold it back. The character development of Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman is unbelievably weak. We barely get a story behind both characters, and we rarely see what their lives are like outside of the job. Some of the Klan members even get more exposition than our leading characters. Another issue is with the relationship between Patrice and Ron. They're romantic relationship has such a weak foundation, because of how rarely we see the two together. Giving both characters more detail would've made the final act more intense to watch.BlacKkKlansman is definitely worth a watch. It's entertaining and intense throughout most acts. Some of the issues with the movie are issues that shouldn't even appear in a film such as this. Overall, BlacKkKlansman is a good movie that expresses a message in a fresh new way; that doesn't feel forced, I definitely recommend watching.",7,2,5,6 January 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Almost As Good As Spider-man (2002)
","I was very confident that Spider-Man: Homecoming was going to be great, and I was right, but I just wished it was going to be similar to the original, and it is, but it didn't set up everything like it did in the original, but i'm pretty sure no-one would want to see an origin story again.Story:9/10After the events of Captain America: Civil War, we see Peter learning about his powers, and himself. Back when Loki was trying to invade New York, we see the aftermath, and workers cleaning it all up when they lose their jobs from a different organization, and that anger motivated Adrian Toomes/Vulture to get a new job by getting the scraps of the alien weapons and selling them. 8 years later Peter Parker is trying to get the attention of Tony Stark, he aims to shut down Adrian Toomes, and his crew. I like the story, it's simple, and there's no huge risk of the world ending, and the only stakes is losing his aunt, and his friend, and I respect that.Characters: 8/10Peter Parker: Peter is a perfect example of a teenager, clumsy, and irresponsible, and I love that, it shows that Spider-Man isn't a professional, he's just a kid.Vulture: Vulture is a questionable character, he is intimidating, but his motives are questionable, but I get his motives, it's just not strong enough.Tony Stark: Tony is just Tony, he's still the lovable Iron-Man, nothing has changed dramatically with him, I don't have much to say about him to be honest.Ned: Ned is just a great character, he's so nerdy, and awkward it's funny, I feel like if Ned wasn't in the movie it would lower the score.Action: 8/10This movie has awesome action, it's entertaining, and funny, I have never laughed so hard in this movie then any other movie I have watched. There's also a lot of time spent in the high school, and I like that because it shows that it's hard to be a super-hero and have to deal with school.Overall this is a great Spider-Man movie, it wasn't as good as the original because the Peter Parker in the original was doing all these things from his heart, but in this movie he's doing to become an Avenger, which isn't bad, it just doesn't feel like the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",8,1,5,1 October 2017
Suicide Squad," The most epic movie of 2016.
","I watched this movie a week ago, but I'm lazy. So let's begin.The characters. 9/10Harley Quinn, I really liked the look for Harley Quinn, I just hated the cartoon version of Harley, with the jester look. She also has a couple of tattoos, which I also like.The Joker, some people hated the Joker, but personally I liked the new joker, he was a thug like appeal, which I think looks best for the joker.Deadshot, Deadshot is really cool and they made Deadshot have some heart in him and can do some nice things, I like how he's trying to do good, so that his daughter can trust him.El Diablo, one of my favorite characters, El Diablo killed his family and wants his redemption and have a 2nd shot at everything, he then dies, but hes proud.Killer Croc, Croc is not that tall which I don'y like, I want a 7ft tall croc instead of a 6ft croc.Captain Boomerang, I like captain Boomerang, because hes funny and manipulating, you'll see why.Slipknot, Slipknot dies early, because Captain Boomerang manipulated him into running and get his head blown up.Enchantress, Enchantress has a dark and mysterious look which I like, there's not much to say about her.The Story. 8/10The story is casual, kill the bad guy (enchantress) the squad starts to bond and trust each other, and I like that, and it shows that the characters are not dull, but interesting how they cooperate, the joker appears sometimes trying to rescue Harley, Deadshot and Harley have a very strong relationship, again they did a very strong job with the characters.The Action. 10/10Great action scenes and one of the most entertaining boss fight I have every seen, I was entertained from the begging to the end, and some movies have cheap action scenes and try to be epic.The Comedy 5.5/10It breaks my heart that the comedy isn't it's suit, I really want everything to be perfect, sometimes when there's a joke it wasn't funny so it was quiet and awkward.Some people are biased doing reviews because of it's ratings, and sometimes I'm biased, but I really enjoyed the movie, so it's a 9/10 don't listen to the critics, its a really fun movie to watch. -Thanks...",6,2,4,22 August 2016
Ant-Man," how can it get rated so low
","When I watched the movie, I searched it up on IMDb and it got rated 8.3 (estimate) and I was like I KNEW IT WAS IN THE 8s. I then check again in April 2016, it said 7.4, I was amazed how great this movie is, but such a low rating, I know 7.4 is a good number but it's still has to have a higher score. I'm going to make this short. It's an action packed, funny movie. The actors played well. This was my favorite superhero movie before Deadpool came out, but it's at second so that's pretty good. I then see ant-man and the wasp, coming out in 2018, I love Marvel, I think it's the best studio that produces the best movies. I have mix feelings about this movie, it won't be better than the first but it will get rated 7 out of 10.I go to Marvels website and there are eight new movies coming out in the future and i'm going to have to wait for years and stick with the old ones. I see a movie, Doctor Strange, who I never heard of, but it's coming out in 2016 so in a couple of months. I'm mostly excited about Black Panther. It would be cool if they put Gambit in a movie and they did put him in a movie, X-MEN: Origins Wolverine. I know it's a bad movie and they might never add him in a movie again, but just once.Marvel is adding a bunch of new movies and sequels and marvel has made some bad ones (fantastic four) but overall, all eight movies are going to be great...",9,0,2,10 April 2016
Baby Driver," Something unique and different...
","This movie is just pure fun, you get to listen to awesome music and watch some entertaining chase scenes. This movie has a perfect blend of action and music.Story: 9/10Baby, as a teen he stole a car from a heist planner, he gets caught, and baby has to help him until Doc (heist planner) is satisfied. Baby is a driver, a heist driver, you get to see his skills in the most entertaining way possible, jamming it out with epic music. While he's doing the dirty work, he's living with his deaf foster parent. He also has a hearing problem, so he drowns it out with music. He also has a girlfriend, and he wants to be with her, but he doesn't want to tell her what he actually does. The story is fresh, and it takes some key elements from other movies.Characters: 8/10Baby: After being in a car accident, he lost his parents, and he has hearing problems. He has a good personality, but he's stuck with a wrong group of people.Debora: Debora is a waitress in a diner. She quickly becomes Baby's girlfriend. She finds out about his job, but she still loves him because she knows he's not a bad person.Doc: Doc is a heist planner. He forces Baby as his driver because Baby is in debt. He later becomes some what of a good guy at the end, and makes you have second thoughts about him.Action: 10/10This movie has the best action of the year in my opinion. I love the classy music, it sets the tone. There is also a lot of gun fights, which I wasn't expecting. The car chase scenes are also entertaining and creative.Baby Driver is the type of movie you can watch with everyone at every time. Baby Driver feels fresh, and it tells a great story of a kid wanting to be with someone, but struggling with the wrong group of people.",9,5,10,15 October 2017
Justice League," DC rising up...
","There was only two DC movies released in 2017, Wonder Woman and Justice League. Justice League was a good movie, like Wonder Woman. The DC movies released in 2016 were pretty trash, but 2017 was a good year for DC, and other superhero movies. I really did enjoy Justice League for what it is, but the problem was that there was no hype. There should be massive amounts of hype surrounding Justice League, but there wasn't that much for a movie like this. If DC took their time and release movie by movie, explaining each character, then there would be much more amounts of hype. I don't want to see the Justice League characters band up in one movie, then explain the characters later in their own movies in the upcoming years. Marvel took ten years to explain each character, and then put them in a movie teaming up all together, I'm talking about Avengers: Infinity War. DC took less than half of the time that Marvel took, but if Justice League was trash, then Marvel would have no competition, fortunately Justice League was a good movie.Story: 6/10The story is beyond average. Justice League has that very average superhero story, like, the good guys find the threat, the good guys have a plan to save the world, the good guys end the bad guys, The End. I pretty much described the story in a few sentences. Justice League relies on the 'Save the world, or everyone will die' story. I have to be honest, I'm sick of the end of the world story, it's way too predictable, and you always know what's going to happen. Stories like Marvel's Logan is a good one, for example: Logan doesn't have to save the world, he has to save himself and the people around him. The story is about Logan's world, not the whole world. Now back to Justice League. The villain plot is a cliche too. Stop the bad guy before he gets this and that before it gets too late. Gladly, the plot wasn't boring. I was slightly interested by the plot. The plot didn't get lost in it's self or any other subplot, the movie had one motive, and it was a basic one. I'm so happy that Justice League didn't try to explain the characters' origins thoroughly, it would be subplot heaven. The last thing I want mention is the cubes. Basically the bad guy has to collect these powerful cubes to end the world, and I hate that. Make it like the bad guy didn't need anything, and all he had to do was just land there and end the world, it would've been more intense. Overall, the story suffers from an average plot and of plenty cliches, also the bad guy plot was weak.Characters: 7/10The Justice League characters were decent, but the villain was terrible, physically and mentally. Physically, Steppenwolf (The villain) didn't seem powerful whatsoever. I knew straight from the beginning that Steppenwolf would manage to do nothing, he didn't even hurt a fly. Mentally, he wasn't scary nor intimidating. The Justice League team was far better. Some characters got their own movies, some got movies to explain their relationships between others (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). The Flash in this movie was surprising, I have to say. Flash makes the other characters look boring. I don't want to say that Flash was funny, but he is the most unique character in the movie. I did feel like some of the characters besides Seppenwolf was dragging. Aquaman felt out of place in this movie to me. If the characters had their own movie before Justice League, than maybe they would be OK, but Aquaman felt so pointless accept for only one scene. Overall, the characters were good, some felt very out of place and some characters, like Steppenwolf were just simply terrible.Action: 9/10I really enjoyed Justice League mainly because of the action. I was never bored, there was action left, right, and center. Justice League has one little issue, the CGI. At some scenes the CGI makes sense and it looks good, but some scenes were just overkill. Near the ending of the movie, there was just too much CGI, and it must have burned a lot of budget. I also liked how they choreographed the fight scenes. Each character was working together in different ways, like Flash and Superman were saving the people and Flash and Cyborg were working together at some scenes to stop the cubes from ending the Earth. One last thing I would like to mention is how amazing the CGI was for Gotham City. Gotham City is supposed dark and rainy, and Justice League did exactly that. Overall, the action is entertaining and unique. The CGI was a bit too much, but it does set the mood for the entire movie.Overall, Justice League was a superb superhero movie. The action was at its best, and the CGI helped the action, and sometimes it didn't help. The Justice League team roster was well done, but some characters felt a bit out of place. The villain was terrible, bland and just weak. The story was decent, but it does suffer from all the superhero cliches. But DC still hasn't learned from their mistakes. DC hasn't took their time with their movies, especially in Justice League. The pacing was a bit off, but not to the point that it ruined the movie. And I have to say, Henry Cavill's face looked like a cut scene from a 2008 video game, the CGI did poorly with removing Cavill's mustache. Justice League was a good DC movie and I strongly recommend it to anyone, you can enjoy it anytime.",7,1,2,12 March 2018
Dunkirk," A Unique Take On A True Event...
","I knew this movie was going to be great, even before the trailer, but what surprised me the most was how it told three different stories of Dunkirk. I was expecting Dunkirk to be a movie about what the soldiers did to try to escape the beach of Dunkirk. I like how Nolan took three different perspectives of this event. This version of Dunkirk has to be the best, in my opinion.Story: 10/10The story of Dunkirk was an event about the Nazis invading France. The French soldiers got trapped at the beach of Dunkirk. The ally British failed to help fight against Germany, trapping themselves with the French. The way the Christopher Nolan showed the language barrier between the French and the English was well done. There was a scene when a group of English soldiers tried to escape with an old boat, and there was one French soldier, and they quickly turned on each other because of that language barrier between the French and the English. The other side of the story was about a team of three English men trying to rescue the soldiers on the beach. The way they showed how long it took to get to the beach of Dunkirk and the thrill of getting there was well done, it doesn't show them getting on a boat and arriving there the next scene, it slowly shows the progression of the journey. The last part of the story was by air. The pilot part was the weakest part of the movie. I wasn't entertained or thrilled in the plane scenes. I felt like Nolan wasn't interested or didn't really focus on the plane side of the story. I was expecting a little bit more from Tom Hardy, but he got the least screen time in the cast. The way Nolan showed this event through these three sides was interesting and unique. The one issue was the plane scenes.One unique part about this movie was the characters. Dunkirk wasn't really focused on characters, but more on the story, and I support that idea. I was expecting strong characters and friendships between the soldiers, much like the movie 'Hacksaw ridge'. The movie focused on 300,000 soldiers not knowing anyone else, and nothing in common, but wanting to get out. Although I knew nothing about these characters on the boat trying rescue the soldiers, I did feel sympathy when one of them died.Action: 9/10Dunkirk really focused on the thrill and the fear of the soldiers, and because of that there is no gunfights, but just waiting for rescue, and Dunkirk does that well. The sound and music design is the best iv'e ever heard. The music fitted the movie perfectly. The music made it ten times more thrilling. Also the sound design was amazing, hearing the planes flying through the air was just so captivating. Near the end of the movie, there was a scene when a plane was flying over the beach, and it sounded so realistic that if you closed your eyes, you would believe you were actually there.Dunkirk tells a great story through the perspective of three different sides, land, air, and sea. The movie didn't just focus on only the soldiers, but it also focused on the brave people who risked their lives to save the soldiers. With that and amazing sound and music design, Dunkirk easy deserves a 10/10 or a 9/10. The only reason why Dunkirk gets a 9/10 from me was how weak the story of the pilots in the planes.",9,1,3,21 January 2018
The Favourite," A Great Blend of Yorgos Lanthimos
","Yorgos Lanthimos' style of movies are unique than any other style. All of his movies end in an unsatisfying way, not giving you what you always get from the average Hollywood movie. I'm a fan of Yorgos' movies, because his movies always give me this feeling that no other director can give. The Favourite gives that unsatisfying ending that you always get from Yorgos' movies; the only difference between The Favourite and Yorgos' other movies is the dialogue and acting. There's no upfront dialogue, and the acting is human like; personally, I prefer The Killing of a Sacred Deer's acting style more. Since this movie is more Hollywood, it would make sense to enjoy it more than his other movies.The Favourite tells a true story of Queen Anne's relationships, between two different women, and it tells the story fairly well. An issue of Yorgos' movies are the pacing, but for The Favourite, it's paced well. It didn't take too long for the audience to pick up exactly what was going on. I liked the inhumane characteristics of Abigail, and how she disguises those characteristics throughout the film; as it shows how deceitful others can be.The acting is done fairly well, the best performances were done by Emma Stone and Olivia Colman. Olivia does the best performance as she embodies a frustrated Queen perfectly. Rachel Weisz does what she can do best with this character, that character being an emotionless right hand servant to the Queen. Emma stone plays a character that is somewhat like a sociopath. Having a character that is a sociopath is necessary in a movie such as this, as it gives more emotion to an audience that is watching a movie about three women in a mansion.Yorgos' directing style is all over The Favourite. There are long shots that are wide, showing the viewers the entire room or landscape. The film got two Oscar nominations for best editing and best cinematography, and it's all well deserved. Yorgos Mavropsaridis is the editor, and he gives it that Yorgos Lanthimos style. The music plays a big role in giving the film more taste; making scenes more intense.Overall, The Favourite is a movie that the critics would love and the average audience would dislike. There are reasons to love and hate this movie, as some say that it has no purpose or that's slow. I love this movie as it's unique, and it makes you unsettled and maybe even depressed. If you're a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos, then this is the movie to watch. If you're just bored and want to watch a movie, then don't watch this movie, because you might be even more bored.",8,1,3,5 January 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," The Hype Is Real!
","I've been waiting for this movie to come out for forever now. I was afraid it was going to be terrible; if it was, then that would be a surprise. Marvel movies have been at the top for years now, and this is the peak. I was so excited to see all these characters meet for the first time and take down Thanos. For me, this is the best way to introduce the Infinity War story. There was so much characters and subplots, and there was no pacing issues and the story didn't get lost in itself. This movie could've been three hours plus, but putting it all together in two hours thirty minutes is a real achievement. I was never bored too; there was action right in the beginning to the end. I know a lot of the non-comic moviegoers are going to hate this movie, because they had no idea that Thanos would kill everyone, luckily I knew what was going to happen. I think it was a hard decision for Marvel to take this direction; due to the criticism of the naive moviegoers, salute to Marvel. The thing is, if Marvel never explained all of the characters, then this could've ended up as a failure. We knew all of the characters and plots. Marvel explained every bit to the audience through multiple movies. Marvel took their time to explain and not confuse the audience. DC didn't do that with Justice League, there was no hype for that, because there were no 'Multiple movies'.Story: 10/10There are six Infinity Stones, each stone was explained throughout every Marvel movie (Excluding the X-Men universe). We knew everything there has to be known about the Infinity Stones and the subplots, because of the 'Multiple movies'. This movie is subplot galore, and a lot of movies suffer from that, but this movie doesn't. All the subplots made the Marvel universe more interesting and exciting. For anyone who doesn't fully understand the plot, Thanos has to collect six Infinity Stones from around the universe, if he gets it, then goodbye to the superheros, and that's what happens in this movie. Most of the superheros are gone, it's up for the rest to end Thanos. There was no pacing issues, as I said before. I was never confused of what was happening; the plot stayed on its tracks the entire movie. We also saw Thanos collect each Infinity Stone, except for one. I liked seeing Thanos collect all these Infinity Stones while seeing the superheros band up together, it really builds up the the climax. Overall, the plot stayed steady, there wasn't too many plot holes, the story is action packed, fun, and exciting.
Characters: 10/10I loved all of the characters. Each one had their own movie to star in, which made them even more exciting to see them team up. For me, Thanos was perfect. They made Thanos strong and 'Merciless'. Thanos was such a good villain because he didn't fail to kill superheros, and that's what he did in this movie. If a villain managed to do nothing, then he's a bad villain, but Thanos managed to complete his mission. Every character was interesting, and they had their own part to play in this movie. Each character and setting was explained so perfectly in this movie, and in other Marvel movies. One of the newer characters is Eitri (Peter Dinklage). Peter Dinklage was the perfect choice for Eitri. Dinklage is such a good actor; he can really play any role. I would also like to see Eitri join the rest of the Avengers to end Thanos, that would be great. Since there's so much characters in a two hour thrity minute movie, some characters don't get that much screen time. I wanted to see more Black Panther, he was only helpful at the end of the movie. Overall, every character had their own role to play in the story, Thanos was perfect in this movie, but some characters didn't get that much screen time than others.Action: 10/10A lot of long movies like, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Blade Runner 2049 suffer from one important issue; the boredom. A lot of long movies feel long because there isn't enough action to keep the audience satisfied, but Avengers: Infinity War had no problem. None of the characters had to be explained and none of the major plots had to be explained, it was all action. This movie really used the power of CGI, and there was no problem. Sometimes having a CGI villain can ruin the villain itself, but the voice acting by Josh Brolin was good enough to make this CGI villain believable. The climax of the movie is one of the strong parts of this movie. Seeing most of the superheros work together for the first time is like rewatching the climax of Avengers (2012). But not all of the superheros were fighting the alien army. The other superheros were fighting Thanos. Overall, there was constant action, the CGI was on point, but I expected a slightly better final fight.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War was perfect for me. I loved the story, the characters, and the action. I was afraid that Marvel would do something wrong, but everything was perfect. I really hope Marvel can keep up with the good work, but Venom scares me. Venom, in my opinion doesn't look that good for a Marvel movie, and I really want this Marvel hot streak to continue. There is one minor issue; there wasn't enough Hulk. I wanted to see Hulk in the final battle, but he was just in the Hulkbuster suit, which is ironic. Avengers: Infinity War was funny too, which isn't surprising. I strongly recommend Avenger: Infinity War, it's the Perfect Marvel movie, with lovable characters, laughs, and the constant action.",10,18,46,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Disappointing...
","With all of these great reviews, Oscars, and it being a Quentin Tarantino film, I held Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood to an extremely high expectation. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is such a strange movie to me: it has Tarantino's directing style, but it doesn't feel like one of his movies. I really wanted to love this movie because I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but this movie felt useless and overrated. And I can understand why people would love this movie, it's funny and it has a great ending, but this one wasn't exactly for me.The plot butchered this movie in my opinion. During the runtime, you could feel Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood building up for something because of the pacing. The issue is that it was building up to something that wasn't defined at the beginning, so it felt like it was going nowhere. There were many scenes that were specifically for a character's development, so I thought all of them were going to me up and have some insane ending, like what a Tarantino film should have. The ending was quite unique in fact, as it was about Charles Manson's goons attacking Rick Dalton and his stunt double. I really liked this ending, as it took a different approach that was funny and satisfying in a Tarantino way. But I don't think the ending was worthy of a 2h 41min runtime.The most redeeming aspect of the film was the acting. When you have Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, you'd expect to see some great performances. The sad part is that the characters aren't interesting enough to live up to the performances. One issue I have with the movie when it comes to the characters is how poorly they were used. Why have Margot Robbie play a character when the character barely even contributes to the final plot. This begs the question, why have the Polanski and Tate relationship if they were only slightly used at the ending.I do like how stylistic Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is: Tarantino is great at making is film unique. It has that 60s vibe that is awesome when done right. Great song selection plays an important part in a 60s movie: it has to be upbeat and fun to set the mood. Tarantino also did a great job with making Rick Dalton's movies seem like a classic westerner.Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is the greatest disappointment of Quentin Tarantino's directing career. This movie isn't bad though, it did a lot of things right, and I really wanted to like this movie, but there were too many issues. It had a weak plot that felt like it was going nowhere throughout the entire runtime. It misused almost half of the characters, and they weren't all that interesting. Honestly, I can see why a lot of people would like this movie, but it's too overrated for me.",7,0,7,24 May 2020
A Quiet Place," A Scary Place...
","I'm not really a big fan of horror movies, but if I find it interesting, then I watch it. And when I saw the trailer, I new I was going to love it, and I did. A lot of horror movies suffer from the cliches, like making stupid decisions or false jumpscares, and this movie did have a few of those jumpscares. I think jumpscares don't make movies scary, but the thrill and the suspense is what truly makes a movie scary. A Quiet Place had so much suspense and thrill, and that for me made it scary. But I wasn't scared like I couldn't get an image out of my head, but I was scared because of what I thought was going to happen, like, is she going to die or how are they going to escape. A Quiet Place did have one of those cliches; at the start of the movie, it said 'Day 89', you should have a basic understanding of survival and to keep quiet from these monsters, so why exactly would you turn on a toy rocket that makes sounds? Except from that instance, all of the characters make smart, logical actions.Story: 8/10The idea that we see the story the same way the characters do was a good. I'm guessing the characters have no idea why or how these monsters got here; the audience also doesn't know why or how they got here, and that's why I love this movie so much. The mystery of the monsters really does make them unpredictable, and generally good monsters. I liked how the movie starts at 'day 89', It adds to the mystery. The story is simple; a family trying to survive from these monsters that use sound to hunt, I also believe they use echolocation. The story mainly focuses on the family, and not so much on the monsters; the movie focuses on how the family has to keep quiet and their reaction to the monsters. The story does have some weaknesses, like why aren't the monsters attacking the birds in the air; does the monsters know they can't get the birds. So clearly their are some unanswered questions and some plot holes, but not to the point where you're questioning the whole movie. The story is very strong in my opinion, it's entertaining, mysterious, thrilling, and simple. Overall, the story is great, but there are some plot holes and unanswered questions.Characters: 8/10The characters are decent, with some characters obviously getting more attention than others (Regan, the deaf girl). At the beginning, one of the family members die (Kid with the rocket), and that kid's death at the start of the movie was a perfect way to start a horror movie; by showing how easy it is to die in the world they're living in. I think most of the characters were good, but it is difficult to make a character likable or attached to with such little dialog. Luckily all of the actors were good at acting, because this movie heavily relies on the emotions and the actions to show what a character is going through. And of course someone dies (John Krasinski's character, Lee Abbott), but it wasn't that emotional. The movie was very short in my opinion, with a run time of 1h 30min; if this movie was 2hs long, with the extra 30min developing characters, then maybe his death could've been sad. If the movie was 2hs long, then it would've been extremely boring, so either character development, but boring or boring characters, but entertaining. The John Krasinski and Emily Blunt duo was good, mainly because their married in real life. Overall, each character had their own moments that made them somewhat interesting, but below average character development, but since there was such little dialog, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.Action: 9/10Since the beginning of the film, we were shown the dangers of the world they live in, but I wanted a bit more. Right after that death of that kid, we didn't really see much from the monsters; I kind of forgot about them for a bit, but the dialog did keep reminding me of the dangers. I would say the last 20-40 minutes of the movie was about the situation the family was in, and how they had to survive the fight. Those last 20-40 minutes were so stressful; one moment the kids are trying to survive from the monsters, then we go back to the husband and wife, then back to the kids. The movie was like giving us short breaks before our hearts were pounding again. I would say the first half of the movie was building up to the eventual 'final fight'. There were a lot of jumpscares, but this movie doesn't depend on them, as I said before, but the thrill is what got me to the edge of my seat. Overall, the action was thrilling and heart pounding (especially at the end), but the movie does get a bit boring in the first half.Overall, this movie was a good horror. The monsters weren't the most original idea, but the mystery and suspense is what makes them unique. The characters were well development for how little the dialog was. The fact that the story begins after the whole invasion/beginning was a good idea, and it makes the audience more unaware of what happened, which I think was a great way to start a horror movie. A Quiet Place is pg-13, and that slightly bothered me. Since it was pg-13, the movie shied back from the violence; if it didn't, then I think it would've made the monsters more scary and gruesome. I enjoyed A Quiet Place, and I think this movie is great to watch with a friend, so I strongly recommend, A Quiet Place.",8,1,3,7 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Better then the last Pirates Of The Caribbean...
","Pirates Of The Caribbean is my favorite franchise, and seeing this movie made me realize that Disney has to stop making Pirate movies, the last two movies felt like a side story, it just doesn't feel important.Story: 7/10The story begins with captain Salazar chasing Jack Sparrow, but he fails, and his crew, and his ship gets destroyed, and their cursed, the movie doesn't explain why their cursed which is confusing. Salazar then chases Jack for some odd reason, and Will Turner's son is looking for Poseidon's Trident that removes all curses. Then theirs Carina who is just there to fill in some plot holes, and she has an unnecessary sub plot. The biggest issue with the story is that there is too many sub plots.Characters: 6/10Jack Sparrow: Jack doesn't feel important, he's just there because it's a pirates movie, and because he sets up the bad guy.Salazar: Salazar is a good bad guy, he has an unexplained stupid reason why he hates Jack Sparrow, but he is a believable bad guy.Barbossa: Barbossa is in the story not for the trident, but for Carina's sub plot, he is just so unnecessary.Henry Turner: Henry I would say is the most important character, he's the reason why everyone is going for the Trident besides Jack's reason.Carina: Carina is the navigator, she has a stupid sub plot, and as I said before she's just there for the plot holes.Action: 5/10Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't have that Pirates action, it doesn't have any crazy sword fights like in the first three pirates movies, most of the action is either ships fighting, and running away from things.Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't feel right, Jack isn't the same, there's no epic sword fights, and the characters feel like replacements for the old crew. Now Pirates movies is slowly losing it's magic, Disney should stop making Pirates movies, and focus on other things.",6,0,3,28 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars Digging Their Own Grave...
","Everyone knows that Star Wars movies are always going to get billions in the box office, no matter how bad the movie is. I feel like Star Wars is now a cash grab from the fans, and I am a fan. The last Star Wars movie that was good was Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in my opinion, and it was in 2015; it's now 2018. I saw some mixed reviews on rotten tomatoes between the audience and the critics, as usual. Personally I'm more on the audiences' side, because I really don't care about the visuals, I care about the story; and let me tell you, the story is trash for a Star Wars movie. And I don't know if it was the director or the writers who screwed up the story. I'm now afraid of what Star Wars movies are going to become; probably a big cash grab, hopefully not to the point as Ghostbusters (2016). Star Wars: The Last Jedi is like a tennis ball, bright on the outside, but hollow on the inside.Story: 5/10The story is just unforgivable, and sloppy. The movie was over 2h 30min, maybe if I was entertained the whole way through, I wouldn't mind, but I was bored the whole way through. I felt like nothing was achieved in this story. And I have to mention the plot holes, it was plot hole galore, and I have the writers to blame for that. The story was overly complex too; how could you make a simple story like this, over 2h 30min. The story was about the last rebellion ships escaping escaping the empire, but they can't escape because the empire could track them through hyperspeed. Then Finn and his new girlfriend, Rose team up to find a guy who can disable the hyperspeed tracker, and then the ships escape. The End. The movie could've been 2hs if they just cut out the stupid parts. And if you think about it, Alien: Covenant and Star Wars: The Last Jedi have one thing in common, their both stupid. Like, why is Luke acting so different from the last time we saw him. In the first Star Wars movies, Luke wanted to end the empire, now he doesn't care; did the writers even watch the first movies. Overall, the story took too long to progress, and too many plot holes.Characters: 6/10The characters were almost as bad as the story, sadly. First I want to talk about Luke Skywalker. Why is Luke so depressed? Is it because of Kylo. Why did Luke shut himself from the force? Is it because of Kylo too. Why did luke give up on the rebellion? Is it also about Kylo; I just don't believe Luke would do that just because of Kylo. Now let's talk about the Finn and Rose romance. The romance felt very awkward, as if it was a check mark on a to-do list. I prefer no romance if it's going to be this cheesy. But all the other characters are the same; Poe is still cocky, and Rey is still naive. I now want to talk about Snoke. How could you screw up Snoke so badly; J.J. Abrams made Snoke mysterious and powerful, but the writers' decision was to kill him. There was such a good opportunity to develop Snoke as a character, but they blew it. Now, I have to mention Luke's death. I think Luke was the first Jedi to die from using the force, that right there just shows the stupidity of this movie. Overall, the writers did a good job with not screwing up some characters, but did a good job screwing some up.Action: 8/10The action was the best part about Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The cinematography was amazing the the special effects were good. One of the highlights was at the end, when the rebellion was fighting off the empire. I loved seeing that red dirt fly off into the air, with the white ground, it was really amazing. The one issue I have with the action, was how little there was. There was complete sections with just talking and talking, but nothing really being achieved. When I think of Star Wars, I think of two things, spaceships and lightsaber fights; there was spaceships, but no lightsaber fights. There was only one lightsaber fight, and it wasn't Sith vs Jedi. The thing that bothered me the most was that we didn't see any training whatsoever from Luke. I got so excited when I saw Rey walk up to Luke in the last scene of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I was Like 'I can't wait to see Luke train Rey, it's going to be awesome', but there was no training. Overall, amazing cinematography and effects, but boring sections.Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a decent movie, but a terrible Star Wars movie. I was expecting to be disappointed due to all the mixed reviews, but I didn't think it was this bad. The director and writers messed up pretty badly, in my opinion, but I still have hope for this franchise. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is either quantity or quality, and it's mostly quantity. I've watched all of the Star Wars movies, and I'm a huge fan, but seeing this direction made me fearful for the decisions this franchise is taking. In my opinion, get Abrams and the original crew of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and hopefully they can undue this mess. But this movie does get some things right, like the directing, which really gives this movie a 6 out of 10 for me. So Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a flop for the audience, but a success for the critics and the box office, unfortunately.",6,2,5,8 April 2018
Logan," Best movie in 2017 so far...
","Logan is brilliant, everyone who helped make this movie needs credit, because every little thing about this movie is amazing, well done by the the cast, the directors and the writers.Story: 10/10This movie is about old man Logan, which is about Logan slowly dying because the Adamantium on his bones is poisoning him. While Logan is slowly dying, Professor Xavier meets a little girl, Laura/X-23 who was sent by a doctor who worked at the weapon X program in Mexico, the doctor promised to give Logan money to send Laura to a secret location where all the escaped children from the weapon X program would meet and escape. Surprisingly I didn't find any plot holes, so bravo James Mangold.Characters 10/10Logan: Hugh Jackman did an excellent job, he made Logan look like he was hopeless and broke, and that's what actors are supposed to do to roles like these.Charles Xavier: Patrick Stewart played just as well as Hugh Jackman, he made Charles Xavier look so broken and aged, great job.Laura: Laura is a clone of Logan, she is made up Logan's DNA which means she has the same powers as Logan.Donald Pierce: To be honest Donald Pierce isn't a strong bad guy, he's always hiding behind people and doesn't look that independent, but Boyd Holbrook did have some acting skills.Action 10/10The action in Logan is brutal, it's down to earth bloody and violent, which is exactly why this movie is a 10/10, if this movie didn't have that type of violence it would be an average superhero movie and that's what made Deadpool so great. All of the action in this movie is combat, just Logan and Laura going all out in brutally fashion.This movie is amazing, most movies rely on the action to make the movie a bit more successful, but this movie doesn't need it, the acting and the X-23 story is great, they couldn't have done a better job.",10,5,11,8 June 2017
The King," Good, but Forgettable
","The King is another middle age war story, that's impressing visually, but offers nothing new to the table. These types of movies that Netflix are producing are becoming a lot more common, but Netflix is doing nothing to make them stand out. The King and Outlaw King have different plots, but both feel the same to me. They're alright when it comes to the screenplay, and they both have amazing visuals and war scenes; I've already forgotten most of Outlaw King, and since The King is so similar, I think this movie is just going to slip out of my memory in about a year.The screenplay is a major factor as to why this movie is so forgettable; there's nothing to talk about, it's simply plain. They should've put more into it and make it more unique, even if it makes The King not true to history. The way the characters were written felt really lazy. Why does Hal hate war so much and try to avoid it? Why does Hal not want to be king even though he doesn't want his father in charge? What battle did Falstaff take part in and why is he in such a good friendship with Hal? It's like all the characters were written to feel or be something but without reason. The screenplay in general is lazy, and the runtime is over two hours, I think they could've put in a lot more to improve the characters.The acting was great, but the way Timothée Chalamet acted Hal felt cold and emotionless most of the time. Timothée Chalamet probably had to act Hal in that way, but it does the character no justice. If Hal was acted more in a compassionate human way, then I might've cared if Hal would die or not. In fact, since all the characters are so one dimensional, if they all died, I would wouldn't care at all.The best part are the visuals, battles, and music, which is what holds up The King from getting a rating that is lower than a five. The visuals is what you'd expect from a Netflix film; it has stunning cinematography and excellent filming locations. The action is realistic and I like how they mention the fact that fighting in full knight armor is going to tire you out quickly. The music is my favorite part; it's sad and droopy which adds to the entire mood of the film.The King is pretty much standard in the genre and it's not going to be memorable in the years to come. The acting and aesthetics can only go so far when the screenplay adds no context to any of the characters. The King is not a bad movie, but it's not a necessary watch, just watch it without any high expectations.",6,0,0,10 May 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Amazing...
","This movie is amazing, the characters were well done, the action was superb, and the comedy was hilarious. If you want to spend your money in the best way possible, then watch this movie.Story: 10/10When the Guardians of the Galaxy was doing a job for a species I don't know, Rocket steels important batteries from them, and then the queen wants it back, they chase them until the guardians of the galaxy crash land, and they later meet up with Peter Quill's dad, who is a god, and is evil, and he want's to control the whole galaxy by killing everyone, and everything.Characters: 10/10Peter Quill: Peter Quill is unique, and funny, he's serious and not so serious, and that's why Peter Quill is such a great character.Gamora: Gamora is the most serious in the group, she never laughs, and she always plans ahead, what I just said is not a bad thing, it actually evens out the movie a bit.Drax: Drax has to be the best character in this movie, he's hilarious, he's just so different and weird, and that's why he's so funny.Baby Groot: Groot is just adorable, he's not funny, or has unique qualities, but he's just too cute.Rocket: Rocket is the gadget guy, he uses his gadgets too fight off enemies in the funniest way possible.Yondu: Yondu sadly dies, Yondu was so unique because of his arrow, he doesn't have any interesting characteristics, but I like him.Mantis: Mantis is exactly like Drax, she's not that funny but she's so naive and curious.Ego: Ego is Peter Quill's dad, he's a god, and he wants to control the whole universe, he is a pretty cliché bad guy, and that's the only bad thing about him.Action: 10/10The action is entertaining, there is a lot of CGI, and sometimes that ruins movies, but the CGI was so good that it didn't take away the entertainment, they also included comedy in the action, which makes the movie even more entertaining.Guardians of the Galaxy was great, and i'm not surprised. Marvel is doing a great job, Guardians of the Galaxy is the best movie to watch if you feel sad, happy, or angry. I could just watch this movie over and over.",10,4,8,18 June 2017
The Shape of Water," Good, But Not Picture Of The Year...
","As a huge fan of Guillermo del Toro and the Hellboy universe; I expected to love this movie, and I did. And yes, I did just claim that this movie is related to the Hellboy universe. I thought this movie was going to be a little more Sci-Fi/Fantasy than Drama/Romance. The idea was great; a little strange, but anything can happen in Hollywood nowadays. A lot of critics are praising this movie, and I can see why, but so much fame was put on this movie that some movies didn't get the spotlight it deserved. I think Edgar Wright should've got the Oscar for directing in Baby Driver, but it's just my opinion. I really couldn't find any problems in this movie; and I tried really hard to find just one issue. The pacing is good, the directing is good, the music was good, etc. Honestly The Shape of Water isn't really my cup of tea, but I can Respect it. Story: 10/10The story is unique and different, which is surprising; due to how long the movie business has been going. The idea that a woman falls in love with another creature can be a little strange, but the story was written so well that it kinda makes it normal; which is even more strange. The message of the story is kind of a cliche though; that you can fall in love with anyone or anything, and no one can stop you. This movie is 2 hours long and it's a Drama, so I expected to be bored, but I was always entertained. The storytelling and pacing always kept the movie on it's tracks, and it never leans to much into different subplots. Some of the subplots are great: Some are mysterious, some add to the story, and some make the characters more interesting. I liked how the story reveals itself more and more whenever Elisa finds out more and more. Overall, the story is interesting, the subplots are used perfectly, and the pacing leads to a great climax.Characters: 10/10In order for you to have a good Drama, you have to have good characters, and that's why this movie is a good Drama. The two main characters (Elisa and Amphibian Man) don't talk, so you have to make them likable, but use no dialogue. Elisa's relationship with Amphibian Man improves both characters, and makes them more 'likable'. The antagonist was done well. I enjoyed Michael Shannon's performance a lot, maybe a little too much. He makes his character so frightening and vulnerable at the same time, sometimes having a vulnerable antagonist can improve the character itself. The supporting cast was good too. No one really stood out, but they were likable, like Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Giles plays an important role in the story as Elisa's neighbor and best friend. Giles is a rather interesting character; being a struggling movie poster artist in a changing world. Zelda plays a role similar to Giles; she's Elisa's best friend too. Overall, the Main and supporting characters are well done, and the antagonist is easily hateable.Action: 10/10This movie has colorful settings in a rather dark world. The settings are so interesting and surprisingly colorful. The teal backdrop of this world adds flavour in this dull world. I could never get over how colorful this dark movie is. The direction and production design is out of this world. Some of the sets and scenes are just so interesting to look at, and I really have to respect the production designers. The music is great and eerie which represents the entire feel of the movie. The pacing is great and it really foreshadows the climax. Not much CGI is used, and sometimes in order to make a creature look real; you have to make it CGI, but the costume design was great and they really did make Amphibian Man look real. Overall, there was a lot of time spent on this movie, with great directing, production design, and costume design.Overall, The shape of Water is a great drama. I could tell there was a lot of time spent on this movie, and it paid off. This movie is a 100% 10/10. There was no flaws whatsoever. The story was entertaining and unique, and it delivered a cliche message, but it delivered it greatly. The characters are amazing; they all played a part in this movie. All of the characters are likable, except for the villain, which is a good thing. The directing and production design is top notch. Although The Shape of Water really isn't my type of movie, I still have to respect it for doing such a great job. I strongly recommend The Shape of Water, it's a perfect Drama and a good Fantasy movie.",10,2,8,24 May 2018
Joker," Alright, but Super Overrated
","I desperately wanted to like Joker, as I love slow paced dramas, but man was it underwhelming. Everyone is saying that it was amazing and that it proves that DC can still make good movies, and that made me believe that this movie did everything right, but it didn't. I see all these reviews with a perfect ten, but with few actually good reasons. Joaquin Phoenix's acting, how there's no CGI, it's impactful and emotional. This is truly by far the most disappointing movie I have ever seen, and I believe everyone is just hopping on the bandwagon just because everyone says it's great. I hate to be the downer and sound like a critic, but I am logical and Joker is nowhere near a 10.Most of my favorite movies are slow paced and don't have any action. Movies like Into the Wild, Silence, and The Green Mile don't have any action scenes or anything entertaining, but it tells an emotional story, and that's what makes Joker fail for me. Joker is incredibly slow paced, and being slow paced is not a problem, it's only a problem when it feels like nothing is progressing. Yes, we see that Arthur is progressively losing his mind and transforming into Joker, but it took almost the entire runtime for Arthur to become Joker. The sad part is when Arthur becomes Joker, the movie is at it's best, it's what we came for, and we only got to see around fifteen minutes of Joker. If we had an entire hour of Joker, then the pacing would be perfect and it would be a perfect ten for me.If a movie is going to be slow paced, then your character(s) have to be well written. Making a character sympathetic and/or empathetic can make an amazing character, but Arthur is none of those things. I'm sorry, but a mentally ill clown getting beat up is not going to make me feel sympathetic. Your character has to likable and relatable to first be sympathetic, but Arthur Fleck was just written way too poorly. We know nothing about Arthur except that he wants to be a comedian and that he has a mental illness, and that's not enough to make a compelling character. There has to be well written motives in a character to be good enough for someone to care about them, but I struggled to find any within Arthur. Arthur does have motives, but it takes so long to get to them, and the motives are so clouded and beyond generic. I tried to piece together his plans and all I got was that he wants to be successful and make the world a better place; seriously? This is Joker, try to be more original and creative. If they didn't try to make Joker a sympathetic bad guy, then Joker would've ultimately been a better character.Joker is amazing when it comes to everything but the writing. It has amazing cinematography and atmosphere. The world building is just so perfect and they nailed Gotham. When it comes to that department, Joker did it perfectly. Another good part is the acting, which everyone loves to talk about. Joaquin Phoenix really gave it his all; he made Arthur so believable by the delivery of the lines, the laugh, and most importantly, the body language. What bothers me is that people are giving Joker a perfect score mainly because of Joaquin's performance, and we can all agree that it was amazing, but if that character is poorly written, then the performance is pretty much useless for the story.Joker tries to be something that it's not. They try and be like Shutter Island with the all twists that you should've seen coming, or that it's a character film and how it's an outlook on society, but Joker failed on all of those themes. Making a film that Joker wanted to be is hard; you need a good written story, which is then complemented with good written characters. As I've said, I hate being the downer, as all movies take a lot of hard work, and Joker isn't a bad movie, but it's sadly overrated. The best way that I can describe Joker is that it's style over substance.",5,4,9,8 May 2020
It Chapter Two," It's Alright
","Living up to It (2017) is a difficult task to do, but I really can't fault the creators for It Chapter Two not being as good as the first. It Chapter Two tries too hard to be as good as the first that it copies everything about the first. The camera tricks and chase scenes are literally a copy and paste. They should have done some new things to make It Chapter Two feel more like a sequel and not a remake. The best sequels of all time added something new, like Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.The plot brings back all of the characters, except for Stanley. The plot contains a lot of subplots; a little too much in fact. I'm surprised that they were able to make It Chapter Two 2h 50min, which sounds long, but there was a lot to unravel in this new plot. What It Chapter Two suffers from is the choppy pacing. Luckily, the pacing wasn't too choppy enough to make the film lose it's intensity.What I disliked the most was the characters. None of the new versions of the Loser's Club were likable, except for Mike. It Chapter Two focuses a lot on the characters' quests rather than the actual characters. They gave a bunch of exposition about the Losers after beating Pennywise when they were younger, but little exposition about their new current lives. Because of the lack of exposition given to the current losers, they weren't even comparable to their younger versions from the original. Also, the acting was way worse for some reason. These new actors are adult professionals, but they gave worse performances than their younger counterparts. I hated Bill Hader's performance of Richie, he made Richie seem like a jerk who cracks stupid jokes all the time. Finn Wolfhard did a way better job with the character, he made Richie goofy and likable.The good part was the use of CGI. The CGI created a lot of cool imagery that seemed like illusions. Because of the CGI, it really made It Chapter Two feel like an It movie. There was a little too much CGI being used to create the monsters, but I guess it's just personal preference whether you like it or not. But for some reason, the scenes that were supposed to be intense, didn't really feel that intense.I really liked It (2017), but It Chapter Two really failed on almost every level. None of the characters were likable; almost unlikable. There was too much subplots, even though it was necessary for the story. Because of all of the subplots, there was little exposition given to the new versions of the characters. It Chapter Two also suffers from a subpar screenplay and terrible acting. It Chapter Two isn't a bad movie, but it's really disappointing.",6,0,2,26 May 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Surprisingly good...
","When I saw the trailer for Kong: Skull Island, I hated it, I thought it was going to be the worst movie of the year, but I was wrong, everything was great and the best part was the visual effects.Story: 10/10The movie starts in 1944, when an American fighter pilot crash lands on an island with an enemy Japanese fighter pilot, they then attempt to kill each other, but they later become alleys because they realize if they don't work together their going to die. Fast forward 29 years in 1973 Bill Randa (The person who began the expedition.) convinced a senator to see whats on this undiscovered island, Bill Randa then contacts Preston Packard the colonel, who gets his soldiers to escort them. Bill Randa also hires James Conrad, who is the tracker. Once they get to the island they figure out there is monsters living among this island. They then have 3 days to get to an evacuation point.Characters: 10/10James Conrad: James Conrad is the most important character, which means he has chance of dying is 99%, hes not really an interesting character, but he is cool.Preston Packard: Preston Packard is the colonel, he has a hatred toward Kong because Kong killed half of his men.Mason Weaver: Weaver is a photographer, she's just there to document what happened on the island.Hank Marlow: Marlow is the comedic part of the film, he lived on the island for 28 years and he was the one who crash landed.Bill Randa: Bill is the one who started the expedition, he knew about Kong, he wanted to prove that monsters are real.Houston Brooks: Brooks is just Bill Randa's sidekick, he's not that important.San: San is also not that important, but she is into Houston Brooks.Action 10/10 Kong: Skull Island is very entertaining, mostly from the monster fights, which is the best part of the movie, there is so much creativity in this movie it deserves an award, and the visual effects are amazing and the cinematography is great.Kong: Skull Island is an entertaining movie, it has all the qualities a monster movie should have and that's exactly why it's such a good movie.",10,0,1,11 June 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Had High Expectations...
","Murder on the Orient Express had a great trailer, and it looked promising on paper, but with terrible execution and boring characters, Murder on the Orient Express is an average movie. I was expecting Murder on the Orient Express to be a hardcore murder mystery, and it falls short on that part too. I thought that the movie was going to be in the perspective of Hercule Poirot and it would share Hercule's thoughts throughout the movie, and in some parts it does do that, but at the same time it doesn't. I was so excited for this movie, because of the unique setting and the A-list actors, but this movie shows how a poor script can ruin a movie. I think the biggest flaw is the characters, the motives of the murder was just weak, in my opinion. The only character that does seem one bit interesting was Hercule Poirot.Story: 7/10The story is average at best. But the biggest issue was the execution, I think the execution is a very important part in a murder mystery, but this movie was just all over the place. The issue was that there was too much characters that the movie tried to make a subplot off of. Every passenger killed ratchett, and there was a lot of passengers in the movie. Every passenger had their own motive to kill ratchett, and all of their motives were connected into one thing. Each character had their own mini subplot, and honestly, there all weak. Murder on the Orient Express attempts to juggle all of these subplots briefly. If Murder on the Orient Express removes all of the weaker characters and focuses on the more important ones, than the movie could've had more time to explain the more important subplots. As I said before, I was expecting a hardcore murder mystery, and this movie really doesn't deliver it. I wanted to see Hercule find clue after clue throughout the movie, but he only really does that at the end. Overall, there's too much subplots that causes one dimensional characters that affects the story greatly.Characters: 5/10The characters are the biggest flaws. Due to the lack of recognition to the characters who committed the crime, the cause of the murder was weak. I wanted a strong motive behind the murder, but they did it because of something that Ratchett did in his past to another family. And I have to say, why kill Ratchett on a train, and why do it when there's the best detective in the world on it. They could've done it somewhere a little more logical. The twist at the end was pretty good and I wasn't expecting it, but I wasn't shocked, maybe it was the delivery of the confession that made it weak. The movie thinks it's clever by putting a twist so unique, but that's it's issue, as I said before, I wasn't shocked. The murder of Ratchett was done out of justice from the murderers. I thought the victim was the good guy and the murderer(s) were the bad guys, but it was the other way around, which was clever. I think evil motives are stronger than good motives in a murder mystery movie, and this movie slightly proves my point. Overall, all of the characters are one dimensional, except Hercule Poirot and the motives were on the weaker side.Action: 7/10The cinematography in Murder on the Orient Express was amazing, and I was surprised how cinematic it really was. I do have to give recognition to Kenneth Branagh for acting as a main character and directing as well. The movie is very slow, and it's almost hitting 2 hours long. The trailer made it look a bit more action packed, but there was only one chase scene. The visuals are very well done, using all sorts of styles, which makes the cinematography look even more better. I do have to mention that the movie could have been shorter. Some scenes just took too long, and it just makes the movie feel so much more boring. Overall, this movie proves that sometimes it doesn't matter how well a movie was filmed, basically it's style over substance.Murder on the Orient Express tries to do too many things all at once. It focuses on a murder, but with too many characters and subplots, Murder on the Orient Express goes all over the place. If Murder on the Orient Express focused on one primary goal, then this movie could have been better. Murder on the Orient Express was already nailing it's own coffin when they decided that all the passengers committed the crime. And yes, it's based off the book, but it wouldn't hurt to cut some parts in the movie that were irrelevant. I recommend Murder on the Orient Express to the fans who read the book or watched the original, but not for people who want to have a good time and enjoy a movie.",6,1,4,16 February 2018
Wonder Woman," DC slightly improving...
","Personally, I'm not really a fan of DC, I do watch DC movies, but Marvel is my favorite, this review may be a bit bias, it could be a 8/10 for some people, but for me it's a 7/10.Story: 7/10The movie starts off with Diana (Wonder Woman) as a child, and you watch her grow up to an adult. She was sculpted out of clay by her mother, and she is an Amazonian warrior, she later sees Steve Trevor crash land in the ocean, and she saves him from drowning, the Amazonian warriors find him and question him. Wonder Woman leaves with Steve Trevor to fight in world war 2, the only reason why she fought was because she wanted to kill Ares. The story is very cliché, and there is some bits that is kind of stupid or unnecessary.Characters: 9/10Diana: Diana is an amazonian warrior and is the daughter of the queen, I think she is a good character because of how naive she is, and Gal Gadot does a fantastic job.Steve Trevor: Steve is pretty cliché, he's the average hero of any other movie, but Chris Pine plays the role amazingly.Ludendorff: Ludendorff is one of many bad guys, he's the weakest of the three, he's so average it's painful.Ares: Ares is the god of war, i'm guessing he can shape shift and have telekinesis powers, which I don't think Ares has those abilities, but it's a fantasy movie, so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt.Sameer: Sameer isn't really crucial to the story, he's just there to be a member of the team.Dr. Maru: Dr. Maru is a strong bad guy even though she's not that important, she is interesting and unique.Action: 9/10The movie takes a while to get to the action, but when it does, it's entertaining, the movie has great gun fights, and the final fight was amazing, one of the best boss fight iv'e seen in a while. There are some points in the movie when the physics are a bit off, which kind of ruins the action, but overall good action.Wonder is a good movie, recently DC has been doing poorly in their movies, but now we have a movie that is actually good. I recommend this movie to anyone, it's a solid entertaining superhero movie.",7,3,9,16 June 2017
Marriage Story," Hilarious, Realistic, and Sad
","Marriage Story focuses on a story that isn't used too much in Hollywood. It's a story about a husband and a wife who separate while fighting for custody for their child. I didn't know much about Marriage Story, and just by the title I thought it would be a romantic drama, but it was far from it. Marriage Story talks about a situation that is far too common, and it's told very realistically which makes this film extremely relatable for most adults.Although Marriage Story is a long movie, you never get bored; you're entertained in a weird way. A major pro that makes Marriage Story so realistic is the screenplay. Marriage Story touches on everything about divorces, the toxic lawyers, the sadness, the arguments, and the awkwardness. One thing that surprised me was how humorous Marriage Story is. There are these insane arguments within the movie, but somehow there's comedy that actually makes you laugh. With all these different emotions happening within two hours, Marriage Story becomes an emotional roller coaster.The acting was done way too well; the crying is what made the movie feel real. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson prove that they can act their heart out in Marriage Story. They both portray these emotions that are so hard to act out, like awkwardness and anger. Noah Baumbach did a great job with developing the characters, making them like real people, with flaws and weaknesses that both destroy and maintain a marriage.Marriage Story is film that I strongly recommend. It pulls all the emotions in the book, and it plays with those emotions constantly throughout the runtime. The screenplay was excellent by creating these characters that you would only meet in real life. The dialogue and acting also improved the viewing experience. So go ahead and enjoy Marriage Story, it's definitely an experience that's worthy having.",8,1,1,11 May 2020
Black Panther," A Unique Marvel Movie...
","Black Panther in my opinion, is the most unique and different Marvel movie made so far. Many Marvel movies are copy and pastes of each other, and yes this movie does have some elements that were copied from other Marvel movies, but Black Panther made it its own thing. This movie has unique characters and a unique setting. Black Panther does have some issues though, like the overkill comedy and the iffy CGI. Although there are few issues with the movie, all of the issues are very noticeable and are not easy to ignore. Some scenes the CGI was very noticeable. There was just too much CGI used, I would like a little more practical effects. The comedy was just too much, I don't want Marvel to keep putting this type of comedy in their movies. A little comedy is good, but too much can ruin a movie.Story: 9/10There was only one problem with the story, but everything else was on point. The climax was weak in my opinion. There was so much hype in the movie for the climax, but the climax was disappointing. When the climax happened, the CGI was very noticeable and looked fake at times, and when T'Challa and Killmonger fought, all I saw was CGI. There was no pacing issues, which was shocking, because the movie is over 2 hours long. There was some bits that made me yawn, but the movie quickly got to the action before it got a little too boring. Wakanda is the setting of the movie, and I'm happy the way it turned out. Wakanda has a very futuristic style, which makes it a good and unique setting. I like what's at risk in the movie. Some movies give that 'Save the world, it depends on you', but this movie doesn't fall for that. If T'Challa doesn't stop Killmonger, then the world could be at risk, due to the rare ore Wakanda has that can change the world, because of how powerful it is. Killmonger's plan is to share the ore and basically expose Wakanda, which could lead to a giant war that can end humanity on Earth. Overall, the story is strong, with real stakes at risk and great pacing, but a horrible climax.Characters: 10/10The antagonist, Killmonger is a very strong character. Killmonger has realistic and emotional motives, which really isn't evil motives, but at the same time, it could end the world. Many villains in movies are bad guys because they're evil, but the villain Killmonger doesn't have that common issue. T'Challa is another good character. He's a diverse character, not only suffering from Killmonger, but the guilt of his father's death. The supporting cast is well done. Each actor/actress did a great job on their character. The acting was also great, Michael B. Jordan stole the show for me, even though he was barely in the movie. Michael B. Jordan made his character (Killmonger) a believable antagonist, by showing a dark and a light side of Killmonger, which in my opinion makes a good villain. Overall, all the characters had their own role in the movie. The protagonist and the antagonist have their own inner conflict, which makes them diverse characters.Action: 7/10The action was the weakest part of Black Panther. Both the CGI and comedy affected the movie negatively. The CGI was iffy at some parts, for example the climax. The climax was a mess, in my opinion. The CGI wasn't bad, but from a Marvel movie, I expected more. The comedy was just overkill to me, although some parts were funny and made me laugh, but it's just too much. I think Marvel is too focused on comedy at the moment. The visual effects were really well done though. I liked the visuals and the colors used. Black Panther is on the same level as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is a high level to set. Overall, Black Panther had a variety of colors and visuals that made Black Panther look amazing, but in some instances, the CGI looks very bad for a Marvel movie, and the comedy was just a little too much.Black Panther was overall a good movie. There was some issues that really lowered the score for me, but with great directing and awesome action scenes, like at the beginning. This movie does everything right, to the characters and to the story. If Black Panther had a little more time to fix things up and look at the script, then Black Panther could've got a 10/10 from me. Black Panther earns it's place as a good Marvel movie. I recommend Black Panther to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, then Black Panther would be a good option.",8,2,12,18 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Too many plot holes.
","I watched Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice a couple of weeks ago, but I was too busy, sorry. But I'm back, let's begin. It shows Bruce Wayne running in a forest, I'm not sure why, I think he was running from his parents funeral, he then falls into a tunnel, and then bats lift him up.A couple minutes later, it shows Lois interviewing A terrorist, but it all fails, and it ends up Lois as hostage and it turns out Superman helps her, I will not tell you what happened, it's too complicate. Then an African women accuses superman that he killed everyone (He didn't) So people are starting to question him and put him to court. They made it very unclear why Batman (Bruce Wayne) hates superman, possibly because many people died in the battle with Zod.half an hour later the Military finds Kryptonite and Lex Luther wants it, eventually he gets it, but not for long, because Batman steals it. Batman Trains to fight Superman, then later he figures out who Wonder Women is. Superman goes to court it then blows up because of a bomb (sorry if the placing is wrong I haven't watched the movie in a long time) Lex Luther creating a creature (DoomsDay)Finally batman and Superman fight but superman does want to kill batman he was trying to say he wasn't the bad guy and that Lex has he mother (Martha Kent) So then they team up, batman kills some agents, but wasn't Batman supposed to not kill, then he rescues Martha. Superman on the other hand tries to stop Lex but it was too late, and DoomsDay was born, they fight DoomsDay until Wonder women comes, they then kill doomsday SPOILER-AlERT superman dies in the most dramatic way possible.After all that was the funeral of superman and at the last frames it showed dirt rising from the coffin, I believe he's not died.In conclusion the movie is 3 hours long, lots of plot holes and a horrible ending. it's an average movie, 5/10.Thank you.",5,1,2,12 August 2016
Jojo Rabbit," What Comedy Should Be at Heart
","Jojo Rabbit is a comedy that focuses on some serious topics, those topics being World War 2 and Adolf Hitler. Having a comedy that is based on Nazis and their point of views may be controversial, but I think that it's important to try to bring out laughter or happiness to such a serious topic. My beliefs are that you can make comedy out of anything, no matter how serious or controversial it is. Jojo Rabbit masters the comedy, as I think that silly comedy is the right way to go for something like this. Silly comedy can come off stupid and/or childish, but Jojo rabbit's comedy can make anyone laugh (only if the viewer have a sense of humor).The plot itself is rather original in my opinion; a young manipulated Nazi boy who meets a Jewish girl hiding in his house who then form a unique relationship. The plot can be done as a drama, but I think it's best done as a comedy, as there's so much more opportunities you can do. Although this movie is really goofy, it has extremely mature themes, like brainwashing, death of a loved one, and hate. The scene of Jojo realizing that is mother is dead is extremely sad, and this theme is super important as it's a wake up call that this is Nazi Germany after all. Jojo rabbit also focuses on some very important parts in World War 2 history that not a lot of movies touch on. For example, the manipulation of young children in Nazi Germany and propaganda. So although Saving Private Ryan is a history lesson, Jojo Rabbit equally brings something new to the table.Adolf Hitler in this movie is extremely well done because this isn't actually Adolf Hitler, but it's Adolf Hitler portrayed in the mind of a kid. So even though Adolf Hitler probably isn't a funny guy in real life, this version is hilarious. Rebel Wilson, Taika Waititi, and Sam Rockwell are the main source of comedy in this movie, and the delivery of the lines were done so well, and I think that there should be more appreciation to the actors. Roman Griffin Davis did a great job too; when children cry in movies, it feels fake and forced, but Roman Griffin Davis completely sold it. The characters and comedy were written so well in Jojo Rabbit that Taika Waititi is already in the Hall of Fame for comedy in my eyes. He played as Korg in Thor: Ragnarok and Adolf Hitler in Jojo Rabbit, so he definitely has plenty of potential.Jojo Rabbit is a must watch if you enjoy comedy at the slightest bit. Jojo Rabbit is what comedy should be; it should make you laugh and it should make you cry while telling an amazing story. At first I thought Jojo Rabbit was going to be stupid by the looks of it, but I'm so glad I've seen it, as it truly made my day.",9,0,3,7 May 2020
Life," Alien + Gravity= Life...
","Life is very average, and predictable, and it has all the horror clichés in the books, you already now the ending, and who's going to die.Story: 6/10A crew is rendezvousing with a pod that contains samples, and microscopic life from mars. Once they woken up the alien from the pod, it starts to grow rapidly, and they called it Calvin, they start testing the creature once it got much bigger. Calvin escapes and kills one person at it, it feeds off that one person, and grows even faster. The crew starts dying fast and they need to find a way to kill Calvin. Then everyone dies except for David, and Miranda, they had a plan to blast Calvin in a pod with David and he'll manually direct it into space, and Miranda will go in the other pod back to Earth, but plot twist Calvin didn't allow David to override it, and Miranda got stuck in space, and Calvin will end the human race. The ending is so predictable, and cliché.Characters: 6/10Sho Murakami: Sho is one of the most cliché character in the movie, his cliché is that he's the good guy, but then tries to escape, and he doesn't care about his crew, and abandoning his crew.Rory Adams: Rory is the hotshot confident guy, and surprisingly he dies first, because he's Ryan Reynolds, and actors like that don't die first.Miranda North: Miranda is the character you would expect to survive, but no, she dies at the end, which I like because I didn't expect her to die.David Jordan: I like David, he's unique, he hates it on earth because of the people living on it, he's also setting a record for the longest time in space.Action: 8/10The action is good, mostly because of the great CGI. I really liked the way they made the alien look, I doesn't have any arms, and legs, it's what alien life would look like. They also did a great job simulating what it would be like in space, which is difficult to do well.Life had a lot of promise, but it has too much clichés. This movie could have been better if they did something different, and never seen before on the big screen.",6,0,1,10 September 2017
Deadpool," Enjoyed it.
","I enjoyed the movie allot. Great fight scenes, though the scenes are very gore and not a good family movie to watch with kids. The humor is hilarious and enjoyed all the jokes. I liked how they added a couple of x- men, but not enough and when I saw the x-men school, it was lonely, they should have added more. The movies was only an hour and a half long, and I wished it was two hours long. I loved when they showed the funny names at the beginning, and it's true as well. At some parts was a bit confusing, and made you feel like why would you put this scene? Overall it's a good, funny movie that you should watch with your friends.",9,1,8,2 April 2016
Green Book," A Great Portrayal of True Friendship
","Without a doubt, Green Book deserved Best Picture of 2019. Everything about Green Book is perfect, and I have no complaints about the movie. The film just gives out a positive vibe, through beginning to end; even during the darker times in the movie, because the darkest moments of the movie is when both characters evolve into better human beings.We follow Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley tour around the south of America. We learn how it was a struggle for black men in the south during the early 60s. The plot is simple, and it always stays on its tracks. None of the scenes felt too short or too long, creating a consistent pace. Every scene in Green Book was about character development, and how both Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley slowly start respecting each other.The cinematography was hands down amazing, and I think Green Book should have at least won an Oscar nomination for best cinematography. The film had a very colorful look to it, teal being a very prominent color. The atmosphere Green Book created had such a warm feel, which made the movie so much more pleasant to watch.Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both great actors, and they give solid performances. In my opinion, the acting was not ground breaking, but it's still on a A+ level. I'm more impressed with the supporting cast than Vigo Mortensen, as they give more 'Italian' performance than VigoEverything about Green Book fell right in place like a jigsaw puzzle. The film had such a unique mood to it, which was created perfectly by the cinematography and atmosphere. Very few movies can compete with Green book when it comes to character development. Green Book is by far the best movie of 2018, if not the best movie in the past five years.",10,1,3,8 September 2019
Annihilation," Loved Every Bit...
","I see a lot of reviews talking about how it's 'Confusing' and 'It made no sense'. I mean come on! It's supposed to make no sense. It's supposed to be confusing. The reason why it made no 'Sense' is because something from another world is changing and fusing DNA; it's a very simple story (For people who pay attention). The argument, 'Confusing' is more reasonable than 'Not making sense'. This movie is meant to be 'Confusing', and it's meant to make you think, and I respect that direction, because sometimes it's good to have an unexplained ending. I also see a lot of 'Boring' in other reviews, and I get it, some people want to see action, but I loved the pacing, and I'll explain later. This movie really does appeal to a certain type of audience; people who love Sci-Fis, Thrillers and a bit of Horror and people who have patience, as this movie does have a slow start. Except from a few little issues, this movie is a really good Sci-Fi.Story: 9/10I like how the story doesn't explain things, and you learn more and more when the characters are learning more. But some subplots aren't explained good enough though, like how Lena is cheating on her husband. That subplot is more important then you would think, as it is the cause of Lena's husband (Kane) to leave and join this mission. The pacing affects the cheating subplot, so you really have to pay attention to what's going on. This is one of those movies that explains what happened in the past as the story is progressing, and I think that's why people are so confused. I liked how the movie doesn't go into detain about the alien, or the hole in the lighthouse, and we really don't know anything about everything. One of the biggest issues I have is at the very last scene, where we see Lena's eyes glow, if there was atleast five minutes more to explain just a little more then I guess it would be okay. Now the Shimmer. The idea that all the cells are changing and developing something new is one of the most original ideas I've seen in a long time. Seeing some of the characters change physically and mentally because of the Shimmer is really interesting. Overall, the story is creative. Sometimes a little too confusing, but it's balanced. But one of the subplots could've been done better.Characters: 7/10The story really doesn't focus on the supporting characters, and because of that, the characters are weak. All of the characters are explained of why they joined this mission, but not explained into detail. I already forgot most of the characters' names and why they joined, that just goes to show how poor the character development is. I think the characters are so weak is because the characters are used to show the dangers of the Shimmer's environment. Like how Josie was used to show how the mutations affect her, Sheppard and Anya were used to show the dangers of the mutated animals, and Dr. Ventress was used to show the power of the alien. I do think the romance between Lena and Kane was weak, we mostly see them in the subplots rather than the present. Overall, the characters are below average, and the romance is weak, but I liked how the deaths of the characters show how dangerous the Shimmer is.Action: 9/10This movie is a mix of Sci-Fi, Thriller and Horror, which is common in Hollywood, but the direction this movie took really makes it unique. As I said before, the Shimmer is one of the most original ideas that has come out in a long time. Using that idea and putting it into a Horror is a great idea. Most Horror movies nowadays rely on jumpscares to startle you, but this has no jumpscares at all, and it's even more scary because of that. One scene, when a bear is in a room walking around beside the tied up crew members, the bear makes a noise. That noise is the voice of Sheppard, how died by the bear. We hear her screams of pain through this mutilated bear. That scene was so intense and frightening that it made me cringe the whole time. The visuals are great, and everyone should atleast agree on that. The pacing is also great, it really keeps me excited for what's happening next. There's that mystery of what could possibly come next. I did hope to see more monsters though, if there was more monsters, then that would've been the icing on the cake. Overall, this is a scary movie (With no jumpscares), the visuals and directing is great and the pacing always caries a suspense.Overall, Annihilation has to be one of the best horror movies of 2018. And I know people are going to say; 'it's not a Horror movie.', but it did make me cringe, because of how scary it is. For me, everything is perfect, except for some little issues. I loved the suspense and how this movie never goes into detail about certain topics. I really do recommend Annihilation. You could watch it on Netflex in some countries, but in others you can't, but if you have the time, try watching Annihilation.",8,2,4,29 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Incredibly Stupid...
","I'm a huge Alien fan, and I love the mystery, and lore of the Xneomorph specie, but this movie messes it all up, and the terrible cliffhanger ending.Story: 4/10A crew, and over 2000 colonists are going to a planet to colonize, but they found a rogue transmission on a near planet that is capable of life, so they went to investigate, and completely forget about their original plan, which is completely ridiculous, so once they found the source, which is from the ship from Prometheus, they then went back to their ship, but two crew members attracted a virus that releases a Protomorph, one Protomorph dies, but the other doesn't and kills most of their crew. Then they meet David from Prometheus who (SPOILER) turned evil, and he created the Xneomorph, and he also went on board the Covenant ship as David, and that's it, the ending is so bad, and cliffhanger. The story is very confusing if you didn't watch Prometheus, and I didn't watch it.Characters: 3/10David: David turned evil, and his goal is to create the perfect organism which is the Xneomorph, and he completes that goal in the most stupid way possible.Walter: Walter is the android of the covenant, he doesn't do much, but fail at protecting his crew.Daniels: Daniels is like a knock-off version of Ripley, and she's so boring, she doesn't do much, but kill the Xneomorph at the end.Oram: Oram is the reason why they got in this situation, he is like Daniels, but he played a bigger part in the story.Tennessee: Tennessee is one of the more better characters, he's likable, and he has a cool hat. I would like it more if he had more screen time.Action: 8/10The action is what's holding this movie up, it's bloody, and violent. The Sound affects, music, and visuals are amazing, by far this movie has the best visuals of the year, I just wish that I saw a battle between the Xneomorph, and the Protomorph, that would be the best part of the movie.This movie has great visuals, sound affects, and music, but a terrible, and stupid story, and bland characters, and that's why I'm going to give this movie a 5/10.",5,1,4,3 September 2017
