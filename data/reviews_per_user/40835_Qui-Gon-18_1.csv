Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is what I think after seeing the film twice, and reading the book
","When I went to see the movie, I was excited beyond description.  I totally loved it. The characters were unique, and each had depth, which made the movie even more enjoyable.  The special effects were perfect, I was just amazed at the clarity and detail of all the computer animated stuff.  And the sounds were nice and loud, putting you right in the middle of all the explosions, and especially the podrace.  I only had one problem, which was the fact that a few of the events weren't explained very well, but after reading the book, I understand everything.",10,1,2,9 June 1999
