Ali," a mess of a movie
","Ali is, alas, a mess of a movie, thanks to Michael Mann's self-indulgence and lack of focus.  I have admired his previous work, which makes his utter incompetence here so surprising.  Mann refuses to impose any narrative structure onto Ali's life story, so we get scenes that go nowhere, characters whose significance in Ali's life appears to be non-existant, and some scenes that don't have anything to do with Ali at all.  Some scenes are extended beyong tedium, such as a sequence of Ali doing roadwork in preparation for the Rumble in the Jungle.The film does feature fine performances from Will Smith (who captures a young Ali's bravado), Mario Van Peebles (who deserved an Oscar nomination as Malcolm X), Jamie Foxx, Mykaleti Williamson and Ron Silver.  Jon Voight did get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Howard Cosell, but he merely does a competent impersonation and besides, Cosell was too small a player in Ali' life and in this film to warrent it.I'm not saying I wanted an old fashioned bio-pic like The Life of Emile Zola or The Babe Ruth Story, where reality is chucked in favor of a cliche riddled plot; but as a writer/director Mann had to make decisions about what to focus on and what to leave out, and he didn't make those decisions.  I give it a 4 out of 10.",4,0,0,24 May 2002
Unbreakable," eerie and thought-provoking
","Unbreakable is a worthy follow up to Sixth Sense--it won't gross as much, obviously, but it's much better than Blair Witch II.  Shaymalan does a good job of establishing an eerie mood, and rewards your paying attention through the slow parts with a twist ending that should have you slapping your forehead saying, 'Of course!'  I figured out the twist in Sixth Sense early (honest!) but this one fooled me.  Willis is a little too low key, but still gives a solid performance.  Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as always.  I give it an 8, and look forward to Shaymalan's next film.",8,1,1,3 December 2000
Fight Club," Best Plot Twist of the year!
","Fight Club is one of the strangest films I have ever seen, with a plot twist more surprising and presaged better than the twists in Sixth Sense or Magnolia.  I'm not sure it all makes sense, but with such imaginative direction and writing, and solid acting by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who cares?  With so many formula films, it's unusual to be honestly surprised by a movie, and Fight Club surprised me more than any film I can remember. It's not for the squeamish, and it runs a little too long (ever since Titanic no major filmmaker brings in a final cut under 2 1/2 hours), but it is a roller coaster ride with no safety bar.",Null,0,1,16 January 2000
Chicken Run," Pure imagination
","Chicken Run is an excellent transfer of the brilliance of the Wallace and Gromit shorts to a feature length film.  The technique is incredible; the faces of the 'clay' chickens are more expressive than 90% of all actors. The vocal work is also expressive, and the chickens develop distinct personalities (it's a little distracting that they have lips and teeth, but who cares?).  The writing should appeal to adults, with references to Indiana Jones, Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, among others; kids should love the intricate visuals and pure imagination of the screenplay.  This is truly a film for all ages.",9,0,0,25 June 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Good, but not typical Burton
","I had an odd reaction to Sleepy Hollow: the acting, particularly by Johnny Depp, was excellent; the plot was much more clever than the original story; and Burton produces some eerie moments and the movie looks uniformly dreamy.  But . . . for some reason it all left me unaffected.  I would give the film a 'thumbs up' and recommend it, but maybe I've come to expect more from the man who created Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. Maybe the plot was a little TOO clever, too convoluted to quite buy into. Maybe the scenes of the Horseman doing his thing were a little too realistic and unimaginative.  I admired the film's craft, but the whole thing failed to connect on an emotional level.",6,0,0,28 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas needs a writer
","Episode II can only appeal to children with Attention Deficit Disorder; anyone with an attention span of more than two minutes will find much of the action tedious and confusing.  The love scene between Padme and Anakin is nothing but a collection of trite cliches,and most of the dialogue is pedestrian (the only line with any emotion is Samuel L. Jackson's 'This party's over!' which one suspects was his suggestion).  The first Star wars sequel, Empire Strikes Back, was written by an excellent writer, Lawrence Kasdan; Lucas needs to work with a better co-writer for the (unfortunately) inevitable Episode III.Even the plot, where Lucas usually excels, feels creaky and forced.  There is a major plot point that makes no sense and is never explained (okay, maybe the explanation comes in III), and most of the plot developments are fairly random.  The amount of time that has passed since Episode I is in question; Anakin seems to have aged ten years, Amidala not at all, and Anakin has a younger half-brother (born since Episode I) who looks about 20.Ewen McGregor is great as Obi-wan, evoking memories of Alec Guiness.  Hayden Christiansen just pouts a lot; Portman is out of her depth but looks scrumptious.Lucas will make a ton of money of course, but the fact that this will be the first Star Wars film NOT to end the year at #1 (thanks, Spidey) will hopefully drive him to improve Episode III.  Or maybe he just wants to film his vision and make more money, quality be darned.I rate this film at 3 out of 10.",3,0,0,6 July 2002
Cast Away," Great acting, dopey script
","Cast Away is sure to nab another Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks, and in a relatively weak year for film he may just win his third.  He would deserve it, and not just for his physical transformation.  Any other actor in the world would get laughs if they recited the dopey dialogue (or monologue, I guess, since he's alone on that island).  I can't imagine Ralph Finnes being taken seriously if he proclaimed 'I have made . . .fire!' but Hanks somehow pulls it off.You may be aware that the studio moronically gives away the ending in the trailers and commercials--it is inexcusable and blunts much of the emotion of the situation.  This is a solid film with a fascinating second and third acts, but a flat-footed fourth act.  They paint themselves into a corner with no satisfactory ending, and then fail to come up with a satisfactory conclusion.  But with Hanks' acting and Zemeckis' eye-popping direction, this film is very satisfying.",7,0,0,28 December 2000
Being John Malkovich," pure imagination
","This is probably the most imaginative film to come out since Fargo.  It reminded me of a live action Wallace and Grommit cartoon, which also seem blissfully unfettered by reality when constructing a story line.  Cusak has always been one of my favorite actors, and he is great here.  Cameron Diaz once again proves she's more than just a pretty face (and great body and terrific legs), and, well John Malkovich deserves a Supporting Actor nomination.  The only annoying thing is that Catherine Keener is one of those actresses who doesn't mind nude scenes as long as she's not exactly naked, so you have a couple of Austin Power type scenes where she's covered by absurdly strategically placed sheets or pillows.  But that's quibbling--if you like movies that aren't made by a cookie cutter, you'll love this film.",9,0,0,11 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," very good, but still chop socky
","I suppose I am suffering from over-inflated expectations--I am disappointed because I consider Crouching Tiger (or is it Crouching Dragon?) only the second best film I've seen this year (let's here it for Wonder Boys!).  With all the hype I expected something better than a real good chop socky film.    As a huge fan of Jackie Chan, I have long been frustrated with the conventions of the Hong Kong cinema, namely that the script need not make sense, the direction can plod except for action scenes, and the main character must have the same first name as the actor playing him.  Finally here is a script for a Hong Kong film that features interesting characters behaving rationally.  Michelle Yeoh is marvelous, and Chow Yun fat seems much more at ease here than in his English language pictures.   But--I've seen cheaply make chop socky films where characters seemingly flew, and it looked silly.  Here, they use state of the art effects and . .. it still looks silly.  It's better, but it's still just a wee but over the top.  The cinematography is luscious, and the score is a masterpiece, and this is a really good movie--just not the best film of the year. Sorry.",8,0,0,28 December 2000
Moulin Rouge!," where's the love?
","I went into the theater prepared to love Moulin Rounge, as I had been terribly impressed with Luhrman's last roller coaster, Romeo + Juliet. However, there the visual pyrotechnics had been at the disposal of the greatest love story ever told; the plot here is, well, NOT the greatest love story ever told.  The whole things starts off too silly to take seriously, Satine falls for Christian merely because the script requires it (who wouldn't fall in love with Nicole Kidman?), and the fact the story is being told in flashback destroys all tension as to what will happen.  McGregor and Kidman are fine both as actors and singers, but the words spewing out of their mouths are such a bewildering purree of pop culture references the mind can't process everything.   I recommend the film for Luhrman's dazzling visuals and the fine work by the actors (particularly Jim Broadbent, who should get an Oscar nomination), but the writing keeps it from being as good as it could have been.  My rating is a 6 (actually, it's close to a 7 but since it is averaging over 8 I feel I need to knock it down a notch).",6,0,1,10 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," Dull, plodding, pedantic
","This film makes no sense.  I could stop my review there, but seeing as this film is currently taking up space in the top 250 that would be better used by Weekend at Bernie's, let me repeat--there is absolutely no linear narrative thread running through the course of this motion picture.  David Lynch is too busy filming things out of focus to bother with thinking up a 'plot.' I suppose that would be fine in something interesting happened while we were being taken on this non-linear trip, but aside from a couple of lesbian scenes featuring two very good looking women, nothing remotely interesting happens in well over two hours.  Despite its excessively long running length, the film shows signs of major editing--for example, Robert Forster gets star billing and shows up in one scene for about 30 seconds.The acting isn't bad, but since it all takes place in an emotional void it is impossible to tell what the actors are supposed to be conveying most of the time.  Is the director laid-back?  too frighten for words?  Really Cool? Stoned?  Planning a counter-move?  Who can tell if this is good acting or not?I would love to know if anyone out there who rated this film higher than a five could tell me the plot.  I sort of doubt it.",3,0,2,24 November 2001
The Insider," Absorbing but long
","Let me say at the start that The Insider is an excellent movie, with great performances by Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer.  And director Michael Mann does his best to make the experience as cinematic as possible.  That said, this is not material that cries out for film treatment.  Hand-held camera can only distract for so long that, in one scene, we're watching a guy make up his mind for five minutes.  At over 2 1/2 hours its presence begins to wear thin after a while.  But that's only because there's too much of a good thing; sometimes less is more.",7,1,1,11 November 1999
The Mummy Returns," less sense of fun than original
","What I liked the most about the original Mummy was it's sense of how absurd it was--the fate of the world really wasn't at stake, it was all just an excuse for some fun.  That sense is missing from the sequel, where the filmmakers seem to think we will take it seriously if the world is threatened with apocalypse in 1933 (I suspect that if the world had been overrun by Annubis warriors in 1933 I would have read about it in my history books).   What I also find odd is that several scenes that were featured prominently in a 'The making of' special on AMC were noticibly absent from the final film.  That indicates the film may have suffered from some last minute script/editing changes.  The special effects in the finale are also not that special, indicating last minute tinkering.  The Mummy Returns is competently done, but give me another Indiana Jones installment.",5,0,0,10 May 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Ponderous, pretentious and ultimately silly
","I find it hard to believe that anyone could take such a silly film seriously.  The psychology behind what initiates the plot is not handled credibly, the plot twists that develop via the now-famous orgy sequence are laughable (as is the entire orgy itself--where did Kubrick come up with this stuff, 50's porno flicks?) and the ultimate denouement irrational and unfulfilling.  Kidman is reduced to a couple of good scenes but little screen time (and almost no screen time when she isn't on display); Cruise just walks around looking perplexed.  Of course it LOOKS great; it was shot by Stanley Kubrick.  But after so many significant films, it's sad he ends his career with this minor piece of fluff.  What were Cruise and Kidman thinking when they agreed to do it?",5,0,0,1 August 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Huh?
","Of course The Matrix Reloaded looks great--given the time and expense how could it not?  But I was not that involved in the film, even as much as I was for X Men 2.  The 'rules' for operating in The Matrix are unclear--why can Neo fly very, very fast but not simply teleport?  Why is no one surprised that he can stop bullets in mid-air?  Maybe there are explanations, but it's not worth it.  The actors are all good, especially Carrie Anne Moss, but Fishburne is just doing a one-note performance and Jada Pinckett Smith is underused.  Interesting, fun to watch, but hardly memorable.",6,0,0,22 May 2003
A Hard Day's Night," One of the best and most influential films ever
","A Hard Day's Night is quite simply a masterpiece--it so thoroughly re-wrote the rulebook on filmmaking that it is impossible to appreciate today how many rules it broke.  Richard Lester's direction is so innovative that 35 years later MTV probably still hasn't finished ripping him off.  Alun Owens script is a wonder--so seemingly natural that it is easy to forget this isn't a documentary (at least enough people noticed there was a script to nominate it for an Oscar).  And as for the acting--trained actors couldn't have portrayed the Fab Four better.  Each of their personalities is captured perfectly, especially John's (when George asks why he was leaving the room, John replies, 'He told us to stay here, didn't he?'Then there's the music--glorious early Beatles!!  Some of the best music ever made.  This is on my short, short list of best films ever made.",10,11,16,28 December 2000
Sweet and Lowdown," Allen misses again
","Once again Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself.  Here we have a mock documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 30's (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about a low-life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes being a genius absolves him from being a jerk (ditto).  Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; yes, I was a jerk, but I'm a genius so you gotta love me.   Allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years; the fine but overpraised Bullets over Broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery.  His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to edgy yet experimental (Husbands and Wives), to pure drek (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry).  His films no longer even try to have a narrative arc, and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing, not funny.  After Deconstructing Harry I stopped seeing his films in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I may stop renting them as well.",4,4,7,6 August 2000
Amélie," clever but disjointed
","Amelie is a film that features splashes of cleverness but doesn't have enough structure to sustain it.  The lead actress is very appealing, with a large eye-to-skull ratio for the suitable gamin look, but often she merely looks blankly and lets the audience impose their feelings onto her performance.  Visually, the film is a treat, with one eye-popping visual after another.  But what does it all mean?  I don't know. It's a very good film, but top 20 all time?  It wasn't one of the 20 best films the year it was released.",7,2,5,3 April 2003
The Matrix," For SF fans only
","The Matrix is visually stunning (not just the FX, but also wonderful direction and camerawork and superb fight choreography) but should appeal only to hard core SF fans.  It has familiar plot elements taken from TRON, Terminator 2 and several other SF stories, but it is so innovative in its visuals you don't mind (in fact, the story needs to be familiar to make sense of it).  Keanu is at his best looking slack-jawed and going, 'Whoa!' It lacks the pace of T-2, but the ending is dynamite (literally).",8,0,0,9 April 1999
Gladiator," paint by numbers
","Gladiator wants to be rousing entertainment, but it's like a talented painter doing a paint-by-number kit and trying really hard not to go outside the lines.  It was such a faithful retelling of standard, cliche gladiator movies that I could mouth most lines before they were uttered.  It's probably the most faithful remake in history except for Psycho.    Which is not to say it doesn't manage some entertainment value.  Russell Crowe is well cast, Joaquin Phoenix surprised me with his range (by showing he had some), and Connie Nelson gave a subtle performance when I would have expected something more heavy-handed.  But the action sequences are choppily edited and filmed through a haze, making it hard to tell whose blood it is spraying across the screen (I could only assume it wasn't Crowe's character's).   I give it a six; anyone giving it higher than a seven is very easily amused.",6,0,0,20 May 2000
