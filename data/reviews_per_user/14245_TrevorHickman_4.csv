Moneyball," Dull story about a dull sport
","I usually love films with a sorting theme, but this one left me cold.
Yes, I get that he chose a team based on stats and therefore went against common wisdom, but that's about the whole movie summed up in a sentence. There's barely any actual on pitch action. What there is requires you to know the intricacies of baseball. Pitt is ok in what is a relatively easy role to play. It's also long, so long - at least 30 minutes of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor. About an hour in I wanted it to be over and was dismayed when I realised we weren't even half way through. Leave this alone unless you're a baseball fan, there are other options.",6,1,2,27 March 2020
Silent Hill," Probably one of the worst films I have ever seen
","I was really looking forward to seeing Silent Hill. It had been well promoted and I had heard a radio interview with a couple of the actors.In actual fact the film was a complete disaster. There was very little plot and what there was jumped around in a meaningless manner. The film opens well (if not a little bit unfeasibly) and you soon get drawn in. Unfortunately, all sense of a plot seems to end after 15 minutes and you are instead thrown into an endless chain of special effects and gory scenes.Silent Hill took itself so seriously but was actually ridiculous. I found myself laughing out loud at the stupidity of it all by the end. If I had been watching it on TV I would have turned off after about 20 minutes.Please don't go and see this. I wasted a complete Friday evening on it and I wouldn't want you to do the same!",1,3,8,22 May 2006
Into the Wild," What a slow pointless movie
","Definitely a Sean Penn directed movie. Moody and with a few nice shots.The story is poor though. Posh, well educated boy drops out and becomes a self acclaimed 'Supertramp'. He selfishly doesn't let his parents or sister know where he is and then dies a pointless death. I'm not sure what the lesson is in the film. Particularly irking is the short time he spends in a hostel where we see the 'real' homeless people wandering around zombie like. Oh no that's not for our Supertramp he's much better than that! I grew to despise his character the longer the film went on and was actually laughing when he realised he had eaten the poisonous plant, oh dear what a shame, never mind. I was reminded of the words of Jarvis Cocker 'You can call your Dad and stop it all'.Don't bother watching",5,2,3,20 December 2011
The Shape of Water," Children's Movie with unnecessary violence and sex scenes
","A classic kids fable - girl meets fish-monster, girl loves fish-monster, bad guy hates fish-monster and chains him up, girl rescues fish-monster, girl and fish-monster live happily ever (after after it turns out fish-monster can survive gun shots but not extended periods out of water), bad guy meets grizzly end. There I just saved you two hours!Indeed I was thinking as I was watching it that were it not for the sex scenes and graphic violence it would easily be suitable for my 10 year old. Sure, it's nicely shot and there's some good references to early 60's culture and music but it's a bit unbelievable to imagine that a cleaner would have un restricted access to a top secret area and then when the monster goes missing not at all be suspected for the crime. Some of the scenes and dialogue is garbled and perhaps I was missing the point of the Cadillac scene and the pie shop. It just seemed like 'filler' to me but maybe I missed the artistic depth or something? And what the hell was the dance scene all about?Weird that bestiality is condoned to such a degree - did we really need to know how the monster's penis works? Couldn't their love just be 'implied'?Not a terrible film, just a very odd one which had it not been framed as an 'adult' movie could easily just have been a kids film. Doesn't deserve any of the plaudits that's it's received as it isn't either original or well conceived.",7,1,14,30 January 2018
