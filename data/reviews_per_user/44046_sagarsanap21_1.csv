Black Swan," a mild start and a refreshing end................
","I saw this movie only after its nominations in various categories for Oscars, till then I was unaware about what a masterpiece I was going to miss. This movie is a splendid blend of darkness, music, passion and a little horror. The direction is so good that u find yourself living with the this character 'Nina' which is spectacularly carried out by Natalie Portman. My mind sometimes went on the way of the lead character's while watching the film, this shows how skillfully this film has been made. The director seems to be very, very clear what he wanted to show and how. The best part of this movie is that, it is highly unpredictable. Unpredictable in every sense. While watching you will think that, though for sometime, the movie is actually a horror movie, but as the movie proceeds, you will get clear idea of what is actually happening and how effectively it has been portrayed in front of you. You will get the actual blow of fresh air at the last shot of the movie, where the character Nina says 'I was perfect'. I bet, at that shot you will say that 'Wow! This movie is perfect '.",10,2,4,2 March 2011
