Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A step up.
","More fast-paced and gripping than its predecessor, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is an adrenaline-rushing improvement that has an intriguing plot, exciting action sequences and a charismatic villain in Jared Harris as Moriarty.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Weak entry, but not the worst.
",This movie contains many cliche and unoriginal elements that feel exhausting along with somehow allowing the movie to feel silly and cartoony even for a fantasy movie. The chemistry between Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver carries the movie and is by far the high point. The finale doesn't seem as climactic as it seems rushed.,6,2,3,30 December 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton's awesome.
","A severely underrated movie that stays faithful to the book, while adding enough to justify its existence and features an amusingly eccentric performance from Johnny Depp",8,2,3,29 September 2019
The Dark Knight," Conflict of genre.
","While a great movie overall which delves deeply into the concepts of order and morality, The Dark Knight has an overlooked weak point which is its cartoony depiction of the titular masked vigilante. Although Christian Bale is fine as Bruce Wayne, the portrayal of his alter-ego doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie and allows The Dark Knight to succeed far more as a movie overall than as a story, centered around Batman.",8,0,2,20 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ's cool.
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens seems to get an awful lot of unfair criticism nowadays. I used to see this movie in more negative light, due to its lack of originality, but there's far more to it than that. For example, Kylo Ren's a relatable and sympathetic villain, and far more than just a ripoff of Darth Vader. Aliens is also a great movie even though it incorporates similar story elements to the first movie.",8,1,16,27 October 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Third time's the charm.
","From my perspective, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's the best of the Indiana Jones movie series and it's always been my favourite, as well as one of my favourite Steven Spielberg movies. It has constant adrenaline-rushing moments, great chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, gives more screen time to Sallah and Marcus, introduces a great character in Henry Jones Senior, has great action sequences and provides some of the best laughs of the franchise.",10,2,3,19 October 2019
