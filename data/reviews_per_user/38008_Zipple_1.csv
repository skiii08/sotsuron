Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh my, its the Ewoks again!
",I went into this movie not expecting it to live up to the hype and boy - did it not!  It appears that Lucas might have hit the bottom of the creative barrell with this one.  The Gunguns are the Ewoks.  The pod race is the speeder chase.  The reward ceremony is the reward ceremony.  The destruction of the driod control ship from the inside is the destruction of the Death Star from the inside . . .I don't know what else to say - see it at a matinee.,2,0,1,20 May 1999
