"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Disco Dollies Shake Their Groove Thangs
","This movie is certainly original - after all how many movieshave been made about two drag queens and a transexual travellingthrough the Australian outback to lipsync a variety of ABBAsongs and disco classics in outback towns, Aboriginal settlements and resorts.  I can't think of any myself!  Thehumour in this is pretty black, and bawdy to say the least, butI think for the most part it is hilarious and the moreoutrageous the better.   The movie is full of great lines, mostof which I would not dream of repeating.  The acting is firstclass all around, and what a surprise Guy Pearce (pre LAConfidential) turned out to be.   The costumes are brilliantworks of art and a dress worn by Hugo Weaving made entirely ofthongs has to be seen to be believed.   The theme of selfacceptance, and acceptance within a wider community are exploredwell with the heroes/heroines receiving acceptance and brutalrejection in roughly equal quantity.   There is no sugar coatingin this piece of confection - unlike 'To Wong Foo Thanks ForEverything- Julie Newmar'  which covers similar territory withembarassing results.   'Priscilla' is one to watch with an openmind, a sense of humour, some high heels and your grandmother inanother room.  And everybody sing along  'Mamma Mia, here I",Null,1,3,29 October 1998
