Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 Review
","The movie is about super hero, Iron man/Tony Stark against the enemy , with his Iron man suit.I particularly like the movie. My favorite character is Tony, he is so strong, flexible, clever to use his suit. I want the directors to produce more movie about Iron man. For example, Iron man 4 or Amazing Iron man, etc... All the scenes are great such as fighting scene, love scene between Pepper and Tony, and the scene when he finding out the true that cause the problem. I watch this movie for about 4-5 times already.I really dislike the scene in the end of the movie when he throws his power into the sea. I think that there's no more episode or other movie about Iron man. This is just my opinion!!! I think that this movie if for older audience, and some fans of super hero movie. Iron man 3 is really good for me to watch. 9/10",9,0,1,18 November 2015
