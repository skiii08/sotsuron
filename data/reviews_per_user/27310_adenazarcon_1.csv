Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Fever is a fun, and really great movie!
","It's a really great movie! You got amazing dancing and choreography. Wonderful music and soundtrack. It's really groovy and 70s-ish. Also, great acting, John Travolta and the other actors did wonderful jobs in portraying their characters. This movie also has a good story. The plot was really well done, although the ending is kind of sad, which is the only drawback. But otherwise, the story is really good! You can just feel the conflict that the characters are having within themselves and with the other characters. That's great acting too. It's just really great! It's fun. It's fun to watch John Travolta cut amazing shapes on the dance floor and it's fun to listen to the beautiful bee gees soundtrack, especially night fever. It's just really good! Great movie!! It's now my one of my favorites and It's got me dancing now er.. learning how to dance like Travolta.",10,2,4,5 August 2017
