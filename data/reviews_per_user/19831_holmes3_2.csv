Iron Man 3," People, WAKE UP! (Be careful, CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!)
","Dear Iron Man fans! I was very disappointed reading all the negative reviews! The movie is decent piece of Marvel and Disney project! I found this part the best movie of Marvel Cinematography after Avengers so far!Action scenes, whenever we see Iron Man fighting the bad guys are perfectly proportional to Tony Stark storyline, trying to defeat a fear in himself. It is a perfect way to show this difference between the person and his suit, and raise a question, about who is Iron Man - a suit or a man?People say the antagonist look just so unreal and 'too much fiction' like. However I want to remind all of these movie fans, that Iron Man is nothing but a MOVIE BASED ON COMICS! When I was going on Iron Man 3, I did not expect to see a 'realistic SCI-FI', I expected to see a quality special effect, which will bring me into the atmosphere of Stark Industries world, and I was totally satisfied! I am not going to talk about Robert DJ and Gwyneth performance, as I fount it as amazing as it was in previous parts.I really hope I would at least make you doubt your negative thoughts on this movie, as I together with the rest of comics fans found it incredibly good.Thank you.",7,3,13,1 May 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel, Down the Hill
","!!!!CONTAINS SPOIIILERS!!!!Man of Steel. When I saw a concept art by Christopher Nolan on a new superman, I dropped my jaws. I will not lie, I did not hesitate even for a second - this movie will be fabulous. DIrector - Zack Snyder, Composer - Hanz Zimmer, Producer - Chris Nolan. I mean, how can it not be great? And i am probably not th only one who thought that. But, its time to face the truth - Man of steel was not a superman, we were all expecting to see. However, it is one of my favourite movies, which deserves to be considered as the BEST superman movie of all times. People kept yelling, how dim and waffling was the movie. That is absolute truth.I guess, when David Goyer was writing a script, he intended to create a tough and vivid storyline. But, the problem was - there were just too many. THe movie could have been split in trilogy. For a movie in order to be inspirational and memorable,it must contain no more than one leading problem, that the main character is trying to solve throughout the story. Goyer created 3 of them. First is Kal-El's hard life and his search of himself on a completely foreign planet. Second is the impossibility of establishing relationship with military service of USA, as they consider him as a threat. Third one is a war, raised against his own 'family' - whats left of his world. WHen I was sitting in the cinema, I just felt overloaded. There was too much pressure on the Superman, even tho he is a Man of steel. This pressure easily reflected on me. Evidently, that has affected my opinion about this movie. And I think that was the main problem with it. As a side thing, I enjoyed Henry Cavill performance, although his previous movies made me want to shot my brains out. As well as Amy Adams, who played a very interesting, provocative lady.Peace and love, guys.Don't go hard on Bieber, he will do just fine ;)",7,0,0,17 September 2013
