Captain Phillips," Fantastic Film - Tom Hanks is Superb
","Having not read any of the back story to this film, I settled in to watch something that my fellow IMDb'ers had rated pretty highly, after watching this movie I am in agreement with them.Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors, as a kid I must have watched BIG about 10 times and in his role as Captain Phillips he simply excels. The movie builds the tension gradually, Hanks enjoying a battle of wit with the pirates before the inevitable confrontation, the journey in between is tense, fraught with emotion and even my other half who is not a film fan found herself engrossed from beginning to end.This movie is a solid 7, but Hanks, with the latter scenes elevates this to an 8. A must watch.",8,1,3,6 August 2014
