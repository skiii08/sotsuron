The Hangover," You won't realise when the movie gets over
","Usually we expect a lot less in the movies than what we see in the trailers, as they are supposed to be good to attract people to the movie. But occasionally you get some of the movies which outperforms not only the trailers but also your expectations from a movie. And Hangover is definitely is one of these occasional movies.You will never regret even a single second of the movie. After the initial plot and the introduction of the characters, the ride begins and never slows down till the end of the movie. Every character in the movie, the timing of the events and the flow of the story is excellent. The best part is, nobody in the movie is trying to be funny but still you will have a smile on your face throughout the movie.",10,3,6,8 October 2009
Cube," Doesn't stand out
","Just letting everybody know its my personal opinion, but I just can't believe that this movie stands at 7.5, at the time of writing my review.The only 4 points I am giving this movie are for a great idea for a thriller (3 points) and for the sets and special effects (1 point). Apart from that none of the points in the movie or even the casts stand out. Most of the times it seems they are pushing it too hard which leads to awkward expressions and, sorry to say this but 'over acting'.Direction is good, apart from the occasional close up shots which because of the my previous point 'over ....' doesn't help.The only two casts who were convincing I will say was David Hewlett (as Worth) and Nicole de Boer (as Leaven). Quentin and Holloway fail to impress, and I am sorry to say that Maurice Dean Wint i.e Quentin is one of the reasons I thought this movie was a waste of my time. Either he had been pushed too hard to look scary or for some reason he did it himself.Bottom line, great idea for a thriller there are a few loopholes but those are acceptable. But the movie didn't stand out at all.*Though a lot of people don't think so. For heavens sake Back to the future II sits at 7.5 in IMDb, Cloverfield sits at 7.4. I would have liked the movie at 5-6, but 7.5 definitely no. 7.5 means you don't mind watching the movie again, but I I don't think I am gonna watch Cube the second time.",4,1,3,16 February 2011
