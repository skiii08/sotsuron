It," Decent, although very flawed
","None of the kids can act! As I watched this I was thinking how bland they all were and thinking how strikingly different they are from the superb cast of Stranger Things.The bad people are way, way over the top bad. Especially the bully gang and leader. This is small town America. I'm thinking where's the local police and then it turns out the kid's father is the local police and he's not tolerant of his sons behavior at all. So there's no way this kid and his fiends would be able to pull off what they're shown going around doing. The implication of course is his father being so strict made him into a raging psychopath. The characterization was all wrong. I grew up knowing the local cops kids. They might have been jerks and acted like they're crap doesn't smell, but they also were expected to toe the line by their parent! A phone call to dad, this all goes away. For good and beyond.It's a swimming marathon to get through. It's literally 40 minutes too long.But the most damning thing...it's just not that scary! So you need something else..and it doesn't have anything else! Also I'd like to point out while they kinda sort of figure out why Pennywise is there, there's no explanation how a supremely powerful demonic being is taken out by a bunch of kids? I can think of about a billion ways Pennywise could have killed them all with zero effort. So no them growing courage wasn't satisfying at all. YOU KNOW HE'S NOT DEAD, AND COMING BACK FOR ROUNDS 2-15 The only CONCRETE thing we do know is they plan a sequel! You can't just fight a supremely powerful supernatural being into submission. There's gotta be...something.",4,1,5,22 September 2017
Rocketman," Rocketman : A love letter to Bernie Taupin
","A very honest portrait. I never realized how personal the lyrics were. It tells his story through the songs. The performances are very strong.All through it though, there's Bernie. Who became his brother. Closer to him than anybody else. Its shows how amazingly strong their bond was. It pulls at your heartstrings when Bernie pleads with him to just go away with him, and get back to the best part of their lives, when they lived together, collaborating.It doesn't shy away from his quirks. His being a diva at times.His sessions in group are very personal. His journey to sobriety was very uplifting.One of the best biographic movies I've ever seen.",9,0,1,4 July 2019
The Irishman," As a Scorcese film it's sub par
","I don't know what's going on here. The real man, by all acounts should have spent a great deal of time in AA. Here he's portrayed as concerned father, family man, loyal and honorable. Who just happens to kill, blow up things, beat down people, bribe everybody and has a daughter whose carefully watching him. His heavy drinking is not shown. Here he might down a shot or two.Based on the late life confessions of this man. The movie tries to imply he knew everybody. He's the Forest Gump of mafia circles.It doesn't help that his account is heavily disputed and suspected to be him shopping a grand story trying to get money to try and leave his family some. The movie gets a lot of known historical detail right. The last 15 minutes is pure Sheeran. They would have you believe he was some super successful hitman of stars within the organization, who nobody ever knew was a hitman.It is true he became a very close friend and confidant of Jimmy Hoffa. I would suggest you look at some of the debunking articles about the story though.Deniro plays the same guy he has in 20 other movies. Joe Pesci steps out of his favorite method, crazed, manic, psychopath and instead plays a wizened old man who tries to be as tolerant as possible. Pacino does himself too. Overall Cannavale and Graham are very good. Those actors are younger and trying real hard.
It's way too long, and really tries to over emphasize certain characters idiosyncrasies, especially Hoffa's. Showing us examples over and over.",5,2,3,8 January 2020
Aquaman," An Honest Review
","The 10's? are a bit ridiculous. This was not a ten movie. This guy is clearly Aquaman. Society hasn't kind of figured that out? He's not trying to hide or disguise himself. He's not working a regular job in an alternate identity. Lex Luthor is not required to figure this out. Yet Manta says several times he needs help finding him? Clearly Mantas...a retard! Yet....There was nothing to imply Manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology, yet he does it in 2 minutes? Because he needed to! It would have been far better to have an Atlantian weapons tech create it for him He's one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed. Like how 100's of people in TV and Movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time. In this case Manta is Tony Stark when he needs to be.To me if somebody is THIS SMART, why are they a pirate? Why are they covertly working for Atlantis? How did they meet? Too many 'just because' things. Another annoying thing...the bad guys of Atlantis clearly know EXACTLY where Arthur lives, which opens a large kettle of fish.At one point a villain will reveal he's known who was loyal to him and who wasn't the entire time. Which again brings up more questions than answers.Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman as a surfer/biker. It helps cement him as about as non royal as King Ralph. He's a fish out of water. One thing that should be amended is he's able to talk to all sorts of Marine life, not just fish.Ok so there's flaws. Then there's these 1/10 reviews. Also ridiculous. The movie is light hearted without mimicking Thor Ragnarok which got a little too silly. The acting is not going to win any awards. But I don't see Anthony Hopkins getting considerations for his Marvel work either.The visuals are stunning. The fight scenes are great! The chase scene rivals any Bond movie. Aquaman is very strong and invulnerable. But he's not Superman and this is shown very well that he's a notch below, but not too far below.This was a great effort. Not as good as WonderWoman, but not too far off.",8,1,1,22 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Seen it twice now....
","Read a lot of reviews. Even a NY Times article that blames all the hate on Russian OP's and Racists.Is it a disaster? No. Is it really good? No. Things are rushed and chaotic. The emperor is just back. He's spent his time building a frigg'n huge armada. He also has a legion of Sith. It would have helped if there were even small clues this was happening In the earlier movies.. But no, it just is. He's been conveniently hidden away on one of those 'uncharted, not on any maps' places that keep popping up in these movies.There's a lot of stolen ideas from other series. Harry Potter, Supernatural, Antman and Wasp, even Infinity War, Charmed, as well as others.We're introduced to the idea of a memory ghost. As opposed to a force ghost?Poe is shown to be a lot more like Han Solo. (Poe movie on the horizon?)Chewy get's killed but then they thought better and had him live? (Second unseen transport?) Rey instantly senses Chewy is alive later on, but couldn't sense he wasn't killed earlier?There's good fight scenes and bad fight scenes. I remember back to The Force Awakens where Ren held a blast in air. Here they're are just using A lot of telekinesis to stop things, pull things, push things, lift things spin things. So Jedi and Sith have suddenly become Marvel Girl/Phoenix?We find out that Leah was fully trained, but abandoned it. She's more of a Jedi precog we learn. Maz Kanata will just remain a magical alien. We've found out nothing about her except she's always been around. Knows everybody.There's the obligatory Star Wars long distance run up attack this time by Ren. Where he's coming, coming, coming....' They can't land nearby, always have to start from miles away kind of thing.There are new powers, force users able to exchange things from long distances through a connection. There's now Force users Supernatural Angel healing. Finn has 'feelings'.There's the obligatory rebels getting their asses handed to them, all hope is lost, but apparently rebel ships don't fall very fast? and despite lot of them getting shot, blown to smithereens, they must have had more ORIGINAL attacking ships then we saw. It would seem thousands of enemy ships would have wiped them out by the time reinforcements arrive? Since the Rebels only had like dozens?Emperor Palpatine is so powerful now it's ridiculous. Yet I never once thought he wouldn't get defeated. So yes there's a lot of BS.If you go in expecting a masterpiece, you will be thoroughly disappointed.BUT if you go in with the attitude they're trying to correct a lot of misconceived notions in the last 5 movies and just watch, you should be entertained.I do have to laugh at episodes 1-3. Where they claimed a Jedi must be trained very young. Everybody in Episodes 4-9 was trained in early adulthood and they are by far more powerful. Darth Vader wouldn't stand a chance against any of these overpowered Sith or Jedi.",7,5,13,25 December 2019
Bird Box," I have a brain so the huge plot hole ruined it for me.
","Maybe this movie could become the next Rocky Horror audience participation movie! Where somebody figures out appropriate things to yell at the screen. Like when Douglas suggests they stay at the supermarket...the audience could yell YES YES YES. Then they argue about not doing that and again ..NO NO NO.This movie is like an encyclopedia of used movie tropes and stolen things already seen.The one movie they should have copied was Dawn of The Dead that solved the supplies problem.Because with the scenario of being holed up, blindfolded and trying to scavenge these people should all be dead within weeks without having a large food source found. Why don't you try it. Have somebody watch you for protection, get blindfolded and try to just make it to your next door neighbors house front door. Then think about having to do that, 3 times day and successfully break in, find food and make it back to your house. Without dropping everything 12 times and such.Food is required for survival. There just was not enough food available to survive even a few months, for 2 adults, 2 growing children, and how long before the house population was finally whittled down to just that. Have you ever seen a family of fours groceries? Even trying to ration. You've got a woman who needs to nurse 2 children. close by house scavenging ...they might have lasted 1 months total. With him out scavenging 2,3 times a day.Remember that Castaway movie with Tom Hanks. How does he survive? He become adept at fishing. We're shown this. Otherwise the viewers would be wondering how the hell is he surviving?This HUGE plot hole could have been easily solved. All they needed to do was make Douglas a survival nut with a basement full of long lasting food supplies. Or a neighbor house was owned by one. 'Mr Wilson was one of those survival guys, I'll bet he's got a few years of rations, we need to get to his house' But unless they found a large food supply the survival longevity makes no sense whatsoever.This gets compounded by a factor of 100X with the ending. What are ALL these people eating?Leaving the water still running was a cute touch, because apparently somebody figured out without that they'd die in a week. Of course it was ridiculous, but showed somebody had a few brain cells.This is by far not the movies only flaws, but if they all starve to death, there's nothing else to continue with.",5,2,5,7 January 2019
Justice League," How can you spend $300,000,000 and end up with...
",".... the level of character development, story line and special effects of Destroy All Monsters?The CGI is bad! You notice a certain person has bad CGI around his upper lip. Because his commitment to his role was on par with Cesar Romero. You couldn't grow that thing back in a few weeks?I'm reading a lot reviews with the attitude of everybody deserves a trophy, when the reviews aren't downright condemning. There's a lot of mention of the troubles during the shooting. I don't give a damn! Also a lot of the high mark reviews are by the typical just joined IMDb to write THIS REVIEW, and you'll never see me again.(phony)look at the difference between IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes! How can there be that big a difference? I'll tell you how, fans can manipulate IMDb, that's how! How can people justify giving this high marks, and then explain all the misfires, and they did it on the hopes NEXT TIME they'll do better? I mean seriously, read about 20 reviews by people who rate it highly and you'll see they admit they over rated it within the review.You've had several shots at this now DC/Warners. Was Wonder Woman a blip on the radar? The villain has no personality! I'm just here for the mayhem, and the buffet. I see several people give this 3 stars for a few nice panels. Really that's enough for you, a few nice hero poses? This is literally the short bus version of a major blockbuster! Sure it's going to do Batman vrs Superman numbers, but is that what they were shooting for?",3,13,25,18 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Whoa Nelli! (10 stars and I'll tell you why!}
","You want action? This here's the MCU's version of an All Star event. With the dunking contest, the home-run derby, and the main event. It's half time and the team has seriously taken a beating. Let's recap. The other team looked downright invincible at first. But our team got in their licks. Several players on the opposing team were taken out too. This is a war anyways, it's like everybody forgets that.It has drama! It has a villain that actually thinks he's in the right. He's not just doing this because he likes being a villain. His followers actually believe in his cause, aren't just there as mercenaries. There are people on our planet who feel the same way Thanos does! That overpopulation is killing our planet. Thanos actually cries real tears.This is the closest thing to an actual comic book adaption that has ever been filmed. It follows the storyline.It wasn't messed with for Hollywood audiences. A lot of the critics just don't seem to get that. I would not recommend taking pre-teens to see this without a conversation first about how this is a comic book adaption. These characters aren't real and neither are..their deaths.You've already seen many, many Marvel characters die on screen in other movies. Why this is effecting people so much is ridiculous. Of course most of them will return...hello..they have movies scheduled for several of them. I for one am joyful because I've been reading the Thanos saga since the old Captain Marvel comics(Mar-vell) and can even see elements of those storylines in here, and can pretty much follow what's going to happen and it's awesome!The movie is everything you want without going overboard. It's laugh out loud funny at times, it connects all the character seamlessly. Most of the second tier characters will have big roles in the following movie. That's a great thing. Remember 'So you're saying theres a chance'",10,4,12,2 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Aside from all the SJW stuff...
","...It's just plain horrible.Let's forget for a moment that Rey is not just a Mary Sue, she's the ultimate Mary Sue. She's the Mary Sue all other Mary Sues will strive to be. She can do..ANYTHING. If the key to winning everything was French Cooking, suddenly she'd be Rey Pepin. If eating hotdogs, she'd be Rey Chestnut.Nothing makes any sense. It makes you start to re-think how bad the previous movie was. Things like... So the parents of Rey sold her to the space Pawn Star, so she could live alone in the desert and scavenge for him?Slow moving? Outer-space bombers that drop bombs(gravity was not explained to whomever thought that up) Bomb Bay Doors that open but still contain atmosphere? A throw back scene to Smokey and the Bandit in space? What is the purpose of slow moving outerspace bombers other than to get lots and lots of ships trying to get them there, blown up? Why would anybody with an IQ over 80 think this was a defendable idea?The hero of the resistance is constantly kept out of the loop, thus 'FORCE'-ING him to take matters into his own hands.A big bad villain who seems like a nod to the Wizard of OZ? He's pontificating about his strong hold and loyalty of his apprentice when he gets gacked? He appears large and ominous just like the Wizard, who really was not all the powerful and terrible. They literally stole this from the Wizard of Oz!A long, stupid side mission, that doesn't work out, and anybody with a brain knows was only done to introduce 100's of now you see me, now you don't characters for action figures! We are told only one person is capable of doing what needs to be done...except for the guy who'll be in the same cell with them!Who is putting guys in positions of power where they can act like deranged idiots when things don't go their way? You've got two characters that just lose it all the time. Was this done to show men are idiots?Mary Poppins space Jedi? Purple haired lady wants to do Crash 2? Space vehicles running out of fuel? Was Nascar a sponsor? The old why land close by, lets land miles and miles away so we can do lots of scenes showing us advancing. Like 5 previous movies already did!",6,0,4,23 July 2018
Logan," It's the best Wolverine movie...but...
","..to me that's not setting the bar very high.They're calling this the 'Dark Knight' X-men movie. I don't see it, I see the 'Leaving Las Vegas' X-men movie. Where a dying, weak, alcoholic, suicidal guy is making bad choices constantly.It's pointed out early in the movie that 'the plan' is to buy a boat and hang out on the seas in their final days. They have some money, not enough. Here's the really not thought out part...why not just sell that really expensive limo? Ohh yeah in the beginning of this movie they have a pretty nice ride! I'm in Comic book Wolverines camp. Comic book Wolverine isn't the guy you surprise, he can literally smell you coming from miles away. Apparently this power of his was tossed in SONY's blast furnace. You can argue this movie Logan was losing that power, but not X-23. I understand why She and He don't display this power in movies, the hero getting surprised is a constant, cheapo plot device.Comic Wolverine is the guy who can stalk Daredevil and not be noticed by him. Now of course they have Caliban tracking him, but it's not like he's trying to hide from anybody anyway. Wolverines ability to surprise his opponents is actually a mainstay in the comics! What stuns me is all the obvious terrible decisions by Logan that set up conflicts that could have been avoided in this movie. In a movie where he's supposedly trying to avoid conflicts.Choosing to park a really expensive car in a ghetto, which leads to one. Showing up at a casino with a vehicle the bad guys and authorities are looking for, all shot up and telling them to leave it out front? It's worth a laugh, but is it a sane move? It looked cool to have Peirce show up alone at their hideout, but then to leave him alive? Especially in a movie where Logan kills dozens upon dozens of people? Bull! There's so much of these bad decisions I'm wondering if they were trying to say he had brain damage.",6,1,8,4 March 2017
Joker," The Joker as a pure sympathetic character.
","Absolutely unfunny. A mash up of several great films with using that material as a back story for one of the most iconic arch villains in pop literature. Phoenix gives it everything he's got. Unfortunately the material is not up to par.He's not an anti-hero.It's a two hours of If you had my life and problems you'd become a deranged killer too.The Joker in this movie displays non of the wit, genius, imagination, manipulative ability of the character he's derived from. You cannot imagine this person becoming the legendary rival of Batman. He's basically a person driven homicidally insane by his experiences in life. That's it. Period.He's purely an untalented deranged killer. Which is a slap in the face to all the people who've made The Joker so interesting in the past. Heath Ledgers Joker embodied the skills this one is lacking. Jack Nicholson's embodied his absurdity. This one just kills.Two hours of making him sympathetic. It scares me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. It's a mash up of Network, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, TAXI DRIVER, and The King of Comedy. Some will say it's paying homage to those. I call it what it really is, unimaginatively stealing most of it's material from them.So why did I give it as high as a 7? Phoenix is incredible. I think with the right material this truly could have been a masterpiece. Instead they blamed all of society for turning him into what he is.The Joker in previous incarnations is a homicidal maniac...but he has smarts, style, wit, dare I say charm?",7,1,7,31 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Wait, I aready saw this movie, I believe it was called It?
","Seriously, they simply had the adult main characters remember the scenes from the first movie. Things were different. They really over used CGI, and in some instances pretty poorly. This is one where the first movie was enough. They literally could have made the first one 30 minutes longer and fit all the new stuff in it. You could easily follow the plot devices as they broke each member up so they could experience their own unique encounter against Pennywise. Even the Scooby Gang knows this is a bad idea!",5,3,4,27 September 2019
Joy," Depends on what you wanted
","Taken right from this pages trivia: 'Annie Mumolo's original script featuring the story of the Miracle Mop was based upon a real person: Joy Mangano, an Italian-American inventor and entrepreneur known for inventions such as the self-wringing mop' This is not anything about that! Instead you'll see a alleged amalgam of strong women woven into a sort of Cinderella sells her mop story. With evil henchmen, a jealous half sister, and kind of a nasty wealthy Stepmother.Ruined it for me, knowing the real story, and liking the real story of Joy Mangano.Just an excuse to make another movie starring JLAW and Bradley Cooper IMHO.It's not bad, but it's just a rehash of David O's favorite movie formula. Take characters out of an insane asylum and put them in a family in a movie.In the real world Joy was an instant success! She set records the very first time she appeared on TV with the highest sales ever prior to that. So 9/10ths of this movie is made up dramatic crap. There literally was no struggling, whatsoever! From poor housewife to millionaire overnight!",4,10,25,27 December 2015
