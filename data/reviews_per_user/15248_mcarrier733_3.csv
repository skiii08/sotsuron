The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Didn't expect much, but didn't expect it to be this awful...
","-----Spoiler Alert-----I've read the books, and watched all of the movies to date.We all know by opening one of the books or going to the theatre for this franchise that you expect it will be mediocre, and by no means a prestigious award winner. You take it for what it is.This movie is cheesy, awkward and trying too hard. It is by far the worst of the franchise, so far...At the beginning, a shredded and shirtless Jacob is running in the rain after receiving the wedding invitation, which makes me hang my head in shame that I also find him appealing.Moving on...The over-hype of the honey moon love making scene... seriously, it was nothing. It was not tantalizing, I found it awkward. And on a side note, I give Pattinson and Stewart a year after the final movie, that relationship is dripping with a public relations agenda. It also makes me wish that Henry Cavill was cast as Edward, because he is delightful on all levels. They really tried to make Bella look like a vixen and I found it repulsive. This movie spent way too much time overcompensating due to the build up of the physical between Edward and Bella.The werewolves communicating while in being wolf form was so cheesy it was painful. I will give props to how they made Bella look gaunt and zombie-esque while being pregnant. The birthing scene was gross considering the PG 13 rating it has. The sounds alone will make you cringe, in addition to Bella's back breaking.I like Seth's character in the movie, and in print. His character is true to what he feels is right and has courage.I did like the fight scene, and it was cool to see the wolves running through the forest and basically focuses on all of their senses while doing so.This franchise has nothing on Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. Mindless entertainment, mediocre acting, and an attractive cast (for the most part).At the end of the day, it attracts such a diverse and wide audience that it doesn't matter if it's a master piece, it is already bringing in so much revenue. I'm looking forward to the Hobbit :)",1,14,22,24 November 2011
The Hunger Games," Highly anticipated Hunger Games lives up to the hype...
","First, I would like to say that I have never been so excited for a movie adaptation in my life.The Hunger Games trilogy is the best book series I've read to date, and I was a bit worried that the movie adaptation would be vastly changed as they normally are.For the most part, it really did stay true to the book with some minor details that were changed (Katniss suffered a burn on her calf, not her thigh, Peeta hinted to Katniss to strike Cato's hand by drawing an X in blood, not tapping the hand, etc).Some people are questioning the shaky camera. I actually enjoyed it from that perspective as it felt more gritty. If it were straight-on shots while running through the woods, it wouldn't have been the same.Praise must be given to the cast, especially Jennifer Lawrence as she perfectly conveyed the complex character of Katniss. You felt her pain and anguish. Lawrence is a force to be reckoned with. Not only is she naturally beautiful, but her acting ability is well beyond her years.Some are making comments about Josh Hutcherson being cast as Peeta. I questioned it at first, but after seeing him take on the role with such vulnerability and strength, I was pleasantly surprised.Also, hats off to Amandla Stenberg, Alexander Ludwig, and Elizabeth Banks. They were also great in their roles.Overall, the film was raw, frightening, and fantastic. I am sincerely looking forward to the rest of the franchise.Now, let's hope Kellan Lutz can be cast as Finnick Odair.",10,1,10,25 March 2012
The Last Song," What a let down...
","All I can say is that I barely got through 20 minutes, and had to stop this horrendous movie.I have really enjoyed other Nicholas Sparks adaptations. This was by far the most ridiculous attempt of a book to film adaptation I have ever seen.Miley Cyrus cannot act. It is painful.She is trying so hard that she is overdoing it. She should just stop acting altogether because there is no hope. She doesn't have the acting chops to accomplish anything (Razzies?).The only reason I gave two stars, is because Liam Hemsworth is really cute.Don't waste your time, energy, or money.",2,6,9,7 April 2012
