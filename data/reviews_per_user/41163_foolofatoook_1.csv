Skyfall," Nothing spectacular for the 50th year anniversary
","Well, let me mention at the outset that being a huge fan of the Bond franchise the anticipation and expectation from every next bond film has ever been growing. I personally feel Daniel Craig makes the best Bond of all times - Rugged, realistic, dark in demeanor.Having said that, Skyfall falls short of being a good film. (Not just talking about being a good Bond film). The artistic cinematography, the strangely varying pace and the theme which tries to blend old school and state of the art technology makes you wonder if it is skirmishes with film noir. Nevertheless, the plot gives it away, with no real meat or strength in development, the movie does not offer anything to stimulate the grey cells of the audience. It actually makes you rethink the definition of Bond film itself by overly trying to make it transformational from the out-of-the-world-gadgetry Bond to more real- life human being who is explicitly advised by the new, younger, geeky Q that the real world don't need exploding pens.Even comparing to the earlier Bond movies by Craig, it seems all the more diluted from the Bond franchise. After all, we do expect villainy of gigantic proportions when it is Bond who is on the screen and not such a predictable climax which revolves around expected personal vendetta. All in all, it is a must watch for any true Bond fan, I can't stop you from hitting the theaters. But you would rather enjoy the old Goldfinger or From Russia with Love, thinking in retrospect once you reach home.",6,4,10,20 November 2012
