Requiem for a Dream," go see this film!!!
","this is the best film i have seen in a long time.  some people won't like it because it is difficult to watch.  this is not a pleasant film and it's made so well you don't just watch it you experience it.  aranofsky really does an outstanding and creative job portraying what the characters experience on the screen.  he actually shows you visually what they are feeling.  he does use alot of camera work and some think that it looks amatureish.  i disagree, he has new original style that is refreshing.  the score is equally great.  it's hypnotic sound sucks you in and doesn't let go.  they combine for a devastating modern portrait of drug addiction that borders on being a horror film.  you will not feel good when you leave the theater, but if you can handle the intensity of the film you'll be back for more.it will be a real shame if this film does not get any oscar consideration due to it's rating.  particularly, ellen burstyn is fantastic in this film. she deserves to receive awards for this film.  if you think you can handle it.go see this film!!!",10,0,0,19 November 2000
