The Blair Witch Project," Unnerving!
","As a major fan of the horror genre I heard about The Blair Witch project and simply HAD to go and see it! Thinking of myself as a hardened horror buff I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy every second, and I did, but I was terrified! The fact that I was heavily pregnant and had to return home to an empty house as my husband was working away should have been a deterrent, but I thought I'd be fine!My sister (who loathes horror movies with a passion) had seen Blair Witch the night before and said she was disappointed in it. She said it was over-hyped and simply not frightening. How wrong she was!The film starts with 3 student film makers, Heather, Josh and Mike, heading to Burketsville to make a documentary about the legend of The Blair Witch. They visit various sites of interest, speak to local people and hear the story of Rustin Parr. Parr was a local man who kidnapped, tortured and murdered 7 local children in the 40's. During his trial Parr claimed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman burnt as a witch in the town of Blair. Burketsville was formerly known as Blair.The trio then head out into The Black Woods. They visit Coffin Rock, the site of the murder of 5 men. As the film progresses the students move further into the woods. Inevitably they become lost. What follows still scares me to this day. As fear takes over the sensibilities of the trio they begin to fight and argue with each other. Then, when night falls, strange happenings occur. Children are heard laughing, strange objects are left outside the tents. The students slowly descend into absolute terror. To go any further would mean including spoilers, which I always hate in a review. Needless to say the frustration of the students is passed on to the viewer. Shaky camera-work (this film being one of the first 'handheld camera' movies) only adds to the fear as we are unable to see what it is that is terrifying the students.I watched this film on the edge of my seat. On my return home I was physically afraid to be alone. I actually ended up staying the night at my parent's house! That's not to say that everyone will be afraid, judging by some of these reviews I think I must be an absolute coward for being scared by a film that some people have claimed made them fall asleep!But I will leave this review by saying one thing:I went into labour the next day - 3 weeks early!",8,0,1,7 October 2011
The Shining," Shockingly over rated!
","I am constantly baffled as to why this film frequently turns up in the 'top 10' scariest films, scariest moments, biggest movie shocks etc!As a Stephen King fan I am fully aware that King refused to allow the film to be called Stephen King's The Shining as he hated Kubrick's interpretation of his book. I love to talk to supposed King fans who are totally oblivious to the fact that the film and the book have entirely different endings, not to mention the fact that huge chunks of the book has been omitted from the film.Anyway, to the film. The author Jack Torrence, his wife Wendy and son Danny all travel to the Overlook Hotel, where Jack has taken a job as the winter caretaker, a job which will allow him to earn money whilst he writes his latest book. Once there Jack becomes gradually withdrawn, becoming more and more agitated, developing writer's block, seeing visions of old guests and eventually losing his mind. Danny also begins to see people. He has been told by the hotel cook that he possesses a gift (the 'shining' of the title). What follows is Jack's descent into madness whilst Wendy and Danny come to the slow realisation that they must get out. But how will they escape with no telephone, no transport and a hotel that is snowed in?As a stand alone film it's good. But the continuous claim that it is the scariest film ever is ridiculous. This and The Exorcist should now bow out gracefully and allow the truly scary to take charge!",5,8,18,23 September 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Absolute laugh riot
","As a fan of horror films I tend not to watch 'comedy' horrors, as they tend not to be either funny or scary . The Scary Movie franchise being the main offender.Tucker and Dale, on the other hand, is the exception to the rule!It's a kind of throwback to the days of Friday The 13th. Kids out camping in the woods, a couple of local rednecks scaring them and then everything gets out of hand, and someone gets chopped in half. That kind of thing. The difference with this film is that Tucker and Dale, whilst being the 'rednecks' we expect to appear in these kind of films, are actually just 2 nice guys who are doing some repairs to a cabin one of them owns. In a chain of misunderstandings the gang of kids suspect that Tucker and Dale have kidnapped and murdered their friend. The truth is however that the girl fell and was drowning when Tucker and Dale rescued her and took her to safety.The rest of the film is the kids' attempt to kill Tucker and Dale whilst attempting to rescue their friend. But the kids are as inept at killing as the guys are of explaining themselves.It's a great film, lots of laughs and a couple of gross out moments. I was pleasantly surprised and I suspect anyone else who watches this will be too.",8,0,0,26 September 2011
Insidious," Way over rated!
","I was pretty desperate to see this film, the trailers made it look like something that would probably stop you from sleeping ever again! And a good horror film with a child as the main focus is always worth the admission fee. It's a fact that ghost children are far scarier than other ghosts!The first two thirds of the film had me gripped. Some very scary parts that had me jumping in my cinema seat. I'll never listen to 'Tiptoe Through The Tulips' in quite the same way! Then the final third lost me completely. It went from a pretty great horror to a sort of fantasy/dream story. I was genuinely disappointed.It's worth watching just for the few good shocks, but don't believe the hype.",Null,0,2,26 September 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," I broke my heart
","Judging by some of the reviews on these pages it seems that unless we are shown extensive camps, human beings on the brink of starvation, brutality to upset the hardest of hearts and factual historical scenes then films simply do not represent the horror of The Holocaust. The fact that this film could have happened, and the fact that we cannot detract from the fact that 6 million people were murdered, seems to have been forgotten whilst the whiners moan about minor trivialities. Shame on them!I had never heard of this story (Holocaust movies are a particular interest of mine) until my teenage son brought the book home from school, he had to read it for a history essay on children in The Holocaust. He read it in one sitting and emerged from his bedroom with reddened eyes and a heavy heart. He said quite simply 'That broke my heart'.Bruno and his family move to a new home after Bruno's SS Commandant Father us given a new post. The Father is the head of a labour camp, housing countless Jews. Bruno, becoming increasingly bored and being the usual kind of nosey young boy, decides to explore the woods surrounding his new home. He walks through the woods and eventually comes to a fence, where he spots a little boy, Shmuel, wearing striped pyjamas. The two lonely children strike up a friendship. Bruno visits Shmuel every day and Shmuel gradually tells Bruno that he and his family are being held in this camp, and have to work.One day as Bruno leaves to visit Shmuel his Mother asks where he is going. Shmuel tells her, and she begins to realise exactly what her husband's new job entails, much to her horror. She forbids Bruno to visit Shmuel again. Bruno ignores her.To go any further would spoil the film. Needless to say, any film depicting the atrocities carried out by the Nazi's is always upsetting. However the climax of this film is quite simply one of the most heartbreaking things I have ever seen. It took my breath away and left me quite stunned.These other reviewers who are crying that the film is a 'chick flick' and that is was rubbish obviously get their jollies from the more visceral images of The Holocaust. The sheer implication of the horrors of the concentration camps impacted on me more than blood and guts ever could.I hope the heartless critics can one day find a film that satisfies their craving for in your face suffering. I'll stick with this tragic tale.",8,2,3,8 October 2011
Jaws," Quite simply the best horror film ever made. Ever.
","What's not to love about this film? It is quite possibly one of the most tense films ever to be made!This films breaks all the horror rules, and it does it brilliantly!We have no masked killer hiding in the woods. In fact Jaws will just come right up to you and chew off your leg. The shark does not target gangs of randy teenagers. She kills anyone who happens to be handy at the time.Three middle aged men are the heroes. No drop dead gorgeous male model types here, these are real men! Apart from Chief Brody who is pretty much afraid of everything.Jaws is just as comfortable attacking you in broad daylight, with the sun shining, as she is sneaking up on you and ramming your boat in the dead of night.This is probably the first horror film I ever saw, and it scared the living daylights out of me (I was probably a bit too young to be watching it!). Anyone who has seen Hooper get the fright of his life whilst examining the abandoned boat will know exactly what I'm talking about!I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't like this film, and I'll bet most people will know at least one quote from it. If you haven't seen it, go and watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again!You're gonna need a bigger boat.",10,1,4,5 October 2011
