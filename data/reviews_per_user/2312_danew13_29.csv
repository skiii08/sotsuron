The Lobster," More a Turkey than Lobster: Farrell Revives his True Detective Personna for an Exercize in Dramatic Futility
","I can't see the point of making The Lobster other than being experimental dramatic production geared towards Colin Farrell's downtrodden character similar to his depressing role in True Detective.It would have helped this bizarre film if it has been preceded by a literary introduction as a scene setter. Instead the audience,if there is one, is shown a film that isn't sci-fi or even a fantasy but rather and allegory or metaphor for human relationships vs. society.This is strictly an art house film and even then those viewing it may want their money back. I won't try to offer a synopsis because I am not sure of what I watched. In the end it was not a pleasing experience.",3,65,119,24 December 2015
The Monuments Men," Seems Like a Very Bad Made for TV Movie
","The main theme that seems to run through this film is a love for cigarettes, not historic accuracy. It certainly wasn't a love of art. Because as an art form itself, the film was bad, which is more amazing due to the large stellar cast.The main problems with Mon. Men are a lousy script, filled with pointless time wasting padding and an attempt to recover art all over Europe in 90 minutes or so.It begins in 1943 when Clooney is trying to convince the Roosevelt to form a unit to rescue looted art. He's using the bombing of Monte Cassino in Italy as an example of what could happen to object'art all over Europe. The problem here is, Monte Cassino wasn't bombed until 1944.Then it takes an entire year for his unit to be formed and six months later in July 1944 they land in Normandy to being their 10 month quest, which is filled mainly with boring small talk and careless excursions around enemy territory as if the war was over.Their final big haul of art comes on the heels of the Russians arriving. They have to leave immediately, which in fact takes 10 minutes of disbelief. Seeing this film you get the feeling Clooney feels he can sell anything to the public.",4,15,18,15 May 2014
If I Stay," Good Acting, Decent Story but So Long it Becomes Tedious
","If I Stay has all the hallmarks of a nice family sentimental drama...good performances and a decent script at the start. The problem is as it went on and on becoming more morbid and tedious,you kept wondering when it was going to end.The film could have been a TV mini series with a soap opera plot. Realistically it could have been half as long and still kept its integrity.The young lovers theme was well established and well worn out by the mid point. In fact the film was so long Chloe Moretz actually seemed older when it when it ended. Then there was the endless hospital trauma...talk about time wasting amidst sorrow. It's shame because this could have been an enjoyable tear jerker if it didn't become so tiring, morbid and lacking much hope at the end.",5,2,4,29 November 2014
Gravity," Very Dramatic and Panoramic, but also Factually Incorrect, with an Absurd Opening Scenario
","This is a pretty film and exciting. But it ends there. It's based on Hollywood hype and the public's ignorance of science.First, the initial absurdity was Russia blasting an old satellite with a missile creating a deadly high speed debris field while its own space station was being manned with its people and the Americans out there working on the Hubble Telescope. The Russians aren't stupid enough to endanger lives of crew members in that way,which invalidates the entire film since there would have been no disaster.Second, their was absolutely no reason for Clooney to untether himself from Bullock and then float off in the opposite direction. He and Bullock, both being tethered together and at one point to the space station would be traveling in the same direction and speed as the station. All he had to do was make slight tug or forward movement and he would have headed into the station.Third, and the comic relief of the film, is Bullock trying to crash learn how to crash land the re entry capsule from first Russian and then Chinese instruction manuals on how to fly a spaceship. This strained all believability. Going back to the beginning, Sandra Bullock'a character would not be suitable either in training or emotionally for this astronaut position.Finally, all such space craft are built for possible sea landings, with the hatch on top so they can't fill with water when opened. Bullock never checks this out and opens the hatch immediately, causing the capsule to sink. But then, she wasn't properly qualified, was she?Oh, and I couldn't understand why Bullock couldn't make radio contact with Earth through using several different radios.Aside from all this, the needless small talk from Clooney while the pair are floating in space is absurd and a waste of air. Again, this is a beautifully shot film, but you have to suspend disbelief. The shocking thing is most people seem to believe it.",6,7,13,14 December 2013
Don Jon," Amusing, Enlightening and Romantic: Levitt Does It Again
","Move over Robert Redford, Van Nuys High School has another Hollywood Hero grad. Joseph Gordon-Levitt expanded his already chameleon like persona in Don Jon, where he plays a street wise New Jersey ladies man who just hasn't found the right woman yet. So, he finds porn more sexually satisfying.Even super hot, but super controlling,Scarlett Johansson can't satisfy him. It finally takes an older woman, Julianne Moore, to teach him the meaning of life.This is a good film...it entertains, enlightens and in the end warms the spirit, much like 500 Days of Summer. Don Jon is the product of JGL. He wrote, directed and starred in it. In doing so he has revealed himself as a film maker of considerable talent.",8,5,7,21 December 2013
Midnight in Paris," An Allen Gem: the most romantic and original film in ages
","For any senior creative person trying to keep dry eyes during Midnight in Paris is almost an impossibility. It brings back faint memories and romantic desires wished for but often unfulfilled.Woody Allen takes the viewer on his own eye view of a city he long has loved more as a fantasy than a reality. He does this through atmospheric lighting and evocative music that creates tourists out of cinema goers.Owen Wilson, in the of his best performances, takes on Allen's role and he is given a gift of experiencing what he had missed by being a bit too young for the Lost Generation of the 1920s.When Wilson and Marion Cotillard stroll through a misty Parisian street to some richly romantic French music, it was like the joy of all man's desiring...a truly beautiful moment in cinema.",Null,7,9,21 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," An amusing but overly rated violent, racist Tarantino epic
","Come on IMDb there is no way this film could be rated an excellent 8.2. It's rather amusing, filled with more racial slurs than ever for the director. But the plot is plodding, with much padding which makes for the three hour length. It contains much of Tarantino's frequent ensemble actors plus Jennifer Jsson Leigh, who vies with Kurt Russell for the best performance. The acting throughout is fine as is Tarantino's direction. It's the story that is improbable with a so what, what happens next ending.The Hateful Eight may be the director's longest film, beautifully shot as his homage to westerns, but it isn't one of his best.",7,2,19,26 December 2015
We're the Millers," Funny in Spots, but Poor Script Development
","We're the Millers is an example of an overly hyped average caper comedy based largely on an alleged striptease by Jen Aniston. Honestly you saw more of her skin in the Breakup than in this film.But there were some genuine laughs throughout the film. However, Jason Sudekis let the side down with a rather trite performance that was almost slapstick in parts. I actually found him quite boring after awhile. The female cast members saved the film from being less than mediocre. Aniston and Emma Roberts turned in warm and believable performances.It's just that there were too many stupid and contrived spots that spoiled the show.",6,1,4,29 August 2013
Ender's Game," A Flawed Metaphor for American Foreign Policy
","If you were expecting a sci fi outer space saga you might be let down by Ender's Game. Most of the film involves boot camp for starship troopers. Still, as a film it is engaging through a good performance from Asa Butterfield.The film's messages heads towards the idea that there always will be an adversary trying to destroy human (or American) civilization. If this is the idea, while there may be some validity to this, it's a bit of a stretch.The climax or anti climax, was rather evident ahead of time and the ending seems like the writers ran out of of ideas as I have for this review. Its worth a watch but more quickly forgettable than Gravity.",6,0,2,19 January 2014
No Strings Attached," Longtime Friends Agree to Sex Only Relationship
","'When Harry Met Sally' has proved to be the moral template for most of today's romantic comedies, with the key classic statement: 'Men and women can't be friends because the sex thing always gets in the way.' In 'No Strings Attached' Ashton Kutcher, who has become a sort of unofficial rom/com king, has finally realized a successful romantic conclusion after a series of poorly written film finales.The jist of this film is simple and predictable. Kutcher and Natalie Portman were childhood friends who meet while in college and then later all in the space of 15 years.Portman, who has emotional issues, only wants a sexual involvement, which Kutcher agrees to. Of course the obvious happens and leads to a romantic and happy conclusion.There is also supporting help from Kevin Klein and Lake Bell. But, the chemistry and honesty between the leads is what puts this flick a bit above most of the Jennifer Aniston style rom/coms. Even so, No Strings isn't heavy going...just a nice date film.",7,2,5,17 April 2011
Before Sunset," Two star crossed lovers meet again after 9 years
","It would be interesting to know the gestation of this sequel to Before Sunrise, which itself was a lovely film about young love in Europe...why nine years later? Was it partly because director Richard Linklater realized how unsatisfying the ending to the first was? I have to agree with other reviewers that Before Sunset was the better of the two films largely because of the mature emotion involved. Yet, almost like the first film, Linklater leaves a question mark at the end.Will there be another episode such as After Sunset....in the mood of the Age of Innocence? The only real flaw I found in the first film was it's unrealistic ending. And, I think Linklater must have realized this, too. That's why in Before Sunset he makes reference to it a couple of time: No phone number or address.But Sunset reveals, especially in Julie Delphy's performance, a depth of emotion about lost love and redemption, seldom seen in American films. This depth is best exhibited in the SUV cab ride they share.Both Ethan Hawke and Delphy act out of their shoes in this film, a film about two life's loves, lost and then found. Have hankies handy,",10,0,0,1 April 2011
Non-Stop," Absurd from Start to Finish.
","Non Stop is an example of what some major actors will do for a big pay check.The entire plot was absurd, even though admittedly the climax was exciting, but also stupid.First, a guy who was fired from the NY Police Dept for being a drunk among other things wouldn't be hired by the US Govt. and an Air Marshall.Second, once a threat to a plane in received, the pilot would would abort the flight at the nearest airport.Third, it's never explained how his partner air Marshal fell in with the the terrorists.Fourth,never once, until the film's climax does Neeson's character attempt to explain to the passengers what's happening.Fifth, the great Julianne Moore, as a passenger, was simply a big name with no meaningful role Sixth, Neeson's superiors on the ground act more absurdly than he does.Seventh, the real culprits manage to smuggle parachutes in their hand luggage and plan to jump into the freezing mid Atlantic.Now add to this a couple of brutal fights Neeson has on the plane, yet he seems immune to bruising and swelling.This is the latest in a growing list of airline disaster films but isn't even as entertaining as Snakes on a Plane.",4,2,3,8 June 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," A Sloppy Convoluted Plot with an Incomplete Ending Leading to the Next Film
",I thougt super heros were undefeatable. Not in this action packed CGI laden film that gathers all the Marvel Comic characters for a battle to save the universe. Yet the plot seems to be all over the universe with the Avengers having a tough time in the war. The downer comes with an unfinal ending geared so you will fork out cash to see the next installment. I won't be wasting any more money on this BS.,5,0,1,29 August 2018
Elysium," A Wasted Attempt at Picturing a Possible Future World
","Elysium's main plus point was, as with Blade Runner, picturing what an over crowded world may look like. But it didn't delve anywhere as deep at Blade Runner.Instead of dwelling on one or two issues it took superficial swipes at several social problems without seeing people.We are given a now typical dystopian view of Los Angeles, where appropriately the street language has become Spanish since illegal aliens have apparently taken over the town.This has caused the power brokers and old money to decamp from Beverly Hills, I guess, to a massive space station version of Beverly Hills. But we never see the rich at play or work.In fact we never see much of this fabulous station. We just see a few leaders such as Jodie Foster, in what must be her worst role.The sad aspect is this is a very real possibility for a future world. In South Africa the wealthy white minority lives in gated guarded communities. Does this point to a bleak worldwide future? Matt Damon's character isn't a heroic type. He a small time thug who is trying to save himself until he realizes its too late. And then the film ends.",6,3,6,9 November 2013
The Artist," A new vogue has been discovered with a trite storyline
","The enormous attention this film is getting is because it's one if the few French movies that Americans can watch...But also, with few living people and film critics who have ever seen silent films, its almost like a new genre being discovered.I can't say I didn't enjoy The Artist, even though the plot was as old as the Jazz Singer or Wings...But to be honest, don't expect to see many more of these vintage movies...in the end the market won't support silent movies.On the other hand, the international cast of Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, John Goodman did a bang up job in this new genre...silent film. Oh, and let's not forget the dog.",6,0,2,8 February 2012
La La Land," A Colorful, Yet Forgettable Demi Musical Promotion of Hollywood
","La La Land has dominated the 2016-2017 Oscar nominations and is another example of Hollywood hype.It is a nice film, but also an overly hyped product for the benefit of the Chinese money in back of the production. Hollywood is drooling over the Chinese these days at the thought of them financing more and more of our movies, and this one in particular is like a musical promotion of the the US film industry.As for the film, while it had good acting, directing and cinema-photography, it had no memorable musical numbers and had a lousy ending combing elements films 'The Way We Were' and 'The Last Temptation of Christ.' It had me leaving the cinema less than satisfied. In that respect it violated the old rule, a light musical romance must have a happy ending. It began on a high and moronically and inexplicably ended on a low.",6,6,10,25 January 2017
Snowden," A Must See Film, Too Bad More People Haven't Seen It
","Once again Joseph Gordon Levitt has scored high marks for a personal profile after his standout balancing act in The Walk. Snowden should be a must see film for Americans, whose memories are short as to what has been building up for decades, yet peaked under the protection of the Obama Admin.For a long time after Snowden took off for Moscow people were wondering about the girl her left behind. This film cast some light on the deep love between him and Lyndsay Mills, played well by Shailene Woodley..The main criticism I had was about the content, feeling Oliver Stone should have been a bit more detailed in the type of phone hacking that was undertaken by the NSA. But, Snowden as a docudrama is excellent and a must see film for college students.",8,1,5,26 November 2016
The Shape of Water," Is This a Joke On Hollywood or Meant to Be Serious?
","Saw the Shape of Water and was baffled about all the praise...for it to win best picture means that an epic such as Dunkirk wasn't as good or better ...if the film didn't have such ominous undertones it would have been a cross between a comedy and old B movie...a mute woman meets a guy in an obvious rubber aquaman suit who looks something like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, It's love at first gulp ro the point where she fills her bathroom up with water to swim with the guy, I recall a scene such as this in a Laurel and Hardy film. We never know where the aquaman came from or what the govt. was doing with him and why Hollywood's resident pysch Mike Shannon is trying to kill him., I agree with Rex Reed about this hyped up turkey. Its win at the Oscars proves further that the Academy is as absurd as this film.",4,18,36,6 March 2018
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Love Found Around Town in the Wee Small Hours
","Even as an old fart I found this to be one of the best teen films I have ever seen, surpassed only by such gems as The Sure Thing and Say Anything.It was a great melding of kids looking for action, or in this case a mythical band called Where's Fluffy. Michael Cera (Nick) and Kat Denning (Nora) do superb jobs of playing two people, soul mates, unknown to each other except vaguely through a friend that dumped him.He's strung out over her and yet gradually realizes how much more he has in common with Nora. This plays out over one evening in new York.It's really something like a NY version of Before Sunrise.The film is highlighted by some great rock sounds throughout and when it was over I felt great.The only unexplained aspect was what an openly Jewish girl (Nora) was doing attending a New Jersey Catholic girls school.",10,0,0,17 July 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great, but hard to believe performances in a film a bit too long
","DiCaprio and especially Jonah Hill produce career best work in a fast paced film that once again exposes the evils of Wall Street. The main criticisms of Wolf are it being too long and repetitive. I mean how much and how many drugs can a person take at one time to not die? This films tries to show that. It should have been at least 30 minutes shorter.Scorsese tells the story as he did in the Goodfellas, with an off screen narrative. Yet, he fails, in his wrap-up, to show what happened to Jonah Hill's character. And in one serious script error, when DiCaprio's wife is leaving him, he says your not taking my children. Yet, we only ever see or hear of one young daughter.It would be nice to see films once in awhile that aren't about criminal types...but about people who become wealthy honestly...we had the Social Network...How about the Bill Gates story? But, maybe they're just too boring. Crooks are so much more fun.",8,1,4,15 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Weak Plot, Lack of Continuity Makes for Disappointment
","Hail Caesar, as a tribute to old Hollywood, had loads of stars, lots of atmosphere, but unlike another L.A. based Coen film, the far superior Big Lebowski, it lacked a strong plot and jumped around so much I had trouble remembering what plot there was.The highlight was Channing Tatum's dance number, which brought back memories of Gene Kelly. Other than that, there wasn't the usual Coen's biting humor or satire. There were a few funny bits such as a room full of champagne commies talking about the repressed workers from their posh ocean view estate.But for the most part, seeing Hail Caesar was a non event. Oh, and during the film being made within the film, about Christ's passion, the name Palestine was used as a term for Judea. It would be more than a hundred years for Rome to name the region Syria Palestina.",5,2,4,9 April 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Mediocre Even If a Made for TV Movie
","Comparing this version of the film to the 1974 version is like comparing a lavish film production to a rather dull, dark and rushed made for TV movie. Once again Kenneth Brannah,. who stars and directs, proved he should stick to the Bard. His accent as Poirot is worse than the my spelling of his name. His direction is rushed and boring, the stellar cast has little do or say and the story is an abriged version of the original film. Even the film score was a total non event as was the train journey. and the climax.",4,1,1,28 January 2018
Arrival," Again, Hollywood Hype Creates a Vastly Over-rated Hit
","The only way Arrival could have cost $47 million to make would be for the actors to get most of that sum. There just wasn't much to the film in both location filming and special effects.It seems to me the production company may have been trying to do a number on the IRS come tax time. There were only five basic locations: Amy Adam's home in the film, the college where she teaches, the army base, the field where the alien spacecraft was and a very nondescript spaceship interior.As for the film...in other times it would be a B sci-fi movie. But these days, the millennials are making into a mind bending sci-fi masterpiece, which it isn't.We are supposed to buy that technically advanced giant squid-like creatures not only build huge spacecraft and travel all over the galaxy, but they can foretell the future as well. And apparently one of their visions told them to come to the Earth...more specifically 12 of them come to Earth, hovering peacefully over various nations.Yet, with this on their minds, if they have any, and all their evolutionary and inter galactic knowledge they don't have a simple tourist English phrase book among them...they can't communicate with anyone. That is until Adams comes along. She's a linguist recruited by the army to translate a single grunt sound that came from the aliens. Good luck on that.The aliens hold an open house for the earthlings hoping that someone will talk to them. Adams rises into the ship and meets the space aliens who appear behind a glass barrier (we assume their atmosphere is different from earth's). The outer space cephalopods seem to be dancing around similar as marionettes would do...except no strings are visible. It's really out of the campy 1950s movie scene.Nothing much is explained in the film which leaves the audience to figure out how Adams finally communicates with the visitors. At the end you are left with questions and no definite answers.",6,7,14,19 January 2017
Parasite," An entertaining, yet over the top, metaphor for rich and poor in contemporary society
","The director seems obsessed with the battle between the have and have nots...Parasite.in essence, was similar to his sci film Snow Piercer, where the poor battle to reach the home of the wealthy.in Parasite we have a poor unemployed family trying to get ahead at the largesse of a wealthy family, which they con into employing them. Things eventually go bad because they abused the breaks they had given them.In the end I was left with an unsatisfied feeling...as if justice had not been done.",7,1,7,10 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," To Call this Well Acted Film a Comedy is No Joke to Mental Illness
","Birdman is not a film for everyone...you have to love b&W abstract cinema. But for some reviewers to call this a comedy is a gross insult to the mentally ill. It's a story about a fading film actor trying to make it on Broadway with a play he wrote, directed and acted in.But Michael Keaton, racked with pressure and bills, has another problem...he's a schizophrenic nearing a psychotic collapse. He hears voices throughout the film and is convinced he has telekinetic powers. Much of the film deals with his demons, which are hardly funny. I find it mind boggling how critics can think this is a laugh riot...It isn't.Birdman is dramatic tour de force for Keaton...but as a film I found the hand held camera style rather tedious for a movie that in the end had a thin plot line.",6,4,9,11 January 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Masterful Hype Job on the Worst Major Film of the Year
","The massive hype preceding Fifty Shades assured it would be a big box office hit...I never read the book and against my better judgment viewed the film.I should have known...all hype and little bite in a film that has virtually no distinguishable plot...it may have been developing but that's when the film ended leaving you with the knowledge that a sequel may be on the way.We are given the rather absurd premise that a respectable young college senior and career virgin will jump into bed and into bondage as the willing sex slave of a billionaire. From there the film goes no where...oh, and with all the nudity, no pubes are shown.If the book is anything like the film, I find it amazing this tepid successor to the 50's Peyton Place made the best seller list.",3,1,4,14 March 2015
The Greatest Showman," Everything La La Land wasn't: A genuine rip roaring feel good musical
","The Greatest Showman is the type of film seldom seen anymore...a genuine Hollywood musical with some great talents on display headed by Mr. Everything Hugh Jackman, And the early on song and dance number with him and marvelous Michelle Williams (who can forget her riveting performance in Manchester by the Sea) was beautiful. This is the type of film worth a high priced cinema ticket.",9,2,5,30 March 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," Superb Acting in a Debatable Hollywood Story
","First, and many people never learn this,virtually everything produced by Hollywood,based on fact, eventually becomes fiction due to rewrite after rewrite. That's why there's controversy over the validity of the story.Saying this, Saving Mr.Banks is a great way to see two moving performances, that of Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell. Thompson's portrayal of P.J. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, is wonderful, and I'm speaking as an American married to just such a proper English woman,who in travers case was actually Australian.And Farrell as her father once again show his enormous range as an actor in an underplayed sensitive role.Quite honestly, at first notice you might not even care about the story of Mary Poppins being made into a film. But once involved in the movie, you can't help liking it.The only thing I found missing script-wise was a bridging scene on how PJ came to live in London after a childhood in the Outback.",7,1,4,28 December 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Good Film about a Very Unlikeable Guy
","For me the best part of Inside Llewyn Davis came right at the end when he gets the crap knocked out of him. Because this is the story, as good as its told, of a self centered A....hole. I mean you sit through nearly two hours of 60s memories in the company of one of the most unlikeable characters to grace the screen in a long time.I know he's an eccentric artist and Oscar Issac does a great job...especially his wonderful singing bits...but in the end he's the same loser as he was when the film began.As for the film,the only real negative aspect is its length because his life being so one dimensional as a parasite, the story could have been told in half the time. But you have to credit the Coen's for adding another string to their diverse bow of fine films.",7,0,0,24 January 2014
