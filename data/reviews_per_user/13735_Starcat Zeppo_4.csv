E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A timeless classic....
","I've read the reviews of this movie and I was shocked. I thought everyone loved this movie as much as I do. I was 9 when it was first released, and I saved Birthday money and conned every family member I could to take me to see it as many times as I could. This movie, although almost 20 years old, still holds water against all the COMPUTER generated special effects of today. There are parts of the movie so detailed you can see E.T.'s veins and temples pulse. Although Drew Barrymore's cheesy performance makes my stomach turn, I can over look that. This movie, torn apart for it's 'unbelievability' (which is the most MINDLESS argument against a FICTIONAL movie I can imagine) is a heart warming story of a boy who's lost and alone looking for a friend. Here's an alien also left alone. Elliot's parents are separated--a point made more than once in the movie. This can have an effect on any 10 year old, then and now, and he's also the 'middle' child. Here he finds E.T. and is able to love, and be loved, without question. I paid to see it 10 times when I was a kid. I went to see it in the theaters AGAIN on it's re-release in 1985-ish (?). I own the original copy released on video, and then bought it AGAIN when it was re-released on video with interviews from Stephen and cast. I own over 300 movies and none of them have received that kind of love and attention from me. Parents can watch this with their kids, or.... without them.",10,1,2,15 June 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," This Generation's 'Breakfast Club'
","I stumbled upon this movie, I had no great intentions of seeing it... but I'm glad I did.I haven't walked down a high school hall way in over 10 years, yet I found the adolescent inside loving every moment of this movie. I thought the entire cast did a GREAT job, and I'm hoping to see Heath Ledger (did I get that name right?) in more movies to come.  Someone else mentioned this but I have to, HAVE to repeat it just to make sure no one misses it.... WAIT until the credits have rolled, because there are some GREAT out takes at the end of this movie!!!I don't think, in response to another comment, that 'rapping' a Shakespeare poem is wrong for a teacher to do. ANYTHING that will get a new generation hooked to the classics is fine---if you don't think so, watch Mr. Holland's Opus.  HE was about strung from the rafters for using Rock N Roll to teach music, and it worked.  I wish some of the snoozer teachers I had in school had been that creative (although some of the language the teacher used would NEVER fly in a real school... unless things have drastically changed in 10-15 years!)",Null,0,0,9 December 1999
Grease," John Travolta... (sigh)
","It could be that my emotional attachment to this movie stems from the fact that it was the first flick my older siblings took me to see in the theaters, but I doubt it.  Or it could be the life long crush I've had on Travolta, but I doubt that too.I've watched this movie time and time again, and yes, there are times that the actors OBVIOUS age differences from that of teen agers JUMP off the screen... but this movie is FUN. It's not an earth shattering special effect hyper flick, it's not over flowing with great emotion... it's just FUN.The only really negative thing I can think to say about this movie is that it spawned a sequel..... Grease 2 is total JUNK, but this original.... it's wonderful.  Simple as that.",Null,0,1,13 December 1999
Scream 2," Waiting for a third helping please....
","I have to laugh as I view these reviews at how disenchanted every one is....Let me lump Scream and Scream 2 into the same review:  Scream's tribute to the genre that made it possible (70's and 80's slasher flicks) was CLASSIC. Not since Friday the 13th or Halloween have I had so much fun with a horror movie.  I was scared in the theater, and I LOVED it.  Let's use this years 'The Haunting' as contrast:  The Haunting took itself WAAAYYY too seriously, and it stunk.  It was a big nutty turd floating away with a big budget, and it was just pure swill.  Scream 2:  Yes, there were a LOT of similar points from one to two... and therein was the charm of the inside joke about making FUN OF THE HORROR SEQUEL RUN ON PROBLEM. It's known that there are going to be three Scream movies.  Let's save the sequel slamming for Friday the 13th part 957. Granted, the whole IDEA behind Scream 2 is unbelievable, but it's a MOVIE. WHEN did every one become SOOOO concerned with what is probable in a MOVIE?? I want to pay my $7.50 for a ticket and be entertained, and that's what this movie, along with the first Scream did.*******SPOILERS AHEAD****** I loved it in Scream 2 that they wanted you to 'think' it was Sid's boyfriend, right down to the superficial wound he sustained when chasing the killer.  Granted, the film student had nothing to do with squat, but bringing back Billy's mother was a HOOT!  I'm so curious to see who the killer(s) are going to be in 3.  I guess I'm stupid, because I DIDN'T guess the killers in 2.  I didn't try to.  I wanted to watch a movie, and have fun with it, and not try to see if I was soooo much smarter than the writers and FORGET that I was being entertained.When 3 comes out in theaters, I'm gonna rent one and two (if I don't own them by that time) and watch those first THEN go see number 3.  If you want to knock on the new horror of the 90's, go to the I know what you did last summer board....",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
