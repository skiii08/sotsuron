Ford v Ferrari," Who ever says is only for car lovers, is a liar
","I am not a cars fan, I didn't know the history behind this movie, after a little research, of course isn't 100% fact because isn't a documentary.
Taking previous considerations, the script doesn't add anything without a purpose, the movie is engaging from first to the last scene. All actors have great chemistry each other, the CGI is barely noticeable, this is a true wonderful REAL car's movie. If not fans of automobiles really enjoy this, car lovers are going to love it.
The photography put the viewers in the action and emotions, it's wonderful too. One of the best movies of the year. This movie is gonna keep growing and growing in box office because no good movie passes without many people noticing.",10,1,4,19 November 2019
