The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Project ... the worst movie I ever saw!
","While looking for reviews on a few movies I have seen lately and knowing that Blair Witch Project was the worst movie I had ever seen, I just had to send in a review when I saw it got an over-all 6.3. That number has to be a joke for many reasons.1) The movie had no real plot or content. 2) The filming was so shaky it made you dizzy. 3) The acting was horrible with people without communication skills. 4) As we were leaving the theater we noted no one looked at each other as they appeared to be too embarrassed for having spent money to see this movie. 5) I am sure you really don't want me to go on .........",1,4,8,13 May 2013
