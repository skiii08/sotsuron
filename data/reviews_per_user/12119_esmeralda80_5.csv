Walk the Line," fun but overlong and simplistic
","Given the lousy films out there this year, this picture is far better than most. It does not, however, stand up to last year's 'Ray', which is strongly resembles. Nor does the film touch on the particularly interesting thing about Johnny Cash, the spiritual duality of his nature. Cash was was strongly Christian but was open about the fact that he had committed all of the seven deadly sins. His humanity came from his humility about his own shortcomings. His core Christianity is barely touched upon here. Actual incidents from Cash's life are totally fictionalized. A strong story point is made of the fact that Cash's father blamed him for the death of his brother. A reading of Cash's most recent autobiography indicates this was never the case. Cash seems to appreciate and revere the hardships experienced by his poor, hard working father. Yet the film continues to portray Cash's hard scrabble parents, the source of his authentic 'country' background, as simple- minded, cruel and cold. It is no wonder that June Carter's daughter walked out of a recent screening of the film in anger. The final resolution of the story is weak. The film takes the position that Cash beat his addiction quickly once he won the heart of June. In 'Walk the Line', she saves him as she triumphantly chases his dealer from the property. The family of any addict can attest that a cure is never that easy. And in reality, Cash continued to struggle with drugs for much of his life. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is excellent, gives the film a gravitas it would otherwise lack.",7,1,5,28 November 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Extraordinary film, Oscar contender
","This is a visually stunning film that packs an emotional wallop. It builds slowly and takes its time, but is never boring. Heath Ledger delivers a heartbreaking performance as a man who wastes his life because he cannot accept his own nature. Any fears one might have that the material will cause discomfort or inappropriate laughter are quickly dispelled. The pure quality of the observation, the depth of the intellect displayed both in the script and behind the camera, the sensitive level of the performances and the high quality of all technical credits translate into a rare cinematic experience. The cinematography is a lock for the Oscar. The spare and elegant screenplay is also a strong contender. Ledger will surely be nominated and possibly Gyllenhall. See it on a big screen with the best sound possible.",9,12,24,3 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," An arty-farty mess
","This is the most overrated movie of the year. It is endless, confused, and a pure example of a filmmaker who has utterly lost his way. Daniel Day Lewis puts in a dreadful performance in which he seems to be attempting to channel John Houston. He is, quite simply, doing Houston in The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The screenplay structure is hopeless and meandering. The length of the film is self-indulgent and unwarranted. This may fool people in this calendar year. It has apparently fooled many critics and perhaps members here, although I suspect studio shills account for the good rating. There Will be Blood will soon be dust. It will never, ever stand the test of time.",1,40,153,18 December 2007
American Gangster," slick but ultimately boring
","This is a beautifully directed film that is without a point or a theme and is about unpleasant people. Both leads do a good job but are woefully miscast. The visuals are dazzling but it's impossible to care about anyone. You follow a 70's heroin dealer, played by Washington, and the honest but emotionally bankrupt cop who is after him, played by Crowe. As a result, unlike the Godfather, you never are rooting for either character. The drug dealer is glorified, his amoral acts painstakingly justified by events in his past, when in fact this is a man who imported vast amounts of a deadly drug that decimated the culture and hope of his own people. The cop is friendless, sells out his only buddy, is unemotional when that buddy is killed, and is shown neglecting his son and screwing random one night stands over and over. If you didn't get the point the first time, hold on, you'll have seven more chances to get it. The first hour is entertaining enough, although any intelligent viewer will squirm at the idolization of Denzel's drug dealer. After that, the middle is repetitive and drags. I have no clue what the screenplay is trying to say, or what the director believes the film to be about. I wonder if Denzel Washington would like his children to admire the character he plays as much as he seems to.",5,14,38,3 November 2007
Casino Royale," Best Bond ever
","Super charged testosterone popcorn movie with a great love story at its core. What more could you want? How about locations that will gob-smack you and state of the art action sequences. This is the must see film of the holiday season. Want to forget about your daily grind and live in the fantasy world of a great tough-guy hero? Paul Haggis scores again with a screenplay far beyond most action films. And it's faithful to the book, has humor but no irony. Aren't we sick of irony? I never thought I could love a blond Bond, but he's fantastic. And instead of watching girls in bikinis come out of the ocean and fall into Bond's bed, we get to see the man himself come out of the ocean in a tight little Speedo. The six pack delivers big time. See it all on a big screen with the best sound. This is not one to wait for the DVD. It's a MOVIE.",10,27,55,14 November 2006
