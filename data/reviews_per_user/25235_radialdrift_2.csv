Blade Runner 2049," A Sequel that didn't need to be made
","I loved the original film, it left me wondering what just happened and where did the story go after the credits rolled, and that was fine for me. The Sequel just never takes off, it spends a lot of time selling the idea of the previous film, before it tries to come up with something new. There are many, many scenes in this film that are pointless and drawn out. They attempt to create an underlying theme but all they do is extend out parts of the film needlessly. Jared Leto's performance, in particular, is over acted and drawn out. His entire story line could be left out and the movie would function exactly the same, and would actually be more enjoyable. One of the scenes later in the film really ruins the legacy of the original. It was a homage that was as awful as the Leia scene in Rouge One.The main story is mildly interesting to a point, but it gets watered down with all the auxiliary re-hashed ideas from the previous film. Where as the original was a believable piece of Sci-Fi, this has scene after scene that leaves you sitting there thinking, 'So that just happened how exactly?' Not worth the trip to the cinemas, glad my ticket was free.",6,18,47,5 October 2017
Alien: Covenant," Hangup your Coat Ridely, you are no longer Relevant
","There was a time in cinema when Ridley Scott was relevant. Prometheus showed us that he was past his prime, and any ability that he once had, was lost in a fest pool of gibberish and poor direction. So we move onto Alien: Covenant, and one can say Ridley has continued in his path of being an irrelevant movie maker, it is really time for him to end his career. This film felt like a lesson in amateur cinema, there are story telling decisions in this film that have been seen and done 100 times before, but somehow Ridely thought, lets do it 101 times. This film has zero innovation and some of the editing choices are very bad, some scenes drag on needlessly, in an attempt to build drama, but it falls flat every time. Without spoiling the story, some examples of the amateur story telling is - 'don't go there, OK lets go there', 'we shouldn't do that, OK lets do that', 'don't shoot inside the ship, OK lets shoot inside the ship' There is not much to be positive about with regards to the story telling in this film, after 20 minutes, you know exactly what is going to happen, and the way it has been edited and directed, it feels telegraphed and lazy. The dialogue between characters is poor, very poor, and the connection between the cast is off. I didn't know much about the film going in, but lets just say, it adds zero to the franchise and doesn't add to Prometheus. Time to hang up the coat Ridley, your ideas are old and so very predictable. At one point that I thought this film might be a spoof.",4,10,19,19 May 2017
