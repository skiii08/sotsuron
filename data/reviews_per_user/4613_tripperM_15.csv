The Devil's Advocate," NOT rosemary's baby...
","if you want to really get into a film about paranoia, fears, loneliness,oh-and the devil...see rosemary's baby. it is much better than this loose up-date.if you love the over-the-top acting ability of al pacino and the shatneresque qualities of kanu reeves, than this is a good update. don't get me wrong, i dig the film, it's in my collection. the acting is fun and the story is good, it gives you kind of the 'flip-side' of the coin. (DA gives you HIS point of view of what transpires while RB gives you the female view.) the pace is up and even. the ending could've used a little adjusting. but all in all it's good.the only thing it really shares closely with rosemary's baby is the wonderfully terrified leading ladies. (charlene theron and mia farrow) the women and their journey through hell and back while their hubbies get everything handed to them on a silver platter is an excruciating and lonely ride. the most believable acting comes from these brutilized women. their lives are torn apart, their loves have betrayed them; and the devil? ...he wins.",Null,0,1,10 January 2001
Fight Club," fight it forward...
","my father once said as a joke,'just because i don't know and don't care, doesn't mean i'm stupid and apathetic.'he never spoke truer words. tyler durden never spoke truer words.our forefathers had the american revolution, our great-grand fathers had the civil war, our grand-fathers had the world wars, our fathers had the cold wars. what do we have? computers and beepers, mortgages and jobs we hate. between the false love-you c**p of the 70's, the false love-me c**p of the 80's, and the false cyber-cerebral c**p of the 90's; we've separated each other not only from society but from ourselves. we're disgruntled americans with nothing to fight against except ourselves. we will finally destroy ourselves with extreme sports, extreme toys, and jobs that give us extreme ulcers.tyler's voice is extreme, his methods are extreme, his reality is extreme, his point his extreme.gen-x is getting an extreme wake up call - and fight club is it.",9,0,1,2 November 2000
Billy Elliot," the best coming of age movie since the hey day of john hughes' films...
","i just started college in 1984 and remember the news and videos of the mining strikes at the time. the violence, the brutality, where family values were, where 'a man's place' was, what individualty did to a young one's self image and self esteam. bringing down the wall, bringing down barriers, stepping out of the box. god! i remember those awkard days in jr. high and high school so busy trying to find yourself that you loose sight of the person in the mirror...",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
Insomnia," there is no darkness to hide the guilt...
","i was a little apprehensive at first because i had been so impressed with the swedish film of the same name. there have been so many BAD remakes as of late, so i viewed this with no expectations.i got a great thriller that kept me interested and on edge till the last even though i knew the basic storyline. al pacino, as always, is top notch and martin donovan (trust, nadja) was a surprising although short lived addition to the cast. (i've seen him in hal hartley's films and really like his subtle style) hillary swank (boys don't cry) shines as the young, anxious, and clearminded local cop who helps her 'hero' with the investigation at first, but get's put on the ajoining case and succeeds in finding truth and reality in her small town.",Null,0,1,9 February 2003
Lost in Translation," sophia coppola has done it again
","'genuine film talent runs in the blood. sophia coppola's debut is so perfectly done that it'll be hard for her to top...' that's the first line in my review for VS. well, she did top that with this wonderfully calm moment of 'reality'. LIT is a quiet and thoughtful piece of work. you feel the abandonment that charlotte feels as the newlywed in a big new world. you want to explore something like this with someone. and bob's obtuse attitude towards life is shaken up when he finds himself needed for more than just a charicature of his former self. i loved it. it's nice to know that even though independent film has now been turned into a hollywood genre, there are really independent ideas still floating around...",Null,0,0,8 February 2004
Pitch Black," a sci-fi flick with flare...
","i popped in pitch black expecting yet another alien rip-off with b-acting, imac graphics, and a wafer-thin plot.what i got was a cimematic thrill-ride. these aliens give Alien something to think about, the film has a b feel, but the acting isn't. Vin Diesel is sharp and menacing as riddick the bad/good guy. the graphics were smooth and not intrussive. the plot is thin but quick paced.the thing that 'awed' me the most is the cinematography. lush, vivid, and imaginative, the use of effects for the surface, riddick's view, and the aliens' view is the best use of artistic cinematography in a long while - especially for sci-fi.the editing kept the pace quick and the tension high.",Null,0,0,27 November 2000
Mission: Impossible II," 1/2 cruise, 1/2 woo. so it's 1/2 a good movie....
","too much cruise, not enough woo! or is it too much woo in a tom cruise film!?!?if it had been a woo film complete with chow yun-fat as the lead, set in n.y or hong kong, more personal vendetta; it would have been much better. i love the stylings of john woo and you can see the woo trademark moves and motivations (slo-mo fight scenes and true love). this was mission:impossible meets the killer - they shouldn't have been introduced.this was a good tom cruise vehicle and he really got to push the limits of his tough-guys status (hoping to replace the cocky-cute-guy thing, i hope). he's growing into the action hero very well. i like his films now better than the early flicks. now if this was a mission:impossible film rather that a woo film with tom cruise in it, i think it would gave gone over better that way, too.it's just that the mix of the genres and ideas for the film was obviously oil and water. woo had his ideas and cruise had his (mainly showing off his weathered good looks in close-up after close-up). it should have been two different films, but since they weren't; enjoy the woo film first, and if your interested after that, then go back and watch tom cruise pose...",Null,0,0,30 November 2000
Rosemary's Baby," one of the best in horror/suspense...(spoiler)
","i love the pace of this film. it starts off slow and innocent then steers itself through the the lives of rosemary and guy in a spiraling parranoia.after rosemary gets druggedand raped by the devil, the surrealism of the drug induced dream-state is chilling ciematography at its best. the ultra close-ups and cubist editing is well used here. rosemary wakes up to a world now invasive and evil.the rest of the film moves with this parranoia in mind.her constant need for religious forgiveness tells us more of her uneasiness and fears than the rest of the film.this isn't a dream... this is really happening! luckily, this is only a movie...",Null,0,0,10 January 2001
Scream 2," there are rules to surviving a horror movie...
","the more i watch this extensively researched trilogy; the more inside gags, references, and homages i see. there's classic horror, modern horror, literary, social, and political references as well as references to other serority movies and even parodies and references to itself.the best new-hollywood horror trilogy and the ground breaker for other (mostly bad) new-hollywood horror films. in 20 years, techno-hollywood will be paying homage to kevin williamson and wes craven.",Null,0,0,6 November 2000
The Green Mile," wow....just....WOW!
","i just got through being glued the tele for 3 solid,wonderful, magical, difficult, sadening hours. i'm not one for wispy tom hanks films (forrest gump was good but, to me, not spectacular; although i do love ron howard's directing)but.. jimminey! this was quite a rollercoaster ride. if the academy in all their self preserving intelligence does not finally just admit that steven spielberg is an accomplished director now, their NUTS. speilberg has been snubbed for the past 20 years (not by us) as that dude that does action/sci fi. although he brought us beautiful films like the colour purple, empire of the sun,he went virtually unnoticed by his peers until 1995 whe he received American Film Institute Life Achievement. i guess you need to bleed for the academy and in 98 he did with saving private ryan.(this is also where i think tom hanks REALLY shined) i am hoping this magical duo of hanks and spielberg will again get the recognition they deserve.oh.... the film... it is something indescribable. it is a MUST SEE. it WILL change you.",Null,0,1,20 October 2000

Blade Runner," the worst thing ridley scott did was release the director's cut!
","i'll probably get hell for this but, i was lucky enough to get a wide screen version of the 'not' director's cut of BR and i love it! (i don't play it often, now, it IS 15 years old...) i IS after all a film-noir piece, and what is a good film-noir piece with out the voice-over? it goes along with the trench coat and the fem fatal in dire need. with out those elements, it's just another action flick. i know it was labeled a 'cyberpunk' film at one point, but that was after the fact. it's as much a cyber-film as switch-blade sisters is a cool film. (Quentin Tarantino made the film 'cool' after he endorsed it - almost 20 years after the fact!) i was so excited when BR hit dvd that i ALMOST got it. then those harrowing words were blazened on the front: 'the director's cut' ! the extra footage was wonderful and added greatly to the film, but where did the voice-over go? it made the film as far as i was concerned. the lack of it made the film more muddled and incoherent. i'm glad that sci-fi decided to show the original wide screen version on sunday (6/4/200) now i can record that (minus commercials - for shame sci-fi!)and view it to my heart's content!B*B*tripperM",10,0,1,2 June 2000
The Matrix," the new cyber bible?
","There has been so much religious comparisons on the Matrix pages that I have seen, it's astounding. beyond that... the Matrix is a film that you can view repeatedly and still find new things, new inside comments, nods, and jokes, and new angles of Keanu Reeves to stare at. Beyond that still is the best cyberfilm to come out of the 90's. In fact I would go so far as to say that it's the best cyberfilm since Bladerunner. (which is a pre-mainstream cyber awareness film to begin with) and even though I like it, I can't with good conscience include J.Mnemonic as a good cyberfilm. The f/x, story line, and cinematography is fluid and beautiful. Laurence Fishburne is as always subtle and larger that life as Morpheus. Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity kicks almost as much butt as Milla Jovovich's Leeloo but with the grace of a crane. Joe Pantoliano is wonderfully understated as our friendly, greasy Judas - Cypher. Watch it...and dream...",9,0,0,12 May 1999
The Replacements," '...and here goes falco...'
","this little film has a lot of action and fun. it's a lot like necessary roughness with a more believable cast-acting and agewise.keanu still surprises me. when i think that he's been acted out, that he's played all sides, he pulls something out of his hat. he trained and beefed up for this. gene hackmen's tough father figure is great. he love's his guys and it shows.the soundtrack (if it has any of the songs IN the film) is great.",Null,0,1,8 January 2001
High Fidelity," say everything...
","there are so many similarities between say anything and high fidelity - rain, phonebooths, tshirts, and totally blowing it with the woman you love before the self-absorbing catharsis ends. i really like john cusak's work, and there is great timing with joan. say anything is one of my favorites from the late 80's. 
guess what... the 80's are on the rise again and high fidelity is a great film to set the pace...",Null,0,1,13 November 2000
