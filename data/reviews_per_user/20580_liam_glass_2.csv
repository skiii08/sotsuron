It," We all float
","Re watching the movie after reading a majority of the book I have to say I rather enjoyed this film, compared to its previous TV 2 part mini movie. The film is within it's right to be it's own thing or different, whilst also paying homage to the book.Characters are played very well some have their character over played to their description in the book but yet that can be brushed off. The late 80s vibes to the film is nostalgic and yet it also feels modern.
The acting and effects that go into Bill's pennywise is phenomenal and extremely entertaining.Some effects are choppy and some main/important points from the book are missing along the film.
Yeah the film has its flaws and weak points and may too feel rushed but it works, not all films or moments will scare you and that's just you but this film needs to people to move on from the 1990s film and understand that not all films which is 100% true to the original source material will work or is best.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," 6th time the charm I guess
","Sony's 6th run of a spiderman film whilst also starting their own spiderman villain universe and by far this film is the best thing to have happened for Sony since spiderman 2. The characters all well written, very little of the characters story was changed as the old saying goes if it ain't broke don't fix it, the animation is done excellent and it's nice to see a new way of how animation can be done. Sony you have out done yourself with this, continue and greater things will come but remember walk before you run!.",10,3,7,21 February 2019
