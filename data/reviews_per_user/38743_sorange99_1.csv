Iron Man 3," Entertaining action/comedy if you prefer to not think while watching movies
","Like my title says, this is a pretty great movie...if you don't think about it. I think my forehead now bears a permanent imprint of the palm of my hand.If you're looking for a visually stunning action movie accompanied by witty, snide remarks by Robert Downy Jr. and unexplainable science fiction nonsense, this is the movie for you. If you want a good vs evil movie with a villain that has sensible motives, goals, and intentions, save your money and watch something else at home.Much like Prometheus or The Avengers, Iron Man 3 is very entertaining but becomes more and more illogical as it goes on. The plot twists feel forced. Some of them you can see coming and the ones that were actual surprises were nonsensical and underwhelming.Also, the highly anticipated post-credit scene was not at all worth sitting through the extensive credits for and gave almost no information about upcoming Marvel Universe installments.Overall, it was fun to watch but I found myself cringing quite a bit at the logical gaps and unnecessary crap. I won't be watching it again unless I'm with a group of friends that insists we put it on.",3,3,6,5 May 2013
