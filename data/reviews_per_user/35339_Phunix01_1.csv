The Ring," Great horror, room for a possible (American) sequel?
","I'm not going to hide it, I love this movie. But it isn't going to love you back, as you are going to exit the theater with major goosebumps.For those who don't want too many spoilers: It's creepy, it'll get to you, you'll want to analyze it to death afterwards. Now go see it.(spoilers ahead) The Ring is a remake of the Japanese blockbuster Ringu. The only thing that the American version has extra in it is the relation to horses.The Japanese Ringu already has several sequels. But now with the relation to horses and with the scenes at the asylum with the x-rays of the horses, along with several other scenes in the movie, an intresting conclusion might lead to a very creepy sequel.Since Samara's mother (Anna) was not able to conceive a child, perhaps Richard Morgan wanted to give her the greatest gift of all, a child. And in his desperation to give them the only thing needed to reach perfect happiness was through invitro. Only, he impregnated not a human carrier, but a mare (female horse). Noone knew until the mare gave birth. Anna found out, went bananas and threw herself off a cliff. And obviously Samara wasn't all 1+1 either. She turned out to have special powers, alongside a twisted personality. And those powers only grew ripe when she got killed.Put together (day)dreams, horses and a monster. What do you get?Incubus/succubus: A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.(male form) The devils who appeared in the female form were generally called succubi; those who appeared like men incubi, though this distinction was not always preserved. They were also known to evoke TERRIFYING DREAMS. In other words: -nightmares-.Here is where American bases screenwriters can take off and leave the original scrips behind, and make it worthwhile to have made a remake of the first Ringu.Would be nice to see a 'The Ring' meets 'Exorcist' meets 'Nightmare on Elm Street'",10,0,0,27 October 2002
