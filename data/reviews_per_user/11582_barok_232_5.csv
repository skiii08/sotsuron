Iron Man 3," Awful
","Just for the cgi I give it 3 stars. They knew they weren't going for a 4th installment so they didn't care killing this movie. I feel deceived by all the trailers because there was no hint there I was about to see a Resident-Evil type of movie. Mandarin I saw on the trailers but that was just a decoy, not only for the film, but for us too, for he is not the real villain in the movie! The real villain is this stupid guy that invented this injection turning you into some kind of zombie-t1000 type of human being!!!This movie doesn't really need a detailed review so I'll be brief.Pros: The cgi, the airplane sequence where Iron Man saves a bunch of people and how he achieves that(because THAT'S what heroes do)Cons: the stupid 'zombie' plot, everybody's acting except Ben Kingsley's, the fact that the Mandarin was not the villain but just an actor, the flashback setting the beginning of this stupid story back in 1999, Pepper Pots being too involved in the film, Tony Stark being too involved with Pepper Pots (reminded me of the Maguire-Dunst failure in the 3rd Spiderman), Tony Stark and the little kid, some mediocre jokes, Tony Stark having anxiety panics (I didn't like Robert Downey's acting there either), Iron Patriot, Tony Stark's new way of wearing the suit (it looked cool in the trailer, but it really wasn't, plus it didn't make sense that he could summon the suit from 3000 miles away!!!!), Stark's new way of controlling the suits without wearing them (this really spoils the whole idea of Iron Man, although generally a smart thought)If you are a fan of the first 2 Iron Man movies (and of course the Avengers) you might want to skip watching this one at the cinema and save your money. Rent it once it's out on DVD. Let's see how the new Avengers film rescues Iron Man from the mud Iron Man 3 has let him sink",3,63,124,26 April 2013
Us," A kick to the crotch
","I loved 'Get Out' and simply CANNOT believe the same person did THIS!The plot is forced and utterly silly, acting is laughable, music is generic and irritating, pacing is very boring, editing is awful at times, lighting/photography/directing is mediocre and uninspiring and everything is unrelatable.To sum up, this is cinema at its worst and everyone who even attempts to make sense out of this crap (eg find symbolisms and allegories etc) is a moron pretending to be smart and cinema-savvy.Had there been an option to give a zero rating, I would honestly have given it",1,4,10,30 May 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," I miss Sam Raimi...
","The movie S-U-C-K-S. Not exaggerating one bit. Everything feels so generic, CGI is so bad it almost feels like watching video game cut-scenes during the action sequences, there is nothing really going on despite the fact that Peter wants to convince Tony that he is worthy to be an Avenger (childish all the way- what a hero!). Emotionally empty movie with silly jokes and Easter eggs, bad- indifferent cinematography, bad performances from everyone (Holland is NOT Peter Parker, Keaton did his Beatlejuice mannerisms once again, Marisa Tomei cute as always but miscast, the rest of the cast either underdeveloped or amateur at best). This movie is just suits and tech. I could go on bashing it forever not only for not being loyal to Spiderman comics but also for being more of a TV show rather than a movie. Forgot to mention that there is a lot of stupidity throughout the movie for instance no physics in there (plus more but I'd have to go frame by frame to discuss those). Never before in my life have I been so baffled from the critics' and audience's consensus. 93% on rotten tomatoes??? WTF! We deserve junk like that then. Since you like talking movie morals why don't you all take a minute to think about this: If the cinema is going downhill maybe YOU are responsible too (since you like garbage like Spiderman Homecoming)",1,130,215,13 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing Spiderman a total failure
","This movie is a cash-in.First thing that occurred to me was that I previously saw everything worth watching in the movie's trailer.For example, note that Spidey's swinging scenes which are spread out in the trailer ended up being one scene in the movie (the crane scene)!Also,I didn't see ONE new bit of action in the movie that I hadn't already seen in the trailer and if I did,it was not a highlight.It really gets on my nerves when Hollywood manages to fool me with an impressive trailer that I am going to see a good movie, only to discover that it's far from that.It is more than obvious that everyone's eyes are on the Parker character, played by Garfield.I believe he did a decent job with what he was given and if at times there was some awkwardness with the character,it wasn't his fault.The bad thing is at some points I got a 'Harry Potter' feeling by him.The rest of the cast did well,Stone was great and cute,Field and Sheen felt like cameo appearances just to help the film sell more(although happy to have seen them),Leary was very fitting to the role of captain Stacey and Ifans was sufficient as Connors(again he did nothing wrong,not his fault that his character was poorly developed). I also got a question here: would a half-arm person lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the Peter-Gwen romance,it was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I honestly couldn't care less.And besides,there are only repeated references of that matter and no actual clues to follow,another cheat sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting bitten by the spider (since the movie is a reboot) and then on the lizard matter. Comparing with the original Spiderman(Sam Raimi's) at this point is inevitable. The question is raised: is there anything more they could possibly tweak/alter? Couldn't they stick to the comic plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no actual impact on him,just a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much, I say, let Ben live in this one flick!Connors is underdeveloped,so his motives are not clear,lizard wants to turn everybody like himself, although able to talk (with fantastic pronunciation!!!)and be sane.I don't get if there is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizard,the film doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard talk to him only complicates things more.The director,in order to promote this film,boasted that this film uses very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is extensive use of cgi, it's actually also very bad.I can't comment further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his own.What gives it away is motion,colors are OK. Gravital issues also occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really heavy(Hulk-Godzilla-like)and at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a very enjoyable scene overall(Garfield's humorous lines help too).The flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate it.Had there not been the Spiderman mask,I would never recognize the man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical (-electrical?) web shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comics(let's give them that),but I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above, in this new film they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in order to do that!.One of my first thoughts was how many times had the director(Webb)taken me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a television series or something. Furthermore,Webb never seemed to understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his whole approach to this project was false.Few examples:Peter Parker being a skateboarder (!) while a genius geek at the same time.There are more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally go on forever.To conclude, there is no stigma,style,interesting shots, there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I haven't seen his other movie, but he did an amateur job.Take out the CGI and production money and you have yourself a fan-made film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he can direct,and his movies are really 'heavy',meaning important and professional.I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him before the eyes of us fans.",1,99,154,14 July 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Good superhero movie doesn't necessarily mean good movie
","OK so the consensus regarding this movie is that it is spectacular. I had heard many reviews beforehand plus I was also excited on my own because I would finally get to see the latest incarnation of Spidey, this time by Marvel. (I am a big Spider-man fan). But...is it?Overall the movie flows well and features enough action to justify its ticket price. Definitely a good superhero movie. Well staged choreography with good shots for the most part (e.g I didn't appreciate the 'shaky cam' in the beginning) and many characters- heroes whose existence in the movie made sense, or at least they didn't feel 'forced'. CGI could have been better at times. As far as plot is concerned it was great to explore the moral aspect of the Avengers, did they have the authority to protect, who would supervise them, who is held responsible for all the casualties etc. The scene where they all sit in the living room, talk to each other and offer arguments is one of my favorites.Black Panther was very interesting (the accent was clichÃ© though) and the chase sequence with him, Captain America and Bucky was a charm, although I would have preferred Black Panther to flee the scene. Spider-man set me off quite a bit, mostly due to the fact that he looked too CGI-ish, as if he walked out of a video game. (I like the suit design though). Hawk-eye making an appearance to help Scarlet Witch escape was also a highlight for me. Ant-man was very refreshing and fun to see.Let's get to the problems of this movie. Was it a civil war? Was there hatred? Did they want to kill each other? (Black Panther excluded, he wanted Bucky dead for sure). No is the answer. In truth, Captain America and his team wanted to keep doing what they do and team Iron Man wanted to stop them and bring them to custody. What's the point when you know they don't really want to hurt each other? It's like when Rocky and Apollo Creed decided to fight each other at a private match just for fun. We should have felt awkward to see our favorite superheroes come to that (to say the least). I don't think anybody feared the possibility that someone might get hurt at any point. And Rhodi was merely an accident! Point is, it was just shallow showcasing of everyone's abilities.Then they wanted to finally create the feeling of vengeance to Tony against Bucky (and Cap). And what did they do? They used footage of Bucky killing Tony's parents, I mean come on! (Also how could a security cam capture so many details is beyond me, it even zoomed in Maria's face...). I hate it when they make everything relate to everything. Would it be bad for once to see a sequence that doesn't serve a purpose later on? (I am referring to the great virtual reality scene in the beginning with young Tony and his parents). Furthermore, the villain not only wastes too much screen time, he also has a sincerely stupid plan. How the heck could he know that Captain would get to that Hydra fortress? And that Iron Man would go there too! That stupid villain could sit and wait there for months and months and nobody arrive! Besides, he had nothing to do with the Sokovia accords, which 'divided' the Avengers in the first place. He only managed to blame Bucky for that conference explosion.Acting-wise, the trailers promised more than the movie actually delivered. For instance, Tony Stark seemed as if he would be very expressive, but really it wasn't that big a deal. Not much emotion, not even from the scene at the end where he is lying down on the floor with blood on his face. Why? Because just as the audience starts to feel for him, seeing him in this pathetic and humiliating situation, he soon starts talking childish to Cap: 'You don't deserve this shield, my father made this shield'. For the love of God! Shhh! Just have him stare at nothing for a while with a sad bloody face, or even cry a tear. Which brings me to my final argument. I know Marvel loves to throw a funny line here and there, but isn't it time this stops at some point? So that we know it's a more serious situation here? Every now and then it was a constant pattern, e.g somebody falls, he says something funny. Oh and Spider-man was not funny, he just talked all the time as if exploring the world for the first time, very naive. I know he is supposed to be 15 but even he himself could have freaked or panicked at something during the airport fight. Was everything so charming to him? Is he so accustomed to fighting superheroes?'Civil War' is very entertaining and a pleaser for every superhero fan. It is money well spent and a 2 and half hour spectacular show of visual effects and stunts. But a good movie it is not, sadly. Eventually you will neither come out of the cinema any wiser from seeing this nor feel you experienced anything groundbreaking or highly artistic. To me it doesn't seem to surpass films such as the first 'Avengers' or the 'Winter Soldier'. So for all of you seeing reviews praising the film, know that they are exaggerated.",7,5,15,6 May 2016
