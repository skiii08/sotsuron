Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," a little perverse, but o so hilarious
","i saw this movie last night with a couple of my friends, and one of my friends mom. from start to finish we could not stop laughing and neither could anyone else. this movie was so great i couldn't even begin to explain. Sasha Baron Cohen gives America his funniest role as Borat, a Kazakhstan news reporter traveling through America to teach people of Kazakhstan what life is like in America. this movie is truly the funniest movie i've seen in a while (and believe me i've seen a lot of movies). i definitely guarantee anyone that sees this movie will laugh their ass off. but you might not want to see this movie with one of your parents considering awkwardness would follow you for the rest of your life.",9,0,5,11 November 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," worth seeing
",what was Roland Emmerich thinking when he made this film he obviously thought that special effects makes a good movie well he might have been missing some key ingredients including plot and better acting. but even with those the movie still would have sucked what was with that little boy with cancer in the hospital did he have anything to do with the movie it was like every one else in the world is dying and nobody does anything for them but as long as they save the boy with the terminal disease it will be okay. and what was with everything being okay as soon as Dennis quaid got to his son. i guess id have to say besides good special effects this movie flat out sucked but its still entertaining to see. my advice to yow would be go see it and find out what all the hype is about. but if you ask me this movie sucked,5,0,0,28 August 2005
Million Dollar Baby," its rocky without the happy ending
",a great movie one of the best I've ever seen. it is a great boxing movie but it isn't just about the sport. it also follows the dilemmas of the characters. i really loved how while the story went on you also saw another boxing hopeful by the name of danger i thought one of the best parts was when Danger was getting beat up so Morgan Freeman's character stands up for him. i also loved how at the end you find out that the whole story was narration of a letter written to Clint Eastwood's character's daughter. all in all i thought this movie was wonderful it was definitely worthy of the 2004 best movie Oscar winner. you should definitely go see it its worth your money,10,3,6,12 April 2005
