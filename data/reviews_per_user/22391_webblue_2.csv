The Blair Witch Project," Great movie; effective cinematography
","The Blair Witch Project wouldn't be anything without the great cinematography; the Hi8 and 16mm cameras give it an authentic look. The acting, specifically Heather's, is great. Also, the 'ad-libbing method' used throughout the movie proves to be an effective technique for conveying the actors' fear; it makes the movie more realistic. In other words: see the movie!",5,1,2,4 August 1999
Big Fish," Great comeback
","Tim Burton's big comeback.The stories are entertaining on their own, and the first few stories did stand independently from the rest of the plot (present and past) in my mind. But as the characters developed more in the present, the stories of the past carried more meaning for me and tied the emotions felt by the young Ed Bloom to those of the old, sick man in the bed.  That's what's important, and that's what I took away from this movie; the stories conveyed the same emotions with added grandeur in their deliveries and made me realize how much life meant to the characters.Best movie I've seen in a long time.",Null,0,0,20 February 2004
