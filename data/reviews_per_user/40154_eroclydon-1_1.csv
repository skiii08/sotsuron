Marie Antoinette," A great intimate picture
","I loved this movie because it was such a great portrait of a person - every little thing in the film came together to help portray Marie's state of mind - a sort of disaffected daze which turns into a warm and content mood as she starts to reconnect with life. The soundtrack was a great way to help remind everyone how relevant the story is, I especially liked how the young royal women carried around little dogs - very Paris/Olsen/Britney-esquire. Kirsten Dunst gives her most nuanced performance of her career so far I think, and the always beautiful Rose Byrne has a heap of fun as the slightly vacuous friend in waiting. Overall a great film from a very assured director - can't wait to see what comes next.",8,0,1,5 February 2007
