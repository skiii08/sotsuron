Blade Runner 2049," Boring until the end
",Utterly boring and waiting for some action until a great action scene near the end. Bought in 4K with atmos but nothing in it to demonstrate the benefit of the technology.,4,6,11,17 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," I liked it a lot.
","Oh dear. I almost missed this film having read several of the reviews but could not equate them with an average of 8 on IMDb so decided to chance it. SO GLAD I DID! One of the best 3 films seen in the last 12 months and the most interesting and engaging. Over three hours but I did not notice the time and did not even fidget. I found it an interesting. engaging, enjoyable, humorous, beautifully filmed and choreographed, well acted, story based film, wondering what will happen next as it is full of surprises. It's not a film for those who are not so interested in story but think action is the be all and end all like the last Captain America or the Fast and Furious series, even thought 7 was not too bad. Nevertheless it has quite a few shocks and had my partner clutching my arm a few times. It's definitely a story based film with enough action to satisfy action fans like me.",9,8,18,27 January 2016
