The Blair Witch Project," AN exceptional example of BRAVE filmmaking. Horror for the senses & Imagination, not cheap thrills.
","Without compare, this low-budget thriller is in a close run with THE EXORCIST in my 'scariest movies of all time,' and the only reason it doesn't beat out THE EXORCIST is because imo it's not as 'real' and disturbing spiritually.  It is, however, a terrifying experience which I think is sure to set a new precedent for Hollywood scare-fests (or atleast I hope so).Simply, most of what happens with TBWP doesn't happen on the screen at all. I hate to burst your bubble, but if you go to this flick expecting to see some mean and evil looking 'witch,' forget it.  The movie has barely anything to do with witches in the typical Hollywood sense of the word (nevermind the real sense of the word).  Neither will you find teenagers being axed to death during or after having sex, scantily clad cheerleaders fending off chainsaw welding maniacs wearing pig heads, psychotic transvestites with machetes bent on hacking apart those who jilted them, buckets of blood, HP Lovecraftian creatures lurking in shadows and beneath damp graveyards or any of the other stuff your USED to seeing on the silver screen these days being billed as 'horror.'  What you will discover is yourself immersed in the experience of the movie, like a cinematic funhouse where most of the horror is supplies by your imagination spurred by slight visual and mostly aural screen cues.  For the most part, not much happens on the screen... but the suggestion that there's something exceptionally horrific and inherently diabolical will ignite your imagination to fill in the blanks with a host of horrors individually suited for each theatergoer.  Now those are some noteworthy special effects!I won't give away any of the plot.  I won't tell you what finally happens at the end (?) of the film, suffice to say that I sat there with my jaw open staring at the screen in near shock.  And something else happened in the nearly 3/4 full theater which hasn't happened in a long time (and I'm a pretty regular theatergoer)... the audience was DEAD SILENT.  I could hear the breaths of those around me, sharp intakes, gasps, heart-pounding heavy inhales... this movie gripped the audience and held it quiet and interested.  There were some minor scenes where the tension was allowed to vent a bit, but for the most part it was a slow boil toward a crescendo which was unlike most any other movie I could mention to compare.This film is innovative by design.  Everything from the actors to the presentation to the marketing was a refreshing wind to this summer's movie calender.  It's ironic that perhaps the lowest budget film I've seen thus far this summer is perhaps the best.  It is perhaps best successful because it really does draw the viewer into the picture like the best campfire ghost story.FOUR STARS, no disappointment, this film lives up to the hype. You WILL be scared.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Pi," A Frankenstein for the postmodern world...gritty and edgy plunge into paranoia and madness.
","Incredible.  Absolutely incredible.This is a movie full of paranoia, isolation, a slow decay into insanity, hidden meaning, subversion, mathematics, an incredible amount of drugs, mysticism, uncertainty, obsession, violence, loneliness, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge fueled by ego.  This is a Frankenstein for the postmodern world, where the computer holds all the promise for answers, but whose inner workings mystify most people who use them.  It's about patterns and structure in the midst of chaos.  It's about the human mind's constant craving for order, for intelligence's grinding quest to label and categorize and put semantic meaning onto bits and pieces of perceived reality.  It's about genius run awry and about those who would seek to exploit it and in so doing it help lead it to ruin.You have got to see a small independent film called Pi.  It's a mere 85 minutes of pure madness set to a ravingly edgy techno soundtrack. The editing is at times incoherent and incongruent, but exceptionally poignant.  It provides the viewer access to a visceral understanding amidst what might otherwise seem a boring premise: a mathematician's quest for some new theorem.  The tense editing techniques, invasive camera angles and stark contrasts in the lighting serve a crucial role as backdrop to this psychodrama as it unfolds.This is what great filmmaking is all about.  Certain comparison's to David Lynch's cult masterpiece ERASERHEAD are sure to abound, though this film is certainly easier to follow, less quirky and far grittier and accessible. It's easy for the viewer to get caught up in the narrative which includes visitations by Wall Street mobsters, a bizarre cult of kabbalistic Hasidic Jews, a nosy landlady with attitude and more.  Top Notch all around. Four stars.",Null,1,2,24 February 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Loadsa action, recycled & repackaged scifi, fun, & cerebral
","I had the good opportunity to go to the premier of this one.  It was pretty good -- loadsa action.  The fight scenes were superb, rivaling some of Jet Li's best choreography.  It also has what I think is one of the best chase scenes ever played on the silver screen.  The effects were out of this world.That said, I thought the film lacked some of the heart that the first one had.  Watching it, I was simultaneously entertained (read fascinated by the artifact) yet completely aware that I was viewing an intentional construct (perhaps an unwanted effect, yet one that was entirely relevant).  It was only during some of the extended action sequences where this broke down and I was able to suspend disbelief albeit momentarily until the awareness kicked in that even the wild action sequences were intentional constructs.I'd say the Wachowski brothers sat back with Jean Baudrilliard's 'The Evil Demon of Images and the Precession of Simulacra,' The Illusion of the End, and Simulacra and Simulation left over from a graduate course in postmodern theory and said, 'hey, this would make a great flick.'  Phillip K. Dick wrote scifi like this back in the 50s and 60s -- this was more serious Harlan Ellison territory perhaps.  Still, it's damn relevant these days with the Internet fully taken hold of our culture -- echoes of William Gibson anyone?  Real vs. hyperreal, it's all fun and games until someone puts an eye out.Joseph Campbell would be proud.  They've got the messiah mythos down pat. Sure, it's repackaged for the cyberage, but that's what Baudrillard was on about anyway -- no new myths, everything recycled and simulated in absence of the referential original, all in the cause of entertainment of the masses who demand fascination -- well, that and black clothes and sunglasses because they look so damned cool.I won't toss out any spoilers.  It's an enjoyable film, and the audience surrounding me seemed to receive it well, too.  Like after each cliffhanger in the Lord of the Rings series, I heard grumbling from a few about the ending of this Matrix 2, but that's just par for the course.  What did any of them expect?  The good news is that the final words on the screen were 'To be Concluded' and not 'Continued,' which means that part 3 will end it, one way or another.  Sure, sequels or spin-off films might happen (and there's that AniMATRIX dvd out soon (next week), but at least they'll wrap this story line up soon.The music was just fantastic and the look of the film was superb and polished -- the bullet cam effect was put to good use and I was slack-jawed on more than one occasion.  Still, while the film/s is/are technically innovative, they are not script-wise.  The Matrix films do not say anything new -- at least not to the those of us with half a brain who've been science-fiction fans for years.  Yet, they put elements we've seen before together well.  Lawrence Fishburne's lines were a bit over-the-top to the point of nearly becoming laughable and undermining the seriousness of what the film was trying to accomplish.  More than once I wondered how he was able to pile on the drivel without cracking up -- really, there was some inane dialogue that made me wince -- it was nearly embarrassing.  But, I suppose that is tempered with the fact that the themes explored throughout the movie are nearly profound and the film does manage to remain cerebral when it counts, almost to the point where it might alienate those viewers more interested in the loud bangs, fast chases, fist fights and bullets flying! ;)",7,0,0,14 May 2003
Gladiator," Some scenes do breach the pale and reach moments of genius, but they are few and far between...
","This was a fascinating film which far exceeded my expectations.  The movie was being pitched as the latest and greatest Roman Empire film of all time, a modern return to the days of Cecil B. DeMille and the old epic films. The scale of the film is impressive, and some scenes do breach the pale and reach moments of genius, but unfortunately they are few and far between, and for the most part the film plays like just another period action flick. However, though it doesn't reach the heart and spirit of BRAVEHEART, the film achieves moments of greatness and admiration which defy overtly sentimental nostalgia.  In the end, the film is about a man who defies great odds in his quest for justice and peace.  It is the story of a man of honor and integrity who must overcome tyranny, deception, injustice, brutality and even his own insatiable hunger for revenge.  It succeeds on this level.Russell Crowe (THE INSIDER, LA CONFIDENTIAL, VIRTUOUSITY) does well as General Maximus who is cast into slavery and who must fight and kill to survive as a gladiator in late second century Rome.  Add into the mix a dabble of cliche' political intrigue (an unworthy Roman despot Caesar Commodus -- played to a tee by Joaquin Phoenix (8MM, CLAY PIGEONS, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS) -- kills his ailing father who just happens to be Caesar Marcus Aurelius (played by the venerable Richard Harris (UNFORGIVEN, A MAN CALLED HORSE, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY) in order to succeed to the throne.  Like Shakespeare's HAMLET, this act of familial homicide fuels the plot and drives the characters to their eventual destinies in the Coliseum.Other players of worthy mention:  the lovely Connie Nelson (MISSION TO MARS, PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, DEVIL'S ADVOCATE), who plays Lucilla, daughter of Aurelius, sister and near love slave to Commodus, his successor; and Oliver Reed (THE BRUCE, THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TOMMY and a bunch of great Poe adaptions and Hammer films).  Unfortunately, Reed died during production, but his performance on screen as gladiator turned gladiator-owner Proximo is superb and one his best!  Easily.The music for the film surpasses a great many period-piece scores which border on the pretentious and uninspired.  This score for Gladiator is at once moving, powerful, emotive and  most importantly interesting.  It doesn't attract attention to itself, yet it manages to support the story quite nicely. Composed by Hans Simmer (CRIMSON TIDE and THE ROCK) with assistance by ethereal vocalist Lisa Gerrard, much of the music approaches the greatness of those soundtracks which stand on their own as great pieces of music vis-a-vis Peter Gabriel's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.
My biggest criticism of the film has to do with Ridley Scott and the cinematography.  Most of the action scenes, especially the battle scenes are all close-ups and tight shots.  This lends to visual confusion, blurriness and a general lack of clarity.  While such an effect might lend itself thematically to the 'heat of the battle,' it does nothing to aid the viewer who is watching the film and looking for details, clear images and who is trying to pay attention to what is happening.  Even the gladiator matches themselves were all tight shots, and though well choreographed, they were at times difficult to follow and even tiring on the eyes.  The medium and long range shots of the great epics were absent.  The look of pictures by DeMille which helped propel films like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, SAMSON AND DELILAH or Sam Zimbalist's BEN HUR into epic status were left out of Ridley Scott's vision, and for the most part the picture remains on the level of MAD MAX or even Scott's previous 'epic,' 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE. Interestingly enough, Scott used cinematographer John Mathieson whose previous work includes French films LOVE IS THE DEVIL and VIGO, but nothing to the scale of vision GLADIATOR deserves.  Someone like Vilmos Zsigmond (GHOST AND THE DARKNESS) could've really brought a sense of 'bigness' to the visuals which is lost in GLADIATOR.In any case, the film is worthy of a solid three stars.  It's predictable as hell, but it's great action.  The violence is graphic and nasty, but thoroughly essential to the plot and none of it is gratuitous.  The players perform at a high level and are believable.  Costumes and sets are well made and create a brilliant setting for the film.  One other criticism is the use of hokey 'floating' dream sequences which, like the lackluster cinematography, undermine the grand scale of the picture.  With a budget of $100 million and both Dreamworks and Universal Studios behind the picture, the film could have gone without the cheesy Roger Corman / Fred Olan Ray style effects.  They really are distracting and detract from the overall effect of the film. (I say this, but other dream sequences are stark and beautiful and provide a sense of awe which the majority of the picture lacks -- unfortunately those scenes don't seem to have to do much with the movie! ;)",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
