Marie Antoinette," Boring! horrendous!
","After a long and tiring day my wife (25) and I (30) decided to relax and see this movie she thought would be interesting. What a grave mistake! It turned out to be the most boring movie we saw since... ever! A complete waste of 2 hours. The worst part - the feeling of guilt for the lost time. Going home and sleeping would be a more interesting endeavor. The movie seemed to have no point, no plot, or purpose. The brilliance of actors made this a little more bearable, but not enough to get any enjoyment. Oh, and I must mention the music was probably the worst part. The music and songs seemed to have no relationship to the scenes. They did not fit the genre, the rhythm, the time or the meaning. For the first time in my life I actually walked out before the movie ended and went to play the arcades while my wife would finish watching it. BTW , she said the ending sucked too. Absolutely horrendous!",1,30,60,24 October 2006
