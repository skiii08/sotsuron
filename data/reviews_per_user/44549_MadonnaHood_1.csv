The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Classic
","I am late viewing this movie as I really just purchased the DVD because I had heard some of the soundtrack and thought I would try the movie. It is exceptional in my view. A lovely story from many angles, the young child who hears stories of the wonderful golfer from his father. Who admires and worships the hero and his father until both men disappoint him, but who in the end learns that both men are the heroes he first thought them to be. Will Smith was wonderful as Bagger Vance. I agree with another reviewer that Bagger is an angel and finally Rachel Portman did an excellent job with the score. Beautiful music. I thought all of the actors including the children were very good in their roles. A beautiful view of America in the years between the wars.",10,0,1,5 February 2007
