Iron Man 3," Not like the others sadly
","To start this off this movie was alright tin my opinion but does not deserve it's current ranking on IMDb. There was just too many plot holes and unanswered questions for me to like this movie. Starting off with the main 'villain' The Mandarin, turned out to pretty much be a joke, as much as i love Ben Kingsley, i hated his role in this, The Mandarin was supposed to be iron mans arch nemesis, not guy pierces character. I hated the whole extremist storyline which pretty much left with more questions than answers. i also hated how iron mans suits were apparently made out of tin foil in this movie, with those extremist just cutting through them like butter. Thors hammer and lighting could barely scratch his armor and these guys can just rip through them? a joke to my eyes. Other then that RDJ's acting was good, great special effects. but this had more of a dark feeling, not consistent with the other marvel movies. Also i thought the scene at the end would have to deal with more phase 2 of the avengers, but i guess not.",6,3,6,2 May 2013
