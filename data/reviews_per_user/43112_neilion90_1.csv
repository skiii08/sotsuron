10 Cloverfield Lane," I make a case for why I think this movie royally stunk. See if you agree.
","Okay, so you might be wondering, out of all the positive reviews this movie has gotten, why somebody would give it an awful rating. Well, I'm going to make my case, and I think you will see that I made a valid point. And if not, that's okay, it's just a movie, so we don't have to agree.When this movie was first teased about in the trailers, it was pretty much universally understood that it would be the sequel to the monster movie 'Cloverfield'.Let's just stop right there. If this was supposed to be the sequel to Cloverfield, I think it may have beaten Halloween 3 as the worst sequel ever. It had absolutely NOTHING to do with Cloverfield. Nothing. I'm no film expert, but I'm pretty sure you're breaking the rules of good filmmaking when you make a sequel that isn't in any way connected to the previous film. That's like making a movie like 007 James Bond, then making a sequel, calling it something like 007 Boulevard, but James Bond isn't in it, nor ANY of the first films characters. I'm sorry, but that is just dumb.Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie was very suspenseful and I found myself rooting for the protagonists and hating the antagonist. The acting was decent and the story thought provoking. However, all of that became null and void in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. You see, I was still under the assumption that I was going to see a connection with Cloverfield.Nope.I realized I had been lied to like the main girl was lied to about the outside air being toxic. You might think I'm being harsh, but I honestly think that if a director thinks they can concoct a decent, suspenseful story as a way of making up for zero connection with the previous movie, they either think their audience cares more about entertainment than common sense, or they just want to make a buck using a thought provoking title. I'm thinking it's a bit of both.I hated this movie. I might be the only one, but hopefully you understand where I'm coming from.Thanks for reading my rant.",1,3,4,6 July 2017
