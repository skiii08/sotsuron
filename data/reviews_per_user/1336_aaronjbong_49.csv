Despicable Me 2," More Minion Madness? Yes, please!
","'Despicable Me 2' is the highly anticipated sequel to the lovable 'Despicable Me'. It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. There were also the three little girls that have the movie heart (Margo, Edith, and Agnes). This time around, Gru's no longer a villain. He's devoting his life to being a father and raising his three adorable little kids. (He dressed up as a fairy for Agnes's 6th birthday.) He's also managing his business of manufacturing jellies. But when there's a villain who just stole a secret formula (named PX-41) that could threaten the entire civilization, Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League, headed by Silas Ramsbottom ('bottom' read in a Minion's voice), to stop this new villain. His partner is an orange-haired funny woman named Lucy Wilde. Gru is facing with different kinds of experiences now. He's raising his three girls and has become a father. He's managing his jelly business. But he's also for the first time in love, which is haunting him due to a past experience back in his days at school. Love is a central theme to the story this time around. Gru is in love and a fun love storyline comes in full effect. Not only is Gru in love, but Gru's oldest daughter Margo also experiences the rush of falling in love. Even Dave, one of Gru's many Minions, falls in love. This love theme is what sets this sequel apart from the original. We have an array of new characters now. The first one is Lucy Wilde, the orange-haired woman who works for the AVL and eventually becomes Gru's love interest. Her funny actions and hyperactive behavior makes her a fantastic addition to the wide range of vibrant characters here. There's also Silas Ramsbottom (emphasis on 'bottom'), the leader of the AVL. His elegant personality and unique appearance makes him a lovable addition to the diverse cast. The final main addition to the character list is Eduardo Perez, the owner of a Mexican restaurant whose real identity provokes the saying: 'there's more than meets the eye'. While these new colorful characters add a delight to the screen, none of them compare to the lovable army of yellow Minions. Hands down, they stole the whole film. They have fantastic chemistry with just about anybody and they're funny as hell. Every sound that comes out of their is just damn hilarious. I have no doubt that children will enjoy the Minions' mischiefs. This time, the Minions have more scenes dedicated to them too, compared to their appearance in the first film. Oh, and don't forget Dr. Nefario too, who sadly has his appearance minimized. But every time he appears on screen, he's a delight. The comedy here works too. The jokes are humorous and most of them work for all ages. Some of them may not be original or repetitive, but they're still able to give you a laugh. And it doesn't hurt that an incredible cast was behind the delivery of the jokes here. Steve Carell was charming as usual and he never fails to impress with his excellent voice portrayal of Gru. Kristen Wiig was energetic as the energizing Lucy Wilde. Benjamin Bratt also gave a satisfying performance as Eduardo Perez. The rest of the cast was superb too. The visual effects were incredible. The sets were also very vibrant and colorful. They're so wonderful that they make the film come to life. Everything is splendid about the setting. They're also very detailed and it's just a treat for the eyes. The animation too is just eye- popping. All the characters' movements are extremely detailed and very smooth. The 3D is more of an optional choice though, but some scenes are especially tailored for 3D as they literally pop out of the screen, especially the end credits. Don't miss that one. Despite the beautiful visuals, the film only explores several locations which is kind of upsetting. A big chunk of the film is set in Paradise Mall, a colorful mall. Some scenes take us to other places but I feel that it's kind of limited. I feel that it's kind of a missed opportunity because the animation here is just irresistible and they could've given us more sets to feast our eyes on. But despite some setbacks, 'Despicable Me 2' is a satisfying sequel to the excellent original. I won't say that it's better than the original because it lacks the freshness the first film possessed. But this sequel comes really close and this should be an entertaining 98- minute adventure. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: It's not as fresh as the original but 'Despicable Me 2' nearly matches the first one and is highly entertaining for all audiences, with plenty of laughs and a superb cast.",8,14,24,30 June 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Ominously Fun
","James Wan is on a hot streak this summer. After the success of July's 'The Conjuring', he returns to deliver more thrills in 'Insidious: Chapter 2', the sequel to the horrifying 'Insidious'. It may not compare to 'The Conjuring', but 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is also definitely a thrilling experience. The main characters from the first film are back and the story picks up directly from the end of the first film. The Lambert family are back and the target of hauntings again. Patric Wilson is back as the head of the family, Josh Lambert and Rose Byrne is back as Renai Lambert. The kids are also back and even Specs and Tuckrr are back. The only new members are the new ghosts. The story is similar to the first one, about astral projections. This time, it's the dad. They move to Lorraine's (Josh's mother) home to stay and strange occurrences still happen; the piano playing by itself, the baby's toy turning on by itself. Then they connect it to a mysterious person and it gets creepy. The film is quite interesting. The flashbacks and background stories are intriguing and creepy. But what made the movie succeed was its shocks. The movie is skillful in producing scares and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The music was well-done too and provided quite the tension. The performances were also not too shabby and well-done. However, what I felt was that kind of got repetitive towards the end. It was definitely formulaic and therefore, in the end, it got kind of annoying. In the end, the conclusion was nothing surprising and therefore played out normally. The last scene was quite expected and it's not surprising that the third installment is in the works right now. But overall, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is quite a fun experience and it delivers quite enough shocks to satisfy horror fans. It may not surpass the freshness of the first film but 'Chapter 2' is quite satisfying. Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: Not a huge accomplishment, but 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is a fun horror flick with an adequate amount of scares and is quite creepy.",6,0,1,4 October 2013
The Avengers," Awesome and Amazing Avengers Assembled
","After years and years of anticipation, we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team. Creating a movie like this is difficult, considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes' story lines and merge them into one storyline. However, Marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing, awesome, action-packed 'The Avengers'.In the first 45 minutes, we see what has happened to our favorite Marvel superheroes in their own respective lives. Iron Man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with Pepper Potts. The star-spangled soldier Captain America has woken up from his 70-year-old frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings. The new fresh revamped Bruce Banner has been helping sick kids in India. Black Widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from Agent Coulson requires her to return to normal business with Nick Fury. Thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer Hawkeye.So what's the danger this time? It's none other than Loki from 'Thor'. To answer some of your questions, No, he didn't die (the post-credits scene from 'Thor'). So even if he didn't die, how did he arrive on Earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed? Apparently, Loki was saved by another alien race called the Chitauri. He offers a deal with the Chitauri leader; he will command the Chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. So Loki arrives through the Tesseract (which has the ability to build portals) on Earth and starts to execute his plan.While Loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes, the heroes didn't get along so well in the beginning. As reality would suggest, the members of the team get into some fights (there's one action-packed scene where Iron Man fights against Thor with Captain America caught in between). There's a lot of dispute between the superheroes, much to Loki's favor, all due to either rivalry, jealousy, suspiciousness, or many other reasons. This gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic. This is just one of the highlights of Joss Whedon's flawless script.Joss Whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film. This is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes. World War II to Captain America seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with (he doesn't know who Stephen Hawking is). Thor, who is of mythological nature, is still used to Asgardian lifestyle. Joss Whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible, not awkward. The dialog is perfect and natural.Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the action. By giving the characters the sense of vulnerability, the fight scenes seem more risky and more heart-pumping. While it may be heart-racing, the action scenes are also fun to watch, especially when we see the Incredible Hulk in action. The Hulk is just a mindless monster (although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax) who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat. His role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining. That said, the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. It offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action. By the end of it, you'll be satisfied but will still be eager for more.The performances were very convincing. Robert Downey Jr. played the role of the quirky Tony Stark to perfection. His dialog, his performance, everything about him was just perfect. Chris Evans also had a strong performance playing the role of Captain America. He was able to exploit the Captain's inner feelings. Chris Hemsworth also did justice with Thor, Samuel L. Jackson did a commanding job as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner played a determined Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson played a sexy and deadly Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating Loki. However the main star of the show was Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. He was able to portray a calm, tranquil Bruce Banner but also showed signs that Bruce Banner can, at any time, become the Hulk.The humor is heart-warming and very well. Every now and then, there's always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience. While one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr., actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including Loki. Why I love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scene.'The Avengers' is a must-see and a great movie to start the summer movie season. It's got the interesting premise, the operatic action scenes, the great jokes and many more to offer. This is absolutely one of the best, if not, the best superhero film of all time. It offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers. Just get up from the couch, head to the nearest movie theater and watch 'The Avengers'. It's great and 3D is a viable option. Oh, and once the credits roll, don't leave yet. There's two post-credits scenes you don't want to miss, and one of them involves the Chitauri leader.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: 'The Avengers' is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences, outstanding visual effects, a powerful script, and solid performances.",9,12,24,6 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Save the Past, Save the Future; the Men in Black Are Back Again
","The first 'Men in Black' film arrived roughly fifteen years ago and pleased audiences. Five years later, the second installment of the franchise arrived and left many moviegoers disappointed. Then, the Men in Black went missing for ten years and now roughly a decade after the previous installment arrived, 'Men in Black 3' arrives in theaters with a time-traveling storyline and we finally get to see our beloved Agent J and Agent K again.The arrival of 'Men in Black 3' last Friday marks an event of comebacks. Obviously, the film marks the return of the 'Men in Black' franchise which has gone dormant for roughly a decade. But the arrival of this film also marks the return of Will Smith to the big screen. His last major role was in 2008's 'Seven Pounds' and he has gone into a three-and-a-half year absence since then. Now he returns to the big screen as one of his most popular roles. He is undoubtedly one of the biggest stars on the planet and seeing him return to the big screen is welcoming.Ten years separated this installment and 'Men in Black 2', where as fifteen years separated 'Men in Black 3' and the original one. Due to the large gap in time between the movies, the concept of Men in Black might be new to some people. Basically, it's about an organization that deals with paranormal and extraterrestrial activity on Earth. You can say that these people are the policemen for aliens.So what's this third installment about? Intergalactic extraterrestrial criminal Boris (Don't call him Boris the Animal or ... you'll see) has escaped a super-max prison located on the Moon. He arrives on Earth to deal with some unfinished and personal business with Agent K. Apparently back in 1969, Agent K cut off Boris's left arm during a confrontation. Now Boris wants revenge and so travels back into 1969 to kill the younger K to prevent the 2012 K from existing. Agent J also travels back in time to prevent his partner from being slain by the extraterrestrial convict.1969 is different from 2012. Unfortunately, 1969 is a time where there is still discrimination to black people, much to Agent J's dismay. Even though it's 1969 and their Neuralyzer isn't as advanced as the 2012 version, they still have some rad technology, especially the single-wheeled bikes used by the two Agents. But what steals the show is the appearance of Josh Brolin as the younger Agent K. Due to the plot, Tommy Lee Jones had to give out most of his role to Josh Brolin for most of the movie.'Men in Black 3' also offers some interesting twists. Aside from the young Agent K, we also discover some shocking revelations. For example, we now know that famous photographer Andy Warhol is an undercover Man in Black under the name of Agent W. We also learn that there is some chemistry between Agent K and Agent O that dates back to 1969. At the end of the climax, we also discover an important moment about Agent J's early life.'Men in Black 3' is a very entertaining film. It includes solid action sequences against extraterrestrials of bizarre natures. The action sequences are very entertaining and keep the film suspenseful. The climax of the film delivers and does not disappoint. The aliens were also very imaginative, creative and very detailed.Not only does 'Men in Black 3' excel in the action scenes, but the cast here delivered powerful performances. Will Smith who had been missing-in-action for three-and-a-half years proved that his star power has not diminished over these years as he delivered a solid, charismatic, and powerful performance. Although he had to relinquish most of his role to Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones also delivered an excellent performance as our beloved Agent K. But the guy who elevated the film's excellence is Josh Brolin. His performance as the young Agent K is compelling and spellbinding and all around impressive. The other supporting cast also did amazing performances.The humor here is also heart-warming. Most of the humor comes from the man himself, Will Smith. When there is a depressing scene, there's always some humor to help alleviate the sadness.'Men in Black 3' as a whole is an impressive and entertaining film. It has an interesting premise, action scenes that build up suspense, solid performances, and outstanding visual effects. 'Men in Black 3' is highly recommended, for both fans of the previous two installments, and those new to the concept. While this installment may not surpass the first one in terms of quality, it's a drastic improvement from the disappointing second installment.Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: 'Men in Black 3' is an excellent addition to the 'Men in Black' franchise that includes an interesting plot line and solid performances, especially Josh Brolin, that is a major improvement to the second installment.",8,14,28,30 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Honeymoon in Brighton? Not today.
","So what's been happening lately?There has been a series of bombings and assassinations across Europe and if these activities continue, war will erupt and Europe will become a field of casualties and devastation. And our favorite detective Sherlock Holmes suspects Professor James Moriarty as the mastermind behind all these events. Meanwhile, amidst the bombings and destruction which are ravaging Europe, Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. John Watson is finally getting married with his fiancée Mary. After being engaged in the first film, they are finally getting married and a short funny wedding scene has been reserved in the film. They're even going for a honeymoon in Brighton. Or they were supposed to go for a honeymoon. The train the couple boarded was filled with Moriarty's henchmen and a loud, explosive battle ensues eliminating any hopes of an upcoming honeymoon. Even though Watson had been planning to retire from adventuring with Holmes after his wedding, he reluctantly becomes Holmes's partner one more time while his wife is taken care of by Holmes's brother, Mycroft. And the duo will receive an additional member to form a trio: the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza. Together, they try to stop Moriarty from continuing his cruel schemes and Holmes learns about Moriarty's plan to start a war in which he will personally benefit from.There are lots of action scenes that keep the film exciting and keep the film running in a constant, fast pace. The action sequences are louder, much more explosive, and much more energetic than the ones present in the predecessor. They are very loud, operatic, and exuberant. But some of the battle sequences are surprisingly quiet, such as a simple chess game held between Holmes and Moriarty. While you think a chess game would be boring, Guy Ritchie filmed it as if it was a grand battle. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the dialog adds another layer of tension and makes the chess game scene more atmospheric.Not only the action scenes, but the humor here is outstanding. Most of the jokes and humor come from the titular character himself. His bizarre behavior, regardless of his intelligence add a layer of comedy to the film. His trademark hobby, disguising into several unexpected people is just purely entertaining. If it weren't for Robert Downey Jr., the humor here would have collapsed and become a disaster.And of course, the acting and performances by the cast were brilliant and outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. is just brilliant in portraying the titular detective. He is admirable and he is really a man of talent. Don't worry, Jude Law also plays the role of Dr. John Watson perfectly. Together, they form an excellent chemistry. Also worth mentioning is Noomi Rapace as the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza, who not too long ago played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the original version of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'. Stephen Fry plays the role of Mycroft Holmes to perfection.I'd like to take some time discussing the character of Professor James Moriarty. He is a very compelling villain. His professional life as a criminal mastermind is hidden beneath his profession as a professor in the University of Cambridge. He is much more intelligent, much more cunning, and much deadlier than Lord Blackwood of the previous film. While Holmes seems to be a detective that can do no wrong in the previous film, here, he will make mistakes. Here, he will feel pain. Moriarty is just a very powerful villain and a very suitable opponent for Holmes. (And remember the slow-motion scenes where Holmes elaborates his fighting strategies in his mind, Moriarty can do it too.) And to further compliment this is the performance of Jared Harris. While he may not look suitable as an antagonist, he actually makes a perfect choice. However, the film uses too much slow-mo effects. This is largely noticeable in one particular scene which has an extensive use of slow-motion. I know the effect is mainly used to make it look more stylish but there is certainly too much of them. Running at a duration of 129 minutes, it could have been shortened if some of the slow-mo effects have been removed. Not only the slow-mo effects, but this film seems to have lost its trademark element of mystery that is present in the first film. Even though there are some mystery present here, they are not as mind- boggling as the ones present in the first film. In the first film, there are just so many questions that popped up and Holmes really has something to work on. But here, it's not mysterious. You know the full details immediately. Nevertheless, 'A Game of Shadows' is a pleasant experience and a whole lot more fun than the original film. Its operatic action scenes will entertain the audience and its comedic scenes will add a layer of laughter. With powerful performances from the cast, this film is one not to be missed in this movie season.Final Verdict: 'A Game of Shadows' is a stylish, fast-paced, yet comedic adventure which improves upon its predecessor in several aspects, and surely a highly recommended film.Rating: 8/10 Thanks for reading my review on 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows'. I do hope this review is useful.",8,117,188,24 December 2011
Sucker Punch," Imagination Can Be Your Guide
","At least that's the case with Baby Doll in 'Sucker Punch'. Being housed in the Lennox House which houses the mentally insane, she plans to escape the facility with four other girls. In the process, the girls need to collect five things: a map of the entire facility, an item that can start a fire, a knife, the key to all the doors in the whole facility, and a mystery that only Baby Doll can retrieve. What's appealing about the movie is the visual effects and the action scenes. I enjoyed these scenes thoroughly. Ninjas, machine guns, bombs, even dragons are all here to create some noise. The rendering of the alternative world and all the sets are amazing. These two things are definitely the key points of this movie.However, everything else was average, to mediocre, or even to poor.The plot was quite simple and I believe that the filmmakers could have done a better job on that. The film opens with a teenager nicknamed Baby Doll (Emily Browning) crying with her sister over their mother's death. Because of that, they have to live with their cruel father. After the sisters' father read his wife's final will and testament, he gets angry and kills Baby Doll's younger sister. Later, Baby Doll is accused of being her sister's killer and is later brought to the Lennox House with her father claiming that she is mentally ill. Baby Doll later meets four other girls: Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), and Amber (Jamie Chung). The five girls then plan to escape the facility. Here's the strange part: the girls later enter their own imaginative world where they fight against the ninjas and others to obtain the five items in the alternative world, as well as in the real world. Bizarre and simple the plot is, the acting and the script were also cheesy. The acting was unconvincing sometimes and the script sounds awkward in some parts of the film. The characters also got ridiculous names. I know it's their nicknames, but, a fighting warrior whose tough is named Baby Doll? What? That's not all. Sweet Pea? Amber, Rocket, and Blondie still sounded better than Sweet Pea and Baby Doll. To point out, there were several unanswered questions that struck my brain through the movie, with answers I'm very curious to find out. Whenever the girls want to go to the world in their heads, Baby Doll must dance to a rock song (I guess) before they can go in and kick ass. In one scene where Baby Doll dances the routine for the first time, she enters the world in her head and fights against three 10-foot-tall ninjas. She jumped around, ran around, screamed in pain, sliced her enemies, and dodged attacks. When she's back in the real world, she received laurels from everyone for her 'amazing' dance. The question is, how did she dance? Could she be really slicing the air, jumping around the room, and screaming around in her dance? That's not the only one. There are more. Another one is that when the girls visit their imaginative world for the first time, why didn't they feel amazed? I know it's their imagination, but, a little 'wow' or surprised look. Instead, they look like they've been into their world for a thousand times often. The last one I want to point out (but I'm sure there are still others in the movie still yet to be discovered) is that how in the world did Baby Doll fight against the ninjas in her imagination, winning the fight, when she's fighting using high heels? If you observe, she fights around using high heels, dodging the opponents' strikes and attacks. I mean, I've never seen a person, fight and dodging attacks with high heels. Imagine Alice from 'Resident Evil' running around shooting zombies, escaping from the zombies using high heels. That's all to discuss about the movie. Overall, 'Sucker Punch' is a winner in terms of action scenes and visual effects. However, the acting, script, and the things that made me confused were mediocre to poor. The film would've gotten a low score if it weren't for the visual effects and the action scenes. But because of the two, the film was desperate enough to earn a 7 for me. In terms of recommendation, 'Sucker Punch' is recommended for those who look forward to action scenes, great visual effects, and (possibly) hot girls. I don't think this movie would be suitable for kids because of the violence and the prominence of the girls. But it's up to you parents. In conclusion, 'Sucker Punch' is an entertaining two-hour adventure of stunning visual effects and action scenes, with everything else mediocre to poor.Prince AJB's Score: 70%",7,6,15,2 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Part 2? I Don't Think It's Necessary
","'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1' is a slow movie that runs for a lengthy 110 minutes and is completely useless. Everything in the film is prolonged and many of the scenes are just additional scenes to fill up the vacant spaces. 'Twilight' was great, 'New Moon' was a downfall, 'Eclipse' stood out with more action, and this one - it sucks! The beginning, as you may have seen in the trailers, Bella marries Edward. A lot of emotional moments and talking, this and that. Then they have a lot of kissing and hugging and kissing and hugging that if you combine all the kissing scenes in the movie, maybe it could last until an hour. Then they go have a honeymoon and then something happens.They did IT and the impossible became possible. Bella became pregnant (as seen in the trailer) and then the baby is killing Bella, taking her nutrients and we see an unhealthy Bella for around 40 minutes.Maybe the scene in the end was a little exciting as it was quite thrilling. There was some fighting, a small dose of fighting that maybe didn't even last up till 5 minutes. I won't tell you what happened in the end because that's an important element in the story. If I tell you that, I'll spoil the movie, if you even plan on watching it.The other scenes are ridiculously useless. There's nothing to admire in the other scenes. Unlike 'Eclipse', even though it's slow paced, there are a lot of things to see, to explore. 'Breaking Dawn - Part 1', I don't think so. Because the content here is so little, I don't even think a 'Part 2' is needed. Harry Potter really needs because there are plenty of things to talk about and each of them is vital to the story. But here, kissing and hugging are not really necessary and just a waste of time.In summary, this movie will as always appeal to die-hard fans of the series. Unlike Harry Potter which appeals to readers and non-readers, this movie apparently doesn't appeal to non-readers (except if you're a teenage girl who loves Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner, etc.). I've never been interested in reading the books as opposed to the Harry Potter series which I read and enjoyed. This series, each book is just the same. Edward and Bella. Someone interrupts. Nothing new. Harry Potter? There's Horcruxes. Half-Blood Prince. Order of the Phoenix. Many things that are fun to explore.Overall, I only recommend this movie if you're a die-hard fan of the series. Plus, I don't really think 'Part 2' is really needed. Based on the ending provided, 'Part 2' is absolutely useless. It's slow-paced, its content is so little, its useless. Probably 'Part 2' was to just get more money. I feel sorry for Harry Potter. Harry Potter had always been great in every movie. But this, they don't deserve this much money.Prince AJB's Rating: 3 out of 10 Final Verdict: I don't even know why this movie earned $30.25 million in just midnight showings. Its completely terrible.Thanks for reading my review on this movie. I do hope this review is useful for you.Note: Someone sent me a message and told me that 'Part 2' will have something in it and would be interesting. That was good news but I hope the content there is more than what's in this movie. Thank you for the message though.",3,233,384,19 November 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," This Is What I Call a REAL 3D FILM!
","'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is the only film which has 3D version worth to be experienced since 2009's 'Avatar'. After 'Avatar', the other 3D films didn't have satisfying 3D effects on them such as 'Clash of the Titans' and 'The Last Airbender'. The 3D effects were just not visible at all like it's the same as 2D only with higher price. The animated films however did have better 3D effects but were still average. But, 'Afterlife' is different and the 3D is really real. I have to tell you, 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' has to be experienced in 3D.Don't expect award-winning acting performances and a great storyline. Just expect some fighting actions with great 3D effects. If you set your expectations in an average level, you'll be surprised, but don't put expectations too high like what you'll put for 'Inception' or something. If it hadn't been released in 3D, I wouldn't be bothering to watch it so 3D is the main reason why I went to see this movie.The story is very simple for this movie. It's just Alice trying to find uninfected humans who have survived in the whole world. So, the story is just plain. Nothing to be proud of.So, if the story sucked, why did it receive a score of 7 stars?The 3D rocked. Bullets shot really went out of the screen and made the movie looked spectacular. With many action scenes, the movie becomes enjoyable and truly, a memorable 3D film. I know the previous films were awful but this one is just damn great. Just cool.Tips if you want to enjoy this film: 1. Don't think about the story, the script or the acting. 2. Don't take your 3D glasses off. 3. Experience the Action Scenes in Amazing 3D!Do yourself a favor in watching the first real 3D experience in theaters since 'Avatar'. Even though it looks horrible, trust me, it's not as bad as it looks. 7 stars for the combination of breathtaking action scenes and great 3D effects. Just follow the 3 simple tips above and you'll have a fun time watching this.",7,5,12,25 September 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Different Side of Abraham Lincoln
","When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater, my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations.So, in the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's fantasy novel, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. But before he becomes that, he's just an ordinary boy living in a world consumed by slavery. One night, his mom died from an undiscovered disease and from then on, he's waited and searched for his mom's killer, only to discover a new large world of vampires. There he becomes a vampire hunter under the guidance of Henry Sturges (who has a secret).However, his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end, he becomes the President of the United States, only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow. In the 20 or so minutes that focus on his presidency, I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this 20 minutes.The vampires are led by a leader named Adam. Although he might appear to be the strongest, I felt that the vampire John Barts (killer of Abraham's mother) was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax, the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal as only the two of them were involved and more engaging. The scene also displayed more of the abilities possessed by a vampire.Talking about action scenes, they were all great and fantastic. They were energetic, full of blood, full of gore, extremely violent, and dead brutal. Most of them feature decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality, deadliness, blood, gore, and violence should be satisfied with the action scenes provided here. But what I noticed in the action scenes, particularly the Lincoln-Barts fight and parts of the climax, was that it was quite unclear. In the Lincoln-Barts fight, the two were in a sandy place with many horses galloping. I felt that there was too much sand flying around and the fight became unclear and a bit brownish. This made it hard to see what was going on. It might intentionally done like that to give it more of an old feeling but it may also be a distraction because you don't know what's going on. The same happened in parts of the climax but this time, smoke and sparks caused it.The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better, I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations, blood, and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more patiently. In fact, most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham, due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However, the performances by the actors were okay, not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience.I also felt there was a bit of a disaster with the make-up. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties, we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance (a beard). We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd, and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white. However, the 3D was excellent. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course, impressive visual effects and eye-catching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov.Overall, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot, the film is downed by some poor unclear shots, an uneven script that mostly focused on action, not on dialog, and poor make-up. Regardless, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time.Rating: 7/10 Final Verdict: Despite the uneven script, some poor unclear shots, and poor make-up, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' promises moviegoers a bloody fun time with gory action scenes, eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects, and excellent 3D effects with an interesting and somehow peculiar plot line.",7,83,143,20 June 2012
Gravity," Fresh and Gripping; Space Masterpiece
","'Gravity', the movie that's been talked about for quite a few months now, is something unlike any other. It has extremely beautiful shots, dazzling visuals, gripping narrative, and fantastic music. Alfonso Cuaron, director of the third 'Harry Potter' film, has a guaranteed a spot as one of the masters of film-making with this film. Set in space, a very intriguing setting, 'Gravity' is a survival thriller about bio-medical engineer Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski and their exciting tale in space as debris from a Russian anti-satellite test creates a chain of destruction that damage their space shuttle and leave them stranded in space. The movie is pure thrill. There are so many unexpected situations and each of them is memorable. The suspense starts fairly quickly when their space shuttle is hit by high- speed debris. The music elevates the tension and therefore, each of the suspenseful scenes never fails to please the crowd. Dying and getting lost in space is quite a terrifying scenario and terrible way to end one's life, and therefore, you're going to be on the edge of your seats as the action ensues. The visuals were magnificent. Space is intriguing and this movie provides plenty of space panoramas. We see different parts of the Earth from space and it's just splendid. I also loved that the shots were long, instead of short unsatisfying ones. The scope of the setting is massive, and this is meant to be seen in a large screen, possibly IMAX. The 3D is pure enhancements and it's definitely recommended. 'Gravity' doesn't have too many characters to play around with. Instead, we focus on Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, the female protagonist of the story. The other leading guy is Matt Kowalski, portrayed by George Clooney. By not having too many characters, we get to take a look inside these characters, really get to know them and this film does it, especially with the character of Dr. Ryan Stone. The movie is headlined by two Academy Award winning actors and they are nothing short of excellent here. Bullock is so good in portraying the role of Dr. Ryan Stone here. She brought all the emotions here and was great. George Clooney was also impressive as the slightly cocky Matt Kowalski (although his role is less compared to Bullock's). They are experienced actors and this film shows just how professional they are. Brilliant. That's the word for the film 'Gravity'. Never before have I seen something like this. It's gripping, it's beautiful, and perfect. This year has not been a very successful year for sci-fi but 'Gravity' is different from the rest. It may contain more drama but it is nothing short of spectacular. Not all will find the brilliance but older audiences should discover just how magnificent this film is. 'Gravity' is wow!Rating: 10/10Final Verdict: 'Gravity' is an experience like no other and will engage audiences with its thrills, visuals, and plot as if it's gravity itself.",Null,4,8,8 October 2013
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2: Satisfying!
","'Iron Man 2' has been the most anticipated movie of May, and yet the year 2010. So many action scenes have been awaited in this movie including the appearance of 'War Machine', 'Whiplash', 'Black Widow' and not to forget, new armors of 'Iron Man'.Action scenes have been the most anticipated thing in this movie. Too bad, the movie didn't put a lot of fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are only a few and they are pretty short. In around 124 minutes of duration, I have expected around at least 40 minutes of those to be fighting scenes.All the visual effects and the story are not really a problem. The blasts, explosions and damage, they were pretty perfect. The details were also satisfying. Only fighting scenes were the real missing things.The fighting scene at the end was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it especially when they're up against 'Whiplash'. But, the fight was way too short. There were like only a few moves they did and done. It needs more action scenes. In total, there were like only four short fighting scenes.In summary, 'Iron Man 2' was satisfying but needs a lot more fighting scenes. But, the movie was still great. 8 stars for 'Iron Man 2'.",8,5,16,1 May 2010
World War Z," Fun, Exciting and Surprisingly Bloodless
","'World War Z', despite involving zombies, plays more to the likes of a disaster film instead of a zombie film. It's more of like '2012' than 'Resident Evil'. We see shots of cities tumbling down to the rule of zombies and the world slowly turns into a zombie wasteland. The zombie attacks are large-scale, grand, and extremely exciting, save for the climax which ends up as a small-scale sequence, but is equally satisfying. The hero is Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations investigator who is recruited by what is left of the U.S. government to assist a young virologist Dr. Fassbach in investigating the virus. He reluctantly accepts this task in exchange for his family to be able to shelter in a U.S. Navy vessel. After Fassbach dies (in a hilarious way) he is determined to stop this outbreak. During their visit to Camp Humphreys in South Korea (where the word 'zombie' was first used in reference to the outbreak) they learn that the zombies are attracted to sound. They also learn that Israel has established itself as a safe zone after it quarantined itself within a wall. Unaffected civilians, regardless of nationality, are allowed to enter. But due to the civilians singing loudly through a microphone, the zombies pile themselves up and manage to overcome the wall, and chaos ensues. This the largest action sequence in the entire movie. The scale is so massive and this scene is extremely exciting. Millions of uninfected humans being chased around by millions of zombies. The chaos is just indescribable. Add in the fact that the zombies are mindless and uncivilized and the chaos just multiplies itself. But this scene isn't the only one. There's another one earlier back in Philadelphia where Gerry witnesses the zombies firsthand for the very first time. All the action sequences are highly entertaining, massive, but surprisingly bloodless (which is peculiar for a film with zombies). They're massive, except the climax, where it's noticeably smaller set in a WHO facility, but the tension is equally high, and allows more shocks. Brad Pitt portrays the lead character, Gerry Lane. His character is devoid of personality here as most of the time, he's just involved in action. But Mr. Pitt delivers a performance that is quite pleasing. The rest of the cast gave good performances too and the acting shouldn't burden the whole movie experience. The script isn't that bad too. It diverges significantly from the original book and it is a bit uneven, but the lines make sense. It also works because it contains a real plot for the script to follow through. It has a sensible plot and the script acknowledges this. It's also worth noting that it has several humorous scenes too.It's far from perfect, it's heavy on action sequences, and it's uneven, but 'World War Z' is an extremely fun ride for everyone to enjoy. I would also say that it's rather family-friendly as there are child characters that appear quite prominently. Another reason it's rather family-friendly is that it's bloodless. It has a real sensible plot (unlike most mindless movies containing zombies) and if you ignore the tiny faults and plot holes, 'World War Z' will take you away on one of the most fun rides. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: 'World War Z' is uneven and far from perfect, but it's a fun and exhilarating ride that is more of a disaster film instead of the typical zombie film, and rather family- friendly.",7,91,158,1 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Happy Hunger Games - May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor
","In the ruins of what once known was North America, lies the futuristic nation of Panem. In the center of the country is the wealthy Capitol, inhabited by lavish-clothed citizens. Surrounding the rich Capitol is twelve outlying districts, each having a different industry and supplying materials for the Capitol. Some of the districts are wealthy (District 1: Luxury, District 2: Masonry, District 4: Fishing), while some are dead-poor (District 11: Agriculture, District 12: Coal mining).Before the film begins, the 13 districts fought with the Capitol, resulting in catastrophe, but eventually the Capitol won. The aftermath: the 12 districts were forced to annually give in a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games; the participants are called 'tributes'. The 13th District was, unfortunately, obliterated by the Capitol (sort of).Our heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen who comes from the poor District 12. She's received tesserae to meet the needs of her suffering family, in exchange for getting her name added additional times for the 'Reaping' (the time when the names of the participants are randomly picked). When her sister's, Primrose Everdeen, name is unexpectedly drawn during the reaping (despite the fact that her name was only there for once), Katniss volunteers to take her place and enter the Hunger Games, a TV show which forces 24 'tributes' to fight to the death as a reminder to the rebellion 74 years ago.The heart of Panem, the Capitol is where the 'tributes' undergo training (Katniss and Peeta have drunken Haymitch) and several interviews. Here, everything looks different from District 12. 'The showers are different' (as Peeta says), the buildings are more colorful and the people there are lavishly-clothed. The citizens of the Capitol don't join the Games but they do are responsible for giving sponsors: some sort of gift received by the 'tribute' during the Games. The sponsors depend on their opinions and these opinions usually depend on the 'tributes'' scores given by the Gamemakers; each of the 'tributes' are evaluated by the Gamemakers based on their skills and the higher the scores, the more likely chance they're going to get sponsors. After the evaluation, we get the interviews hosted by the eccentric Caesar Flickerman, and the Games begin in 3 ... 2 ... 1.The 24 'tributes' run at once in different directions, some to the tempting backpacks filled with valuable items, some clashing to kill some 'tributes', some escaping to the wild.Pushing the PG-13 rating to its fullest, the Games do involve blood and some deadly kills. While Katniss and Peeta are relatively quiet, some of the Careers ('tributes' who spent their entire lives practicing for the Games) are very brutal especially Cato of District 2. The Careers form a pack to kill the other 'tributes' first before they kill each other until only one remains. 'The Hunger Games' is often compared to the 'Twilight' films. They may have a similarity (a love triangle which places Katniss in the middle of Gale and Peeta), but the main focus of the film is not the love triangle. Katniss originally loved Gale but because of the 'Reaping', Katniss allied with Peeta Mellark. That's basically what the love triangle covers. The love triangle is only a piece in a larger plot set in the dystopian future surrounding the Hunger Games. The film has an excellent cast. Putting Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine Katniss Everdeen is nothing but perfect. Coming off from an Oscar nomination two years ago, she's one to rise into super stardom. Her performance here is very convincing and very powerful that she deserves an Oscar right there on the spot. Her ability to show rage, nervousness, fear, determination, sadness, is just very spellbinding. John Hutcherson is also one not to be missed. His portrayal of Peeta Mellark is convincing also, being able to display nervousness, and fear. The others were also excellent: Alexander Ludwig plays Cato viciously, and brutally; Woody Harrelson plays the drunk Haymitch perfectly; Stanley Tucci portrays Caesar Flickman with charisma and style; Elizabeth Banks depicts Effie Trinket with meticulous details. The action is another thing the movie excels in. Although there might have not been a lot of intense explosions or 'Kabooms!', the moments that take place in the Arena are thrilling likewise. The fight is not about action but more about hunting and survival skills. Katniss is relatively quiet, unlike the Careers who are more excited about getting into a fight where they are able to snap people's necks. The film is based on a novel, a novel I enjoyed immensely. With the author Suzanne Collins also playing a part in writing the screenplay, the movie is faithful to the book's contents. Although there are slight alterations, there are no major alterations that might change the course of the plot (such as 'Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief'). Anyone who has read the books will be pleased with how Gary Ross transformed the book into this film. Not a fan of the books, no problem, you can still enjoy this film. In other words, anyone can enjoy the film. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: 'The Hunger Games' is an action-packed drama that lives up to its massive hype and can be enjoyed by anyone.",9,35,73,22 March 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of Persia-The Sands of Time: A New Generation of Disney Movies
","It seems like Walt Disney have co-operated well with Mike Newell by looking at this brilliant motion picture. Therefore, I call this the beginning of a new generation on Disney movies.Basically, the movie chronicles the story of Dastan with Tamina to protect the Sands of Time from the enemy.Why I said this was a new generation on Disney movies, it has action scenes that will astonish you. The movie is very exciting and the story is pretty sophisticated as being a Disney film. For most Disney fans, I think that this film would be very good for them.I praise Mike Newell for his directing. One of the reasons that I give the praise to him is that because from approximately 116 minutes of running time, he gave a lot of scenes that makes the movie good. I also like the way he directed every time Dastan uses the Sands of Time where he gave an extraordinary vision on him.There's only one problem I think. For young Disney fans, I'm afraid some of the action scenes and the violence may be unsuitable for your age.I recommend this movie to you people reading this review. I hope this movie will be a success and sequels will be made as a series successor to the Pirates of the Caribbean series. I give this movie 8 stars.",8,20,39,27 May 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," This is a Splendid Re-creation!
","Since 1981, Spielberg has become an avid fan of this gorgeous 'Tintin' comics and has been longing to create a film about it. Before he and 'Tintin's' master, Herge could meet, Herge passed away. However, Herge's widow decided to give them the rights and began the adventure to re-create this marvelous wonder of art.Adapted from three of the comics, Spielberg's re-creation of the comics introduces us to Tintin (Jamie Bell), a Belgian reporter who gets caught up in all sorts of adventures. One day, he found a model of a ship, the Unicorn and bought it and brought it home. However, when Tintin was buying the ship, two men came to try to buy the model, Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and Barnaby. Later, Tintin discovers that the model holds an important secret and somehow, the secret is linked to the real ship itself. On the way for answers, he meets the grumpy Haddock and head off to an adventure spanning around the globe with his white fluffy dog Snowy.The animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. Tintin's animated self looks stunning (even though he looks kind of different from his comic-self) in his blue long sleeves. Snowy is fluffier than ever. Captain Haddock is grumpier than ever. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen.I like how they change scenes. While most other movies just shift scenes normally, this film uses a little imagination and is ingenious in shifting scenes. They can change from a scene of shaking hands to a desert scene by using the outline of the two hands into the surface of the desert. This thing is just entertaining and great in its own right and deserves some reward.The movie itself is fun to watch. The story is compelling, the lines are natural-sounding, and the action is plenty of fun to watch. It is great excitement to watch and I was hooked from beginning to end. Great plot + awesome action + breathtaking animation equals up to amazing movie.The 3D is perfectly fine. The depth is seen and the 3D just makes the movie even more fun to watch.I definitely recommend you to watch this film. 'Tintin' fan or no, this is sheer fun to watch. If this movie is out in your country, watch it immediately. For U.S. citizens, I'm sorry if you still have to wait for a while but I promise you, this is like no other movie. This movie is over the top and is plenty of fun to watch. A full 10 out of 10! Thanks for reading my review on 'The Adventures of Tintin'. I do hope this review is of good use to you.",10,129,173,11 November 2011
The Expendables," Say Goodbye to Summer 2010 with The Expendables
","Yes, summer 2010 is ending. It's pretty sad isn't it. After 'Iron Man 2', 'Robin Hood' and so on until now, it's the moment of rocking movies. Now, August 13 is the end of all those moments as we have to wait until November for another short movie season. So, why don't you do yourself a favor to end Summer 2010 by watching this explosive, action-packed movie, 'The Expendables'.First things first, the cast is obviously awesome. Meet your favorite actors: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Steve Austin, Dolph Lundgren and even Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's definitely awesome and rare to see such a great ensemble in one film. Sadly, most of them appear on screen for a short time except Stallone and Statham who receive the most screen time. The action. Totally breathtaking. It's very loud and enjoyable and yes, there's a lot of blood. The fights were worth the money you pay for watching the film and it's very satisfying. Let's start with the movie. The first hour can be called boring as we are still learning the characters and their strategy etc. Skip the first 60 minutes, that's when the real action begins. A 30+ minute battle in a small island begins as explosions, noise and plenty of blood on the screen. Stallone and his friends kicks ass in the final hour of the film. And not to forget, there's some comedy in the film. The story. Well, you know Hollywood. Hollywood can make a film so exciting even with a simple story concept and 'The Expendables' is one of those films. The story is so simple that it's about Stallone or Barney Ross with The Expendables assigned to eliminate a general in an island called Vilena. It's very simple but the movie is very exciting. However, to the more negative sides of the film is the special effects. The blood looked pretty fake at several scenes as when it spreads, it really looked unreal. The explosions and others were of course life-like. 'The Expendables' overall is a very exciting film. It's another great job by Sylvester Stallone. It's a very good way to end the enjoyment of Summer 2010 movies. I recommend this to moviegoers who love action movies and people who love Sylvester Stallone on action. It's worth to sepend your time and sure to not disappoint you people. In a word, 'The Expendables' is ... awesome!Prince AJB's rating: 8/10.Thanks for reading my review on 'The Expendables' and hope it's useful.",8,26,53,14 August 2010
Megamind," It's Despicable Me + Superman
","2010 has seen many animated movies with the same 3D treatment which include March's 'How to Train Your Dragon', May's 'Shrek Forever After', June's 'Toy Story 3', July's 'Despicable Me' and the recent 'Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' which blasted on September. While October sees none, November's first animated film (the second one being 'Tangled') is 'Megamind', a similar movie to 'Despicable Me' but in a Supermanalized version.'Megamind' uses concepts from Superman such as a foreign planet is on the way to destruction while one little young of the species is hoped to survive and live in another planet. That's what has happened to Megamind. But the twist is that there are two outer-spaced people and the other one is Metroman, the more Superman-like person compared to Megamind. Just as Megamind was about to arrive at a royal, happy house on Earth, Metroman gets the spot first and bumps Megamind's capsule causing Megamind to end up in jail. There, Megamind learns criminal stuff and soon, when he grew up, he faces off his nemesis Metroman. But, when Metroman has lost and died, bored, Megamind creates a new super-powered hero. But, the new super-powered person didn't want to become a hero but instead a villain. Megamind, for the first time in his life, becomes a hero.Megamind is a unique character. With the big blue head, his plans are actually ingenious but is easily tricked by other people. This makes him a funny criminal rather than a scary one. He has a friend named Minion which is a fish that has a robot body. He's like Dr. Doofenshmirtz in Phineas and Ferb but slightly more intelligent and better luck.By the way, you might be wondering what Tina Fey's character does in the story. Well, her character, Roxanne Ritchi is a reporter for a newscast who supports Metroman. After Megamind impersonates as a friend of hers, she starts to have a relationship with him even after Megamind was discovered of pretending to be her friend.Of course, what fuels animated movies is the jokes. That seems to be what lacks in 'Megamind' as the original jokes are quite a few. But, one of them was ingenious. The 3D effects were satisfying enough for me and they were quite deep enough for an average 3D movie. The animation was not so stiff and the locations and everything was very much detailed.Voice performances were excellent especially Will Ferrel's who owns the part of the titular character. Tina Fey's performance was also well and seemed to sound confident. Brad Pitt shows his talent of voice acting too. David Cross who plays Megamind's pet fish is also well and satisfying. Jonah Hill's performance as Hal or Titan was also excellent. The acting was all good. Overall, 'Megamind' is a perfect kid's movie even though a big blue headed hero may sound scary. But, kids will definitely enjoy the film very much as I do with the lovable characters especially Megamind himself who is funny and ingenious. 'Megamind' is truly recommended.Prince AJB's Score: 8/10Thank you for reading my review on 'Megamind'. Hope it's useful.",8,9,16,19 November 2010
Underworld Awakening," Selene to the Hybrid's Rescue
","From the first moments of the film, the film blasts into nonstop action scenes that the audience won't have time to take a breath. One scene ends, probably a 90-second rest and our heroes fight again with the bad guys. And this time around, we have a new group between the wars: the humans. So the battle here is pretty much Vampires vs. Lycans vs. Humans (although the humans don't actually do any part in the war).After evading the previous installment, Kate Beckinsale returns to reprise the role of the sadistic, sexy vampire Selene. She's back after experiencing a 12-year sleep in a human facility and being held captive for several reasons. But then, a mysterious hybrid (a combination of vampire and Lycan) awakens her and soon, Selene has to protect the hybrid from the impending threats committed by the Lycans and humans.The bad guy here is a scientist who works for the facility in which Selene had been trapped. But deep down inside, he's actually a Lycan who aims to triumph over the vampires and humans. And he's got a sidekick, his son named Jacob who's a Lycan but through some process, possesses extra abilities (e.g. more gigantic rippling muscles, heal instantly after being injured).The action scenes are fantastic and wildly entertaining. They're incredibly fast-paced and this movie definitely provides more than we need. From the first seconds of the film, the movie immediately starts accelerating into full tension with its extravagant and exuberant fighting scenes. The action never stops and there's barely any scenes involving words coming out of the actors' mouths.The 3D here is mediocre. Some of the scenes offer eye-popping effects while at other scenes, the 3D was hardly noticeable. Some of the scenes didn't even look blurry when I took off my 3D spectacles. Unlike the similar 'Resident Evil: Afterlife', 'Awakening' offers less eye-popping effects and the 3D here acts like more of an optional choice than a mandatory one.The acting was okay, not too shabby. But they just don't have enough lines. It's like they're reluctant to talk. There is just not enough things to say that I barely got to know with the characters. I was like 'What's his name? What's her name?' The characters don't talk at all. They must have been in some sort of detention class.But overall, 'Underworld: Awakening' is a wildly entertaining film. I'm sure boys will enjoy this film and I'm sure most wouldn't be disappointed after leaving out the theater, as well as for 'Underworld' fans. There are plenty of action scenes and it's just sheer fun watching this film. 'Awakening' is a visual feast of blood, violence, and action.Final Verdict: 'Underworld: Awakening' is an impressive, stylish entry to the popular 'Underworld' series that offers plenty of action, blood, and violence.Rating: 8/10",8,8,16,12 February 2012
Tangled," Disney's Comeback On Animated-Musicals
","The Disney Renaissance period was grand to the Disney company. They had made many 2D animated musicals that had turned into all-time classics such as 'The Lion King' or 'Tarzan' which are based on stories, legends or maybe fairy tales. But, after 1999, things changed as the movies are no longer based on fairy takes or other stories but rather original ideas. But, 2010 will see the return of animated musicals with 'Tangled' with the addition of 3D animation and 3D format.'Tangled' marks the return of animated musicals and will be based on the fairytale of Rapunzel. But, Disney added some changes and new characters and also removing some things from the original tale into a new tale. It's basically about Rapunzel, a girl who has incredibly long hair with magic powers. When she's still a baby, Mother Gothel kidnapped her forth magic powers and so, Gothel took care of Rapunzel and concealed the truth that Rapunzel's parents were actually the king and queen of the empire.Unexpectedly, Flynn Rider, a mastermind thief now known as a fugitive was on the run and saw Rapunzel's tower, he climbed up the tower and met Rapunzel. Then, they began to form a relationship and so it becomes a problem for Mother Gothel then, they have fights and so on.'Tangled' is actually a great film to begin with. It is enjoyable mostly to girls but it also has an appeal to boys. Jokes here are plenty and everything was really good. The voice performances were also magnificent. The songs in this film are classical. They are really enjoyable for kids and are memorable . There are many songs here but the division of the songs is quite uneven having Rapunzel owning over 65% of all the songs. The 3D effects if the film was also satisfying enough. It was quite in depth and the lanterns part in the film was really breathtaking. I was happy enough with the 3D effect. However, there is a prominent difference from previous animated films which is the length . Mostly range from just 80 minutes to 100 minutes. But, 'Tangled' is actually 110 minters ling instead, very long for a children's movie. 'Tangled' is actually a very good film. I would recommend it to everyone and their kids because this movie is truly remarkable. Even though not Disney's best movie, 'Tangled' is definitely worth seeing it.Prince AJB's Rating: 90%Thanks for reading my review on 'Tangled'. Hope it's useful!",9,15,22,29 November 2010
Interstellar," 'Do not go gentle into that good night'
","Space is an interesting setting, due to its enigmatic properties, hidden secrets, and just the sense of awe it instills on us. There's something alluring to space, whether it's because of our curiosity to explore what's out there, or just because of the seemingly endless void of darkness. It's fascinating, and yet terror-inducing.In 'Interstellar', the earth has been ravaged by blight, and is in a desolate condition. Farming is the number one occupation and the only crops that still survive under the harsh conditions (frequent dust storms) is corn. Our protagonist is Cooper, a widowed engineer and former pilot who has two children, Tom and Murph. After an accidental incident, he stumbles onto a NASA hideout. There, he meets Professor Brand who informs him of the existence of a wormhole (a phenomenon that theoretically is able to act as a 'shortcut' through spacetime). Then, he is requested by Brand to pilot the Endurance, an experimental spacecraft joined by Amelia (Brand's daughter), Doyle and Rommily, along with two versatile robots named CASE and TARS, on a trip to the discovered wormhole in hopes of colonizing new worlds to ensure mankind's survival. But this is a Christopher Nolan film, so there is sure to be more layers surrounding the plot of the film. 'Interstellar' boasts some of the most exhilarating and beautiful images I have ever seen on the big screen, and as i watched these spatial phenomenons unfold, I was completely baffled. I may not know much about astrophysics, but the wormhole and the spinning blackhole were extremely grand, massive, and digital wonders. Comparisons to 'Gravity' will surely be present, but 'Interstellar' is different enough in the sense that it has a much larger scale of setting and story then 'Gravity'. One of the highlights this film carries is its scientific accuracy. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne served as the scientific consultant of this film and the movie had a lot of physical concepts, most of which were interesting, but sometimes quite hard to grasp quickly. The quite prominent concept is that of time dilation, a phenomenon that occurs due to the difference in gravitational potential. Time will pass slower when there is a higher gravitational potential. In one situation, the characters visit a planet that is in close proximity to a blackhole, which means for every one hour they're there seven hours have elapsed back on Earth. Time is a valuable resource and therefore, everything the characters do must be carefully considered. There are other concepts too such as gravity and the nature of time itself. Running at nearly three hours long, the film runs quite slowly in the first act, sweeps up into full gear in the second (after we enter the wormhole), but ends with a quite abrupt, rushed and confusing third act. Perhaps the concept makes sense but it feels quite out of place and preposterous. Nonetheless, the film is one that will make you think, one that actually requires you to think, and one that utilizes its characters to exchange ethical ideas. Director Christopher Nolan's confident sense of direction allows this movie to successfully hit the right notes as the film progresses. The film has a lot of big talent in its cast and Matthew McConaughey leads the pack as Cooper. Fresh off his Academy Award-winning performance from 'Dallas Buyers Club', McConaughey delivers a sensational experience as a caring father who is torn between having to travel far to save the world or be with his children. Anne Hathaway is superb as Amelia Brand, a very determined astronaut who later gets caught in her own motives and becomes confused in her judgment of what's right and wrong. Jessica Chastain was also amazing, able to display her anger and frustration at her father for leaving, and also her newfound determination to do something herself to help the human race. The rest of the supporting cast couldn't be anymore better. And don't forget about the two robots TARS and CASE, very imaginative creations who provide the light-hearted humor amidst the brooding atmosphere of the film.In conclusion, 'Interstellar' is a very beautiful visual experience that will take you back to that moment when you see something that made you feel out of this world, like '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It is however a long epic film filled with technical concepts of physics and therefore, quite a heavy film for your mind to work on. But with the help of a superb cast and a clear direction from Christopher Nolan, 'Interstellar' is a ride you should not miss, and instead experience on the big screen in its entirety.",9,1,6,9 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Monsters vs. Mechanical Monsters
","'Pacific Rim' is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing. Unlike 'Transformers', this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly. Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. 'Pacific Rim' provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart. The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's 'Hellboy' films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. 'Pacific Rim' is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: 'Pacific Rim' is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot.",Null,283,505,11 July 2013
Man of Steel," Superman is Back, and He Soars High
","Who doesn't know Superman? He's undoubtedly among the most popular superheroes and arguably the most popular one. With his trademark red cape, 'S' emblem emblazoned on his chest, and trademark red underwear (worn underneath this time), Superman's become a cultural icon and universally beloved. His films started arriving in 1978. An excellent film, it was followed by the equally superb sequel. The subsequent installments failed to match the impressiveness of the first two installments, especially the fourth one, so disastrous that it killed the franchise for 19 years before they tried to bring it back to life in 2006 with the release of 'Superman Returns', which was still a disappointment. Now, we finally have another Superman film: 'Man of Steel'. And I'm happy to say that it is excellent. You've seen the previews and trailers and they're excellent. 'Man of Steel' does live up to the expectations set by its brilliant previews. And while critics are bashing it for the super- serious Superman, lack of Clark-Lois chemistry and too much action, I'm sure that the general audience and fans will enjoy this adventure.The 148-minute journey starts off with the destruction of Krypton. I loved the beginning because we are able to explore Krypton, their people, their culture, just how it looks like. Krypton's core is growing unstable and its destruction is soon and inevitable. Jor-El and General Zod acknowledge this fact but the Council won't buy it. Zod attempts a rebellion but fails and is sentenced to the Phantom Zone, Jor-El died in a battle with Zod, and Krypton is destroyed. But baby Kal-El is able to escape in a spaceship and arrives on a farm in Kansas on Earth. He is taken care of by Jonathan and Martha Kent. We then see Clark take on several jobs under false identities, with his childhood portrayed in occasional flashbacks. We see times where he used his superhuman abilities and receives lecture from his Jonathan Kent telling him to keep this side of himself a secret. Finally, Clark discovers a Kryptonian spaceship and sparks a conversation with a hologram of Jor-El. He then receives his Superman suit (no underwear outside) and becomes the Man of Steel as we know it. And then he flies...When he flies, he laughs in joy. (Earth's gravity is weaker than Krypton's) I loved this scene because he really feels human, after living most of his life here. He's so happy when he flies, just like any other human would if they could. It's such a special moment for him and this scene is just 'Wow'!And then Zod makes a grand appearance with his henchmen (including the ruthless Faora-Ul), and we soon know Superman's identity is soon going to be known worldwide. After several conversations, Superman (along with the military soon after) engage in a battle against Zod's forces......and we then witness some of the most spectacular action sequences ever crafted. Any worries that 'Man of Steel' would be action-less (like 'Superman Returns') should be put to rest because this film delivers mind-blowing intense sequences of battles. Superpowered Kryptons battling each other is just plenty of fun to watch. So much wreckage, and explosions too (but not as much as the obnoxious 'Transformers'). Critics are bashing it for having too much action. From my perspective, it's not too much. It's just a crazy action sequence followed by another crazy action sequence and so on. By the end of it, you'll say 'I'm satisfied' instead of 'I want more'. Superman is far more serious this time around. Another area where some critics are criticizing on, but I don't find that bad. In fact, I feel that having a serious Superman is pretty cool. He's serious, calm, humble, and super! Henry Cavill, the star who fills in the shoes once used by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh, does a terrific job of portraying this latest incarnation of Superman. He's able to blend all this seriousness, humility, serenity, tranquility into one and is able to create a Superman that's really human. The rest of the cast is superb too. Amy Adams is Lois Lane, a reporter Clark meets in an encounter in the spaceship where Clark discovers his identity. Amy Adams portrays a Lois Lane that's curious and not a damsel in distress, someone who can act. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe play their roles as Clark's adopted and biological father, respectively. They play their fatherly roles so leisurely, so easily, with ease that they're splendid to watch. Diane Lane and Ayelet Zurer also play their mother roles skillfully. Michael Shannon delivers a terrific performance as the merciless General Zod. He delivers his lines so powerfully that you can feel the anger. I loved the chemistry between Clark and Jonathan Kent. Their meaningful conversations, reflections on situations, thoughts on the possibilities of life, I enjoyed all that and it gives this movie enough heart to make it a heartwarming experience. Clark's relationship with Martha Kent is also impressive, especially when Martha tries to calm Clark after he is overwhelmed with his super-senses. Many critics comment on the lack of interaction between Superman and Lois. Their interaction is a bit limited but it's more of an origin story this time around. The love storyline could perhaps be more focused in the follow-up. All in all, 'Man of Steel' is an impressive reboot and mostly successful one for the Superman franchise. It may not be perfect, some elements can be improved and some plot points contain minor problems and inconsistencies. But if you let that go away, this movie will blow you away. And I dare say that this is better than 'Iron Man 3'. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: It's not perfect but 'Man of Steel' is a superhero film that will amaze you with its impressive action sequences, amazing performances, and surprising heart.",9,11,21,28 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A Dark, Amazing and Wicked Beginning of the End
","Almost a decade has passed since Harry first encountered Hogwarts. The long anticipated battle between Harry and Voldemort is drawing near. Hogwarts has become no more safe haven. The Ministry has set Harry as a fugitive. The beginning of the end has begun. First, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is the seventh film in the Harry Potter series based on the first half of the book. It is as usual dark in a David-Yates- Style. In its whole 146-minute run, 'Deathly Hallows' follows Harry, Hermione and Ron who are on the run from the MInistry of Magic now controlled by the bald-looking, dangerous, evil Voldemort as well as trying to locate and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes as explained in 'Half-Blood Prince'. 'Deathly Hallows' will introduce several new characters and they include Xenophilius Lovegood and Rufus Scrmigeour. Xenophilius Lovegood is undoubtedly Luna Lovegood's father. While Rufus Scrmigeour is the Minister until the Death Eaters swarm in the Minister. 'Deathly Hallows' also sees the return of our beloved characters such as Dobby and Kreacher, the house elves. 'Deathly Hallows' will not only introduce new characters but also new locations and they include the Malfoy Manor, where the Malfoys live. We will also see Harry, Ron and Hermione in the mortal world rather than the magical world for around half of the book such as Tottenham Court Road.A note for Harry Potter fans, you will not see Harry, Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts anymore. There will be no Quidditch games, Fred and George's shop, love potion problems or even their friends although Neville and Luna appear in small roles. So, 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is really dark than the previous films and there will be no happy moments. But, the movie will still have some jokes, funny ones to cheer up scenes which are too heart-breaking.The movie will also see some emotional scenes that will show growth in the characters especially Ron. The relationship between Hermione and Ron would be a little bit threatened due to the quest and of course, a bit of Harry. The performances by the actors and actresses actually match the Oscar standards I would say. Emma Watson shows growth in her acting and seemed confident than ever. Rupert Grint showed some growth in his acting too by the emotional scenes given. Daniel Radcliffe seemed even more confident but was a bit less in depth compared to the other two. Overall, the movie consists of remarkable acting performances. But, I would say the one who performed best was as always from the fifth film, Helena Bonham Carter or known as the wicked Bellatrix Lestrange. The acting was totally perfect not to mention the remarkable acting contribution from Imelda Staunton or better known as Dolores Umbridge.Exciting and thrilling, I really enjoyed the film. It was dark, brilliant and perfect. Although a bit slow-paced, I still really enjoyed the film. I don't think it will disappoint any one even its book's fans. Even though the scenes were re-arranged while some excluded, it was still acceptable and as a reader of the book, I really appreciated the changes. So, book fans of the series, you wouldn't be too disappointed with the movie as the movie was loyal enough to the book. Also, the film ends with a horrifying scene related to Voldemort and it makes you have the creeps. But, that all ends in Part 2, doesn't it?Thank you David Yates for creating a very dark and amazing film. Can't wait for Part 2! Prince AJB's Score: 10/10Thanks for reading my review on 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1'. Hope it's useful to you.",10,71,123,19 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Po's Fist Hungers for Justice, I Hunger for More Po
","'Kungfu Panda 2' is an excellent sequel to an excellent preceding film and a truly fun film to experience with your family and friends. It is as enjoyable as watching through the first time, maybe even better. Here, the elements from the first film are improved and crafted for this sequel to create a wonderful, stunning, and memorable adventure that will surely entertain all its audiences and leave them hungry for more Po.The plot of this movie is much more enveloping than that of the first film. Po, now the Dragon Warrior is a hero protecting the citizens of China with his fellow friends, the Furious Five, as well as his master, Master Shifu. But then, a threat endangers all of China as well and threatens the existence of Kungfu. This threat is organized by the peacock, Lord Shen, who is after the destruction of China, and the extinction of Kungfu. Now Po, the Kungfu Panda, with the Furious Five, are determined to stop Lord Shen from destroying China and the existence of Kungfu, despite that Lord Shen has designed a very powerful weapon (something like a catapult). But doing so takes Po into learning the truth about the past, about who his parents are, and about who he is.'Panda 2' is also the first 'Panda' film to be shown in 3D, which wasn't quite bad. Depth was practically conspicuous throughout the film and is certainly not a bad choice in how to enjoy this film. 'Kungfu Panda 2' is definitely a film worth watching in 3D. With a more threatening premise, and the addition of 3D, 'Panda 2' also improves on the action scenes. The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should keep kids and adults hooked. The animation movements and CGI in 'Kungfu Panda 2' are also excellent and awesome. The backgrounds, and the setting are all very detailed and the complex movements of the characters are simply perfect. Bravo!Another element welcome to the 'Panda' movies is romance. In this movie, Po will start to have a relationship with another creature (No, I won't tell who he had it with). Speaking of relationships, the movie will also get emotional as Po begins to discover the truth about his past. Humor plays an essential role in this film and will leave you laughing in your seats. I think the jokes here can give you more laughs than the jokes from the first film. 'Kungfu Panda 2' will definitely keep you laugh your head off. Apart from all these, I was also amazed in how they could use a peacock as a skilled martial arts creature. At first, I thought, how could they use a peacock, full of feathers, as a martial arts villain. Then 'Kungfu Panda 2' revealed it all and I was stunned by their work in crafting a feathery bird, into a dangerous, and ruthless villain. In terms of recommendation, I would recommend this movie to all ages. The humor will appeal to little children, as well as older audiences alike, and the fighting scenes will appeal to teenagers, or and older audience. 3D is definitely worth it for experiencing this film. After analyzing the box office performance of 'Kungfu Panda 2', I feel pitiful for the movie, especially when Dreamworks have crafted a wonderful and amazing film for audiences to enjoy. I do hope that the box office performance of the film rebounds and becomes a great hit in the box office world. I also do hope that this movie will be successful enough for the sake of 'Panda 3'. So yes. Po's fist hungers for justice. But I hunger for more Po!Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)Thank you for reading my review on 'Kungfu Panda 2'. I hope my review is useful for you.",10,47,64,24 June 2011
Salt," Who is Salt? Better find out Quickly
","'Salt' is an action thriller about a CIA officer named Evelyn Salt. After trying to interrogate a captured Russian person, she is then accused of being a Russian sleeper agent lurking in the U.S. With no other choice, Salt goes on the run to clear her name and so the question remains: 'Who is Salt?' From the trailer, I thought it was so thrilling. I know, many trailers these days are thrilling even though the original film is horrible. But, it also looks interesting and I think 'Salt' is an amazing action film that will blow your minds up.Although you might have some thoughts about the question or the tag line it self, the movie has many surprises than what you expect from the trailer. Maybe you expect this to be good but in the movie, he's bad. Some things like that. I'll tell you a tip, the main antagonist I may say is almost nothing what you expect from the trailer.The acting was perfect. Angelina Jolie acted Evelyn Salt like she was really Salt. It was mesmerizing. I loved her acting. No problem with the acting. Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter is a good friend of Salt. Schreiber who was Sabretooth last year was great now. He looked really confident and was really in depth in his acting. The other minors are also memorable. The acting was in a word ... amazing.The cinematography was brilliant. The action scenes were perfectly directed at any aspect of mine. The director, Phillip Noyce tried to make every scene enjoyable and the climax of the movie at maximum level. Of course, he needed the help of the music from James Newton Howard to increase the excitement of the film. The others like the special effects were simply perfect.If you know the plot from what you get from the Internet, that is barely telling you any part of the story. That is just the beginning of the story, not even a single secret out. So, I guarantee that when you watch this brilliant thriller on the big screen, you'll get surprised.To wrap this up, 'Salt' is absolutely a rare thriller you might find these days besides 'Inception' which was also a masterpiece. I recommend this to action lovers, people who love surprises as this movie provides many plot twists and of course, fans of Angelina Jolie when she's in action. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 and of course, thanks for reading my review. Hope you find my review useful.",9,5,12,30 July 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Spectacular and Immensely Fun, 'Mission: Impossible' Keeps Soaring
","*VERY MINOR SPOILERS*The fifth installment of the now quintessential action spy franchise has arrived 19 years since the original. Times change, the crew changes, yet our hero is always going to be Ethan Hunt. This time, he's going to face his most seemingly impossible mission yet: take down a mysterious anti- IMF group called the Syndicate, with the help of a few allies and a disavowed British agent who may or may not be on his side. Let's get on to the points. Pros (Things that I enjoyed about the film)1. The film starts with a blast with full-throttle action and doesn't hold up until the end of the movie. It's very fast-paced and an exhilarating adventure. 2. Our main team is made of our favorite agents: the nearly- superhuman Ethan Hunt, the lovable tech-genius Benji Dunn, the kick-ass William Brandt, and the return of original computer hacker Luther Stickell. It's worth to note that there aren't any female IMF agents though. 3. The two mega-action sequences here are able to stand alongside the stand-out scenes from its predecessor: the underwater scene and the airplane scene. 4. Tom Cruise is an action machine and here, he continues to just prove that he's the best at what he does, and despite his increasing age, he's also increasing his credentials as an action movie stars. It also amazes me that even at more than 50, he's still willing to do his own stunts. Incredible. 5. The villain here is the mysterious Syndicate. I found its motives to not be that original but not too preposterous and lazy either. (I'm pointing at you M:I 2. Spreading a disease and curing a disease?)6. Rebecca Ferguson's character is a welcome addition to this film. Her presence adds another layer of mystery and keeps us guessing on whose side she really is on. 7. The story takes place on many different locations around the globe and including an exotic one (Morocco). This is one of the many things I really like about global espionage films. 8. The humor here is spot-on too. It does not feel forced and for the most part, it works. But more importantly, it does not detract from the direction of the plot and does not become distractions. 9. The climax is very smart and is immensely satisfying. It's lengthy and even without a jaw-dropping moment, it culminates into a very thrilling and pleasing finale. Cons (It doesn't necessarily bog down the film but I felt that it could have been changed for the better)1. There are many action sequences but I was disappointed that there was a lack of action scenes led by Jeremy Renner. We've seen him kick-ass in the previous installment, as Hawkeye in the 'Avengers' films, and even become the leading role in 'The Bourne Legacy'. I really thought I would see him get some solo time, but not here. 2. I felt that the ending was a tad bit too abrupt. I would love to see more of the immediate aftermath for those more involved in the conflict. 3. The situation faced by the heroes is very similar to 'Ghost Protocol', in the sense that they are disavowed by the authorities and therefore they are wanted people.4. (Minor spoiler) The whole four-man team only get together halfway into the movie, so there's not a lot of action sequences where they all team up together where each does their own job and depends on the other (i.e. the Burj Khalifa scene and the India scene from 'Ghost Protocol'). In most scenes here (especially the beginning), the main team is separated and off doing their own missions.5. The conflict here is between Ethan Hunt and the Syndicate. At one point, it becomes personal, but I felt it was not just as personal as the one present in 'M:I 3' where Ethan's girlfriend is abducted by Philip Seymour Hoffman's character. 6. Alec Baldwin's character is more comic than imposing as his role suggests (can be a good thing, depending on how you look at it?)Overall, 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is a very solid and very well-done action movie that is on par with the previous installment, which itself is already an incredible thrilling ride. It doesn't necessarily add anything game-changing to the franchise, but it doesn't put anything 'Ghost Protocol' accomplished to waste. It certainly was very fun and ranks among the best entry in the franchise alongside 'Ghost Protocol'. It identifies what we love about the previous installments to deliver an entry that is immensely pleasing and satisfying. This movie is highly recommended whether you're a fan of the franchise, of action spy films, or of Tom Cruise. Even after 19 years, the franchise just keeps soaring and if sequels are as good as this, I will certainly be looking out for future installments.",9,2,5,2 August 2015
Shrek Forever After," Shrek Forever After: Enjoyable!
","Shrek Forever After is said to be the final chapter of the Shrek series. Well, perhaps the final installment is a good installment to finish the Shrek series.Pretty much like the previous series, Shrek Forever After has those fairy tale themes. In this installment, it still has the guts to make you laugh. It can still be called good (although it's not very good). I like the alternate version of Puss in Boots.The story was also quite smart. Well, I still enjoyed it.The appearance of Rumpelstilskin is the thing I like the most. His actions are pretty much laughable. For me, he's the best movie villain for children. Shrek Forever After is more exciting than the previous installments. But, the problem is that it's too short. If you compare it with 'How To Train Your Dragon', 'Dragon' (even though with approximately with the same running time) has many more scenes than 'Shrek' does. It all happens so quickly. It's like having a normal pace in the beginning and then hurrying up in the end. But, Shrek Forever After can still be called an enjoyable film. 7 stars!",7,1,7,22 May 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," An Amazing Reboot; Even Better than the Original
","Who doesn't know Spider-Man, especially when a trilogy of films based on the superhero started a little over ten years ago? All three films have been tremendous successes and have become movie phenomenons. Sadly, the third film was a mess, filled with too many villains and disastrous subplots. So to make things easier, they went for the 'reboot' route with Marc Webb replacing Sam Raimi, Andrew Garfield taking over Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replacing Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Luckily, they did a great job of it.The story of Peter Parker's origins in 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is not necessarily the 'Untold Story' as the advertisements say but rather a revamped version. It goes back to basics, taking the key plot points of the original 'Spider-Man' film and putting it all together with a few more details and finishing touches. Peter Parker, an orphan living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, is in high school. He's nerdy and sort of unsociable. He has a hobby in photography although his true passion lies in Science. In an attempt to discover his father's secret life, and of course due to curiosity and stubbornness, he gets bitten by a modified spider and gains his superpowers. His superpowers however don't include being able to shoot webs out of his hands as now he uses mechanical devices to shoot out the webs.Those who watched the 2002 original blockbuster may feel over-familiar with the first hour of the film as it stays very similar with it. Even Uncle Ben's death is present here, albeit killed by a different person. However, I must say that the origin story is done perfectly and more enjoyable than the one provided in the first film. It's more detailed and his parents, especially his father, is more involved here. It's also surprisingly more touching, and more emotional.Here, the villain is someone who hasn't appeared in any of the previous films. It's no other than the Lizard. Apparently the Lizard is the result of an experiment done by Dr. Curt Connors, who is the working partner of Peter's dad, Richard Parker. Both of them have been working on cross-species genetics planning to cure others. Unfortunately, Richard died in a plane crash along with his wife resulting in Peter becoming an orphan. Connors has also lost his right arm in an incident and has been observing the regenerative abilities of reptiles (particularly the lizard) in an attempt to grow his right arm back. With the help of Peter Parker, he successfully creates the serum and it worked. However, it does just more than that, the serum completely changes him and turns him into a monster named The Lizard, now equipped with superhuman strength and abilities.Gwen Stacy's is Spider-Man's main love interest here. Unlike MJ, she is also interested in Science, not someone into singing or anything like that. In fact, she is like the assistant of Dr. Connors and works in Oscorp. Even though she loves Peter Parker and knows of his secret identity, her father is apparently Captain George Stacy and Captain in the Police Department and has issued an arrest warrant for Spider-Man. So much trouble. This creates a stronger romance for the film and is definitely another triumph over the original Spider-Man.'The Amazing Spider-Man' offers very powerful performances by the actors. Andrew Garfield gave a great performance as the newly revamped Spider-Man. However, I thought that he would be unsuitable as he would look like someone you don't want to mess with and hardly a nerd. But that all changed when I saw this film. He successfully gave Peter the teenage personality needed and was stunning. Emma Stone also gave a great performance as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two leads were convincing. Rhys Ifans gave a cruel and menacing portrayal of Dr. Curt Connors and also did a great job.The reboot also had impressive 3D effects and one of the few films that uses the 3D wisely. The sets more realistic and envelops you into the action. Talking about action, the battles here are also very exciting and creates high levels of suspense. However, I thought that some of the action sequences are less creative than others and therefore not consistent. The battle in the bridge was satisfying whereas the battle in the school was less creative although it incorporated a very humorous scene. Just when you thought Spider-Man was becoming 'Batman Begins' and descending into darkness, it instead became an action film filled with lots of humor too. There are many comedic scenes that make the film fun and not too depressing. The most humorous scene was actually the one with the signature Stan Lee cameo, the creator himself. This is by far the best Stan cameo I've ever seen and was very hilarious.'The Amazing Spider-Man' is amazing indeed. It has great acting, impressive 3D effects, and a detailed familiar plot. The two things that downed this film was probably that familiar feeling of the plot which makes it less intriguing (especially when the original film just came out a little over ten years ago), and the less creative battles in the movie. However, the former can be repaired by the more detailed additional plot points and polishes to the origin story. Otherwise, I enjoyed the film immensely. It had a great villain, fun comedic moments, exciting action sequences, and a strong love subplot. I would say that this reboot is probably better than the original, far better than the third, and on par with the second. And watch for that one scene after the credits start rolling. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: 'The Amazing Spider-Man' offers viewers an excellent reboot to one of the greatest Marvel franchises ever, thanks to Andrew Garfield's excellent performance, and director Marc Webb who has polished the origin story and crafted an action-packed, emotional, and funny superhero film.",9,18,39,3 July 2012
Toy Story 4," Beautiful Epilogue to a Masterful Tetralogy
","'Toy Story 4' comes 9 years after 'Toy Story 3', giving us another tale of the toys after their saying their goodbyes with Andy. To be honest, I felt 'Toy Story 3' was the perfect conclusion, given that Andy had been the toys' owner over the course of the film series, and their separation and Andy moving on just felt like the apt place to end things. I was a bit skeptical that this installment would feel unneeded, and out of place, because what could possibly be there to explore. It would be a shame if a redundant installment ruined one of the best trilogies of all time, but I'm glad to say it may perhaps make it one of the best, if not the best tetralogy of all time.This installment is mainly focused on Woody, dealing with the aftermath of no longer being with Andy, and being left with Bonnie, leading to questions of his self-purpose and what-not. Bonnie is an adorable character but she's no Andy, and perhaps because of that, I associate 'Toy Story 4' as more of an epilogue instead of a full-fledged installment. It's not a bad thing, but it does stand out being the only movie where Andy is not in the background.There are a bunch of new characters here; Forky, a newly made toy struggling to cope with his sentience, Duke Caboom, Canada's greatest stuntman voiced by everyone's favorite actor right now Keanu Reeves, Ducky and Bunny, the fluffy duo brought to life by the comedy duo Key and Peele. These characters are plenty of fun to watch and each of them have their own unique charms. They are excellent characters and an appropriate amount of screen time is dedicated to each of them. That said, this means that the characters we have been familiar with (Jessie, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, etc.) are sort of given the backseat. It would have been great if they had been given a more central part in the action but it's understandable to manage the time to give to the newcomers.The story itself is beautiful and not as dark as Toy Story 3, with Lotso essentially transforming the kids' center into some sort of prison camp. It deals with questions of what it means to be a toy and what a toy dreams life should be. I feel it to be somewhat more existential questions than I had expected, especially with the arrival of Forky, a newly created being brought to life from trash. Perhaps with age comes the boldness to ask more challenging questions. This is after all, a 24-year-old franchise.The animation is beautiful and some of the scenes just stood out as being immaculate and gorgeous. Some of the scenes are set in a carnival with lights and serving as a backdrop with all the lights illuminating in the background, it was just a feast for the eyes. That said, I have to point out that the movie does not really have a wide setting, it's pretty much limited to certain locations. It's more expansive than 'Toy Story 3' but not as diverse as 'Toy Story 2'. Somewhat with the ever-growing ensemble of toys, it also is narrower in scope.Ultimately, 'Toy Story 4' is an amazing movie and wiped away any notions I had that this movie would be a letdown, considering how 'Toy Story 3' acted as a very sweet conclusion. I personally think 'Toy Story 2' is still the best and this one particularly acts as more of an epilogue, but it is a damn good one.",9,49,98,21 June 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Ethan Hunt is Back in Action ...
","... and he's climbing the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa of Dubai. Not only he's ascending the super-tall structure, he's going to infiltrate the Kremlin in Moscow, chase people in a huge sandstorm, and of course ... save the world. The story: the IMF is accused for bombing the Kremlin, although they were not actually the perpetrators. Due to this, the IMF is shut down and 'Operation Ghost Protocol' is launched with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and William Brandt(Jeremy Renner), a group of 4 people being what is left of the IMF. Together, they find that there was another person behind the bombing code-named 'Cobalt' and he has a plan to ignite a nuclear war which he believes would begin the next stage of human evolution. From beginning to end, I was hooked by all the action scenes. The action scenes and all the moves are spectacular. The hand-to-hand combats, the chase scenes, the gunfights are very well-done and spectacular. The cinematography was excellent and one of the best in years. Of course, the Burj Khalifa scene was the trademark of the whole film. Ethan Hunt climbing the Burj Khalifa was thrilling enough. But with a limited time, having trouble going back down, and running around and swinging around the structure just quickens the pace of the story and makes the scene very stylish. This scene is just outstanding and will be one of the highlights of the film. The acting was very well-done. After 5 years of absence in the series, Tom Cruise still got his spy skills here. Paula Patton's bad girl character is very well-played. Simon Pegg as the clumsy-but-genius Benji Dunn was amazing. Jeremy Renner as the so-called-analyst-but- actually-IMF-agent William Brandt was stunning and great. The performances of the actors/actresses are very strong and convincing.I love the technology used in this film. They are just unreal. A device that lets you float using magnetic attraction. A device that copies the scenery behind and displays it into a screen that allows you to deceive other people who are looking at the screen. A suit that turns into a casual jacket when you wear it inside-out. All of these devices are creatively made and looking at them being operated is just so fun. And be sure to see the amazing BMW Vision (a futuristic, BMW concept car) in a scene set in Dubai. (Also, this movie is keen about BMWs.)The mission tactics are also ingenious. The tactics are very smart and are very entertaining. How they create diversions in the most unlikely situations and the scenes involving the composition of a plan keep the film in a constant quick pace and increases the suspense of the film. When they take their tactics into action, that's where they get more interesting. The comedy here adds up the fun in this film. Sometimes, prolonged scenes of action are just too noisy and make the movie feel plain. But not here. The comedy scenes here act as intervals between so we don't always see long, noisy, and bloated action scenes (major trouble of 'Transformers') and make sure that we have a perfect dose of both. All these elements are very well-done and balanced and together form a suspenseful, fast-paced, and thrilling, yet funny action ride worth to experience. I think we should thank genius director Brad Bird for successfully revitalizing the movie series. This movie is just brilliant and I think it's because of Bird's genius directing. Final Verdict: With fast-paced directing by Brad Bird and exciting action sequences, yet with funny moments, this movie is a thrilling ride worth to experience. Rating: 10/10Thanks for reading my review on 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol'. I hope this review is useful.",10,161,248,17 December 2011
The Lion King," Beautiful Remake in the Most Literal Sense
","In the age of advancing CGI, 'The Lion King' is definitely one of the best visual movies I've ever seen. The animals are highly realistic, the surroundings were vivid, and at times when there was no dialogue, you might think you're watching a documentary on Nat Geo. It is a beautiful movie but if you've seen the original movie, you'll see that this movie is a near-replica of the original, with scenes that come right out of the original, adopting identical framings, etc. It adds very little to the original movie and its status as a 'remake' is very spot-on.The animals are very lifelike and beautiful to watch. That said, just as I think real lions are hard to distinguish from one another, I also feel like the lions here are very hard to distinguish from one another. It helps Mufasa and adult Simba are never in the same scene, because I would be very confused. However, the lionesses are very identical to one another, and it's only because I'm familiar with the fact that Nala is the main lioness in the story, that I was able to distinguish her from the other lionesses. The standout design was Scar, though, and while he's not as colorful as the cartoon version (black mane, green lions), his rugged look, and not to forget with an actual scar across his left eye, presents a terrifying villain, elevating one of Disney's best villains into another level.Another drawback with realism is that it's hard to discern emotions from the animals, aside from smiles, etc. But it's difficult to obtain the same amount of expression as in the original, where the eyes are so much more flexible. It loses a certain degree of charm, and has to be made up by the voice actors. I personally found Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Timon (Billy Eichner), and Pumba (Seth Rogen) to be highlights in the movie, and their vocal performances were top-notch.Ultimately, 'The Lion King' is a beautiful movie that is the definition of a 'remake' in the most literal sense. Even the dialogue is highly identical, save for some modern updates to connect with today's audience. It's visually splendid and I had a good time watching the movie, and while everything is highly familiar, it was still a great experience getting to see how those animated frames get translated into the hyper-realistic renderings. However, now having watched both, I'm still unsure in the future, which version I would watch when I want to revisit the story. This remake is a technological marvel, but the original had strong colors, vivid emotions, and just an overall animated charm that a live-action version just can't have. Let's leave it at 50-50.",8,1,5,23 July 2019
Brave," Pixar Nailed it Again, Now with a Tale of a Rebellious Princess and Caring Mother
","Today, Pixar is undoubtedly one of the most invincible force in the movie industry. Since 'Toy Story 2', the studio has unleashed nine-straight string of $200 million movies and each of their movies have been favored by both audiences and critics alike. Even though last year's 'Cars 2' failed to meet expectations in both critical (I still liked it though) and box office prospects, Pixar is still undeniably one of the most powerful studios existing now and the arrival of 2012's 'Brave' just reaffirms that statement.Stepping away from the world of racing cars, 'Brave' explores the life of Princess Merida , a master archer princess living in the lands of Scotland during the Middle Ages. Apparently, she doesn't like being a princess because she thinks her whole life is fully planned and therefore she lacks freedom in her life because of her mother, Queen Elinor, and of course because of old traditions. Also, she has to decide which oldest son of the three allied clans would she marry because of old tradition which causes her to show more hate to her mother. In an attempt to change her mother's mind, she seeks a witch living in the middle of a dark forest for a magical spell that will change her mother. Unfortunately, 'change her mother' to the witch means change physically and so Queen Elinor is transformed into a bear instead. Now, she has to reverse the curse before it's too late.Unlike other princesses out there, Merida is a tomboy, a master archer, a rebellious teenage girl who dislikes being a princess. Her father, King Fergus gave her her first bow in the beginning of the movie. This causes it to distance the movie from other princess movies. She's a warrior, magnet to danger, full of courage, unlike those princesses who act all clumsy when they meet the villains. She has triplet brothers: Harris, Hubert, and Hamish. They are even worse than Merida. They act like little devils and are incredibly naughty and bring lots of trouble but they can be helpful sometimes. They are adorably-designed and will undoubtedly be audience favorites.Merida's parents are Queen Elinor and King Fergus. Queen Elinor is a highly proper mother. She's caring, kind, patient, but also stern, highly organized, very tidy, and sometimes can be annoying to Merida because of her queen-like personality. King Fergus on the other hand is more cheerful, messy, and playful, sometimes to Elinor's dismay. In the beginning of the movie, King Fergus lost his leg in an encounter with an ancient savage bear named Mor'du. From then on, he's sworn revenge against the bear.The rendering of Scotland during the Middle Ages is amazing and incredible. Every point in the grasslands, every shrub is just incredibly detailed. The trees and everything look so lifelike that I almost forgot that I was watching an animated toon, not a live-action film. This shows how Pixar is one of the best movie creators of all time. The 3D enlivens the scenes even more and is recommended.Perhaps the one thing that downgraded this film was its climax. I was expecting a battle with Mor'du yes, but also a little involvement with the witch, maybe a little cameo or maybe using the full potential of her powers. Instead, the witch skipped the scene and left it to Mor'du to handle alone. Also, Merida didn't really get involved in the climax because it was actually Queen Elinor as the bear who did most of the fighting. Even King Fergus and his allied clans are no match for Mor'du.Continuing the tradition of having short films precede the films, 'Brave' is preceded by an animated short named 'La Luna'. The short is about a boy with his father and grandfather who are sailing on a boat. They then stop in the middle of the sea and use a ladder (that's right) to go to the Moon. Apparently the Moon is made up of dozens of glowing smaller stars. The three then sweep the stars to form a crescent moon shape. All I have to say about 'La Luna' is that it's gorgeous, marvelous, and beautiful.'Brave' is a highly recommended film and anyone disappointed with Pixar's previous entry 'Cars 2' will be satisfied with the latest film from one of the most dominant forces in the movie industry. It may not be groundbreaking but it offers a lot of fun, plenty of humor, and lovable characters notably Merida's triplet brothers. 'Brave' also sends out a message to improve communication between mothers and daughters. With great voice performances, 'Brave' offers satisfaction.Rating: 8/10 Final Verdict: It may not be groundbreaking but 'Brave' is a great film that reaffirms the fact that Pixar is one of the powerful forces in the movie industry.",8,13,27,29 June 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An Exhilarating Super-powered ride that barely manages to hold its strings together
","*There are no strings on me*First of all, huge kudos to Joss Whedon for wanting to take the job as the director of this mammoth movie. The sheer scale of this film is both huge and yet smaller at the same time as compared to the last outing. And yet, Whedon manages to pull it all together, despite a few loose strings, and deliver an exuberant two-and-a-half hour thrill ride with the mighty Avengers as they try to stop the technological enemy who is bent on human extinction, Ultron. Despite the Avengers' fight for peace, not all the people in the world adore them. Realizing that the Avengers need a hiatus, Tony Stark attempts to jump-start a peace-keeping program Ultron so that they can take a break from saving the world. However, things quickly go wrong as Ultron immediately decides that peace can only be achieved through the obliteration of human life. The film is simultaneously bigger yet also smaller in scale. On one hand, all of the conflict is based on Earth and therefore, there are no aliens involved (at least until the end of this film), and yet despite the smaller canvas, it becomes much denser as more characters are involved, not to forget the main villain himself. Handling a film this big is not easy and Whedon tries his best to develop his characters and while he doesn't accomplish this perfectly, he does it well enough that we get to roughly know what troubles each of these characters. And it's also welcoming that he spends more time with characters that don't have their own standalone movies such as Hawkeye, Hulk, and Black Widow. Ultron is an interesting villain because he's different from other artificial intelligence villains. While it is true that his motives are based on logic, it's that he has a personality that sets him apart. He was jump-started by Stark, so therefore he inherits some of Stark's attributes such as his sarcasm and dry wit. But he's technological, he doesn't need the Chitauri army, he can make his own, he can reproduce at incredible rates, he can upgrade himself. He also has another perspective on the definition of peace. As long as he has access to the Internet, he's virtually unstoppable. Unlike Loki who's deceptive and mischievous, Ultron's straightforward. But the true standout was James Spader's voice. His voice was menacing, powerful and gave Ultron his signature feature. Ultron's not the only newcomer. There's also the Maximoff twins, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. The twins are not 'mutants' but rather, a result of an experimentation conducted by Hydra member Baron von Strucker. They've suffered a harsh past and therefore, they have a very strong bond as they protect each other. Quicksilver can run incredibly fast psychic powers. These two characters provide something fresh to the film as their powers are visual delights (although that one scene from 'X- Men: Days of Future Past' remains superior) but they're among the crowded canvas of super-powered characters in this film. Therefore, their characterizations are not that extensive but enough for us to relate to them and to keep the action engaging. (There's also the Vision, but it's much better that he remains as mysterious as he is now.)Talking about the action, the action sequences are absolutely outstanding. We get an adequate dose of each character kicking ass and showcasing their powers and abilities. One thing I enjoyed was that the action took place in different locations all around the world and this was very nice to see that the conflict was global and just kept it fresh. Most of the time, I just gasped in awe and just was astonished by just how awesome the action was. Some of the shots were so jaw-dropping I wished I could immortalize them into posters. It brought my inner geek out. Apart from being exhilarating, it was also humorous and that's also another primary reason I loved about this film. Some movies work well with a dark and brooding atmosphere, but I loved that this one was not so gritty but instead, more fun and just more about the adrenaline- filled ride. But all this wouldn't be a fully baked cake without a brilliant script. The script, although unable to delve deep into each character's mind (wished Scarlet Witch explored more), ultimately reminds us that despite their incredible powers, the Avengers are still humans and have faults, and this makes them feel real and to be rooted for.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: It can't help but feel very crowded but Whedon ultimately manages to keep all of the gargantuan content together, despite a few slipped strings, and deliver a hugely sensational and satisfying sequel to 2012's 'The Avengers'.Tip: The mid-credits scene is one to watch out for! Don't miss it!",9,12,27,22 April 2015
Super 8," 'Super 8' is Super Great
","Note: I put the warning of this review as having spoilers, as I'm not sure if I've had written a spoiler below; just in case I wrote one that I considered as not one. From first glance, 'Super 8' resembles an enigma. Later on, the trailers seem to give us information of a very fatal train crash that sets fire lurking everywhere. Besides the derailing of the train, it also shows a mysterious monster punching through the train walls, which leads us to the conclusion that the monster is probably lurking within a small town, and secretly causing chaos around the small town. The story inferred above is indeed correct. But that's not all. There's a whole lot other things that are related to the plot besides the fact that a monster is lurking within the fictional small town of Lillian. The only other thing I'm going to tell you is that a group of children were filming a Super 8 film (that's where the movie got its title) during the event of the train crash. And as a bonus, I'm going to tell you another thing: the events in 'Super 8' will remind you of many of Steven Spielberg's films.When watching this film, expect a lot of sudden monstrous attacks throughout the film. It will happen a lot of times and some will happen in the most unlikely scenes. So beware and keep your eyes open, the monster is everywhere. The acting was convincing and satisfying for audiences to enjoy the film. The special effects were amazing and the script was nothing awkward. It was just - wow!However, what amuses me is how they can use little children as brave heroes. Harry Potter is a young hero yes, but this, against aliens! And another thing: the main character, Joe is depicted in earning C- (or C+, I forgot), but amazingly, he can lead a group of other kids his age (apparently his friends) and devise a plan for saving his other friends. How amazing isn't it!Despite the amusing things, the main culprit, the downside of this movie is no other than the ending. The ending was bland and felt too rushed. After an amazing approx. 100-minute run, the final minutes of the film was disappointing. I figured out the ending could have been much, much better. But overall, I do recommend this movie to all movie adventurers, people who hunger for sudden scares, as well as Steven Spielberg's films. For movie adventurers, this film will take you on an adventure that will keep you hooked from beginning to ending. For moviegoers who loved to be scared suddenly, this movie will give you monstrous attacks that will get you shocked, even if you're almost immune to being shocked (sorry for putting too many 'shocks'). For lovers of Steven Spielberg, this movie will remind you of your Spielberg favorites ('E.T.', 'War of the Worlds', etc.). One statement about 'Super 8': 'Super 8' is super great!Prince AJB's Rating: 9/10 (Very Good)Thank you for reading my review on 'Super 8'. I do hope you find this review useful.",9,11,21,28 June 2011
Joker," Deep-dive into Madness
","'Joker' is not a comic-book movie. It's a gritty, psychological thriller that delves into the mind of one lonely man, who is subject to the cruelties and neglect of society, and finally dissolves into a path of insanity that leaves him irredeemable. It's unsettling and so grounded in reality that while it does take some inspiration from 'Killing Joke', Todd Phillips generates an original story that ultimately reinvents the character of the Joker.That being said, a comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker is just not applicable. Firstly, it's an origin story so that immediately removes the aura of mystery Ledger's Joker. The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' is just a being of unknown origin, present to wreck havoc and be the perfect antithesis to what Batman stands for. 'Joker' is about a lonely man named Arthur Fleck who gradually descends to into a being of madness who happens to be called the 'Joker'. He's not really the Joker from the comics. Perhaps that's because it's an origin story so that some of his most defining characteristics like his charm and genius-intellect are not fully-fleshed out yet. I totally respect the decision to totally reinvent the Joker, but I missed those aspects of the character, and ultimately, I'm hesitant to call Arthur Fleck the Joker.Despite the radically different character, Joaquin Phoenix slays his portrayal of this man. This movie is a showcase of his performance and cements the fact that the Joker is probably, if not already, the most coveted comic-book character to be portrayed in cinema. There are side characters portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, etc. However, this is Phoenix's show and his performance was brilliant, haunting, disturbing and moving. His interpretation of the Joker laugh is so nuanced, that it's more than just a trademark of a character. You can see and hear the pain, sadness, anger from his laughs as he ponders whether his life is a tragedy or comedy. He brought new dimensions to the Joker character, leading us at one point to empathize with him, his sorrow, and we watch helplessly as his character just falls into a path of no return.The script is well-polished and I appreciate that it takes its time and opts for a slow pace to ensure that Arthur Fleck's transition is natural, not forced and abrupt. The result is a dark brooding thriller which I feel can be segmented into two parts; the first of which depicts the crumbling of the wall between Arthur Fleck and insanity, followed by the latter half where things get unsettling and ramps up to accommodate Arthur's full transformation. Some scenes are disturbing, but that's what you'd expect to see in a movie that aims to delve into the mind of someone like the Joker. I do feel the main story arc is a bit too predictable, particularly in the second half of the movie. There's not a lot of impactful twists. That said, the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant, as it compliments the dark atmosphere of the movie very well, with its sorrowful melodies and haunting background. It is music you don't want to listen to alone.All in all, 'Joker' is a really good movie, and a very brave one too, bringing in topics that are relevant today. It brings to light the subjects of mental illness, and social neglect of those affected by the former. I'm not sure if it's really trying to make a statement about it, whether it's trying to say that anyone, if pushed enough, can be someone like the Joker. That would sort of take the 'special' out of the Joker's character. It's definitely not the typical comic-book movie and the Joker here is not the Joker you typically know. But it is a very good psychological character study of a man crumbling to madness, powered by the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix.",9,7,11,8 October 2019
Ice Age: Continental Drift," After Human Encounter, Global Warming, and Dinosaurs, the Continent is Splitting
","We've arrived at the fourth chapter in the 'Ice Age' franchise, and believe it or not, it's been a decade since the original film. The fourth one offers a great time for families, and is hilarious. However, after reaching its peak in 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs', I felt that 'Continental Drift' was unsatisfying when compared to predecessors.After protecting a human child, avoiding a meltdown, and surviving dinosaurs, the super continent of Pangeaea is separating into today's continents. All this is caused by our lovable squirrel Scrat, accidentally due to his endless quest to get his acorn. This causes a large landmass to move and separates Manny from his family (wife Ellie and now-grown daughter Peaches). Manny, along with sloth Sid, saber-toothed tiger Diego, and Sid's 'lunatic' Granny, now stranded on a small block of floating ice, attempt to return back. Meanwhile, the moving landmass forces Ellie, Peaches and the other animals to head to a land bridge.During their little journey, Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny encounter a crew of pirates led by the ape Captain Gutt. From here on, we experience a whole lot more action scenes than we expected and needed and makes 'Continental Drift' as the most action-packed installment of the series yet. While this is the most action-packed yet, I still think that the story is a bit lacking in richness. This installment lacks subplots causing me to believe that the filmmakers might have been quite lazy when writing the film. In fact, they recycled some of the elements from the previous films for this one. Quite embarrassing when the previous installments were all brilliant. There were some subplots that try to enrich the story but some of them are just mediocre at best. This refers to the love subplot between Diego and one of Captain Gutt's apprentices, a saber-toothed tiger named Shira. After Diego saved her life, a relationship sparked but it had poor development. I felt it was too rushed and it would have been killer if they had been more careful. But well, it's a family movie. There's another one which features a love triangle between Peaches (Manny and Ellie's 19-year-old daughter), Louis (a mole hog who is Peaches's best friend and who has a crush on Peaches), and Ethan (the popular mammoth whom Peaches has a crush on and is unexpectedly voiced by rapper Drake). This one was done perfectly and was impressive. I also felt that the film lacked that heart and touching feeling we experienced in the previous three films. I mean, we were sort of tickled when we discovered Manny's desire for family in the first film, and when we discovered Ellie's past in the second film, and when we saw Sid say his final goodbyes to the dinosaurs in the third film. In 'Continental Drift' that feeling is gone. Nowhere to be found. I personally felt that that was one of the strongest points of the 'Ice Age' films but it was nowhere to be found in this one. For the first time, we catch a glimpse of Sid's family. That includes his mother, father, Granny and etc. Apparently they only came to dump 'lunatic' Granny for Sid before they escaped because Granny is too hard to handle. Granny later on makes an addition to the trio and despite being sort of crazy, she proved to be useful in the climax of the scene.In 'Continental Drift' we meet new species of animals. We meet an ape, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, badger, elephant seal, a Blue-footed Booby, and more. Most of them are part of Gutt's crew. But interestingly, we meet a creature that is part of legend, Greek mythology to be exact. They are none other than the Sirens. They take on the appearance of loved ones to lure the animals into danger. They are indeed deadly, but were almost unable to lure Scrat, after taking the form of former girlfriend Scratte. Speaking of Scrat, his quest to grab that acorn continues. This time, he encounters a map that would take him to the heaven of acorns, Scratlantis. He doesn't interact with the trio like they did in the previous installment. Even if you thought it would be exhausting to see him again and again, it never gets old. Seeing Scratch's futile attempts at getting his hands on the acorn is just hilarious. I have to say the animation was excellent. It was wonderful, flawless and extremely detailed. This is a significant improvement over the previous three installments. The 3D works although it isn't mandatory. There is a big crew of voice talents behind the studio. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary, reprise their roles as Manny, Sid, and Diego, respectively and they are still better than ever. Queen Latifah also reprises her role as Ellie as she drives her character with power. Keke Palmer fills in the role of Manny and Ellie's teenage daughter Peaches, who is stubborn and grown-up. Some of today's hottest singers are also here. Rapper Drake fills in the voice of Ethan whereas Nicki Minaj provides the voice of Steffie, another woolly mammoth. We even have Jennifer Lopez filling in for Shira. 'Continental Drift' may not be a worthy follow-up to the previous installments but it promises to be a great fun time in the theaters for families. It's hilarious and the most action-packed entry of the series yet. I just felt that it didn't capture the heart of the previous installments and the story wasn't rich enough. But hey, it's a family movie not a drama film. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: It may not compare to its brilliant predecessors but 'Continental Drift' is a promising movie-going experience for families filled with hilarious moments and action-packed sequences.",7,6,10,16 July 2012
Inception," Nolan Takes Us Into A Journey of Dreams
","Two years ago, Christopher Nolan brought in the highly successful 'The Dark Knight' to theaters and eventually becoming a box office legend and also an acclaimed film. Now, Nolan steps away from the franchise for a while to bring up a new sensation to the screen by 'Inception'.'Inception' tells about Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) who's skilled in stealing ideas from other people's minds or 'extracting'. But, doing so has made him lost many things such as his wife and having to not see his children again. But, Saito (Watanabe) offers him a job instead of stealing ideas to perform an 'inception' or to plants one.I really liked 'Inception'. The movie is so creative and smart that it takes us to layers of dreams. Then, the characters go fight in their dreams. 'Inception' is absolutely going to be a classic.The acting was not bad at all. It was stunning and amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb was perfect. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and etc., they're also great. There was definitely no problem with the acting.The special effects were also brilliant. The dream sequences were real-like. Everything about the effects were cool.The fighting scenes in this movie were thrilling and exciting. Nolan created these scenes beautifully. I really like the scenes. But, the problem is that they're just too long and that made the movie a bit boring. But, it's still fun to watch.The score is produced by the acclaimed Hans Zimmer. After scoring 'Sherlock Holmes' and other successful movies, he brings his brilliant tunes to increase the thrills in 'Inception'Next, I truly love the directing of Christopher Nolan. He's sure going to end up as a legendary film maker. He directs every single move perfectly. He creates the dreams carefully. After Nolan's 'Inception' has been watched by the world, he's sure going gain more fame.'Inception' is a movie you don't want to miss this summer 2010. I also think that 'Inception' might receive some 'Oscar' nominations. Overall, 'Inception' is a rare summer blockbuster you will ever watch. I award this movie a score of ten stars. Nolan should be proud of his works.Since this movie explains an 'inception' as planting one idea, a question struck my head. Did they perform an 'inception' on my mind?",10,1,3,16 July 2010
Prometheus," Discovering Humanity's Forerunners May Lead to Our Extinction
","What created humanity? Why are we here? Who created us? The answers to these questions are what the characters in 'Prometheus' seek in this two-hour sci-fi film. In this magnificent two-hour adventure of exploring our beginnings, we are taken to a moon located in a distant galaxy named LV-223 where clues and secrets to humanity's beginnings are kept and where dangers against undiscovered species await.'Prometheus' is a prequel to 1979's science-fiction horror masterpiece 'Alien', also directed by Ridley Scott. It's been over 33 years since that critically acclaimed film influenced the movie industry and aside from James Cameron's 'Aliens' released in 1986, subsequent films in the series (and that includes the two crossovers 'Alien vs. Predator' and 'Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem') have brought disappointment and it must have been painful for Ridley Scott to watch his beloved franchise crumble into pieces. But that all changes with the arrival of 'Prometheus', the long-awaited prequel to the original 'Alien' film.The first moments of 'Prometheus' show us the beautiful sceneries of Earth in the distant past. Is it Earth? We don't know. Then we see an alien with extremely pale skin and well-built standing by a massive waterfall. However, we don't know where the scene is set. The alien drinks a mysterious black liquid and then vomits. He then disintegrates with his remains falling into the bottom of the massive plunge pool where it morphs into something alive.We then travel into 2089 where Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover mysterious markings in a cave located in the beautiful Isle of Skye located in Scotland. After comparing these markings with previous markings found in other locations, the archaeologist couple believe that this is an invitation from humanity's ancestors, which they call the Engineers. Then we go to 2093 where we arrive in LV-223 using a vessel called the Prometheus. Then the violent and gory adventure begins.'Prometheus' is divided into two parts. The first hour focuses on discovering the magnificent dome located on the moon and examining the various extraterrestrial objects while observing some beautiful visual sets. The second hour of the film is when action sequences become more prominent, when it gets more violent and gory, and when there are many deaths.Most of the film takes place inside the dome or pyramid located on the moon. It is where most of the story takes place. At first, it seems like an ordinary network of corridors with nothing interesting but as we get more into the film, we discover some horrifying stuff here and the movie starts to get more interesting from there on. The horror scenes are reminiscent of those present in the original 'Alien'. We discover multiple vases filled with disgusting but deadly black liquid, a massive statue of a humanoid head, and corpses of giant aliens (believed to be those of the Engineers').Even though most of the film takes place in dark and gloomy spots, the visual effects of the film is still one of the strongest highlights of the film. The murals on the ceilings of the dome are very detailed and beautiful. The carvings on the walls of the pyramid are intricate and very meticulous in detail. One of the scenes where David discovers a room and finds a star map highlighting Earth has amazing visual effects. It's one of the bright scenes in the film and is the best scene in terms of visual effects. The holograms and everything incorporated in that scene is a job well done. The 3D is also excellent and it does not disappoint.Let's talk about the characters now. Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley is now replaced by Noomi Rapace's archaeological character Elizabeth Shaw. She is a strong believer in God and throughout the movie, she still believes that God is the ultimate source of life and creator of everything. However, she's less bad-ass compared to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley but a scene in the movie depicts her sense of feminine strength. Accompanying Shaw is her love interest Charlie Holloway portrayed by Logan Marhsall-Green. Unlike Shaw, Holloway is not a strong believer in God and skeptic. Onboard the ship is the android David portrayed excellently by Michael Fassbender. He is an android who doesn't show feelings and is envious of mankind's feelings. There also others on board the ship: Meredith Vickers, Captain Janek, Millburn, Fifield.The characters were portrayed excellently from their respective performers. Noomi Rapace didn't give an Oscar-worthy performance but she still delivered a powerful performance. Logan Marshall-Green's portrayal of Charlie Holloway was also strong. Charlize Theron gave one of the more powerful performances in the film as Meredith Vickers. The minor characters were given excellent performances too. However, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the android David grabs the spotlight. His performance as the android is intriguing and very powerful that for a second, I thought he was portrayed by a real android.The characters in 'Prometheus' are driven by intrigue and curiosity. They are so interested in discovering their origins that they would pay any cost to uncover the truth and reach the answer. Their sense of curiosity is what caused the disaster. 'Prometheus' is later on fueled by extremely intricate sets and amazing visual effects and accompanied by solid performances (a special note to Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David). Whether it's a prequel, sequel, standalone film, 'Prometheus' is a magnificent film. It's not perfect and it has some flaws but 'Prometheus' is a must-see film of the summer movie season - and in 3D.Rating: 9/10 Final Verdict: It may not be perfect but the fantastic sets and visual effects accompanied with extremely powerful performances, especially Michael Fassbender as David, assure that 'Prometheus' is a must-see movie of the summer.",9,10,19,7 June 2012
Despicable Me," A Brilliant Film Filled With Comedy
","First up, if you're planning to watch 'Despicable Me', put on high expectations because this movie might and will satisfy you with its comedic adventures.In this movie, I truly love the yellow minions. They are just truly adorable, cute and funny. If you listen to their language, it's insanely hilarious. Their actions are truly silly and laughable. The story is very clever. I truly loved it because it's different than most of the other children movies where the protagonist is a good guy rather than having a little bit of a twist where the main character is a villain. Steve Carell's accents on Gru are also excellent. They're unique and amusing. Not only the sounds, the model for Gru is also cool. His nose is like so long that it looks strange like Pinnochio's. The three little orphans are also cute especially Agnes, the smallest one. Vector was also hilarious.The 3D effects were also good. The depths were really seen and some of the scenes really got things towards the audience. So, it's not a bad choice to enjoy it in 3D.'Despicable Me' is another must-see movie this summer as it rivals 'Toy Story 3' to become the best animated film of 2010. Bring your kids and 3D is a good way to enjoy it. In conclusion, this movie gets a perfect rating of 10 stars. By the way, don't miss the scenes in the credits, the 3D effects there are cool.",10,3,6,9 July 2010
X-Men: First Class," An Excellent Prequel With a Compelling Storyline and Exciting Action Sequences; First-Class Entertainment
","'X-Men: First Class' is an excellent prequel to the original 'X-Men' trilogy. It has a compelling storyline chronicling the adventures of Professor X and Magneto, or should I say, Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies, as depicted in the three movies that form the original 'X-Men' trilogy. Not only a compelling storyline, but 'First Class' also promises amazing sequences of intense action. 'First Class' chronicles the adventures of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies. Set in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the two met during a mission in which Xavier and the CIAs are trying to track down a guy named Sebastian Shaw, who apparently is a mutant and acts as a threat to the world. In that time, Xavier found Lensherr trying to stop Shaw from getting away using his mutant powers and told him to let it go as continuing to do so will result in the drowning of Lensherr and Xavier. Later, Lensherr and Xavier become allies and learn of Shaw's intentions of starting World War 3 that would bring mutants into rulers of the world with most of the world in turmoil. Xavier and Lensherr then decide to recruit other mutants and create a mini mutant army to stop Shaw from igniting the start of World War 3. Apart from stopping Shaw, 'First Class' also tells the story of how Xavier and Lensherr became enemies and split the first generation of X-Men. 'First Class' is truly a fantastic prequel to the popular 'X-Men' series. With a compelling storyline, it has action-packed sequences that would keep audiences hooked until the end. The action sequences are much more exciting than that of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should be enjoyed by audiences. Besides the action sequences, the script, and the special effects of the film were excellent. The script had no awkward lines and the special effects of the film were real and life-like. The acting was also great and there was no problem with it. Well done!Humor also plays a role in this film. In serious moments, sometimes to cheer the audiences up, humor is added. The jokes and humor in the movie was pretty funny. Overall, 'First Class' is a mesmerizing mixture of a compelling storyline, action-packed sequences, amazing special effects, and funny jokes. Matthew Vaughn has crafted a fantastic prequel that serves as a pleasant addition to the 'X-Men' series (although 'Wolverine' was disappointing). This movie has great storytelling and awesome sequences of intense action. In terms of recommendation, 'First Class' is a must-watch summer movie that should be on your list of must-see summer blockbusters of 2011. The compelling storyline will keep audiences interested, the fighting scenes should keep audiences excited, and the special effects should make audiences satisfied with the film. Anyone disappointed with the last 'X- Men' movie, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', should be relieved after watching the new, fresh, and amazing 'X-Men: First Class'. 'X-Men: First Class' is truly first-class entertainment. Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)Thank you for reading my review on 'X-Men: First Class'. I do hope that this is a useful review for you to read.",10,43,79,24 June 2011
The Wolverine," Wolverine's True Comeback
","Wolverine is finally back, and this new installment in the 'X-Men' franchise is extremely slick, exhilarating, and top-notch. Forget the disappointing 'Origins' 4 years ago, this is the real Wolverine movie. It's action-packed, dark, occasionally humorous, and surprisingly has depth. It may not be the best 'X-Men' film but 'The Wolverine' is a solid entry that will help the 'X-Men' franchise recover from the disappointing 'Last Stand' and 'Origins'. In this installment, Wolverine is struggling with his immortality. His lover, Jean Grey died way back in 'The Last Stand' and he's been suffering from an endless period of nightmares. It feels as if he has nothing to do on this Earth and he's longing to re-join his lover in the other side. But when an old acquaintance Yashida (a man who Wolverine saved during the 1945 bombing of Nagasaki) invites him to Japan and offers to remove his immortality, Wolverine is delved into new territory. There are two women who work alongside Wolverine here. First, there's Mariko Yashida, the granddaughter of Yashida and the chosen heiress to the throne. When she takes her grandfather's role, she will become the most powerful person in Japan and will need protection from the endless hordes of the Yakuza. The other person is the pink-haired Yukio who is an excellent fighter and form a great team with Wolverine. 'The Wolverine' is set in an environment new to the 'X-Men' franchise, Japan. The vibrant colors, tall buildings, beautiful scenery are used in a maximizing manner. The action scenes look really well in this new setting. What made 'The Wolverine' more engaging was that we finally get to see Logan mortal. He literally will get hurt if he gets shot or cut. For the first time ever, he is no longer invincible and this escalates the tension every time he's in a fight against an adversary. We see Wolverine lingering in the boundary between life and death. Wounded. Then we have the action sequences which are extremely intense. The climax was gripping but I also expressed extreme fondness for the action scene where Wolverine battled against several Yakuza members on top of a lightning-fast moving bullet train. That scene was extremely suspenseful and was one of the highlights, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, the other action sequences were fun too but that bullet train scene was just amazing. Hugh Jackman returns once again as the ageless Logan aka Wolverine. As usual, his performance is strong, gritty, and excellent. The only difference between his performance here and 'Origins' is that his performance here is not burdened by an awful script as it was in 'Origins'. The other performances were powerful too. Tao Okamoto was perfect as the heiress Mariko Yashida and Rila Fukushima was bad-ass as Yukio. Everyone of the cast was good. All in all, 'The Wolverine' is solid, action-packed and a satisfying addition to the 'X-Men' franchise. It has incredible action scenes, solid acting, and a great script. However, I did find something nit-picking (no spoilers here but it concerns Logan's ability to recall a certain memory). Nonetheless, 'The Wolverine' is successfully in continuing the revival of the 'X-Men' franchise and only gets me more hyped about next year's 'Days of Future Past'. And watch out for the post-credits scene in the end. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: Forget 'Origins', 'The Wolverine' is a terrific new entry in the 'X-Men' franchise that serves as the Wolverine movie we all wanted.",8,31,60,27 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Caped Crusader Has Returned for One Last Stand
","Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' trilogy that started with 'Batman Begins' back in 2005, continued with 2008's 'The Dark Knight', finally concludes with the arrival of 'The Dark Knight Rises'. And this conclusion is a very ambitious, thrilling, exciting, and epic ending to one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Nolan has transformed the meaning of superhero films. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is no longer a normal superhero film, it's something beyond that.Not many movie sequels are able to match its predecessors' quality especially when the bar is so high. When the first entry is excellent, many sequels fail to match their predecessors' quality. But 'The Dark Knight' on the other hand improved on the already amazing 'Batman Begins'. The third entry is even harder. An example is the Godfather trilogy which faltered with its third installment. But 'The Dark Knight Rises' is different, it manages to meet the high standard set by its nearly-perfect predecessor.Four years have since the release of 'The Dark Knight'. But the gap in the story is double that. Batman has taken the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes and he has disappeared for eight years since his encounter with Two-Face. In the process, Gotham is experiencing peace time while Bruce Wayne has grown during his hiding in Wayne Manor. He's even grown facial hair and uses a walking stick. Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises is falling apart and is on the verge of bankruptcy. However, Gotham faces a new threat, someone who is powerful both physically and mentally. He is no other than Bane. Equipped with a mask that supplies him a specific gas to help alleviate the excruciating pain he sustained years ago, he is one of Batman's most terrifying adversaries. What helps him become an even more dangerous villain is the brilliant performance by Tom Hardy. While his performance is no match for the brilliant performance of the late Heath Ledger, Hardy's is pleasing in its own right. His menacing voice adds a layer of tension to whenever he makes an appearance and his body-language performance is just outstanding. And of course, this Bane is much more menacing than the Bane we witnessed years ago in 'Batman & Robin'. 'The Dark Knight Rises' starts off slow and the first hour of the film focuses on Bruce's eventual return as the Dark Knight. The tension eventually builds up into one of the best climax scenes Hollywood has ever created. Early on, minor characters get more screen time than they did before and this includes Alfred, Bruce's loyal butler, and Lucius Fox, the man behind all of Bruce's devices. We also meet some new characters, and those include two mysterious but important women whom we will meet throughout the film. The two women are Selina Kyle and Miranda Tate. Selina Kyle is a professional cat burglar who is able to steal almost anything. She's also able to obtain Bruce Wayne's thumb prints. She's also known by her more famous alias, Catwoman. Her presence in the film ups the tension and excitement. Anne Hathaway's performance is also amazing as Catwoman. I didn't think she had what it takes but her performance here proved me wrong. She was able to portray someone who was charming, sly, and bad-ass. As for Miranda Tate, she is more than just Bruce's love interest and Marion Cotillard's performance successfully hides that.'The Dark Knight Rises' proves to be the biggest, darkest, and most epic 'Batman' film yet. This is the first time we get to see Gotham in total chaos. Literally total chaos. Bane unleashes all the criminals Harvey Dent imprisoned during his time as DA and as a result, tremendous chaos ensues on the streets. The government is dead, the rich are robbed of their wealth, Gotham is in anarchy, everyone's life is at stake, and Gotham is on the verge of destruction while Batman is preparing to rise for one last stand against Bane. It's also the most emotional installment of the trilogy as the relationship between Bruce and Alfred is more damaged than ever. Batman doesn't make many appearances here as he is struggling to rise but every time he makes an appearance, he does it in spectacular fashion. His presence on the screen always makes the audiences engaged. This can be attributed to Christian Bale's outstanding performance as the Caped Crusader. His 'Bat' voice is more menacing than ever and he mixes a perfect balance of emotions. The other minor characters were also driven by amazing performances. Gary Oldman gave his best to portray Commissioner James Gordon. James Gordon-Levitt also gave a great performance for young cop John Blake. Michael Caine gave Alfred heart as his relationship with Bruce deteriorates. Morgan Freeman was stunning as he gave out some laughs as Lucius Fox. The cast's performances were all very excellent and they deserve the Oscars. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is also the most action-packed movie of the trilogy. It may be slow at first but it switches to full gear in one of the most sensational climaxes ever. We get to see Batman fighting in the daylight. We also see Batman fight to his fullest against Bane as well as saving Gotham from total annihilation. It's lengthy, it's full of explosions, casualties, unsuspected revelations, and accompanied with flawless yet heart-pounding music. All in all, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a beautiful piece of art. It changes the way people think about superhero films. It changes its meaning. It's beyond a normal superhero film. The villain is satisfying, the film is emotional and filled with heart, the performances are outstanding, and the climax is just brilliant. The ending of the film does not disappoint either. Christopher Nolan is now legend and 'The Dark Knight Rises' is his magnum opus. Rating: 10/10Final Verdict: 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a stunning finale to Nolan's brilliant 'Batman' trilogy and is truly legend.",10,7,16,21 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Pixar's Best Movie And Truly A Masterpiece
","Is 'Toy Story 3' good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. 'Toy Story 3' is an excellent movie for all ages.First, the animation. The moves of the characters are simply perfect. Ken and Barbie, they're robotic moves are so breathtaking. The moves are simply so detail and mesmerizing. The appearances. Not much to talk about. But, the appearances of the characters were perfectly designed. The main characters were really cool. Ken and Barbie, they're really designed in detail. For Barbie, the line where is visible in the neck was really detail. Ken is also really detail especially with his body. Lot-o-Huggin'-Bear was also carefully designed by the paper which often appears on dolls listing the warning or whatever.The way the movie is presented. Very well done. In around 90 minutes of running time (excluding 'Day & Night'), the movie was not boring at all. It had some laughable expressions which are pretty funny. I liked it when Buzz turns into Spanish mode where most of the audience laughed. That moment was hysterical. The scenes were also thrilling like the end scene (which I'm not going to tell you) or the scenes in Sunnyside. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.The new characters. Well, I think there's one negative point. I think little kids around the age of 3, 4 or 5 might be scared with the appearance of Big Baby, because, his appearance is kind of scary for little kids.The 3D effects. Not so cheesy and not so breathtaking but pretty good. The depths of the items in the film were not bad. The sound acting. They were really good. Tom Hanks on Woody was really good. He really projected his voice until he becomes a real Woody. Tim Allen on Buzz Lightyear was also good and satisfying. He really sounded like a real astronaut or space ranger. The others were also good. But, I think Tom Hanks on Woody still has the best projection of voice in the film.Final thing, the short film attached to it: 'Day & Night'. It was shockingly, awfully, crazily cool. That short film was quite funny. It was really good. Overall, the short film compliments to the film to be a very good movie.A short advise, you might want to prepare some tissues to wipe your tears as there are some pretty sad moments in the film. The scenes were just so sad that that's another praise for Lee Unkrich on his directing. So, if you don't prepare those tissues, I hope you have something you can use to wipe your tears.As an amazing end to such a magnificent trilogy, 'Toy Story 3' is a must watch movie. Watching it in 3D is not a bad choice. Your kids will definitely be thrilled watching this film. I truly believe this is the best animated film of the year, or even the best film of all 2010 films. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? Go purchase your tickets and enjoy this masterpiece. I guarantee you that you won't regret watching this movie. Overall, I give this movie a perfect score of 10 stars. I wish a fourth installment would be made.",10,234,370,17 June 2010
Thor: The Dark World," The God of Thunder Returns, with More Lightning
","Marvel's superheroes just keep coming. It's just only been a few months since the release of the immensely successful 'Iron Man 3'. Now it's Thor, the God of Thunder to strike back. Thor is of course the least relatable of the Avengers. But that doesn't stop this movie from succeeding. There are multiple references to what happened in the blockbuster 'The Avengers'. Often referred to as the 'alien invasion in New York', it doesn't really play a major role in the primary plot in 'Thor: The Dark World' itself. So, even if you haven't watched 'The Avengers', don't worry, you won't feel left out.The plot of 'Thor: The Dark World' concerns with something extremely ancient. The Aether is kind of like a fluid that is extremely full of energy and is able to turn ordinary matter into dark matter. This ancient relic begins to play its part in the story after scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) travels to another world accidentally and encounters it. It is later revealed that every 5000 years, the nine realms will be in perfect alignment and therefore, borders between these worlds become blurred. This is an event known as the 'Convergence'. However, due to the recent activity of the Aether, a race called by the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, are awakened. Apparently, they were once ruthless rulers who were defeated by Odin's father Bor. Bor vanquished the Dark Elves and it started a peace that lasted for thousands of years. However, Malekith wants the Aether to plunge the whole universe into total darkness. He intends to that at the peak of the 'Convergence'. Now, it's up to Thor to stop Malekith and his evil schemes. If Thor is to defeat Malekith, he's going to need help from someone unlikely...... Loki.Yes! A team-up between Thor and Loki. This is one of the most exciting components of the film. Thor is serious, powerful whereas Loki is wise-cracking, mischievous, and very tricky. Together, they form a very well-balanced duo and seeing them work together is true joy. There is plenty of action. Of course! It's a superhero action movie. But the superpowers incorporated here are mighty and therefore the sequences are intensified. The Aether is slick and don't forget, Mjolnir is a ravager. The 3D is amazing and I watched this in IMAX 3D. Not all of the scenes were shot in IMAX, but some of the landscapes were incredibly beautiful. More of Asgard is revealed and it really is gorgeous. The movie also had a comedic nature. In fact, it was funnier than I expected. The mischievous and charismatic Loki is plenty of fun to watch. Watching him on screen is pure delight and his character is extremely interesting. But you also have to keep an eye on Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's ally. He's gone a bit crazy in this movie and therefore, his antics are hilarious in the movie. Malekith is an all-powerful villain and he is intimidating. However, I didn't really think he was an interesting villain. His background is rich but that was short. We don't know really know Malekith. He is extremely devoid of character and sometimes, he's so boring. He, along with his race, speak a language that sounds like pre-historic dialect to me. Performances were wonderful. Chris Hemsworth is a well-rounded character and has given Thor adequate depth. Natalie Portman is stunning as the pretty and intelligent Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins shows his class as Odin. Tom Hiddleston is flawless as Loki. His performance is top-notch. Christopher Eccleston's performance was polished enough, although his character was a bit boring. So is it a good movie? Yes. 'Thor: The Dark World' is a good sequel and I would say that this exceeds the original in quality. I enjoyed the film although the villain was kind of dull. It may fall in some aspects but overall, this is a great success. And as a Marvel film, check out the two post-credits scenes. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: 'Thor: The Dark World' is a well-polished sequel that has great action, excellent chemistry (especially between Thor and Loki), but lacks character in the villain.",8,8,16,2 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Film Bursting with Energy and Beautiful Storytelling, Unstoppable Fire
","'Catching Fire' is the highly awaited sequel to the immensely box-office-smasher 'The Hunger Games'. Based on the middle book of Suzanne Collins's best-selling trilogy, it focuses on the complications Katniss faces after her actions in the previous film, and the rising of a rebellion against the cruel Capitol. Katniss won the 74th Hunger Games, alongside Peeta Mellark. This means that she broke the rules as a single Hunger Game can only have one victor. by threatening the Capitol, they both won the game, although this meant breaking the rules. The Capitol felt mocked. What worried the Capitol was that this instilled a spark of hope within the citizens of Panem, and a rebellion itself might be imminent. So, in an attempt to reaffirm their authoritarian power, the 75th Hunger Games is born, and its tributes (participants) are to be chosen from the existing pool of victors. Since District 12 has only had one female victor, Katniss heads back to the arena. Characters from the previous film are back. Our heroine Katniss Everdeen is back! She's even bolder this time around and her hatred against the Capitol is very conspicuous. Peeta Mellark is also back and let's not forget his famous rival Gale Hawthorne. Amazing side characters like Haymitch Abernathy, Cinna, and Effie Trinkett return too. Oh, and don't forget the lovable Primrose Everdeen too. New movie, new characters. There's a new Gamemaker. Seneca Crane, the man with the fabulous beard, is replaced by Plutarch Heavensbee. He's more aggressive and his affiliation is mysterious. And the tributes! Just when you thought the District 1 and 2 tributes are terrifying in the first film, the new tributes are even more dangerous, having all been victors. Gloss, Cashmere, Brutus, Enobaria are the new Careers here. Other tributes include the brilliant Beetee and Wiress from District 3, the heart-melting Finnick Odair from District 4, the aged but humble Mags from District 4, and the violent & brave Johanna Mason from District 7. 'Catching Fire' amps up the stakes considerably compared to the previous film. While in the first film, only the other tributes pose the threats to the characters. But here, not only to the tributes become even tougher, they've also got the Capitol against them. The fate of the Panem is now in uncertain hands. Trust is scarce. What they say and their true feelings must carefully considered. New director, new style. For those who despised the infamous 'shaky cam' from the previous film, well don't worry. There are no shaky takes and you can enjoy the beautiful sets and thrills without a headache. The scenes are now smooth and some of the thrilling sequences are perfectly shot, literally perfectly. Watching it in IMAX glorifies this aspect. The sets are amazing. The Capitol is amazing, futuristic, and just awesome. Beside the beautiful Capitol, there's also other districts too that are shown in the film, most notably District 11. Performances were outstanding. Jennifer Lawrence is without a doubt the star. THE STAR. She has incredible talent and powerful skills. Her performance is incredibly captivating and we are always with Katniss. However, that's not to say that the other members were bad. They were also great, but do not measure to Lawrence's ability. Josh Hutcherson was great as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth was stellar as Gale Hawthorne. Sam Claflin was charismatic as the handsome Finnick Odair and Jena Malone was vicious in portraying Johanna Mason. Donald Sutherland was imposing as the feared President Snow and Stanley Tucci was of course charming as the exuberant host Caesar Flickerman. With excellent storytelling capabilities and an interesting continuation, 'Catching Fire' is one hell of a ride, with exhilarating action sequences and powerful performances, especially Jennifer Lawrence as the lead heroine. This film surpasses the original film in almost all aspects. Its story is more interesting, its themes are more mature, the stakes are higher. Wonderful job! Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: 'Catching Fire' is a perfect continuation of 'The Hunger Games', with fluid pace, excellent storytelling, an interesting premise, and flawless performances, most notably Jennifer Lawrence.",9,2,18,23 November 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The Twilight Saga - Eclipse: It's All Love Triangles
","Keep it in mind when you're watching this, the main thing in this movie is all about the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob. So, that's already eaten much of the movie itself.First things first, 'Eclipse' (in almost every scene) relates to the love triangle. Even the battle parts still have a connection between the love triangle. Everything (except scenes not in her perspective).'Eclipse' is also a kind of slow movie because of too many dramatic scenes which were pretty boring. Even though they had a brutal killing villain, tension wasn't even there as drama overthrew it on the screen.There were some laughable moments too (and they were related to the love triangle). They were just not-so-funny moments but still can entertain you.Another thing you have to remember watching this movie is to remember that 'Eclipse' has tons of kissing scenes (and they are so long e.g. 10 minutes). It was so boring. It's just like watching some person watering the plants while whistling. And, when I saw it, I feel like it's going to be a very boring film which deserves a one-star rating.The acting was bad. There were almost no emotions even for Bella. I say Robert Pattinson's acting on Edward was the worst of all. Bryce Dallas Howard on Victoria was not bad. Xavier Samuel on Riley was the best of all. But, the three main characters' acting were almost emotionless. Of the three leads, Taylor Lautner was the best.The action scenes were not satisfying. It was short and kind of brutal. Speaking of brutal, I say 'Eclipse' has the deadliest, most brutal scenes in 'The Twilight Saga'.By the way, a contributing factor to this movie is that it has many flashbacks or memories of the characters that also skip the fighting parts of it. The flashbacks were too long that it made me sleepy when I watched it.I'm kind of shocked with the vampires in this movie. They look like crystals or something as there were scenes showing hands or heads decapitated and they look like shiny crystals.'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse' is another slow movie which always and always focuses on that love triangle. There were no really exciting moments in the movie and if they had shortened the kissing scenes, this film would have been shorter than two hours. I think this film just deserves a 5-star rating. But, believe it or not, it's currently the best Twilight film.",5,28,56,30 June 2010
Minions," A Festival of Pure Silly Joy and Nothing Else
","'Minions', the spin-off everyone has been waiting for! Over the years, we've grown to be very fond of those yellow pesky yet lovable Minions who speak Gibberish and are very well-known for their carefree and silly antics. This time, they finally get to become the main stars of a 90-minute feature and honestly, they delivered what they were known for, their carefree and silly antics, and nothing else. 'Minions' starts out with an overview of the origin of the Minions (sort of). It explains that they are creatures whose purpose is to serve the baddest villain. But they always have hard time keeping their masters since their efforts to help them always unintentionally leads their masters to a not-so-good fate. The failure to find a master leads them to a depression and one Minion (Kevin?) decides to bring some of his friends along to find a new villain to serve, that is Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock). The movie itself is quite fun. It has plenty of laughs, and even if the majority of the laughs are slapstick comedy, the Gibberish spoken by the Minions are always something to giggle on. They do silly stuff. Their interactions with humans are fascinating and funny. They run into ridiculously impossible situations yet somehow manage a way to find solve it. It's hilarious. The gadgets are visually dazzling and cool to look at, but everything else was a bit lacking. This spin-off lacks the incredibly likable human characters its predecessors had. No Gru. No Agnes. It substitutes them with a couple consisting of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm). They do not resonate with us as Gru and the three girls did with us in the previous two films. The signature Gru accent is absent. The awkwardness of Gru trying to become a good dad is absent. The vibrant and distinct personalities of the three girls are absent. But rather than replacing them with other rich characters, we just get a female super villain who's really just a control freak or a megalomaniac, with a husband who simply just supports her along the way. I can't help but feel that they are just dull as compared to what we were offered previously. (There's also one random villain family but they're also plain.) Ultimately, the lack of dynamic human characters causes this spin- off to not be able to achieve what I really loved about the first two films besides the Minions, that is the ability to have touching moments. In the first film, there was an arc when Gru started to actually open his heart to the girls, and when he started to gradually become kinder and more giving. The scene in space where he finally shrunk the Moon, but realized that he was on the verge of missing the girls' recital. The bonding between the girls and Gru. In the second film, there was this scene where Gru felt depressed after Lucy was relocated somewhere else, where he just sat outside his home alone in the rain. Agnes comes and the two have a chat. In the end, it's a lighthearted comedy and it's enjoyable. Kids will undoubtedly devour it and will glee at the sight of those yellow Minions. But for those who expect something more than just rampage and silly antics, well this movie doesn't offer to you that much. It reinforces the popularity of the Minions but it's quite a shame that this movie could have been done with more thought and heart, but ultimately chose not to pursue it.",6,7,15,25 June 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Afro Circus, Afro Circus
","It's hard to believe that it has been over seven years since the first 'Madagascar' film arrived in theaters back in 2005. Now, the number of installments in the movie franchise has risen to three. In 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' we are reunited with our beloved Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe. Our favorite animals are stuck in Africa and are missing their home in Central Park Zoo in New York. In the process, they head to Europe (marking a shift in the setting compared to its two predecessors which are set in Africa) where most of the adventure takes place. Regardless, this third installment is a marked improvement from its two excellent predecessors, offers a great deal of fun, and promises a hear-pumping ride.'Europe's Most Wanted' is mostly set in Europe, from Monte Carlo all the way to London. This marks a shift in the setting compared to its two predecessors which are set in Africa. Anyways, you're probably wondering 'What happens in this third installment?'. Apparently our four favorite animals are stranded in Africa along with King Julien, Maurice, and Mort. The penguins and monkeys left them and head to Monte Carlo (specifically the luxurious casinos) and promise to never come back. The remaining seven animals then head to Europe to capture the penguins and monkeys in the hotel, only to cause trouble. Because of the chaos that ensues, Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois is hired to capture these escaped animals in a chase that spans all over Europe. DuBois is ruthless and she actually wants the animals dead, especially Alex. Aside from ruthless, she possesses some of the coolest moves you would least expect from an elderly woman, and some of the most preposterous tracking methods, more reminiscent of a dog's.Along the way, the escapees encounter the circus train belonging to the Circus Zaragoza (later renamed Afro Circus) where we meet new friends (which consist of the circus's members). This includes Stefano the sea lion who is a sea lion cannonball, Gia the jaguar who is a skilled trapeze, and the most harrowing of them all, Vitaly the tiger who can jump through a ring of all sizes (even as small as an engagement ring). We also meet Sonya the Bear, whom King Julien develops a romantic yet comedic relationship with. Apparently the circus has been losing its luster ever since Vitaly's bad incident years ago. From then on, the circus crew just didn't have that same energy and excitement they had before. Alex later on along with his friends attempt to rebuild the circus by developing some of the sickest and breathtaking stunts ever for a circus show.The breathtaking circus stunts bring one of the most entertaining scenes in the entire movie. The scene I'm talking about is when the circus crew, now added with Alex and friends, performed in London. I like how they combine the different acts together along with the neon lights, fantastic sets, and not to forget, Katy Perry's 'Firework' song playing in the background, to create something so spectacular and bright and colorful. Add the stunning 3D effect and this scene is just flawless.'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is humorous and is better than the previous two installments even in terms of humor. Marty the Zebra' jokes assure that this film will be humorous while the romantic relationship between Sonya the Bear and King Julien is silly that it makes you laugh. But what made me laugh the most was DuBois's preposterous methods of tracking the animals. She can crawl on all fours and inhale the air to see what the scene was like hours ago. It is so preposterous that it's funny and humorous. She also possesses some of the coolest moves you'll ever see, most of them present in the chase scene in Monte Carlo where DuBois jumps over obstacles with her bike and does crazy stunts. The actors gave applauding voice performances. Ben Stiller was great as usual providing the voice of Alex the Lion. Chris Rock delivered a great sound for Marty the Zebra. Jada Pinkett Smith gave a strong voice for Gloria the Hippo whereas David Schwimmer provided a great sound for Melman the Giraffe. Frances McDormand gave one of the best performances as she voices DuBois with ruthlessly and hauntingly whereas Bryan Cranston delivered a menacing voice for Vitaly the Tiger. I also loved Martin Short's performance as the sea lion Stefano where he makes Stefano an extremely likable figure and I wished that his screen time had been extended and made longer. The 3D is also one thing to note about for this film. It's excellent and enhances the movie experience. One of the scenes that benefit from 3D is the circus show set in London where there is an eclectic mix of fantastic sets, breathtaking stunts, and the beautiful upbeat song ('Firework' by Katy Perry) in the background. It makes you feel the movie more and makes the ride more thrilling. Whether you're a fan of the previous two installments or not, go watch this one. 'Europe's Most Wanted' is an improvement from the previous two films, even when its predecessors are already excellent. Its shift in the setting makes the movie more interesting and the presence of a human villain makes it more exciting. The 3D enhances the movie experience and allows you to feel more and capture the heart of the film. Overall, 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is a great film and highly recommended especially after it's been a long time after the last family-oriented animated movie came out in theaters so go watch this film with your families. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is an improvement from its two excellent predecessors that entertains you immensely and delivers a great deal of fun - and it has to be watched in 3D.",8,30,50,8 June 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Dark of the Moon' is the Real 'Transformers' Film!
","The first 'Transformers' was an enjoyable experience back in 2007. Even though it wasn't great, it was still a great experience watching the film. But the second one back in 2009 had a considerable drop in terms of quality from the first film. Even Michael Bay accepted the fact that 'Revenge of the Fallen' was a sequel with a precipitous drop in terms of quality from the first film. Then 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was announced with Bay promising that it would be a good film. And yet, it is. 'Dark of the Moon' is a significant improvement from 'Revenge of the Fallen' and is absolutely the best installment of the franchise.As its predecessors, 'Dark of the Moon' has a mediocre plot. As mediocre it is, this is how it goes. Back when Apollo 11 landed, Neil Armstrong and crew were given a top secret mission to investigate a Cybertronian spacecraft that had crash landed on the Moon years ago. They discover several robots and kept the operation secret for a long time. Later, the Autobots and Decepticons learn of its existence and race to get it which can lead into two results; if the Autobots get it, the world is saved, if the Decepticons obtain it, humans will be enslaved and Earth will be used as the base to rebuilding Cybertron which would result in the destruction of most of Earth.'Dark of the Moon' will take us deeper into the origins of Cybertron. This third installment will include much more robots, and most of them are much cooler than what's already in the previous two films. One takes the form of a Ferrari, one's some sort of professor, one's a gigantic snake-like form driller that's around ten times the size of Optimus Prime, one's super ancient, and there's much more. These robots take the action to new levels and will get our hearts racing so fast like never before. The acting, however was normal. Shia LaBeouf was great in portraying the role of Sam Witwicky. The others were also okay. But newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley seems to have a lack of experience in acting. But anyways, the result here is what you get for casting a new actress who's new to the world of acting, and for one who's new to acting, it's not that bad. The script was kind of awkward though. There were some scenes that were confusing and made me lose track of where the film is heading. Sometimes, these convoluted scenes force the characters to say strange things and I found it really annoying. 'Dark of the Moon' loses points in the shifting of scenes. Sometimes, they make the film look awkward and not really enjoyable as it could be. Here's an example (no spoilers): Optimus Prime talks about something very serious that relates to the fate of the whole world INTO Sam finding a job with humor. Definitely ironic. But besides all those, 'Dark of the Moon' is definitely a fun ride to experience. The climax of the film takes up almost an hour and is definitely satisfying. The huge and dangerous robots compliment to the thrill levels of the fight scenes. The fight scenes are super awesome!The 3D in this film was acceptable, although it wasn't exceptional. Depth was sometimes conspicuous, though. But at other times, the robots and the explosions were out of the screen. But definitely, the scene which had the most amazing 3D effects were when the title showed up during the beginning of the film. That was amazing! The special effects in one word: amazing! There's no need to complain about that. The robots, the explosions, the fires, were simply amazing. But what was shocking, and funny, was how they used CGI to create the face of John F. Kennedy during one short scene. The face was clearly different from the others' faces. But good try though. Through halfway of the film, expect some reminders of disaster films such as '2012' as well as 'Terminator Salvation'. But what amuses me in these scenes are: where are all the people. I mean, it was only a few minutes after the destruction of the world began, and the terrified people only started running away. But then, minutes later, millions of people started to vanish and barely any person was there. But anyways, that doesn't matter. 'Dark of the Moon' is satisfying. To wrap things up, 'Dark of the Moon' is simply a great film and definitely worth watching. I know 'Revenge of the Fallen' was a bummer but 'Dark of the Moon' will replace that horror. 3D is not a bad choice to watch this film. I truly recommend watching this film. But remember, don't get the expectations too high. If you do so, you'll be really disappointed with this film. Michael Bay's promise is fulfilled. 'Dark of the Moon' delivers. It is absolutely the real 'Transformers' film we've been waiting since 2007. Prince AJB's Rating: 8/10 (Great)Thank you for reading my review on 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. I do hope that this review is useful for you to read.",8,11,22,29 June 2011
