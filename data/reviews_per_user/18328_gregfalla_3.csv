The Hangover," Was Bowled Over by the Hangover!
","With writers churning out script after mundane script; and story lines weaker than the state of some actors after a hard night on the town:- this film is exactly what those who have a hangover need; a breath of fresh air. This is the funniest film of the decade. Compare it to the likes of Yes Man which has Jim Carrey to carry the story but this script calls upon actors of lesser known fame- and it does the script and film more justice than having a well known cast member (I am not criticising Yes Man either by the way!). The laughs are sustained throughout and you are able to explore 'The Night Before The Morning After'. We have all been there, but it has never been this amusing. Even calling upon physical attributes of the actors for jokes; i.e. weight or facial hair allow this script to have more depth than modern day thrillers. A true classic is born in the shape of the Hangover.",10,8,14,12 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," My rating was for the effects
","Explosions, big budget, robots and Christian Bale; normally very enticing features. But this movie was diabolical. It dragged on and the story could have been completed within half an hour. Trim the fat and make a better movie. The effects however were mindblowing, unlike the script. McG did a great job directing but with so many plot holes and confusions within the script it beggars belief why the hell Christian Bale signed up to this crap. With rumours of a fifth one to take place in modern day Britain of all places, this needs to be terminated; now. The time line set up in the previous films are almost discarded within this one and the fifth film in the series. I know die-hard terminator fans will slate my review but the truth needs to be heard. Can script writers actually come up with a decent script? With depth, surprising twists (that make sense even due to their surprise), interesting story lines and no plot holes? You can relate script writers to a famous saying; something about monkeys, typewriters and Shakespeare; except the monkey could come up with a better script than the one here.",4,3,6,15 July 2009
Avatar," Effect-ively Bad
","Ladies and gentlemen, may I start this submission by stating that visually, James Cameron has made the best film of the generation. However, a film cannot hold it's water on effects alone. Conceptually, this film could be nominated in every category for any award - yet the final product was sickly sour. The story's premise had potential and started off in a brilliant, influential fashion. However, half an hour into the film; me and my fellow film enthusiasts found ourselves in dismay. We had painted our faces blue for the occasion and were hoping for something special. Yet three hours of something in which the storyline goes out of the hypothetical window for two hours of it is hard to endure. Yet we did, well, most of us. Two people walked out. One within 15 minutes and the other within 2 hours. Visually, I will repeat, it is stunning and words cannot describe how beautiful Cameron has made this world/film/entity. Yet, the film focuses too much on the effects, the dialogue (what there is of it anyway) is cheesy and B-movie esquire. With one of the lines echoing Wizard of Oz supposedly for comedic effect just doesn't work. Jim, you cannot go out and create a new Star Trek! Creating a new world with a new language and new creatures has been done. It was successful and now you want a slice of the action?! NO. Stick to originality. Another gripe me and my buddies had was the blatant sound effects rip-offs. Especially the iconic and unmistakable sounds of Jurassic Park. In particular - and most noticeably - the T-Rex and Raptor sounds used on the creatures of Pandora. If only Mr Cameron stood back from his project let the effects slide a little bit and work harder on a solid script with a decent dialogue with memorable quotes. If this film does become a new Star Trek with people declaring themselves Na'vi Enthusiasts - or Tarries (possibly the new colloquial term for these Avatar fans, like Trekkies). If you liked this film - good for you and I'm happy for you. Yet you may have had wool pulled over your eyes - known as hype. Please re-watch the film to see if it truly deserves the awards it is achieving. This is not a stab at Cameron or indeed a jealousy post, merely I am submitting my views. Thank you.",5,6,16,23 December 2009
