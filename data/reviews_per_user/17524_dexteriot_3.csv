The Finest Hours," One of the best movies of the year!
","I find it puzzling when people rate this movie less than 7/10. My question is - Have you seen it? Or you were you half asleep? First of all the acting is superb, so it directing, music and everything else in this movie. Rescue missions are one my of favourite genres and this movie could not have been made any better. Rotten Tomatoes says 'The Finest Hours will satisfy those seeking a traditional rescue drama – but may leave more adventurous viewers wanting more'. OK, then Avatar will satisfy those fond of sci-fi movies but will not be any good for comedy lovers. It is an excellent and well made rescue drama and that's how it should be viewed because it is based on true events, it would've been wrong to make up and some adventurous character to it just for the sake of satisfying more viewers.",10,2,4,6 August 2016
Kong: Skull Island," A Cheap Screenplay with Weak Dialogues vs Excellent Visuals
","They probably hired a 7th grader to write the dialogues. How emotionally powerful should be something you say to another person so they change their mind in 5 seconds? You'd think it must be something extraordinary, turns out you can just say You know, it's a wrong thing to do, and voilà a guy who was just pointing a gun at you is now pointing it at his immediate commander. I wish they spent at least half an hour to write some of the dialogues not just something that comes to your mind first. The plot isn't far from the dialogues, at times it's childish. If it wasn't for superb visual effects for which I am a sucker and Tom Hiddleston it might as well could've been one of the worst movies I've seen. So my advice lower your expectations.",7,3,6,10 March 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's not as good as Man of Steel but it is still amazing
","To be honest the beginning was kinda choppy. I almost walked out, and I noticed some people glancing at their watches. Then it started to pick up and with action came excitement. Really, really enjoyed the movie.I was a bit disappointed with Jesse Eisenberg performance, not because he was bad at it, it just didn't feel natural. I think his personality doesn't really fit the character.Can't wait for the next one, will be definitely buying this one on DVD.So don't listen to critics and bad reviews, just watch it if you're a fan of superhero movies.",9,4,8,26 March 2016
