Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Overrated homage film, that does not pay tribute to great film makers
","Kill Bill vol II unlike the prior installment cannot rely on kung fu and great cinematography , it was time to see tarantino put his verbal kung fu on the big screen once again. This was not the case the dialogue however well delivered or not by the actors was uncool and definently not even close to the work he did with Avary(Props). There were some highly pleasing moments mostly the training scenes but i think  all the avenues that could have been taken for a homage movie like this were overlooked and the story was not entertaining enough to come off. The pacing of the movie was stop start stop start and did not flow well.When the hype dies down even Tarantino lovers(which i am one of)  will have to agree it was not great.",3,3,6,22 April 2004
