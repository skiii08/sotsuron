United 93," Jerky camera made viewing impossible
","Eagerly I looked forward to watching the movie, but couldn't sit through more than a few minutes when it was first released. The jerky camera shots and constant rolling made me woozy. Later, when it was shown on HBO, I tried again. And still couldn't watch.This is sooooo frustrating. This gimmick is being used in a lot of movies today and it's not necessary. Please, producers and directors, movies can be just as dramatic without all the spastic camera work. I can't be the only one who has this problem. Why deliberately omit a certain percentage of the population just for an effect? Keep that camera still!",Null,0,4,22 March 2008
