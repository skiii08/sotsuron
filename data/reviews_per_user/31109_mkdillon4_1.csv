Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Brilliant production
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is more than just another comedy film. It is a film that the directors spent much time on combining real life people with animation. There is a murder of a R.K. Maroon (played by Alan Tilvern) in the animation world and Roger Rabbit (voice done by Charles Fleischer) only hope is the toon hating detective Eddie Valiant which is played by Bob Hoskins. Valiant must overcome his hatred for toons to protect Roger from Judge Doom (played by Christopher Lloyd) until he can solve the case of who committed the murder of Maroon. The theme of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one where the viewer is trying to solve the mystery too. The director keeps building on the scenes to reveal more and more information on who committed the murder. The theme also helps to identify why the person would want to murder Maroon. The director also uses the theme to keep the attention of the audience by making them part of the movie in solving the film. The director also uses the movie to show how something different can be used as blame for something. In this movie, the director uses the toons as blame because they are different than the humans in the way that they act and behave. The film is a great way to show how someone can be viewed and treated based on how they are different from others. In the film you will see that they are using camera angles to help tell parts of the story. For example, there is a scene where the director uses a downward shot to help show how going into the goo can be dangerous and hurt the toons. The music plays a vital role in this too as it gets more dramatic to make the viewer worry.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a great movie that used many different forms of art to combine human interaction with animation. However, there is meaning behind the story rather than making people laugh. The story will make a person think about why you would accuse someone for something without truly knowing if it was them that did the action.",7,0,1,2 February 2014
