Resident Evil: Afterlife," Going down deeper with each episode...
","I am not a fan of the series. The first movie was OK, with the second one had good action scenes.This one is the worst. Why? No acting, especially Ali Larter. She seems like she is photo-shopped to the scenes. Milla is similarly bad.All the actions scenes are predictable, and booooooooringly slow motion packed. A fall-down scene is stolen from Matrix, I guess a reuse of a computer code :).The main antagonist is as cool as he is dumb, i cant understand how that sunglasses coolness made to 2010s. Come on guys, is this what you can do? Jovovich is falling down fast, as the scene stolen from Matrix.",5,0,2,3 January 2011
