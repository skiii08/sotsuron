The Ring," Thank God someone still knows how to make good scary movies
","Gore Verbinski... Before The Ring I had seen only one movie from this director. I must admit that I really enjoyed Mouse Hunt and its pure old-fashioned slapstick style. But still, Mouse Hunt wasn´t the kind of a movie that would make its director a top director in the world of cinema.I´ve never bothered to watch the Mexican because it simply doesn´t interest me. I don´t remember when I first heard about the Ring, but when I read all the positive reviews I knew this was a film I didn´t want to miss. And when the movie opened in Finland some weeks ago I went to see it with my friends. And I was so glad that I catched the movie during its cinema run.The Ring is a movie that shouldn´t be watched in daylight. The best place to see it is a theatre with lots of people. If you watch it home, wait until its dark and then play the movie. And if you have a home theatre system the experience will be even better. This is a creepy movie that will scare you at least a couple of times.I´ve never been a fan of 'horror' films like Friday the 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street. I enjoy creepy ghost stories like What Lies Beneath, the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist etc. Horror is a very difficult genre because you can easily cross the line between being scary and being funny. Take Thir13een Ghost, for example. I couldn´t even watch the whole movie because of its stupidity. That film didn´t give me any creeps at all. But luckily every now and then a good creepy movie comes out of Hollywood and the Ring is such a movie. I was very impressed by the movie´s autumnal style, dark atmosphere and performances. You rarely see memorable performances in this kind of movies.It´ll be interesting to see what Gore Verbinski´s next movie will be like. Hopefully it´ll be something as memorable as the Ring.",8,1,1,17 April 2003
Unbreakable," It´s not the Sixth Sense, but it does come close
","M. Night Shyamalan´s The Sixth Sense was a quite impressive piece of psychological suspense. I saw it in a theater and the end really caught me, and everybody else, offguard. Next Shyamalan did Unbreakable and then my favorite of these three movies, Signs. Unbreakable is an above-average thriller/drama, but still I find it somewhat weaker than the Sixth Sense or Signs. And in this case 'weaker' isn´t a huge drawback as Unbreakable would still beat 90% of all the so-called psychological thrillers coming out of Hollywood every other second. Only few films manage to create heavy atmospheres and suspenseful moments and even fewer films have talented actors. Bruce Willis might not the greatest actor in Hollywood, but he knows how to do his job well. Samuel L. Jackson is also a very reliable actor and I´m sure that the fact that these two men were both in the third Die Hard movie helped to create the chemistry necessary for movies like this.       Unbreakable is a solid dark thriller, but not as good as Signs or The Sixth Sense. I watched this movie dubbed in German (don´t ask me why...) so I might have missed some more or less important points... Oh well.",7,1,1,9 January 2004
As Good as It Gets," An excellent comedy drama
","As Good As It Gets is one of the best comedy dramas I´ve seen. It stars the wonderful Jack Nicholson and also wonderful Helen Hunt. I think this is a great film with powerful performances (all the awards given to Nicholson and Hunt are very well deserved). It´s a perfect film for a Friday evening. It´s smart, funny, sad... You´ll enjoy it!!! I give it 10 out of 10.",9,0,0,28 December 1999
The Mummy," Highly entertaining
","The Mummy is a very entertaining adventure film. I enjoyed it very much. It reminded me of old Indiana Jones movies... Special effects are great, cast is nice, itÂ´s funny, thrilling, entertaining... Go to see it.I give it 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,27 August 1999
X-Men," Pretty good
","I m not a fan of X-Men but I did enjoy this film. It was pretty good and VERY entertaining. This kind of movie (big budget, lots of special effects, lots of hype...) could easily become a total turkey like Battlefield Earth.
If you like X-Men you´ll love the movie. For a 'normal' movie fan it´s just a stunning effects-filled movie. I give this 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,17 November 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton did it again!
","Sleepy Hollow is surely one of the best films I´ve seen this year. I´d been waiting for it for months and when I finally saw it last month I was really impressed! This is a gorgeous fairy tale! Landscapes in this movie are simply fantastic! The cast does great job! The effects are great! There´s humour, action, horror... This is a fantastic film!Tim Burton, you did it again!I give this 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,25 May 2000
Scary Movie 2," One of the worst movies I have ever seen
","I don´t know why I rented this movie, I really don´t. I plead momentary insanity. I saw the first Scary Movie in a theatre and I thought it was quite bad. Some of the scenes and jokes were amusing, but overall the whole 'movie' was just lame. It could be funny if you watch it in a 'proper' state of mind. Anyway, now I decided to watch Scary Movie 2 and I really regret it. I just wasted two and a half euros and 79 minutes on one of the worst 'comedies' I have ever seen.The trailer of the movie looks promising enough, but the film itself is unbelievably horrible. It´s obvious that the movie was done very quickly because the studio wanted to capitalize on the first movie´s success. Unfortunately there´s nothing good to say about the result. Few chuckles here and there aren´t enough and this movie´s gets so low every other second that it´s just disgusting. The makers also seem to think that bad and dirty language guarantees laughs. It just isn´t so. The scariest thing about this whole disaster is that people actually put money into this! I don´t even feel sorry for the cast members, their careers deserve to die if they seriously thought that this movie was worth doing. And James Woods...What the hell has happened to good comedies? All these rude teen comedies seem to rule the business and all the good ones are overlooked. I just can´t believe it that there are people out there who liked this movie. Most likely those folks have never seen any real comedies like Airplane! or the Naked Gun which I will watch very shortly in order to forget Scary Movie 2.My advice is... AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2 AT ALL COSTS! It´s horrible, terrible, disgusting, unfunny, boring, shocking and easily one of the worst so-called comedies of all-time. I just hope the third part will be able to top the second part as it has one of the Zucker brothers at the helm and Pat Proft as one of the writers. Beating Part 2 won´t be hard, though. You simply cannot get any lower than this.>",2,1,2,17 April 2003
Armageddon," A really really really stupid movie
","Simply said, Armageddon sucks!!!!!! It´s awful!!!!!! I could have fallen asleep in the theatre if it wasn´t that loud. Mindless action (yes, those effects are awesome), irritating characters (especially Bruce Willis)... Deep Impact was MUCH better...I give it 1 out of 10.",1,7,13,31 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Critics are right... This is a fantastic piece of work!
","Encouraged by all those good reviews it´s gotten I finally decided to rent Moulin Rouge last weekend. To be honest I wasn´t expecting much. I thought it would be one of those movies that critics love and 'normal' people find just okay. Boy was I wrong! Rarely have I seen such a visually impressive and dynamic film and after the first few minutes I was hooked! I was impressed mostly by the images, but also by the performances and music. The story might be nothing new, but all the other ingredients of the film lift it above many other love stories. This is definitely one of the best performances Nicole Kidman has ever given.      Now I´m seriously thinking about buying the soundtrack and the DVD which seems to be loaded with special features. I already have the single Come What May which is a stunning ballad performed by Nicole and Ewan McGregor. Those two really know how to sing. I´m not 100% sure whether Moulin Rouge deserves 8 or 9 out of 10, but in any case it´s one hell of a movie! Now I´m looking forward to seeing Nicole´s supernatural thriller The Others.",9,0,1,11 August 2002
Men in Black II," Waste of money and time
","Men In Black was a well-made and hilarious comedy that truly deserved its blockbuster status. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith had great chemistry on screen and the duo provided numerous laughs. Due to the movie´s huge success a sequel was guaranteed and last year MIIB came out. I didn´t see it in a theatre since I believed the reviews I read were correct. I decided to wait until the movie comes out on DVD and I´m glad I did because MIIB is quite disappointing, considering all the talent involved.The best thing about MIIB is naturally the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are one of those great buddy pairs of cinema. Both Jones and Smith are talented actors with great comic timing. The reason why MIIB fails is its script. It does have its share of laughs, but you can´t help but feel a bit cheated after watching this movie. The only reason why this movie was made was money, the studio simply wanted to cash in. Since this is movie business it´s okay, but for God´s sake, they should written a lot better screenplay! MIIB has a very short running time which reveals the fact that the writers didn´t have that many good ideas to work with.MIIB is a typical disposable item from Hollywood and a good example of sequels meant purely to cash in. Entertaining? Mildly. Memorable? Far from that. Worth renting? Judge for yourself.",6,0,0,17 April 2003
Big Fish," Most directors will tell you stories straight through. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
","Think about all the directors in Hollywood. How many truly unique talents are there? Not many, I'd say. And how many directors actually have a recognizable style? Even fewer. Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, the ZAZ team... Those are the names that come to my mind. But there's one person who rises above all the others, and that man is Tim Burton.I have been a fan of Tim Burton's work for a long time. I've seen all of his full-length movies expect 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' and the only one that doesn't really feel like a Burton flick is the watchable-yet-disappointing 'The Planet Of The Apes'. It was okay for a summer blockbuster, but it lacked that special Burton magic. All the other movies of his are as Burtonesque as they could possibly be. I even like 'Mars Attacks!' a lot which is a movie Burton fans either seem to love or hate. It's hard to name my favorite of Burton's productions, they are all quite different in spite of having the magical Burton touch. In Tim's movies fantasy meets reality and the results are like fairy tales with dark undertones. 'Ed Wood' is Tim's most realistic film to date, but it also manages to be more than just a typical biography movie. It might have been shot black-and-white, but it's definitely one of, if not the most, colorful story about a life of a person who actually existed. When I first read about 'Big Fish' I was a little skeptical because I thought it would be a typical family drama. But thank God it was Tim Burton who was directing it. All my doubts disappeared when I saw the trailer for the film. Having seen the film itself I'd say that the trailer is actually one of the best I've ever seen. It's really refreshing to see a movie which is sad, funny, touching and heart-warming at the same time. I don't think the film ever turns into a tear-jerker as the 'realistic' parts of the film are very life-like. And in the hands of a bland director the 'fantasy' parts could've become a real mess. But with Burton at the helm, we are treated to his greatest hits. We get weird and captivating characters (witches, Siamese twins, also a werewolf...), stunning images and colors, Danny Elfman's gorgeous score, the exactly right amount of humor and those wild stories. The stories Ed Bloom tells might not be 100% true, but they sure are entertaining!And the cast... Tim Burton once again got a great team to work with. The main players are Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor who are both outstanding and worth at least a few awards. Smaller roles are played by Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham-Carter. Their roles might be small, but they all contribute something special to the story. Many people have complained about Jessica Lange being wasted in such a small role. I don't think she was wasted at all. The most beautiful scene of the film has Sandra Bloom getting into a bathtub fully-clothed with her dying husband and only a few words are spoken during this scene. More dialog is not needed as the two highly talented actors show what they are capable of. 'Big Fish' is a movie that will definitely become a Burton classic. It would have deserved bigger box office grosses, but as one reviewer put it, the movie will more likely become more popular on small screen and gain more and more popularity over the years. It's a bit sad that people spend so much money on totally forgettable 'entertainment' and let true jewels like 'Big Fish' pass by. On the other hand, those brainless productions will be forgotten in a blink of an eye while the gems will live on. Just like Edward Bloom's stories in the movie. Full points. It's a classic.",10,0,0,22 June 2004
From Hell," Wonderful gothic horror movie
","When From Hell premiered in the States I knew I had to see it. I read about its story and it seemed like a really good horror movie. Too bad it wasn´t much of a hit. Nonetheless, when it premiered here in Finland I went see it and I wasn´t disappointed at all. On the contrary. European critics also seemed to like the movie more than their American colleagues. Our local newspaper, for example, gave the movie a pretty good review.      From Hell is actually quite similar to Tim Burton´s gothic masterpiece Sleepy Hollow which also starred Johnny Depp. Both movies are dark and old-fashioned horror movies. Like Sleepy Hollow, From Hell has a solid cast lead by Depp, Robbie Coltrane and Heather Graham. This time heads won´t roll, but scares are guaranteed. From Hell gets 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,11 August 2002
Scream," Quite good actually
","I´ve never been a huge fan of horror movies but I must admit that it´s fun watching these kind of slasher films (including the bad ones!). Anyway, Scream was probably the first teen slasher film I saw and it was very thrilling. The opening scene is a classic! It´s a great movie: funny, entertaining, thrilling... One of the best horror movies I´ve ever seen!I give this 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,31 July 2000
Shrek," Another great movie for both kids and adults
","Shrek is one of those kids´ movies that adults are sure to enjoy as well. Many of my friends (I´m 19) saw Shrek before me and they all said it´s very good. Now I finally decided to rent the film and watch it myself. I´m glad I did. The movie´s hilarious! Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy, is the best character and he´s sure to make you laugh. Another great character is Lord Farquaad, played by one of my favorite actors, John Lithgow. He is such a fantastic performer, just watch The 3rd Rock From The Sun and you´ll know what I mean.       It´s no wonder that Shrek became a massive box office hit all over the world. Disney´s not the only studio that can produce good-quality family entertainment. Ice Age is another proof of that (I´ve only seen the trailer, but what a trailer that is!). Shrek actually pokes fun at many familiar Disney figures, but it´s not like Jeffrey Katzenberg is mocking them. I guess he just wanted to show his old pals at Disney that there´s a new player in the game and that´s DreakWorks & Co. Shrek, one of the best family movies out there, gets 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,11 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," X2: Bigger And Better
","I´m not a huge fan of movies based on comics. I´m not into comics either. I didn´t care that much for Spider-Man which was way too overrated. X-Men, on the other hand, was a movie that I liked a lot, though I had no idea what the comic was all about. The only thing I knew was that there were these mutants and... well, that was it. The first X-Men movie was given quite good reviews and that might have been the reason why I went to see it. The movie also had a very promising cast. In wrong hands X-Men could´ve been a real turkey. Luckily the filmmakers succeeded in creating a wonderful adventure with fantastic effects and interesting characters. Since the movie did well at the box office a sequel was guaranteed. Part One being such a good movie it wasn´t bad news at all. When watching X2 I got the feeling that this movie wasn´t a 'compulsory' sequel. Men In Black II, for example, was obviously a sequel that just had to be done. That was so obvious and the MIIB was a major disappointment. It´s still possible to create a sequel that´s on the same level with its predecessor. Take the Mummy, for example. In my opinion both parts were equally good. It´s the same thing with X-Men: Part One was great, Part Two is at least as good.       One of the strong points of X2 is its talented cast. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming... They all do great work in this film. My favorite X-Person is Famke Janssen who looks stunning with red hair. She and Halle Berry prove that even Bond girls can have real movie careers if you work hard. The special effects are also first-class stuff and there´s a good amount of humor too. X2 was a bit long and had it been a not-so-good movie it would´ve been a negative thing. But since the movie keeps the momentum going all through its running time I´m willing to overlook this minor thing. Now we just have to wait for X3...",8,0,0,9 January 2004
