The Blair Witch Project," Good Movie!
","My husband and I went to this movie and absolutely loved it.  We both like scary movies and were excited to see this one.  He didn't know a thing about the Blair Witch, he actually thought it was a real documentary.  I, on the other hand, had read reviews about it and knew that it wasn't real.  We were both freaked out by it.  We are avid campers and I am glad that summer is about over and we won't be camping for awhile!!  The noises and other things that happen in this movie are intense and creepy.  I agree with many comments here that say that this movie uses your imagination and encourages you to draw your own conclusions about what is out there.Overall I gave it an 8 out of 10.  Pretty scary and creepy.  The ending was a trip!!",10,1,2,13 August 1999
