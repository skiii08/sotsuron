Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Needs A Rewrite To Correct It's Shortcomings
","Kill Bill Volume 2 is the continuation of The Bride's story in getting her revenge against Bill. I consider Kill Bill as one of Tarantino's weaker films, and Volume 2 is definitely a big reason why it's a letdown.The film is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is much more dialogue and story heavy than the first volume. I enjoyed the first volume a lot more because it is much more fun and stylish, this second volume holds back much more of that in service to the story which wasn't all that great to begin with. Normally heading towards the end, a film with this story should be much more intense than the first half but that's not the case. The bulk of the build up of the climax is dull due to the underwhelming dialogue, though the pregnancy test sequence was hilarious. The climax itself would have been a great opportunity for Tarantino to write something spectacular and thrilling, yet it felt like Tarantino couldn't find some sort of vision of it and just wrote something that can be done swiftly. I know Tarantino can write because he has proved it with great dialogue-driven films like Pulp Fiction and Death Proof or mainstream action driven films like Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Kill Bill combines both aspects together and proved to be ineffective. The film's story isn't all bad with an interesting burial segment and a throwback to the old Kung-Fu Chinese films that had me smiling throughout.Tarantino directs this film with a much more slower pace, in order to flesh out the story and gain more insight to it's characters. This film at times feels too safe for me, with moments that have characters just talking, which I don't mind if the dialogue was written better, leaving me feeling underwhelmed. Kill Bill as a whole's best moments are the segments that are over the top, violent and experimental. These experimental moments include the Pai Mei chapter, feeling like it was from a 1980's cheesy Kung Fu film. If Tarantino treated this half of the film like the first half then Kill Bill as a whole would have been an instant favorite of mine.Robert Richardson comes back as the director of photography for this film and this time the scenes don't look as hyper stylised and overly saturated as the first volume. I do admire the fact that this film doesn't look the same the entire run of the film, with moments in black and white, changing the aspect ratio of the film, and using split screen to show two things at once. The Pai Mei sequence was shot in such a way that is similar to the old Asian Kung Fu films, with grainy photography and lacking in vibrancy in it's color. Though there are great moments in this volume's photography, I much prefer the style that was applied for the first volume.RZA didn't come back to do the score for this film, which is odd as I liked what he did for the first volume. Instead Robert Rodriguez is credited for the music of the film, I am sure that he did the final song but I am not aware of any other moments in where he might have contributed. The film's music still follows that inspiration of Ennio Morricone, with some tracks actually written from him, and gives the film this Western feel to it. There are also moments where it uses Asian inspired music which works well with the tone of the film. The sound effects of this film is hilarious as they use the cheesy effects that are found on the films that this was inspired by. I wish that this film does retain that upbeat and fun soundtrack that fueled the first volume, but I guess that would be inappropriate judging by the events that unfolds during this film.Uma Thurman as The Bride is still great but this time it seems the film demands more from her and she does a great job. She may seem less bad-ass here because vulnerabilities arise and there are times where she is outmatched by her opponent which we didn't see a lot from the first volume. I felt that Bill was a little dull because of the way Tarantino has written him, but David Carradine does the most he can with the character. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle and Budd were fun to watch as they play characters that are classic Tarantino; fun, hilarious, and unpredictable. I wish Madsen were in much more entertaining films because he is a wonderful actor to watch. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was definitely hilarious and written with such absurdity that anything that comes out his mouth is pure comedic gold or bad-ass.Kill Bill Volume 2 is a bit of a disappointment in comparison to the first volume and the other films in the director's catalogue. If the film was fun like the first one, or at least written better then I would have liked this film a lot.",5,2,4,9 January 2014
Skyfall," Exceptional Execution And A Step In A New Direction
","Let me just get this out of the way and say that I am not the most immersed fan of the Bond films, and I only properly watched Craig's interpretation of Bond. Though I am aware about the principles of the Bond films like girls, gadgets, etc. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace felt like they were trying to steer away from the principles that fueled the pre-Craig bond films. Skyfall in the other hand embraces it and spraying something new in there making it feeling fresh and unique.The film was written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan. Since both Purvis and Wade have experience and knowledge of the history of Bond, they may be responsible for the genius reference moments in the film, like Q and the Aston Martin DB5. Logan on the other hand was a surprise for me as he has never written a Bond film before and isn't a frequent collaborator with Mendes. Nevertheless Logan has done well here. He has brought that imagination of thrilling and intense action sequences here that haves us hooked all the way through. The film is able to explore the argument of the traditional and contemporary approach, even more so at the end of the film, which I thought was a nice touch. The emotional drive in the film is carried not by Bond but rather by M, as the film showcases the regrets and sacrifice that M has made and the torment and suffering that others and herself it has caused. The film also surprised me by touching on Bond's past, showing us his roots and home.When I heard Sam Mendes was directing this film, I knew that this was going to be handled much better and the film will feel significant and requires to be viewed over and over again. I was a bit worried on how he would handle the action element of the film as I don't really see him as the most onerous when it comes to those particular moments but he really outdid himself here with action sequences that shine and is memorable. It is the intimate moments where I appreciate Mendes' craft because he has proved it with his previous films like Away We Go and American Beauty. Mendes really understood Skyfall's characters, displaying their vulnerabilities and strengths allowing us to engross on the story and the relationships that is being explored. Mendes has accomplished in creating the most stylish Bond film yet, at least for now. The film is definitely a first step into a new phase of Bond that will define the subsequent Bond films.Roger Deakins has worked with the best directors of this century and he frequently collaborates with them. Deakins has worked on every film by Mendes after Road To Perdition, except of course Away We Go. Deakins is definitely one of the crucial fraction in making this film feel and look beautiful. The highlights are the scenes that takes place in Macau and Shanghai, this is where the image makes an impression with popping colors and employing a modern style of photography. The action sequences are handled very well as Deakins and Mendes allows the stunt men or actors to show off their skills within that one shot allowing for a much more smoother experience. As the start of the film, the image feels more natural and then heads towards a more colorful approach in the scenes in Asia. The end takes a monotone palette stripping the image down with the beauty that accommodates the first three quarters of the film, correlating with the themes that Mendes was trying to project (particularly the traditional vs contemporary aspect).Thomas Newman who have worked with all of Mendes' films, aside from Away We Go. Newman a lot of the times doesn't make scores that people will end up taking notice while watching the film, though there are a few exceptions like American Beauty and WALL-E, but he does have the ability to suck us in and allow us to feel the emotions that Mendes wants us to feel in selected occasions. Newman's score for Skyfall projects that and avoids the feeling of being campy even if it doesn't deviate too far from the modern day action scores. His score just works seamlessly with the traditional Bond theme that is scattered throughout which adds on to the immersion.Craig comes back for his third attempt of playing James Bond and he has done a wonderful job, as expected. There may be a bit of a step back for Craig here as the emotional driven scenes are not handled by him but rather by Judi Dench as M. Dench was able to embody a character who has a lot of regrets in her life and the audience can see how fractured her soul is with people fallen under her command. Bardem was a great villain in this film, making himself very memorable and tries to outshine any actor in the scene with him. Fiennes is an actor that always brings his best in whatever role he is in and he has done so here but he was limited here in screen time. The bond girls, Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe, were fantastic here. I love seeing women who can carry their own or at least bring something unique and fresh to a formula that has been recycled over and over again. Harris was a standout in balancing sexy and toughness while Marlohe on the other hand brings out the lustful desires of the audience while not being there just for a good time with Bond.Skyfall is definitely a milestone for the Bond series and it sets up for a new phase in the series. If you enjoy a new twist in the same formula, beautiful photography and brilliant direction then give this one a try. I hope Mendes' 24th Bond film will just be as good as this, maybe even better.",9,2,7,2 December 2013
Spartacus," Memorable and Iconic
","Stanley Kubrick's sword & sandal epic, Spartacus, is a film that should not be ignored as it holds an importance place in the director's catalog. This was not one of the films that introduced me to Kubrick's works and I came into this thinking it may surprise or immerse me that it would rise at the same level as my opinion on Kubrick's masterpieces. Sadly, it did not hit me with much force as I wanted it to.The plot of Spartacus is the rise of Spartacus from the shackles of Rome's slavery. It is a story that I indeed enjoy but since the film, at times, drifts away from Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and focuses on Crassus' (Laurence Olivier) goal for power and dictatorship of Rome, it took me out as that half doesn't hold up to the strength in Spartacus' story. It doesn't get to the point that the film becomes dull, so it is still tolerable. I felt Dalton Trumbo's script lacked interesting dialogue and sometimes doesn't create that sense of importance in what they are saying. I believe in a film like this, it is dialogue that should keep the audience invested, as it serves in supporting the plot and intentions of the characters on screen. The rivalry between Gracchus (Charles Laughton) and Crassus is very entertaining as it explores the paths of what Rome can become. It is the screenplay that holds most of the issues I have with this film and if it have been maybe revised or spent a little more time on it, this film would have been a masterpiece.2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon, are films of Kubrick that I felt were all daring as they have imposed either controversy, antagonizing characters, exploratory themes and risk for low financial gain. Spartacus on the other hand was something of an epic which had extremely high expectations and was easy to market to the public. This film in his catalog definitely seems like an oddball. I felt that Kubrick did not have that creative control in this production as compared to his other projects but he did the best he could with what he had. Kubrick understood the material enough to convey what is needed to tell this tale. He also knew that this film had to be big as the story's themes of hope and freedom had tremendous weight.As I said, this film is large and to convey that, you need to have a cinematographer who can deliver. Russell Metty showed he could handle a project this big. Metty's photography showed the scale of film and, along with Alex North's score, carried significant weight. The battle scenes are example that shows just how big the production is. Metty did not only create beautiful and large long shots but also handled the intimate moments between characters delicately. Scenes with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean SImmons) are captured with such elegance that it is at par with Metty's large ambitious shots. Metty is an important aspect in making Spartacus an epic film that rivals classics like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.The film's length, 3 hours and 17 minutes, is a stretch and some scenes could have been a bit trimmed. I felt that the pacing was a little on the slow side for me and with the issues of the film's script, it made it a bit more of a chore. To me, the length of a film is not the issue but rather the content within that length is what determines the necessity of longer running time. If the film explored a little more with the Senate and make it very entertaining and smartly executed then I would satisfied with the running time, maybe even longer.The score of the film is conducted and composed by Alex North, who I recall also did the score for Cleopatra. North's score definitely has a presence in the film and screams out to be noticed but it isn't the grand moments like the battles that gets me listening but rather the intricate moments between Spartacus and Varinia that shows off a memorable tune that creates the element of romance between the two. His score definitely goes hand in hand with Russell Metty's photography and delivers something that will be remembered in the long run.For a character to become believable, the actor must be deeply attached and understand the role that they are embodying. Kirk Douglas definitely shows that here and is one of the big reasons that makes Spartacus' cause all the more believable. While Douglas is the strongest aspect of this cast, it is not without the help of fantastic supporting actors like Charles Laughton, Jean Simmons, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis. They really connected with their characters and brought their A-game to the film. The downside of the cast is sadly, Laurence Olivier. Olivier brought as much as he could with the character Crassus but the character is written so thinly that it Olivier couldn't show off his abilities. There is one seen which I thought explored the character Crassus for a bit, and that was the restored scene of him in the bath being washed by Antonius (Tony Curtis).The film has it's weak point but it doesn't place the film as the weakest of Kubrick's films or even within that decade or genre as it is solidified it's classic status with it's iconic score and photography, strong story, and a powerful cast.",9,0,0,30 June 2013
Casablanca," Curtiz's Magnum Opus
","A film that is regarded as a classic from most but does it hold up for me? Definitely. Michael Curtiz is the director of Casablanca, who has done a mountain full of films including The Adventures of Robin Hood and Mildred Pierce. I came into this with high expectations, even in my subsequent viewings, as it has an established cast, a well known composer, a prominent director and an experienced cinematographer. The film is definitely excellent but some elements, due to nitpicking, sinks this film a little.The screenplay is developed by the Epstein brothers who had a reputation at their time, and with this project they seem to be in the top of their game. The film's story is packed, exploring a love story, a rebellion and the life of a citizens or immigrants in Casablanca. The film is generally well known for its love story but that wasn't the area that hooked me as I felt it was dragged by it's melodrama. The shifty and uneasy life in this desert city is what kept me hook and it dominates the first half of the film. It is from the start that the film establishes the importance of the city as a character along with the leading actors. The first and start of the second act is dominated with humor as a break from the main storyline which held my interest. I do not hate the love story but I just feel it doesn't hold up with me as compared to the more later love stories in Hollywood, Annie Hall, Vertigo and Beauty and the Beast. Then again, this is a product of its time and I can't frown upon it too much just because of that.This is the only film I have seen of Curtiz's work but it isn't the only one I am aware of. He is an underrated director and one of the hardest working. With Casablanca, he just got hold of a fantastic script which got the general public to really notice him. Curtiz wanted this film to move quickly but also giving key moments in exploring the relationship between Bogart and Bergman's characters.The year before Casablanca, Arthur Edeson did the cinematography for The Maltese Falcon and in that film, Edeson used shadows well and using lighting to create the mood of the scene. He brings it back here but more. This film is dark, for the most part as most of the intimate scenes took place indoors and at night. Shadow casts on scenes with Bogart and Bergman but at the same time not overshadowing the actors, especially Bergman's beautiful face as her beauty and vulnerability expressed by her face as both are important components of Ilsa. Edeson and Curtiz always have the camera moving, whether it is inside Rick's club or outside in the streets of Casablanca. It keeps the film at a pace that doesn't feel stationary and gives us a sense of exploration of the setting. This pace is also supported by great editing. In intimate moments, Curtiz really wants Edeson to have the camera get close on the actor's faces to not only have us focus on it but to create that sense of intimacy and closeness. Casablanca still has great photography, even in this day and age, and is an important piece in making it an iconic film.Max Steiner was nominated in 1939 for his iconic work in Gone With The Wind and he was also nominated a few years later for score in Casablanca. His work here in Casablanca is definitely something to be remembered by fan when remembering this film. This should have been an area where it definitely should have won the academy award but sadly it lost to The Song of Bernadette.For a film focused on the love story and is this intimate requires actors that bring that chemistry in order to create a memorable performance. Bogart and Bergman definitely work well together but I felt that Bogart is a little too old for Bergman. I would rather have the age of Bergman's character be nearly level with Bogart's and replace her with an older actress, but would the film still be regarded as a classic if the casting choices were different? I think so and I am only nitpicking. Both Bogart and Bergman bring it their all, even if the script is a little melodramatic they make it work for the most part. I definitely enjoyed Bogart's embodiment as this stoic and tortured character who distances himself from letting people in. Bergman has the more overly dramatic lines but she still delivers by showing emotion and care for Bogart's character. As soon as she was introduced in the film and meets Sam (Dooley Wilson), you can see that pain and sorrow rising to the surface. The supporting cast are fine and are either used for plot tools or comedic relief. The actors giving comic relief, especially Claude Reins, had me smiling every time they say something witty.A film that definitely still holds a strong place in this day and age and is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a fascinating story of a love story and an interesting take on the life of Casablanca during the second world war. It has its flaws but it's overshadowed by its strengths. Casablanca is definitely worth your time and demands repeated viewings.",10,3,4,2 July 2013
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Jazzy, Edgy and Different
","101 Dalmatians feels heavy and dark for an early Disney film. I am not sure whether it was trying to raise a message on animal cruelty or were they just trying a good tale and just using it as a backdrop, but either one it's still something that is worth seeing.This story is based on a children's story by Dodie Smith and written for the screen by Bill Peet. The film's premise is that there is this scary lady who wants to steal Pongo and Perdita's children and turn them into coats. Peet has done four films with Disney and those are Cinderella, Sword In The Stone, 101 Dalmatians and Peter Pan. Out of all of these films, I felt that his best was Peter Pan but his darkest is 101 Dalmatians. This film gets into a dark place once Cruella De Vil is introduced and some children may find her frightening, when her eyes went red it was one of the most frightening things Disney has ever done. Once the stealing of puppies begins, I started to see the themes of genocide and imprisonment. After when they escape it becomes like a survivalist film. It feels similar to world war 2 films like Schindler's List and Defiance which I admired. The beginning of the film feels a little misleading, as it feels positive like something from Lady and the Tramp but then that adds to that shock you would feel when this woman comes in with evil intentions and a horrible personality. It was pretty funny though when the film starts and thinking that the narration is from the human's perspective but rather from the dog and we find out through calling of the human from Pongo, a 'Pet'.This film is directed by Clyde Geronimi and Hamilton Luske. These guys have directed some well known Disney classics, in particular Lady and the Tramp, and so there is some expectations with this film. I think with their experience from Lady and the Tramp, it was easier to animate and needing not to do a lot of research in animating it. The third director for this film is Wolfgang Reitherman. This is his first feature length film for Disney and I bet he was the reason that this film had that edge to it, whether it's the music or the animation. This is the guy who used Jazz and R&B for his future Disney flicks. I feel that they did a decent job. I can't say that this film will be the most remembered but with a memorable villain and edgy feel to it, it is deserving of its status as a Disney classic.The animation of this film is a start of a string of films that uses a dirty look. The animation is not as clean as compared to Cinderella or Lady and the Tramp but it is effective as it captures urban London so well that it won't be so much of a distraction. The dalmatians are drawn very well but can get rather repetitive, then they did half to draw 99 dalmatian puppies. The animators have improved from their last Disney efforts, Sleeping Beauty, as there is more personality in the characters, especially the people. They drew Cruella very menacingly and so uniquely in the film. She stands out when she is in the scene, especially near the beginning when standing next to Roger and Anita.The music of this film has a mix of both orchestral and jazz. It feels like a bridge between their orchestral dominated film, Sleeping Beauty, and the film soon to follow, The Jungle Book. I enjoyed the songs that Roger plays as it feels catchy and edgy. I like that the film did not decide to become too melodramatic with its score and dis something a little more simple.This film is not Disney's top classic but it is fun and something different from the films that Disney usually puts out, aside from Alice In Wonderland. I suggest let your child be a little bit more mature or have seen at least a decent amount of Disney animations before watch this. I recommend it to anyone but don't get your hopes too much on it.",10,7,8,3 July 2013
Gravity," A Film That Is Frightening And Gorgeous
","Thrilling, tense, ambitious, exciting, beautiful, and horrific. These are the words that I mostly hear that is associated with this film and I can now safely say that it does live up to those words. It's praise from critics and general audience is definitely understandable as this film is a powerhouse in direction, cinematography, musical score, and visual effects.The film is written by Jonás and Alfonso Cuarón. Both have written a script that focuses much more on the survival of both Stone and Kowalsky, which I think is a great approach and also can be risky in being discarded as another thriller that does not break any new ground. Gravity does not feel campy as the story places these two characters in a situation that has the audience feeling tense and fearful of the unpredictability of space and the chance of not being able to breathe. The film does also touch on philosophical themes that had me understand the value of life.The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón. who is best known for his work on the third Harry Potter film and Children of Men. Cuarón is definitely a great storyteller and knows how to keep both simple and deep audiences to be thoroughly entertained. Cuarón doesn't seem to try to create something unique but rather create something that would evoke something from the audience.Gravity's photography is handled by Emmanuel Lubezki who is mostly known for his work on Terrence Malick's recent films. Gravity is simply a gorgeous film and definitely may be the prettiest film of the year. The photography captures the darkness and emptiness of space and supports the tension and tone that Cuarón was going for. Visual effects also plays a role in making the film look and feel realistic. I watched the film in 3D, which i rarely do, but it definitely works in this film as debris come by the characters and sometimes come towards us and haves us looking away as it just feels so real and frightening. I cannot decide whether Lubezki's best work is either the emptiness and lifeless picture of Gravity or the beautiful image of life and nature of The Tree of Life.The film's score is handled by Steven Price, who is a new composer as he has only really worked on three films. Price has cerated a score that kept me felt tense without me knowing that it was Price's score that caused me to flinch or shocked me. The last time a score that had my heart racing was Hans Zimmer's score on The Dark Knight Rises. Gravity's score definitely doesn't stand out in comparison to other thriller-action films in recent years but this doesn't retract from the score's effectiveness to get a reaction out of us.The film's acting is driven by both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Bullock as Ryan Stone was great in showing the fear that one would feel when they are helpless in space. Clooney as Matt Kowalski portrays the rational thinking that is required from a person when a crises occurs, he is the voice in our head that we must try to listen to but sometimes is clouded by the anxiety and fear that we feel when a crises occurs. Both actors play well with each other and something I deeply enjoyed while watching this film. Gravity is a intense thriller that haves the audience feeling fearful and anxious of the dangers of space while at the same time delivering a good score and an incredibly gorgeous photography. This is definitely a film that I would constantly come back to in the future as it's themes and approach resonates well with me.",10,1,3,26 October 2013
Se7en," Dark but a thrilling ride
","Major spoilers below.....Have we all gotten so used to it that we have become naive? Se7en is David Fincher's second film, after his under appreciated take on the Alien franchise. This is a film I have watched when I was around 14 and I thought it was excellent, does it hold up now that I am more mature and I have a better understanding of how things work? Definitely.The film's screenplay was written by Andrew Kevin Walker and honestly I have no idea what other films he has done aside from 8MM, and I haven't even seen that film yet. So I came into this thinking whether I would still be excited and thrilled in my second viewing. I was not as surprised or excited this time as I knew the major twist and the events leading up towards it. Back then, I only really viewed the surface of the film and in subsequent viewing, I discovered the depth of this film and this depth is the reason I remained hooked until the end. The story is an up and coming detective who got transferred to this city where crime is apparent and is hoping to be involved in bigger and more serious cases. He is then paired with a soon to be retired detective to solve a case of murders relating to the seven deadly sins. The screenplay really speaks the abundance and triviality of sin that litters the streets. It gives us these two characters that clearly represents the sins and virtues in Catholicism. David Mills' character clearly represents a person who is among the people who falls within sin and yet we root for the guy. The character Mills throughout the film has fallen within the seven sins that John Doe is trying to show, either done subtly or obviously. William Somerset on the other hand represents the virtues that counter acts sin. I see this film as a character driven film, you follow both these two detectives to a definitive ending that will not only entertain the audience but also get them thinking. Thematically deep but also a surprising thriller.This was my first David Fincher, and in my first viewing I found the film to be unsettling due to the themes and tone, granted I was also 14 who loved light and heart-warming films, but as I have gotten older and mature I have become a little more stoic and have gained an interest in cinema. With this interest, I have started to explore different films and such, then I got to a point where I watched a few under Fincher's direction and started to enjoy them, especially Fight Club and Alien 3, so I decided to watch Se7en again and started to understand his ability as a filmmaker. Se7en is definitely a dark film but this was coming off the heels of Alien 3, which was also a depressing turn to the Alien saga, so it wasn't much of a big change but his direction in this feature was much more controlled and understood. He definitely knew what he wanted to do with this film and knew what he wanted to convey to the audience. Fincher's confidence here is not something that is found in his later acclaimed films but he did enough to convince me in his sophomore attempt.I haven't seen the other films that Darius Khondji have worked in but his photography here is definitely moody. It's appropriate and unsettling. The tone is the major thing I picked up on his photography and it was definitely supported with dominating shadows, icy cold colors, and the overpouring rain. This tone and darkness is something I don't find in a Fincher film until The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.Pulsing drums and deep horns fill the score by Howard Shore. It aided, especially in the third act, in creating that thrilling atmosphere with the rising tension that constantly grasps the audience. I am familiar with Shore's work, notably The Lord of the Rings, The Aviator and Hugo, so I had a bit of expectation for his take on this film. It was great and can't think of anything that would improve it.The film moves in such a pace that doesn't feel rushed. It takes its time with its character development and tension building. The third act is definitely the Coup de Grace as it fantastically grips us as it leads to the conclusion that will have you shocked and amazed.As this film, to me, was character driven, it had to have actors who can give great performances. Both Pitt and Freeman give their all and have successfully stamped and defined their characters. Pitt, though, is the one I have to give more props to as he played a role that was sympathised but also unlikable. The supporting cast is underplayed to dominate the presence of these two leads but their performances were great.The film has some dark themes and is very unsettling at times but should not be dismissed as it is also an entertaining piece of work and definitely a notable effort in Fincher's catalog.",10,2,4,1 July 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Risky, Unique, Fresh, And Fun
","Many people regarded Death Proof as a disappointment and they were all hoping that Tarantino will come back to his best form in his next film, though I did think highly of Death Proof, and what a come back he did. Inglourious Basterds is his 6th film and it shows Tarantino going back to the things that made his film great whilst doing something unique.Inglourious Basterds is written by Quentin Tarantino, and he has definitely made something fantastic here. Tarantino here has brought back the non-linear approach to his storytelling. He dedicates the first three chapters of the film as an introduction to the key players of the last chapter, and having the 4th Chapter 'Operation Kino' as the driving plot point. It kept me hooked because with each chapter, as he adds on more information that we didn't know which builds it all up for the last two chapters of the film. The film shows off entertaining and quirky characters, which hasn't been found in his films since his 90's flicks. Tarantino has given his characters much more depth here than most of his previous films would give, and he continuous it with his next film, and it does allow me to connect with these characters more and understand their inner workings due to their given back-stories. The dialogue in this film is top notch, at times very reminiscent of the style that was used for Pulp Fiction, as it kept me more interested as more words come out from these characters. To some people, they may see it as a return to Tarantino's indulgent style of dialogue but that's what makes his films special in the first place, so the more the better.Not at all did the film bore me, this is because Tarantino is in love with his own dialogue and he makes it the star of the scene. Tarantino fills the scene with dialogue, as a build up of sorts towards the violent and explosive ending that the scene needs in order to be relieved and pumped for what comes next. As I said before the non-linear storytelling of the film and using the bulk of the film to create and introduce it's characters, it doesn't get boring as it doesn't repeat itself and always give off something new. Some people find a lot of Tarantino's films to have a pacing problem and I can understand where they are coming from, but Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that felt like it moves forwards all the time regardless how still a scene may seem because it keeps throwing interesting things your way and in a lot of scenes, Tarantino was able to convey tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking something might happen. Tarantino has used non-English dialogue with subtitles in his previous films, Kill Bill, and now he has put that up front with this film, using it as a style in making this film unique and allowing the film to feel more genuine.Robert Richardson is back to do another of Tarantino's film and with each film I start to see a connection and understanding of each other's visions. Richardson understands what the film needs to create that homage atmosphere that Tarantino intends his films to look like. Richardson and Tarantino has brought back their trademark shots like long takes and the trunk shot. Because this film is a dialogue driven film, Richardson contains a lot more closeups than his previous films and this does allow us to get in touch with these characters and see the emotional rumblings that they hide behind the facade due to the current situation, especially Melanie Laurent's character. The film's photography seems to strip away the over saturation of it's colors, like Kill Bill and Death Proof, and takes a more darker and grimier look for the film.The film doesn't contain a composer writing an original score, instead it uses soundtracks that are more score driven. The tracks that are chosen are Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone inspired, which on paper would be an odd choice as it suits more of the Western era but after seeing this film, you hardly even notice it and at the end you realize that it actually works. There are specific moments that are supported by a track that makes the moment seem perfect but Tarantino has the habit of cutting it off and not giving the scene a proper conclusion, which gives off a comedic feel and prevents it from being too melodramatic.Brad Pitt may be seen as the frontrunner of the film but the film is more of an ensemble piece. The first three chapters are dedicated to a certain character(s), and this allows these actor(s) to shine in their segments. Brad Pitt definitely brings a surge of energy in this film, working with a character that feels almost specifically written for him. The other standout was Christoph Waltz, playing a character that has a personality that I have haven't seen before. Waltz brings such charm and personality to a character that is regarded by most people as the ultimate Jew killer. Tarantino has used an international cast before but not as diverse as this film. Inglourious Basterds has made a star and showcased the talents of actors like Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl. Though Michael Fassbender has been on films before this like 300 but this film put him on the map, the bar scene segment was tense and thrilling and a part of it is due to Fassbender's performance.Inglourious Basterds is a remarkable film and a demonstration of Tarantino's ability to take something that has been used a billion times in films and make it feel fresh and unique. The film boasts wonderful dialogue, amazing sequences, fantastic performances front actors, smart choice of music, and excellent photography. Inglourious Basterds is a rival for the number one spot for my favorite Tarantino films.",10,2,4,14 January 2014
World War Z," Not The Best Of It's Genre But Acceptable
","World War Z, a zombie film with a big budget and has Brad Pitt as the leading man, it sounds excellent. Turns out it's only decent. I came into this film thinking it's a zombie film in a much more grand scale. Now that I've seen it, I now know that I came in expecting too much from it.This film was based off a novel of the same name, which I haven't read so I came into this blind in plot. The film's plot is quite straight forward and doesn't take a genius to understand the goal of Pitt's character but what made this film feel a little flat is the stakes. In a zombie or apocalypse film, usually there would be more than one guy that the film is following and with that focus, the characters then have a sense of weight to them if a soul is lost but in this film there isn't a lot of people to care about aside from Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). I understand that this film shows a much bigger picture than intimate survival films like Dawn of the Dead but at least those films had characters that means more to us as an audience if they die. I see the tragedy and horror of the situation but these are people seen from a distance and they feel expendable. The film's ending may seem underwhelming but it makes sense as zombie films never truly have a defining conclusions, it usually ends with everyone dead or stuck somewhere hoping someone will save them. This film feels like the first step in fixing the issue and needs at least a second film to tie up the loose ends. The film though has it's strengths. I love that it still had it's suspenseful moments and that it didn't really focus on the killing for survival but rather the search for a cure in order to survive. Overall, the film's story feels like a mixture of Soderbergh's 'Contagion' and Emmerich's '2012'.Marc Forster has proved that he could make action with Quantum of Solace but so far his films with high amounts of action have been not so strong with it's core story and this film is another example but his work on the simpler dramas like Stranger Than Fiction and Finding Neverland seem to receive more positive responses. His efforts here is not horrible though, it's just not up there with his better films. I like the fact that the film has large moments, the attack on Israel, and frightening small moments, World Health Organisation in Wales. The film doesn't feel deep and with a film like this with such ambition, it would have benefited from it.The cinematography feels very generic and is an aspect of the film that won't be remembered. It does what it does, captures the image and creates some sort of tension, but I hoped for a film like this that it would be a little darker and moody.Beltrami's score was fantastic in films like The Hurt Locker and Resident Evil because they create this dark mood that supports the film. Surprisingly for a film that focuses on zombies, it feels more like a action film which at the same time is unsurprisingly as the moments with tension is very fast paced and exciting. The scenes at the WHO centre or the refueling of the plane was fantastic, the times where the film are at their most suspenseful and dark.I have no issues with the acting in this film, my issue is that the screenplay doesn't flesh out these characters enough that anybody besides Pitt could show off their acting range. Brad Pitt, as always is fantastic, but this type of film doesn't really try to challenge actors in showing their skills. The supporting cast were fine but wish was used a little more.Definitely won't be up there along with my favorite Zombie or Apocalyptic film of all time but it's good enough for me to watch again when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD just to pick up on things I may have not picked up in the story. I had fun though.",7,2,5,17 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Superficially entetaining and thematically deep
","The Hunger Games was one of the films in 2012 I expected to be a disaster but hoped that it was carfted well. My hypothesis of the film was clearly wrong and my hopes for the film was very much proved right.The plot of this film is very simple allowing audiences to be interested and earn the studios some profit. Though it is not the film's plot that made me, for the most part, enjoyed this film but it is the film's themes of political and commercial manipulation to ensure the peace and cooperation within the Capitol and the twelve districts. So much of this film reminds me of Ridley Scott's Gladiator as it also incorporates the importance of winning the audience as a tool of surviving in the arena. The film's focus on romance drew me out for a bit as it felt a little tiresome, though it's use in pleasing the sponsors was very interesting.Gary Ross' direction is, for the most part, great. He really seems to understand the source material and accurately and entertainingly transfers Suzanne Collins novel to the screen. Ross has chosen to create a gloomy atmosphere in showcasing the districts and the world of Panem. Though the Capitol is almost the complete opposite of the twelve districts; Ross still maintains that depressing feel when displaying the Capitol by showing that these people, who root and applaud for the chosen tributes, are animals who wants to see these children destroy themselves for their entertaining (Something that is also similar to Gladiator). I am happy with Ross' decisions and direction but there is one area where I found him a bit weak at and that is the action. The action sequences in this film didn't entertain or excite me as it should have. They feel generic and lackluster, though the scene with Katniss running in the flaming forest was done well.The cinematographer for this film was Tom Stern, who usually is found as the DP of Clint Eastwood films. Stern knows how to create a mood with his photography, Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby, and he successfully does that for The Hunger Games. The colors are muted and has this blue hue that fills the image, particularly in shots of District 12. The Capitol on the other hand is captured with breathtaking wide shots and fantastic lighting. There was a particular moment in the film where Katniss is hallucinating from the Tracker Jackers, this moment was created excellently. There will be a few people who will find the shaky cam to be too overbearing and frequent but it did not bother me so much.The pacing of this film was handled excellently with fast cuts that move the film along at a pace that does not slow the film down or bore the audience. I feel that this film should have some sort of extended cut or director's cut to show a little more with Donald Sutherland's character to set him up much more for the next installment.One of the film's main highlights is the production design of the film which to me feels very inspired by the Romans and made me think back of films like Gladiator. The Capitol's design draws similarities to Rome in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The costumes and make up in this film is very wild and eccentric and I think fits very well and not at all distracting.James Newton Howard's score fits well with the film's tone and setting. I hate coming back to this but again I found certain segments of his score to resemble Hans Zimmer's score in Gladiator. The score never at a point dominated a moment which made me stop and adore but it I did notice it's presence and fit well with the film.Now the actors in the other hand are a bit polarizing with me as the leads I found to be a little disappointing. Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss passable enough that she wouldn't be seen as the down side among the actors in this film. I felt that she, and also Josh Hutcherson, did not show the emotions that I hoped they would experience given their situation. These two were placed in a horrible situation that may result in death and somehow they don't convey any signs of anxiety, fear or anger. It felt that they went straight to acceptance. I would have appreciated it if they showed it even a little so it won't affect too much of the character. Hutcherson in my opinion is the weakest link and the main reason why I felt chemistry was a bit lacking between him and Lawrence. He doesn't seem to be in touch with his character and at the same can't challenge Lawrence's acting. Though the moments with Katniss and Rue, Lawrence did these scenes perfectly and shown the protagonist's vulnerability. In the supporting cast, there were some scene stealers and these were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks as Effie. They are spot on with their comedy and hit their marks when they deliver their lines. Harrelson embodies this troubles soul so deeply that you are really convinced that Woody may actually just be playing his regular self. Liam Hemsworth, i felt was not in the screen long enough to actually show his relevance but this may change in the sequels. Lenny Kravitz did fine but nothing noteworthy. Donald Sutherland should have been used more in this film as he is truly, i felt, is the main protagonist and still will be in the upcoming sequels. At the end, Sutherland felt menacing and dark which gladly sets up his goal in the next film.The film's plot may be simple but it's use of symbolism is great. Beautiful cinematography, excellent pacing, spot on score, and fine acting ensures that this film is definitely worth a watch at least twice or own on home media.",7,0,3,30 June 2013
The Impossible," One Of The Best Films Of 2012
","I had high expectations for this film as it looked like something that would be nominated for Best Picture or something just as prestigious. When the awards came, it did not get enough praise as I thought it would. So my expectations of this film was a little lower coming in, now that I have finally seen it, I am baffled on this film not being regarded as one of the best films of 2012.The film's plot is that this British family who lives in Japan, who decides to take a Christmas holiday in Thailand and a tsunami hits the holiday resort which forces them to be separated form one another. Screenplay written by Sergio Sanchez, who also did the screenplay of J.A Bayona's previous film The Orphanage, is an amazing story of family and resiliency. The strongest area of the film is the event of the tsunami and, Maria and Lucas' attempt to find each other. It's really powerful and moving. The latter half of the film may not be as strong and frightening as the first half but it still works as the aftermath of the event on this family.I have a feeling that in the future, we are all going to see a lot Juan Antonio Bayona's films being critically acclaimed and receiving awards. He knows how to create something so shocking without making it feel unfamiliar. We all see injuries and pain everyday but not like this. I cringed a couple of times on the gashes that are found on people. He wanted to make the event to feel heavy and really see the impact it has on the family, whether it's emotional or physical trauma. The disaster scene alone was suspenseful and felt that maybe someone won't make it. Bayona doesn't want the CGI effects of this film to feel too ambitious or too flashy and just focusing on making it feel real. The ending was predictable but after what these people have just went through it's acceptable.Beautiful. Simply Gorgeous. The way Oscar Faura captured Thailand before and after the incident are done so well that it sometimes dominates the scene. The lighting feels very natural and doesn't at any point become too forced or artificial. Even cramped and intimate moments in the hospital or the plane works. There will be at times where the camera feels shaky but I felt that it was tamed well and doesn't feel at all distracting.A lot of the people working on this film has worked with Guillermo Del Toro productions before and I think that's what makes the film work at times as the crew know each other and knows each others abilities. Fernando Velazquez is the film's composer and I am familiar with his recent film Mama, also produced by Guillermo Del Toro. The Impossible's score at the start is subtle but as the drama elevates, his score becomes bigger. I did not really took notice of the score's presence at times as it has been outshone by fantastic cinematography and amazing acting performances.Everybody in this film was great, in particular Naomi Watts. You really see it in her performance that everything that just happened hit her like a wave, don't mind the pun, and makes her vulnerable emotionally as well as physically. There was a beautiful scene with her, her son and this young boy they were able to save and the boy caresses her hair as a way of saying thank you, this scene shows the best in her acting as she didn't need to say anything and yet so much about her character is said with a single smile. Ewan McGregor was good but I felt didn't carry it as much as Watts did but nevertheless great. How Bayona was able to get something great in the children's acting was beyond me because they were fantastic.One of the best films of 2012, probably just under my favorite Silver Linings Playbook, and is deserving of much more praise than it currently has. Strong performances from the actors and moving drama made this film unforgettable. Bayona has made a film that shows the other filmmakers out there he is a force to be reckon with. I am excited to see what he is going to make next and hopefully it's as beautifully crafted as this one.",10,1,3,10 July 2013
Argo," Up There With The Best Films Of 2012
","Argo is the best picture of 2012, according to the Academy Awards and after watching it twice it is hard to argue whether it is deserving of it's honor. I have seen most of the films that Argo was up against for Best Picture and I must say that there were much better overall films but none can match the intensity and suspense that Affleck has crafted here.Argo's screenplay was written by Chris Terrio and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Argo's plot sounds interesting even on paper but it when you watch it, you start to see the brilliance that most people have given this film credit for. The screenplay's strong point is the first half of the film where it focuses on the ridiculousness of the plan and the weight it bares on the lives of 6 people. I do wish that Terrio did a little more work on the film's dialogue as at times feel a bit too straightforward and simple. The other issue I had with the film, particularly in the extended cut, was the small focus on Mendez's family issues which would be fine if the film spent more time with it but the film only slightly focuses on it so watching it subsequent times, it does slow the film down. I love that Terrio has written Siegel (Arkin) and Chambers (Goodman) as comic relief as it keeps the slow moments of the first half to move along faster. A lot of the audience's negative reaction to the film is the inaccuracy of the film's story but to me that aspect is not as important. When a film takes a biographical/historical approach then it should be approached cinematically. If I wanted a film to focuses heavily on facts then I would watch a documentary.I have seen all of Ben Affleck's directed films and I can definitely say, at least for now, that Argo is his strongest film. Affleck's direction is the star for this film as it meshes both comedy while retaining the weight and intensity of a suspense film. It may not appeal to everyone but I thought it was effective and it gave the film that style that other filmmakers can't achieve. Affleck's greatest achievement in film is the final 40 minutes of this film where it kept me locked towards the screen and always thinking on how the scene will play out.Rodrigo Prieto is responsible for the film's photography, he is mostly known for his work with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's films and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain. Prieto was able to capture the late 70's effect in the image, particularly in scenes shot in 8mm and 16mm, but still able to retain that contemporary look and style that is found in recent films. The shot choices that both Affleck and Prieto has used for the film is fantastic. The shots that are chosen have definitely been planned and it shows the confidence that Affleck in his filmmaking abilities. I am glad that Affleck has chosen to take a much more patient and stable approach to the cinematography and avoiding the style that Paul Greengrass has perfected with his films, a camera that is constantly moving and have that shaky cam feel. Shots in this film move gracefully and I found this very attractive.Alexandre Desplat is a composer who has worked with many of the big name films these past few years. Desplat has worked on some of my favorite films like Moonrise Kingdom and The Tree of Life. His work here may not be up to par with those films but his score is able to maintain and support that intensity that compliments with Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography. The score shows it's best moments in the final act where it becomes much more dramatic. If only the score is like this throughout the entire film then I would have given this area of the film more credit.The film's cast is amazing. I can't stress enough the amount of familiar faces in this film and is done in a way that doesn't feel over the top and have us retracted from the story. Affleck is the protagonist of the film but there isn't much to the character in this film as the film's focus is the operation and the weight of it rather than having a personal and intimate focus. Bryan Cranston is probably the best thing about this film as he brings something here that I have not seen from him in his other films. I am a fan of John Goodman and he is always good on whatever film he is in and that goes the same for Alan Arkin. Both Goodman and Arkin delivers their comedic lines brilliantly with Arkin giving a much more out there performance. The actors playing the six Americans were cast perfectly and definitely worked well together.Argo is great overall but it isn't a personal favorite of mine from 2012. This doesn't mean that it should not be given a try as you would be missing out on an experience that you would want to come back to over and over again. I am excited to see Affleck's next directorial effort and hopefully it would at least be at the same level as this one.",8,0,2,5 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Ambitious And Thematically Deeper
","4 years after the reboot of the popular franchise directed by J.J Abrams has now returned with a sequel. Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely a much anticipated sequel due to the first film being successful commercially and critically. This sequel have been argued whether or not this is an improvement over it's predecessor, but there is one thing I can guarantee and is that this film is definitely a well made Science Fiction Action film.Star Trek Into Darkness was written by Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof & Roberto Orci, and all three acts as screenwriters and producers of this film and it's predecessor. The sequels of the franchise is usually the best opportunity for the writers to dish out the best stories for the franchise as they are not restricted in having to explain the characters back stories and having to define the relationship between characters. Star Trek Into Darkness can truly be a film of it's own. The writers have definitely written something I found enjoyable with a plot that is intriguing and a villain that is so mesmerizing to watch that we wouldn't mind if the film focused on him even more. The film's screenplay is definitely thematically deeper than the first film. The film explores themes of friendship, death, sacrifice, and family. This did impress me in comparison to other blockbuster films released this year and it's something that I will definitely come back to over and over again and it would still not lose it's steam.J. J. Abrams comes back to direct this sequel of his successful Star Trek reboot. Abrams have definitely crafted something much better than it's predecessor as this may be due to a much better understanding and connection to the source material. Abrams have crafted something that is different from the other Star Trek films released but able to relate and throwback elements from the classics. Abrams have made something deep and entertaining. It may not be as in your face and pretentious as other films that touches the same themes as it still retains it's action packed entertainment approach which I don't mind either as long as it is executed with flourish, and Abrams has executed with such flourish. Abrams were able to sneak in some still and heartbreaking moments that surprisingly made me care about the characters, which is something I usually dismiss in films like this. This does give me more faith with Abrams future films, as he has disappointed me before like Mission Impossible 3. I hope he does return for a sequel to this film as he definitely revived a franchise to a new generation and hopefully for future ones.Daniel Mindel comes back as the director of photography for this film. Mindel is more known as an action director and he is a frequent collaborator with Abrams, aside from Super 8. Mindel and Abrams have brought back the beautiful photography that was present on the first film. The visual effects in this film do look impressive and improves the already fascinating effects from the first film. The lens flare in this film is much more toned down, or maybe it just seemed less distracting due to the improved technique in photographing this film. The shots that Abrams and Mindel uses for this film, especially within the ship, are filled with panning and this is due to the great blocking that Abrams employs in his shots allowing the film to be constantly in motion but without relying on the shaking effect of hand-held camera. As the film does contain certain intimate moments, I felt that they were shot fantastically and adds on to the tension or emotion that Abrams wants to convey or bring out from us.Michael Giacchino is responsible for the film's score. When the film's theme song plays, it gives me the chills as it just makes me think that we are coming into a special film. Giacchino has brought the good areas from his score of the first film and improved upon that with this film feeling much more ambitious and heavy. Though the moment at the start of the film with the sick child contains a beautiful piece driven by a piano. Giacchino definitely knows how to suck us in with his scores, just listen to his work on the Pixar films like Up and Ratatouille.The actors in this film is more focused solely on their interaction with one another rather than a separate entity of it's own like the first film, due to the first film focusing on their backstory and how that connects to the way these characters are. I can definitely say that these actors work well together and more moments show their acting range. Pine and Quinto banter and acting, particularly in scenes where their relationship and feelings towards one another are being discussed and explored, have definitely grabbed on to me; making me care about the decisions of these characters and empathise with them. A stand out performance from Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely something that needs to be noted when praising this film. Great and scene stealing villains are not something unique in films nowadays but his is something that cannot be ignored. If I am to nitpick, I am still a little disappointed with Karl Urban's character being a source of one liners, the character is also written quite campy which does become a distraction for me. All in all the actors did a great job and hopefully the next film will allow more screen time to flesh out both the actors and the characters they play.Star Trek Into Darkness is ambitious and thematically deeper than it's predecessor. It is also more entertaining and features a villain that we won't forget. I hope that Abrams come back for a third installment and somehow improve on a film that is definitely one of the best blockbuster films of 2013.",9,2,5,29 November 2013
Beauty and the Beast," One Of The Best Films Of The Disney Renaissance
","Disney has created a few classic princess fairy tale films in the past, so does Beauty and the Beast still matter? Simply yes. In comparison to the other princess films in the Disney Renaissance, this tops it but overall it isn't my favorite. The Disney Renaissance was film after film executed with brilliance and there are four films that would almost always be chosen either one as the best of the pack; The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. I fall in the group that thinks Aladdin is the strongest film but either one are great enough to be number one.The story team for this film, did a great job as they meshed the melodramatic tale ,that is commonly found in the Disney princess films of the past, with modern dialogue and humor that appeals to the newer generation. With Disney animated films, I expect to see funny side characters. The difference between the old Disney and the new Disney is that somehow the most memorable element of the cast is the supporting cast rather than the main star. With Disney's old films, the main characters were the memorable ones for me. The film is an endearing, feel good, romantic story; with hilarious dialogue; that will appeal to all ages.This film was directed by Gary Tousdale and Kirk Wise, and this film was their debut in directing a Disney animated full length feature. What a great way to start, they created a film that is now regarded as a classic and was the first animated feature to be nominated with Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I think they took the best things about The Little Mermaid and added other things that work. Their next directorial efforts for Disney did not achieve close to what they have done for this, although those films did gain a cult following.I felt that The Little Mermaid and The Rescuers Down Under in comparison did not have that beautiful cinematography that Beauty and the Beast shows. It's cinematography is one of the main reasons why so much of this film work, whether it's the beautiful and dramatic lighting or the way the 'camera' moves in a particular scene. An example would be the scene where both Belle and the Beast had a romantic dance in the ballroom; the scene was lit gorgeously and the iconic moment when the 'camera' starts from the chandelier and glides its way down to them dancing. I felt that this aspect of the film should have been awarded with something.As expected from a Disney film, it is going to contain musical numbers in it. I don't usually mind it as it allows the animators to show off something daring and outrageous. I feel that the songs in this film are much more accessible and beautiful, like 'Be Our Guest' and 'Gaston', rather than something grand and iconic, Lion King, or as fun and daring, Aladdin. Be Our Guest and Gaston are definitely the favorite of mine. Be Our Guest due to it feeling like a Broadway musical and Gaston because it is so ridiculously egotistic that it is entertaining. Also pretty much who has seen the film, would remember the words 'Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme'. The soundtrack is wonderful but I don't feel any of it out trumps Aladdin's 'A Whole New World' or Lion King's 'Circle of Life'.The voices of the film fit well for the characters and certainly gives the characters a bit of personality. The animators did a wonderful job drawing the characters as they look very clean and attractive. The animators pushed hard on this film as large amounts of objects or people move in one shot, and each movement has a personality of its own. Cogsworth and Lumiere are one of the best character duos ever animated on Disney.The film is an icon of its own and definitely ranks in one of the top romance films of all time. Beauty and the Beast is a film that would be competing against films like Casablanca and Gone with the Wind in deciding which melodramatic romance film is the best. If you are looking for a great romantic film or a Disney film that hits all of its marks then this is that film.",10,2,2,8 July 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Solid film with a few issues
","Coming off the heels of his highly acclaimed film, Let The Right One In, his next film would be very highly anticipated and the expectations would be higher as this would be his first English film. This film was also my introduction to his works as I have not seen any of his previous films but only have acknowledged it. I have owned this film for quite some time now and I have watched it at least 3 to 4 times. Each time I watch this, I understand the film's plot and the characters a little more; and at the same time not losing it's entertainment value.In the simplest terms, the plot of this film is for Smiley (Gary Oldman) to identify the mole, that is suspected from Control (John Hurt), within the 'Circus' (MI6). The film was based off John le Carré's novel and rewritten for the screen by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan. I cannot say whether their screenplay is faithful to novel as I have not read it but I can definitely say that their work is fantastic. So much of the dialogue speaks so much about the characters and story is unfolded in a way that doesn't feel forced. This film barely consists anything action, and when it does, it's more heartbreaking rather than pumping you up. If the dialogue didn't work then the film would collapse. I hoped that the film ran a bit longer to explore more on the suspects to prevent predictability on who the mole may be but the result was not too bad and definitely still enjoyable. My main issue with the script is that there are some plot holes that can be resolved either by knowing the source material or having a sequel that explores it further. These areas are revolved around Karla as not much is explained about it but rather it is an important piece of the puzzle.Not a bad way to start your English film-making career. Alfredson successfully created something that is suspenseful and engaging. Alfredson wanted this film to be slow, not for pretension, but rather giving us time to take in the new things that are fed to us by the conversations. This film is done stylishly that fits well with the setting and tone, rather than something that is obvious and forced.The way this film was edited is a bit confusing, especially in the first viewing, but after the initial run through, the subsequent times this is watched will not be at all confusing as it starts to become a little cohesive. It is still a chore though, in trying to follow and takes you out of the film for a bit. It didn't bother me as much it did with other people but I did notice it and I did find it slightly annoying.Hoyte Van Hoytema has had experience with Alfredson in his previous film, so they both have an understanding with each other. Hoytema also directed David O' Russell's 'The Fighter', which was a favorite of mine. In this film, Hoytema has employed a slick style of photography in order to have that classy and mysterious feel to it. He uses shots that move quite slowly and sometimes uses zooming as a tool to avoid the feeling of stillness, that would definitely make the film even slower than it already is. Hoytema did a terrific job for this film and deserves a lot of credit for this film.The score of this film, by composer Aalberto Iglesias, is not something that I took notice when watching this and is not very memorable to me. I can say that it did suit the style that Alfredson was going for but I hoped for something a little more than what he did for this film.The cast of this film is amazing, and something that any director would die for. Each one brings their best and each one should be somewhat awarded in some way. The most notable ones are Oldman, Hurt, Cumberbatch, Strong, Hardy and Dencik. It is either they all have some sort of chemistry with each other or that the director demands these performances out of all of them. I like to believe it was both. It was nice to see that there was more to these characters than what was expected from them.This film needs to be watched more than once as, most likely, you may have missed important information that adds to the story and the characters. A film that has a style of its own supported with an appropriate score and a moving photography. It has a wide and award deserving performances from almost the entire cast. Not something to be ignored, give this film a watch.",9,1,2,2 July 2013
Taxi Driver," A Dark Journey Through New York
","Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him.The plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination.This film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind.Michael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way.Bernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York.The film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting.It contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch.",10,5,9,24 July 2013
21 Jump Street," A Unique Approach To A Buddy Cop Story
","21 Jump Street looks goofy when you look at it's poster, i did not watch the trailer before watching this film, but as soon as the plot moves forward it starts to get a little better. The film has great comedic actors, which was the main reason I was hooked to watching this in the first place, and is handled by new directors which grabbed my curiosity.21 Jump Street's plot is not hard to follow, as found on most comedies, but what drives the film along is the references to either the TV show from the 80s or the life of high school students in the 90s. My main issue with the plot is that it feels forced and the writers didn't find a clever way to make it more layered and subtle. The characters in this film at least feel fresh, for the most part, and the film's dialogue does rely on being a little raunchy and unexpected. The buddy cop format has been tackled many times and they did just enough here to make it enjoyable.The film was directed by first time live-action directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, their first film was Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. Their transition to live-action has definitely shown that they can take a material that has a high tendency to become very cliché and campy, and make it unique. The directors definitely wanted to push beyond people's expectations and make them think 'what the f**k just happened?' while retaining that comic quality. The best qualities of this film is the tripping out sequence as it's really in your face, comedy that I also found in films like Fight Club. Lord and Miller kept the film at a quick pace, and i think this was a great decision because if it dragged even a bit, the audience can start to see beyond the surface of the film and find it's flaws. In delivering it's comedic timing, it relies on using sudden jump cuts that work only a couple at times.This film won't win any awards or turn heads on Barry Peterson's photography but it does get the job done. Not a moment I felt the film looked stale or cliché but it does feel generic and commonplace. Peterson and the directors loves to have shots focusing on the actors faces as the main focus of the film is to deliver the comedy, and a lot of the comedy comes from the delivery of the punch lines and the reactions to it.Mark Mothersbaugh's score here did not win me over. It felt lazy and uninspired. This would have been a great opportunity to create a score that feels over the top and trippy, as this would complement the style that Lord and Miller was going for.One of the other highlights of this film is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as they play each other off well and bring personality to these characters in order to prevent them from being stereotypical and one-dimensional. Hill and Tatum's banter is fantastic but the dick jokes does get a little old at times. The dramatic moments though did feel a little over the top from them and I wish a little more came from their performance. Brie Larson is the love interest of Jonah Hill in this film. Larson is fantastic in this as she plays it cool and at times do feel like a high school student from this generation. She was a great casting choice as she is more cute and girl next door type rather than those stereotypically sexy high school girls. Dave Franco was great but nothing different from his other performances like in Scrubs. Rob Riggle did surprise me though as his improvisation in his lines are clever and does catch you off guard. Ice Cube was definitely over the top and did bring down the film a little bit, his comedy just didn't hit me as it did with the others.21 Jump Street doesn't break any new ground but it does have enough to be enjoyable and at times unique. I definitely did not expect the comedy that would be presented in this and it did a great job in keeping me interested until the end. I'm interested to see the sequel but I hope Lord and Miller correct their mistakes from this film with 22 Jump Street.",8,1,2,5 October 2013
The Godfather: Part II," A Flaw Preventing This Film From Being A Masterpiece
","This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.This film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.Coppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.Gordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.The music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.The acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.I may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",8,1,4,11 July 2013
Man of Steel," Entertaining But Familiar
","It's nice to see the Superman franchise take a different direction from the all-to-goody and cheesy style it was known for on its previous franchise. My expectations for this film was not very high, even though it has great names working in this project. After seeing it, It was better than expected but the film does have flaws that may not go so well with me now but may eventually be forgiven for in repeated viewings or after the release of sequels.David Goyer is a type of writer who has passion for what he writes for and has a vision of his adaptations. He seems to have a deep understanding of the source material and sees it's potential, more than we do. Though I admire his contributions in creating a realistic and grounded Batman franchise; I did not like the way Batman Begins is written. I found the origin story a bit lackluster and felt needed a little bit more work. It seems what he has done for Man of Steel is very similar but definitely an improvement in telling the origin story of an iconic character. His screenplay keeps Kal-El grounded by giving it a sense of humanity; having this man who not only is special but also goes through similar things that us normal people can either sympathise or empathise with. In comparison to the the first and second Superman film, I felt that this film was definitely superior as it gave the villain a more interesting goal and giving Kal-El a more realistic touch. An issue that I had with this film is not something that Goyer could really change as it is important to base on the source material, but the origin of Superman has been so well known that not a lot of things here shock me. The film deals with themes of hope, morality and destiny. I think the sequels for this film will definitely improve as it allows opportunities for more original stories and a focus less on the foundations but rather the potential of what it can be.Zack Snyder is a director that is definitely more well known for his visual style rather than other aspects of his filmmaking. He continues his trademark for visual flair and glitter in this film and I felt that it works. His choice of making the action take up a significant portion of the running time did not annoy or bore me. The action oriented scenes in this film is over the top but isn't Superman's story always have been over the top? A few of my friends after the film did feel that the action sequences were a little stretched and did feel tiresome at times but I thought every moment was entertaining and crazy. I wish that Snyder executed better with the film's climax as it did not feel grand enough and the stakes didn't feel as large as it was before that last fight. The use of flashbacks in this film, is obviously something Goyer composed, is much more effective than Nolan's Batman Begins. I cared more for Kal-El's past rather than Wayne's past and it is all due to Snyder's ability to make something visually exciting and Goyer's dramatic writing. Snyder will definitely not win or even may be nominated for Best Director but I felt that he brought justice to a franchise that was considered doomed and in need of a fresh start.Amir Mokri is well known as an action cinematographer. His last film was a Transformers film, so it meant that the scenes will be shot in order to support visual effects rather than the effects enhancing the photography. I was annoyed with this at first but then at times I started to become immersed by the film that it did not become of a major annoyance. The most tedious aspects of his photography is the frequent zooms of objects of importance in wide action oriented shots; after the first few times it was done in the scenes of Krypton, it started to become a frustration and took me out of the film. The last hour of the film though was fine and was way too exciting for me to nitpick on. The sequences, in particular the flashbacks, involving the Kent farm are at times shot very beautifully and could be regarded as pretentious; It felt like something out of a Terrence Malick film. Oh such beauty, but sadly I felt that the film needed a little more of that especially since the film has a large philosophical theme.I'll keep this one short. Hans Zimmer has done memorable scores of films like Lion King, The Dark Knight trilogy and Gladiator. I didn't feel that his work for this film will be ranked among the top of his film scores as it wasn't memorable, but it is effective. I just hoped for something memorable like in his previous efforts.The actors in this film are fine. Cavill does a great job as Kal-El, and Shannon was fine as Zod but they were not defining roles by a long shot. Amy Adams as Lois was definitely a highlight as her portrayal of this strong woman who does her best to chip in and sometimes tries to get what she wants, is a delight to see. The supporting cast, including Crowe, Costner, Lane, Fishburne, and Meloni, were fine but nothing that would steal the scene.A fun summer blockbuster action film with underlying layers of hope and destiny. It is exciting to watch but contains a flaws that hold the film back. If you are familiar with Batman Begins, then parts of this will feel similar. I say, give it a try but don't expect anything prestigious.",5,1,2,6 July 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Just Keep Trying
","I have a tendency to like dramedies even if their flaws are abundantly clear. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those perfect dramedies that contain no flaws, at least in my opinion. I enjoyed the hell out of this film the first time I watched it and just as much the next few times.The film is written by Michael Arndt, and this was his first adapted screenplay. This man knows how to make a story that is emotional and at the same time subtly funny, which is probably the main reason he was brought in to do Toy Story 3. He has created this dysfunctional family filled with personalities that clearly don't mesh with one another and they have to be together in order to bring Olive, the daughter, to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The film focuses on this family who are clearly not very successful in either their career, family, or even their life their burdens have caused dysfunction within the family. This is something that I can easily empathise as everyone, at least, at some point has had dysfunction in their homes. The film itself is kind of a message in telling us to keep trying in achieving our ambitions, and don't give up just because the journey is hard.This is directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and this is their first feature film. A fantastic way to start their career in feature films, before they were doing music videos and documentaries. The film has a small budget and maybe that is one reason this film couldn't do more spectacular moments, aside from the pageant but with what they did, they did great. Dayton and Faris has created a film that is very cramped to emphasise on the family and their personality and struggles. Most of the film is shot inside the VW bus and because we see the bus in a lot of the film, it becomes a character of it's own. This film does look like a lot of low budget films that are commonly found at festivals like Sundance but it's strong script and simple direction makes this film a gem.Like I said before, the film feels like a low budget film and looks like what a dramedy should look. It looks engaging and accessible while at the same time feeling very intimate and simple. The DP of this film is Time Suhrstedt who commonly do a lot of romantic comedies, comedies and dramedies like 'Office Space' and 'The Wedding Singer'; he also did the photography of a personal favorites of mine 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' and 'Fantasia 2000'. The film doesn't try to look amazing but there are moments, like the first 5 minutes of the film, where shots look beautiful though only a handful.When I come into a film like this, I expect a fantastic soundtrack that dominates the film rather than the composer's score. Little Miss Sunshine has a great soundtrack, just not as abundant as I thought it would be but I think that it's a good thing as it would have distracted me from the little things in scenes. Though the track that plays in the climax is unexpected and hilarious. The score though in this film is great, it fits well with the tone and feels very hopeful and positive.This film has an amazing ensemble cast which work well together and looks very convincing in their role. Steve Carrell took me by surprise in particular as I generally see him as an over top actor but he convinced me here that he can play something serious. Paul Dano was another actor which I liked in this film a lot as most of his acting is played through facial expressions, and that particular scene where he breaks is just phenomenal. Kinnear, Collette, Arkin and Breslin were also great in this film. The cast feels like a real dysfunctional family, and each one feels realistic and none feel cheesy or over the top.The film feels very heartwarming and is easy to digest. It's a fantastic dramedy about a family that makes you think about your own and how similar it may seem. The film shows us the importance in trying and not giving up, because only losers give up.",10,0,0,18 July 2013
North by Northwest," It's Age And Influence Has Impacted This Film's Strengths
","Hitchcock is highly praised by critics and the general public as one of the most influential directors of his time and they are not wrong. I have not yet seen all of Hitchcock's work but I have seen most of his films that are commonly regarded as 'essential'. North By Northwest is one of those 'essential' films and it was the one that I felt was the weakest. I am sure that most people will disagree with me but this is how I perceived it after viewing the film three times.North By Northwest is written by Ernest Lehman, who has worked on highly regarded films like The Sound of Music, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and a personal favorite of mine Sabrina. Lehman has written very ambitious films, showing off things that other writers have not yet thought of. North By Northwest is a prime example on how grand his vision was for the action thriller. The film's premise is quite funny and it does get you intrigued. The film starts small, then it gets bigger and bigger as the film progresses. The set pieces in the film are daring and at times ridiculous (though not entirely in a bad way). My main issue with the script is the way the protagonist is written. Roger Thornhill is too self-centred and at times cocky for his own good which many may appealingly engaging, I found it to be difficult for me to show any empathy or sympathy of his unfortunate conditions. Towards the end of the film there is a moment where Thornhill and Eve Kendall discuss about being together and this is the first time where Thornhill showed some sort of emotional vulnerability and had me caring and started to see the side of him that was not shown earlier.Alfred Hitchcock is not shy in pushing the boundaries once in a while, and this one is definitely a huge push. This Hitchcock film has definitely inspired many action/thriller films in the future and still being used as inspiration in modern filmmaking. I do admire the fact that Hitchcock wants us following a man who in most situations is helpless to do anything. North By Northwest is a film that contains the most memorable action sequences, but ironically the main reason that these set pieces lacked the impact for me is the influence it has made on contemporary films. These scenes have time and time again been replicated and taken inspiration from it that when I actually give this a watch, it loses the magic that these scenes can give off. The effects that are used in this film are very ambitious, and because of this ambition it has aged poorly as time passes. Though these is heading towards late Hitchcock, he still has not lost his touch to create mystery and suspense.Robert Burks is a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock starting from Strangers on a Train and ending with Marnie (The only film between that he did not work in was Psycho). The relationship between Hitchcock and Burks are an example where both members are in tune with one another. Burks understands Hitchcock's vision, this is why the films they work together are very different from one another and each one has their own style. North By Northwest may be the biggest film that they both have worked on, second being To Catch A Thief. Burks has chosen very wide and huge shots of the environment that the action is taking place, which is one of the key factors that makes this film feel large and ambitious. The crop duster scene or the climax are the key moments where his photography shines. Personally, I much prefer Burks' work on Rear Window and Vertigo but North By Northwest is a force of its own that it cannot be dismissed.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who has worked on the most iconic of films delivering the most iconic of scores. North By Northwest's score is an example of that brilliant craft with an upbeat and tense composition that sticks with you throughout the movie. The score often builds up throughout and then the action and suspense occurs then it comes in full force. It adds on to the sense of desperation to survive which is something Roger Thornhill constantly has to go through.Cary Grant is the protagonist of this film and I'm just going to say that currently I am not a fan of him. I am not sure whether it's the roles he picks, or that I just haven't seen enough of his films. Grant comes off here as a hero or invincible even though he is meant to play a man who is very vulnerable and lacks the skills to survive in the face of danger. Grant constantly has an answer for everything and has a sarcastic joke to say with every response, but this may be more due to the writing than his acting abilities. Eva Marie Saint is another member Hitchcock's list of leading ladies but if I had to rank them, she isn't up there with Grace Kelly and Janet Leigh. Saint still does her role well though, able to project that sexuality that many actresses cannot do and still maintains to be just as equally witty and as Grant. James Mason was a treat to see, he brings this class in his role as the antagonist of the film. The accent and delivery of his lines make gives him a unique quality that other actors of it's time just lack.North By Northwest will stand the test of time as a classic but in a personal level it just didn't impact me the same way as Rear Window or Psycho had on me. I came into this film open minded with every time I watch it and it does get better with each viewing.",9,1,4,3 December 2013
Hugo," Scorsese's Love For Cinema
","Hugo is a family film directed by Martin Scorsese. Hugo is an odd film for Scorsese to do as most of his films are much more mature, dark, and at times violent. Though different from his acclaimed films, it's damn entertaining.I have seen a few of John Logan's screenplays, some are OK (The Last Samurai) and some are near perfect (Gladiator). Hugo would be at the same level as Gladiator for me. This film is adapted from Brian Selznick's novel entitled 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret'. This film is fun from start to finish, as it's an adventure film while at the same time a message saying that films from the past are important and in need to be preserved. The children may not care so much about the latter but just on the adventure alone makes this one hell of an experience. It's main focus is on Hugo but the times where it focuses on the other people from the train station, it's just as interesting. Being a children's film, sometimes the dialogue can be a little bit cheesy and it's present in this film but only minimally. The film's plot is easy to swallow and can be enjoyed by both children and adults.Like I said, this is an odd turn for Scorsese but he still delivers. Scorsese has created something magical, using a story that also relates to his passion for films. A certain flashback sequence on Hugo reminds me of the same love and passion that Scorsese put on the Hell's Angels production scenes from The Aviator. Scorsese has also opened my eyes on the beauty of the distant era of cinema and it's beginnings.The film is gorgeous from start to finish. Scorsese and Robert Richardson have captured the beauty of 1930s Paris and the train station that the film is set in. Richardson has created a magical, almost fantasy like image of Paris and definitely makes the film feel more like a pleasant dream. The beautiful imagery is supported with a wonderful use of visual effects, making the film feel more realistic but at the same time not losing that touch of magic and fantasy that makes the film so pretty. Richardson has, again, shot a period piece that brings out the beauty of an era that once was.Howard Shore has done it again with Hugo, created a wonderful score that aids in putting the audience in this fascinating world and era, similar to what he did for The Aviator and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings saga. His score here is more enlightening but without making it sound cliché or familiar.I love seeing films with child actors that do not bring down the quality of the film. Both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz gave strong performances that was at par with great actors like Ben Kingsley and Jude Law. I think both are going to have a very memorable career, so far Moretz is showing a lot of promise. Ben Kingsley as the toy maker was great and sweet, while Sacha Baron Cohen stole the scene when he comes on as his comedic delivery is fantastic. When he is on screen he is either doing something funny or showing vulnerability, which is very rare in his own films. Cohen has great chemistry with Emily Mortimer, who needed a little bit more screen time to make their relationships more empathetic but doing so may retract from the point of the film, nevertheless it's entertaining. Jude Law, Michael Stuhlbarg and Christopher Lee had minor roles but their presence makes the film all the more entertaining. Scorsese has a great cast that many other filmmakers would envy.I came into the film thinking it may be not hold my interest as family friendly films don't really impress me as it is sometimes clouded by it's own restrictions and would generally end up being only a guilty pleasure or a holiday tradition film for me. Hugo is something I could watch over and over again as it is a love letter to cinema.",9,3,5,24 July 2013
Apocalypse Now," Needs To Have The Right Mindset
","This history and production behind this film is almost just as spectacular as the film itself. Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic that tells the story of Captain Willard on a mission to terminate Col. Kurtz command as he has become rogue and conducting operations with the locals. This film does not focus on the exciting action part of the war but rather what the war does to a person. The film does have moments of epic destruction but it supports the point that Coppola is trying to make. To truly enjoy this film, you must come in with the right mindset or this film would be seen as a big disappointment.The film is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad titled Heart of Darkness and was written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius. Coppola and Milius has taken Conrad's story and placed it within the Vietnam War which I thought worked. Coppola and Milius has created a screenplay that gives us a look on the horrors of war whether it's on a grand scale, like the killing of civilians, or on a personal level, Willard in his hotel room. Willard is escorted to Kurtz by a boat crew who at the start seems like normal guys in the war, just having fun and doing what they are supposed to do, but as they go further and further down the river they start to lose themselves and become more primal. The writers have not only added a straightforward story of a mission but also the disintegration of one's super-ego and has been stripped down to just the id. When they have gone past the last outpost, where every soldier seems to have gone mad, they found Kurtz. This is the point where things become less easy to tolerate as I had to watch this film at least 4 times to at least get a grasp of the point. Is Kurtz more evil or insane than any of the other soldiers napalming villages? It's really interesting how Coppola and Milius tackled this and makes us think about morality and whether or not our own super-ego is really more wiser than our own instinct.The 1970's is a great decade for him, as all of his directorial efforts in that period were nominated for Best Picture and two of which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Apocalypse Now is definitely his most ambitious film as the first 3 quarters of the film just shows where most of his budget went. The napalm, ordered by Col. Kilgore, on that village was a fantastic scene and knowing that back then post production effects couldn't do something like that made the scene all the more impressive. Though this film has it's epic moments, it's the intimate scenes in the boat or at Kurtz's compound where I felt this film really shined. Too bad Coppola did not find the same acclaim in his future films, maybe except The Godfather Part 3.The film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro who also did The Last Emperor, and his efforts here is just as important as Coppola's contributions as he is responsible for making the scenes look spectacular. Storaro's best captured moments in the film were at the big time war sequences, and as the film progresses it becomes more darker and moody. On daytime scenes, the image gives off a sunrise or sunset kind of feel to it which I think worked for the film. I like the way Brando was captured, consumed by the darkness making it feel artful.Carmine Coppola is the composer for this film. The film's score sounds like something that came off either from A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, using some sort of synthesizer to manipulate the sound in order to create that tension in the track. I don't think it was that much of a standout but it does work. What did standout was the soundtrack, they come in full force. Moments like the helicopter scenes using Ride of the Valkyries or that scene on the boat where The Rolling Stone's 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction' was playing through Clean's radio. Coppola's score is more present as they go down the river and pop songs that were found in the first track were gone. Also this film is loud, this was one of the first films to ever have a 5.1 mix and the results are booming.The acting is on this film is great. I especially like the subtle things that are found on the boat ride that makes the scene just a little more realistic and gives a little more personality to the characters. Willard, for the most part, doesn't try to outshine anybody but rather just keeping it simple. There is a scene though in his hotel room where you can really feel the damage of Willard and it's one of the moments that really stand out in Sheen's acting. I'm not even sure he was acting because he was an alcoholic then. Brando didn't wow me like he did in The Godfather but he was poetic and artful in his acting. He was consumed in Darkness for the most of the film so most of his acting came from his facial expression. I preferred him here than he was in The Godfather. Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist was the one where I never really understood because it felt like his lines were improvised and was talking in code, but it was still somewhat relevant to the plot.This film is something that grew on me with multiple viewings. This is up there with my Coppola favorites and at par with The Conversation, which I think is his best work. This film is deep and doesn't try to wow you but rather have you thinking. Just try to make sure you watch this with the right mindset to truly enjoy this film.",10,0,1,15 July 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Another Great Film Under David O. Russell's Direction
","After The Fighter, Hollywood and the general public has restored their faith on David O. Russell and this allowed him to have more choices in his projects. Silver Linings Playbook is definitely a film he wanted to make, as he wrote the screenplay and the plot and premise is quite risky in comparison to his previous film, The Fighter.Silver Linings Playbook is written by David O. Russell. Russell mostly writes the screenplays of his films and when a director also writes the film, it also allows the director to have a connection to the script that the actors or anybody else in the production may not have. Russell has simply written a dramedy, if you look at the big picture but what makes it so unique and interesting is the fact that it touches on the topic of mental illness and explores beyond what has already been covered in mainstream film of mental illness.When I first watched this film, I thought the dialogue between characters and the personalities they project were hard to empathise and sympathise with but as with each viewing, and an increase awareness in mental illness during my degree, allowed me to realise that Russell has written a script that is so faithful to reality and that people who suffer mental illness have sometimes a complete different perception of oneself and his or her surroundings. The characters are very self-centered and only cater to themselves but this just adds on to the sense of reality with these characters allowing it to feel natural. The film explores the themes of mental illness, love, commitment, and relationships. The film at times also touches on the social stigma on mental illness.David O. Russell has proved to be one of the great directors in this decade with two films gaining critical acclaim, with his next film being much more ambitious than the previous two (American Hustle). Russell clearly wanted to make a dramedy but due to its subject matter, it makes the film feel fresh and stand out from other films in the same pile. I am so happy that Russell has taken a positive approach to this film as films touching mental illness, in most cases, is seen in a negative light and it isn't fair as many people who are 'diagnosed' with mental illness has lived a happy and successful life. Russell during the third act does dip into a cliché territory but with everything that has happened throughout the film it's nice to see something campy. Russell approaches all characters in the film with a mental illness, at times it may seem like it's a natural thing and that we do it too but modern medicine has used these little things as a criteria for diagnosis. This film may feel different and lose it's accessibility if it was handled by a different director.Masanobu Takayanagi is the cinematographer for this film. Takayanagi does a good job for this film, allowing the film to feel and look accessible which is essential in the film's uniqueness. Though David O. Russell has chosen a different DP for this film, it still has the same style as The Fighter; but without the television broadcast effect. The film is mostly shot hand-held allowing us to feel like we are standing or present near the characters allowing us to feel involved in the conversation and story. There are shots that I have noticed that Russell has used in The Fighter, though this is the second film I have seen from his it may be a trademark shot or scene that is common within his films.Danny Elfman is a hard working composer, working on a number of films in the past few years. Elfman doesn't have a huge impact in this film because like The Fighter, Russell loves to use soundtracks in particular moments to enhance the scene. I did enjoy the fact that the music choices for the climax scenes matches the emotions of the characters during the film. Elfman may not have a huge impact in the film or at least his score is not as noticeable but when it does come on it works so well that it uplifts us or it haves us in tears. The use of the piano in the defining moment between Pat and Tiffany at the end or the uplifting guitars in the running scenes.David O. Russell is an actor's director and is always able to bring out the best and unique performances from the actors in his films even if they are not leads. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper felt natural together and the chemistry was great. Both leads portray characters with mental illness was believable but at the same time, with Russell's direction, allowing to be accessible. De Niro, Weaver, and Tucker are so great. When they have their moments, it's converts you to believing that they are great actors, or in De Niro's case seeing that he still has it. It was also nice to see Julia Stiles in films as it has been a while for me that I have seen her.Russell has made an excellent film to put in his resume and I think this film will definitely will stand the test of time. It is filled with great performances, supported by the awards that the film has won, and it has great direction from Russell. If it didn't have stiff competition with the ambitious films of 2012 then this may be the best film of that year.",9,1,3,6 December 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not a film that would appeal to everyone but definitely worth a watch
","Spoilers will be present.....The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is David Fincher's latest film. The Millennium trilogy was only recently made in Sweden and was, from what I have heard, was decent to good. Now this Hollywood remake comes out only a short time later, and does it succeed? My answer is, for the most part, yes.The driving plot of this film is the mystery of Harriet. I found that aspect of the plot extremely engaging. I wish that I have not read the book before I have seen this film, as the suspense and closely identifying the conclusion of Harriet became predictable. Fincher and Zaillian successfully keeps our attention and haves us figuring out on our own who may have killed her, so it was not their efforts that made me find the story predictable, and I blame myself for it. My pre-knowledge of the source material does not affect the score of this review. The disappointing aspect of the film's plot was the events after solving the mystery, it is though faithful to the book in exploring Lisbeth's feelings for Mikael and the repair of the broken reputation of Millennium and Mikael, but it doesn't hold up for me as the excitement and wonder of the Harriet's story really drove the film forward and was heavily focused, I even forgot at a point there was a problem outside the Vanger island/village. There are differences of the book and the film, in particular the Harriet resolution and it did bother me a little bit. I feel that Zallian should have stuck similarly to the novel.When I first heard about the remake, I was annoyed but when I saw that David Fincher was directing it, I was a little less worried. Fincher have done it again, he has made a film that can entertain the audience and grips us the whole way through. The tone of the film makes me think back of his previous films like Alien 3 and Se7en, where the themes are dark and gloomy. Fincher feels like he understands Larsson's novel and the themes that fills it's pages. Just straight from the opening title sequence, it felt dark and twisted that you may feel a slight shiver or fear from it. The first half of the film involving Lisbeth and her guardian involves with themes of power, control and helplessness but Fincher cleverly uses it as a form of getting the audience to understand the abuse and powerlessness that comes with rape and sexual violence. This makes the resolution of the mystery of Harriet even more repulsive and twisted.Fincher's direction captured the film's tone but that is also supported by the photography of Jeff Cronenweth. They both seem to have agreed to wash out a lot of the colour to give off a feeling of darkness and despair. Cronenweth captures this atmosphere of death that makes me feel uncomfortable, not that he did his job poorly but rather the feeling unpleasantness that I personally feel when I watch it. He captures key moments like the rape scenes in a way that appropriately induces a feeling of disgust in the rapist's action and yet at the same time captures the feeling of power and control that the antagonist is then feeling.The film's score was not something I can deeply say I would remember later on but it does fit well with the mood that Fincher is trying to create. The opening title sequence though was played with a twist on the song 'Immigrant Song' and it felt incredible haunting when paired with the eerie imagery displayed.I have recently seen the Swedish version of this film and so I had a predetermined idea of the look and feel of the characters. Casting both Craig and Mara was great, they both work well. As both protagonist play off each other, you do feel that there is a relationship between each other that is being built either professionally and personally. Mara seems to be dedicated to her role and has from time to time throughout the film reminded me a lot of Noomi Rapace's performance in the Swedish edition. The role played by Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd should have been casted by someone that is less well known, as soon he came on screen and has been identified by Henrik, I immediately knew he was going to be an important piece of Harriet's mystery. This does not mean that SkarsgÃ¥rd's performance was flawed but rather an issue of miscasting.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo will be a film that I may not watch for a while due to the themes that I may find uncomfortable but will definitely someday, if in the mood, will immerse myself again as it is an excellently crafted mystery drama with wonderful performances and faithful direction.",10,3,8,30 June 2013
Django Unchained," Slightly Flawed But It's Strong Enough To Be Not Missed
","Finally, Tarantino has created a film that he has been paying homage to for so many years. Django Unchained is Tarantino's 7th film and still hasn't lost his touch. Sadly Django Unchained is not perfect, as it has problems.Django Unchained follows the same approach that was applied to Kill Bill, driven by a clear end goal and uses a linear approach in telling it's story, despite a few flashbacks. Though similar, it is a major improvement from Kill Bill as Tarantino keeps our attention with it's quirky characters. Characters in this film are definitely a much needed depth, with a richer backstory, in comparison to his previous films. The film is definitely a big film, with a story that spans on long periods of time and creating personal growth for the protagonist. It would have been more interesting, if Django Unchained explores more of his personal and physical journey of becoming a bounty hunter. The film's dialogue is quite fun and it plays around with the dialogue found in classic Westerns. I did enjoy the fact that Tarantino has written two characters that clash in personality, Schultz and Candie, as their conversations with one another especially towards the end was thrilling to watch. Great dialogue is being written for Schultz and Candie as they represent the most over the top characters in the film, aside from Samuel L. Jackson's character.Django Unchained tackles the genre that Tarantino seems to be in love with the most, and it seems like this is a film he has always wanted to tell but because this is a Tarantino film, it doesn't stay on course with the traditional Westerns by exploiting a topic that is barely touched on in the genre or at least not commonplace within the mainstream films, slavery. This does make the film a bit controversial as not everyone can be comfortable with the topic and even to the point of being offended. Both Inglourious Basterds and this film, touch on history but they don't ever become a social commentary or it never places the situation on trial, rather it is just used as a backdrop. Tarantino avoids having his characters become a representation of the cultures within that era. If you want to watch a film that touches on these themes with depth and fueled by a message, then watch Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, but if you want to see a fun film then watch Django Unchained. This film in a way follows Kill Bill's approach in it's story, with a clear end goal, but this film balances the style and substance much better with it being consisted throughout the entire film. Django Unchained strays away from Tarantino's common use of the non-linear narrative and leans on to the conventional 3 act approach but keeping it feeling fresh due to his style. There are 2 scenes that were done so well that they deserve a mention, these scenes are the KKK segment and the Dining Room scene with the principal characters.Robert Richardson returns to work with Tarantino and their collaboration always seems to give off positive results and this is mainly due to the understanding of each other's vision. Both have created a look that is reminiscent of the classic Westerns, using a warm palette to create the atmosphere and softer shots, in order to have the audience feel immersed to the era. The film also contains the quick zooms and close ups that were found in the films that this is paying homage to. With each subsequent film, Tarantino's budget and trust from the studios seem to rise which allows him to be ambitious in his work using multiple locations to film and build up faithful and detailed production sets. As the characters in this film have much more depth than Tarantino's previous film, the photography was able to convey that depth to these characters which then sells the character's motivations.Similarly to his previous film, Tarantino has taken a soundtrack approach rather than hiring a composer to create an original score for the film. The tracks he chose though are score driven and again chooses the tracks that are either from Morricone or at least similar. That does allow the film to feel like a Leone film at times. Tarantino interestingly enough has used Hip-Hop/Rap music on certain moments but it comes off more as humorous, which allows the audience to not take the film too seriously and maintaining that fun upbeat tone.Django Unchained may not be an ensemble film like Inglourious Basterds but this is due to the story being a bit more grounded and personal. Jamie Foxx as Django was a decent choice but he didn't really create something astonishing here with the character or maybe he was severely overshadowed by the acting performances from Waltz and DiCaprio. This is definitely the best that I have seen from Kerry Washington but it doesn't seem to be enough for me to highly appreciate it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio on the other hand was a stand out in this film delivering performances that will always be remembered when people look back at their filmography. Waltz was able to come off as charming which makes him so likable and he delivers his lines with amazing grace. DiCaprio creates this menacing character but at the same time able to give off a sense that he is a phony and a bit of a try hard. Samuel L Jackson was great in this, with an introduction to a character that will leave you surprised on how unlikable this person is.Django Unchained is a fun Western film that I have been waiting for him to make since he started his film career. It contains amazing performances and great direction from Quentin Tarantino. Yes, Django Unchained could have been better but it has enough great moments for this to be in the stronger side in the director's filmography.",7,1,5,15 January 2014
Drive," One Of The Best Contemporary Films
","I heard a lot about this film either being really great or boring as hell. After watching this, I definitely belong to the former camp. Drive is not an action film but rather it is a stylish executed drama that contains intense action. So if anybody who has been sucked in by the title, poster and trailer thinking that it's a thriller action film; change your perception of the film before going in because it may ruin your experience with this film.Drive's screenplay was written by Hossein Amini and was based off the book by James Sallis. Amini's screenplay is not exactly the most unique piece of work in Hollywood at the moment but he was working with such a great story and a character that people can immediately love regardless of his personal qualities. I'll start with the film's plot; the plot definitely feels like a thriller and if it was written or directed by someone else then it would definitely feel generic and bland. The film has it's moments that stick with you and if watched enough become iconic. It's not the plot that makes me want to revisit this film but rather the portrait that is being shown of the protagonist. Straight from the start we feel detached with the character as he doesn't show much and is closed off with his emotions, until he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan). Immediately from the start, I have this attachment to this character as I want to be him. Ryan Gosling's character is so cool and the moments when he does show a side of him that we didn't see in the first half of the film, it doesn't push me away but rather make us admire him much more. A lot of the audience may be annoyed with this film as it takes it's time to show the main complication of the film as the first half of the film establishes the character and his relationship with Irene and his career, both night and day. I felt that this approach was very effective as it allowed me to care about his problems and his decisions later on the film.The film was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn who has made notable films before Drive, Bronson and Pusher, but I have yet to see those films as this is my first experience of his work. This film definitely grabbed a hold on me from the minute it started and I give most of the credit to Refn's direction towards this film. Refn has definitely made an action film that was stylish and explored more of the characters and story rather than creating adrenaline fueled set pieces that are commonly found in mainstream action flicks. The film's action may not be as wow or extraordinary as The Transporter or the Fast & Furious series but instead Refn approaches it in a much more intimate level. Without Refn's vision, the film then loses it's unique and stylish touch.The film's cinematography is handled by Newton Thomas Sigel who is more commonly known as the director of photography for Bryan Singer's films. Sigel definitely did fantastic work here with shots that look beautiful, in particular night scenes and the ending of the film, and shots that are patient and allows us to take in the image even if there is nothing much happening on screen. The beautiful moments of the film are the moments when the lighting are intimate or hyper-realistic, these moments are the parts that I adore most about the film's photography and makes me want to watch it again just for those scenes alone.The film's musical component is very 80's driven, but the songs and the score are not from the era but rather taken major influences from it. The soundtrack of this film is the highlight and feels sweet and catchy. The songs that play throughout the film are definitely by indie bands or artists which fits with the film. The songs are synthesizer driven which I think is a great choice and adds on to the unique style that the film show off. Cliff Martinez does the score for this film, though his work doesn't outshine the soundtrack choices, it does follow the style of these songs and make it his own therefore it doesn't feel out of place when it comes on.The film's cast is great even if their parts aren't large. Though the film has a size of a cast, the film doesn't shift it's focus from Gosling's character which is very center focused on him during the first half, exploring the relationship between him and Irene. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was great as it didn't feel too dramatic and repetitive. When they first converse with each other and build upon that during the next few scenes, feel like a relationship that must be established. There was an elevator scene between the two which in my opinion is their best scene together. The supporting cast of Perlman, Brooks and Cranston was great. They brought their all to the roles, Brooks in particular, and their hard work paid off.Drive has an excellent cast, shot beautifully, amazing synthetic driven score, and a story that was delivered with style and flourish; making this one of the best contemporary films I have ever seen. Cannot wait for me to watch it again.",10,2,5,9 October 2013
The Hurt Locker," Subjective, Not Objective.
","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proved herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a 'family' back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out.",9,0,1,3 July 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Style Over Substance
","Kill Bill is an epic film that is split into two volumes, though one story, the two volumes cannot be more different in it's execution. Kill Bill, when I first watched it as a whole, was definitely entertaining but as time went on I have watched Tarantino's films over and over again, I started to lose that feeling that I had with this film and changed my perception of it. Kill Bill may be epic but it lacks something that keeps it from being his best work.Kill Bill: Volume 1 is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is simply a revenge-action story. This approach is not a problem for me because it allows me to digest it simply and avoid ambiguity in it's storytelling. Jackie Brown was an example of Tarantino taking a conventional 3 act structure and making it his own. Kill Bill: Vol 1 follows that approach but making it much more epic and somewhat adventurous. The thing about Tarantino's writing here is that he has written something that is much more mainstream friendly than compared to his previous work, which in a way is great because I think that's what he really wants, is to exploit these dying genres and styles to his films for the mainstream audience. Tarantino has written a protagonist that we know very little about, yet we enjoy seeing her kick-ass and reaching closer to her goal. The film is full of dialogue, though not as punchy and indulgent as his previous films as the dialogue here is more reliant on it's attitude and delivery. The most enjoyable part of the film is truly the last half of the film where she is up against O-Ren Ishii, and honestly it is so interesting to see these two battle it out because of all the backstory and hype that is being given to us of O-Ren Ishii, it makes her seem like such a challenging opponent.This is the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino and between the two volumes, I can definitely say that this first volume is much more fun and entertaining to watch. The reason this film is so appealing is that it is enforced with such style mainly influenced by the Asian cinema, particularly in the 70-80s. I don't mind that the film is stylish but it can only do so much. I am more disappointed with the film's screenplay rather than Tarantino's vision and direction. Kill Bill is the mark for Tarantino, when he started paying homages to his personal attachments in films, and he continues to do so in his latter films. The first three of his films has this technique in delaying action and giving us more of the characters in their most normal moments, but Kill Bill strays away from that by upping the violence and action almost to the point unbelievability. Also, the audience must lower their rational thinking when watching this as the film doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a reason why this is viewed over and over again by it's fans.Kill Bill is also the start of Robert Richardson's collaboration with Tarantino as his cinematographer. Richardson has worked on prestigious films for most of his career, and worked with prestigious directors like Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, and Rob Reiner. Out of all of those directors, I think working with Tarantino allows him to experiment more with the camera and create something more unique. Kill Bill may not look like a unique film as the way it looks feels more like something you have seen before and that is the response that it's supposed to get from us. Kill Bill's photography pays tribute to the shots found on Sergio Leone's films, or the clichés that are found in Asian action films. Kill Bill's image looks colorful and at times being so saturated it loses the sense of naturalism.Kill Bill is also the start of Tarantino relying on a film score in driving the musical side of the film. His previous films were full of soundtracks that go exquisitely well with the scene, it's the same outcome here but just replacing it with a score from RZA. The score for this film isn't cutting edge or the best I have heard from a Tarantino film but it is stylish enough that it goes with the director's vision. There are spots in the film where you can hear musical segments either made by Ennio Morricone or inspired by it.This film is primarily driven by Uma Thurman's performance as The Bride and she does a great job, though this isn't my favorite role from her. Thurman has to play this character who is clearly emotionally and physically traumatized by Bill's actions but at the same time project a shade of a bad-ass assassin who is fueled by anger. I don't think anybody else could have accomplished this role physically. As the film doesn't take it's self seriously, it does hold Thurman back from showing her range in acting. Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii was great; she was fun, exciting, dangerous, and bitchin'. Liu stand out scene was when she was at the table with a group of Japanese gang leaders, as she managed to come off as frightening but at the same time give off a comedic under tone in her acting. The bulk of the villains are not seen until the second volume, so for the most part it pretty much covers both of these actresses.Kill Bill is definitely an example of style over substance but it does well enough with the former that it doesn't lead off as such a terrible movie. Do I wish the script was better, yeah maybe it needed a bit more, but that isn't enough for me to dislike it. Give it a try but I suggest lowering one's expectations and rationality before heading in.",6,1,2,8 January 2014
Reservoir Dogs," Despite It's Slick Style And Unique Take, It Leaves You Underwhelmed
","Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from Quentin Tarantino and I can definitely say that he is definitely a dime a dozen. Tarantino was bold with making his debut film so unique from the it's competitors at the time.Reservoir Dogs is written by Tarantino and Roger Avary contributing some dialogue for the film. What Tarantino has written is a twist of a staple story in the crime genre, where the events of the actual robbery is not seen but rather shine a light the events after the robbery. Tarantino could have kept it with that road but instead the film flips back and forth between origin/specific robbery stories and the post-robbery events. The film is driven by dialogue, which is now considered a principle in his films, and the dialogue is definitely different from crime films that preceded this film. Instead of physical actions and deep insight of the character's emotional core, characters are instead shaped by Tarantino's dialogue with characters speaking about themselves or others which in turn shapes our perception of these characters, which I think is important in order to view the plot objectively and not gain a deep attachment to these characters. The issues I had with his script is the underwhelming origin stories that doesn't really show off the wildness and absurdity that is found with many of his future films. The screenplay also felt a little held back on pushing the boundaries of the dialogue when compared to his succeeding films. The dialogue also from time to time jump from being a natural and organic conversation, regardless if they are in a crisis situation, to basic plot driving dialogue.Quentin Tarantino is an amazing director and even though all of his films are not always in excellent condition, though his worst are miles better than most films it competes with, he still brings a sense of style that defines the film and it's fresh unique take allows us to be curious on what could come on the next scene. Reservoir Dogs is his first film which is the main reason why this film felt a bit rushed or amateurish, not in a bad way but rather in an inexperienced way. The film definitely is limited by a budget and that in a way restricted Tarantino, as he seems to show more crazy and fun sequences when he has the budget for it. The film for the most part keeps me interested with it's great pace and it's characters play with his dialogue, though Mr Orange's backstory did feel tiresome and did feel like walking through a mountain after the swift two thirds of the film. The film's non-linear approach does kind of play off the style that Kubrick applied for The Killing.Andrzej Sekula is the cinematographer for this film and he returns again in Tarantino's sophomore film. Sekula and Tarantino felt like they were held back in this film due to the budget therefore the film felt like it has this rushed hand held style that a lot of the moments of the film contains but this film does show hints of the photography style that Tarantino employs in his future films, with crooked angles, long takes and long shots of dialogue-full moments allowing the film to feel like a play, which is obvious in this film due to it's budget and boxed story.This film doesn't include a score and this does in a way allow the film to suffer with moments that felt overstretched and needed that cinematic flair. Pulp Fiction also has these features but it makes up for it by having a sufficient amount of musical nuggets throughout the film that keep it from being stale. Though the musical moments that do cameo in this film are top notch with moments that actually feel more gruesome and horrific than what it already is.Reservoir Dogs' cast is confined to 10 people and they are given the majority of the screen time, and it most cases it is shared. The actors do play off well with each other and along with the strong dialogue it makes the film entertaining. The standout actors in this film is Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, when they are bantering they all just bring the intensity that the scene required and are able to stay strong and fresh in long takes that includes monologues and subtle physical acting. Tim Roth was a bit of a distraction though, his American accent and the slight over the top acting did have me cringing.Tarantino's debut does bring something unique and fresh to the crime genre but with an underwhelming screenplay and the inexperience and budget constriction does bring the film down.",7,0,0,6 January 2014
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction Is A Triumph In Contemporary Cinema
","Pulp Fiction is the film that put Tarantino on the map, and this film is regarded as many as his magnum opus. At first, I didn't agree to this acclaim and it did had me confused a bit due to it's lack of driving plot and seriousness that I expect from crime films. After subsequent viewings, I understood that I came into this with the wrong mindset and that I did not appreciate the boldness that Tarantino demonstrated with this film. Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade.The film is written by Quentin Tarantino and his screenplay here is like a collection of his best stories sewed together. The highlight of this film is his use of pop culture, hilarious, and naturalistic dialogue. In Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's dialogue in that film did contain that style that is found here but it does from time to time fall unto the conventional dialogue that is found many crime films but in Pulp Fiction, the lack of plot allows him to focus on it's characters and therefore write dialogue that is not boxed in by the story. Though the film is not tied down by it's story, it does include it to have a conclusion of sorts in the end of each segment. The characters in the film are one of the main reasons that this film is enjoyable because they are all so unique and different from one another and they never feel like they are common archetypes, and one of the main reasons are the delivery of the actors and the smart quirky dialogue from Tarantino.Quentin Tarantino's sophomore film is a major improvement over his previous film, in terms of style, dialogue, and photography. Tarantino was able to maintain the tone of dark humor, and the grit of a crime/gangster film. Without the humor, I think may be suffered by characters just having a regular conversation just before a very brief burst of action. One of the main points that made this film appealing is the jumbling of the storyline, and having each storyline having some sort of throwback to the other. Pulp Fiction is an execution of style but not sacrificing an inch of substance.Andrzej Sekula comes back to handle the photography of this film, and it is an improvement over the previous film that felt rushed and amateurish. Sekula and Tarantino have taken the things that worked on Reservoir Dogs and improved upon it here. Pulp Fiction contains multiple shots that felt precisely placed and takes away the hand held style that was found on the previous film, except for heated moments in the film. The film contains long takes of the actors just spitting out his dialogue and delaying the action of the film, which at times is not as fun as the moments that precedes it, and it also allows the camera to explore the environment these characters are confined in.Pulp Fiction lacks the musical score that most films succumb to and is primarily a soundtrack driven film, similar to the first film. The film contains excellent songs from multiple decades, and these tracks at most times defines the scene. These tracks are now much more abundant here in comparison to his previous film therefore the film doesn't feel quiet and rarely contains a moment that felt slow or didn't feel cinematic.Pulp Fiction contains a stellar cast with standouts that include Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis. When these actors come on screen, they bring their A game. The chemistry between John Travolta and Samuel Jackson or Uma Thurman is fun to watch and did allow me to get sucked in with their words and their relationship. These actors gave these parts with seriousness to a story that is ridiculous, that it allows the film to attain that dark humor that made this film so appealing. The actors I did not mention were not as much of a standout as the other actors but they do their part well enough that none of them felt boring or underwhelming.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece that contains hilarious dialogue, outrageous story lines, precise photography, stellar soundtrack, and great acting. The film is a milestone in cinema history and has been looked upon to in future films as inspiration. Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade.",10,0,2,7 January 2014
In Time," An Intriguing Idea Held Back By Niccol's Direction & Lack Of Chemistry
","In Time, a film set in the near future where the currency has been replaced with time. I didn't expect much from this film as seeing the posters with the leading actors didn't aspire much confidence. After watching the film, elements of the film did surprise me but some of it was disappointing as expected.Andrew Niccol is a director who also writes his films. His films are at times a hit or miss but most of them are creative and imaginative, which is something I get excited for when I come into his films. What held my interest in this film is the concept of the currency of time and how it has divided the world to the rich and the poor. This idea, to me at least, is brilliant as it allows Niccol to create tension as time becomes more precious than ever. The first half an hour of the film, dealing with the life of the common man in the ghetto is so fascinating that if the film stuck with this direction then I would have appreciated the film much more. There is a particular scene involving Timberlake and Wilde which was one of the strongest moments of this film, the tension was high and it put me on the edge of my seat hoping. There is a storyline in this film about Will Salas' father and it just felt a little too forced and unnecessary.Niccol's direction is an area where he has let me down. Niccol has changed the tone and direction of the film within 30 minutes of the film. It starts of as a day in the life of the common people using Timberlake's character as the example, making the film feel like a survival film with the villain being time. The film then changes it's direction to a Bonnie and Clyde mixed with a Robin Hood agenda, which is also interesting but suited for a sequel or a separate film of it's own. Also the climax is very similar to a moment that happened earlier in the film but the earlier sequence was executed with more flourish than the ending which was very disappointing. If Niccol just stuck with the tone of the first half hour then this would be much more appreciated from me.I'm not sure if the budget has set the picture back but I felt the visuals was lacking, in the rich time zone in particular. This would have been a visually spectacular film, even the ghetto doesn't look very frightening. In Time has a setting that is very similar to a film like The Hunger Games, and yet Gary Ross was able to vision a beautiful and advanced city.Oh Roger Deakins, why couldn't you make this film look spectacular. Deakins has done the cinematography of many films that I love but yet here, it feels like he's not even trying. Not sure if Niccol's vision held Deakins back but this film feels so generic and bland that it brings the film down. Dialogue driven scenes where characters are just inside a small room, Deakins at least get some great shots like for example when Timberlake and Bomer were sitting alone in a room with the light coming in from the window, sharing each other's lives.Craig Armstrong's score was blended in within the scenes and doesn't become a force of it's own. As I watched the film, I didn't notice a lot of his score as I was too fascinated with the concept of the film and the life of the citizens in the ghetto.The acting in this film is sub par and some casting choices were poor. Timberlake is the main example of poor casting as I felt he is too attractive and distracting. The chemistry between Timberlake and Seyfried was fine but Seyfried, being the better actor, shows more of her skills than her partner. When the partner in crime scenes started to roll, their chemistry became a little better. The supporting cast was also good in their roles, in particular Murphy and Kartheriser. Murphy can play a decent villain but the film's script, being filled with one-liners, makes him seem a little corny at times. Kartheiser is a great actor, I particularly enjoy his work in Mad Men and he pretty much plays almost the same person here. His acting feels classy and smooth, which makes his role entertaining to watch. Olivia Wilde and Timberlake had decent chemistry but I think it would have been a little more effective if they replaced Timberlake with a stronger emotional core.The premise of the film is exciting and has ambition to become a sci-fi masterpiece but it is held back by Niccol's jagged direction, boring production design, and sub par chemistry between the leads. It is still worth a watch for the idea alone as it is a fresh take on the sci-fi genre and also the film's setting feels more relatable to the current conditions of our economy.",6,0,0,26 July 2013
Three Colors: Blue," Wonderful and Powerful
","Review In A Nutshell:Blue tells the tale of a woman who is trying to cope with a recent car accident that involved the death of her husband and child.Blue is one of those films where one couldn't predict the ending, as there wasn't a measurable goal established during the first or second act of the film and the director was aiming for a sense of realism when shaping the lead protagonist, therefore the character would not be following the traditional path of absolution and instead making one that is tailored for the character. I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.The film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.I cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots. The director is manipulating how much of the character we see, there are times where the film lets us in and at times we only see partially or are too far away from the character.The film's score was a definitely one of the film's highlights as the score creates this sense of impact during particular moments in the film, accurately representing how she feels at that given moment. The film was clever enough to have the film's protagonist be aware of the music, as the music seems to play as a reminder of the event and at the same time a sense of inspiration in how his husband's magnum opus composition should turn out. Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.The film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.Blue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film.",9,0,0,11 June 2014
The Godfather: Part III," Definitely Belongs With The Other Coppola Masterpieces
","The third and final film of Coppola's Godfather series ends with a bang. It holds up really strong within the trilogy and I feel currently is underrated. Before seeing this film I thought this film wouldn't hold up as everybody seems to say that The Godfather Part III is horrible or lackluster. I completely disagree as I feel this film is incredibly strong. Yes the film doesn't have that feeling of a period film because it isn't. It's more contemporary and I think it's a great way of seeing these characters in a new era.The point of the film is to show that Michael is trying to become a better person and trying to make his business legitimate leaving the ways of corruption and murder behind. But just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in; I just couldn't resist. The reason the old film felt a bit lackluster for me is that there are too many new characters introduced and those characters aren't as interesting as the ones in this film. The characters in this film do feel new but most are just older versions of themselves from the first film or second film. The main focus, even though there are other things going on like romance and revenge, is Michael looking for redemption as he has regretted everything that he has done. There is a lot of reflecting of the past in this film, like about Fredo or what Vincent and Mary's discussion about their fathers or when Kay and Michael was in Sicily. These moments were enjoyable. In comparison to the second film, I preferred this one as I found it to be more entertaining to follow.Coppola returning for a third film is risky as for years people have seen Michael Corleone as a horrible man. So the decision of restoring his image to the public and family is very risky but I think it paid off as I think it gives the saga a better closing. The film goes back to the strengths of the first one and keeping it linear. Coppola did a great job in concluding the saga and will be regarded, at least by me, as a classic.Gordon Willis did the photography for the Godfather trilogy but since this film is set in a more contemporary era then that style that was found in previous films is now gone. The film is still shot well with moments that are beautiful, in particular Sicily, but this really is more about the characters rather than capturing something unique and daring. The film's photography definitely isn't as strong as the original but it's appropriate to the film's setting and story.Instead of Nino Rota being the composer of the film, it's now Carmine Coppola. Carmine has worked on the first two of the Godfather films but his role was minor. Nino Rota died a few years after the second Godfather film, but his work is still found in this film. I felt that Carmine Coppola did not deliver that same level as Nino Rota did as it was a little underwhelming and never creates a sense of presence but his score does fit well with the film and does his best to fill in Rota's shoes.Acting again like the previous films is top notch. Another brilliant performance from Al Pacino showing off vulnerability that was rarely shown in previous films. Andy Garcia felt like a reminder of James Caan's Sonny but making it his own and adding a more unique personality to it. It was great to see Eli Wallach in films, as the films I have seen him in were always vicious, here he is a little more soft but still retains that viciousness in a subtle way. Keaton and Shire were great in playing stronger women in a time where Michael is vulnerable. Sofia Coppola was not spectacular but she did her part fine, chemistry between her and Garcia wasn't at the level of Pacino and Keaton but passable. Good thing that she chose to be a director rather than an actress.Great ending to the trilogy supported by a strong script, great direction, decent photography and score and fantastic performances. It is definitely along with Coppola's finest work and should not be dismissed.",9,0,1,11 July 2013
Psycho," A Film That Shaped Modern Thrillers
","Major Spoilers Below....'We all go a little mad sometimes.' Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a suspense, thriller film that is still effective today. I have not seen a lot of Hitchcock's films and the ones I have seen are the most known; Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest and now Psycho. This film has become such an icon in horror and thriller films that it becomes so hard for a person in my generation to come in this film fresh and be ignorant. This film is very effective as the story requires the audience to not have an idea of what is coming next.As I said before, I came into this knowing all the iconic scenes but luckily I did not know about the main twist at the end of the film. This film was based on a novel by Robert Bloch but developed to the screen by Joseph Stefano. I have not watched any other works by Joseph Stefano and I have not read Bloch's novel but yet due to popular culture the film kind of takes the fun out of watching this film. Though stripped off of it's suspense at times but the film's story story was still entertaining due to its characters. I admire the fact that the film decides to take an unexpected turn and switch the focus on Norman Bates rather than Marion Crane. I find Norman an interesting figure and is something of a mystery. I do tend to give a more positive rating to films that dives into human psychology, which is the reason I liked films like Identity. Lila Crane is a great substitute of a strong female character and doesn't sacrifice the presence of women, something that is lacking in this film in my opinion. The film overall is great and the character Norman Bates is something that have influenced future films.Alfred HItchcock has been labelled as the master of suspense. Though I haven't seen all of his films but I felt Psycho is one of the films that solidified his reputation. To me, this film ties up there with Hitchcock's other film Vertigo. The film still does feel like a product of its time and may feel a little date in its effects, like when a certain someone falls down the stairs, but I watched this with that mindset and not allowing its dated flaws to ruin my judgement of the film. Psycho is still something that should be watched by the current generation and, mystery and suspense fans.John L. Russell is the film's cinematographer and in this film he ensures that everything does, every angle and every camera movement, supports in creating tension and suspense. The camera, a lot of the time, follows the characters ensuring that our focus stays on them. Shadows are important in shaping the tone and supports the characters' personalities and intentions. Some of these scenes are so iconic in its cinematography that it has attributed to the film's influence. Hitchcock may have decided to have this film in black and white because it is much cheaper to photograph it that way but I think this style is also something that he desired to avoid that feeling of a set.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who have worked on the most acclaimed films; Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and North By Northwest but I think this is his most iconic as it has been used and talked about by either critics or the general public. The film's tense moments are accompanied by harsh strings that shocks you as it screeches. Without Herrmann's score then the film would not give that same effect as it would with it.The most crucial actor that must be chosen perfectly is the role of Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has embodied the role of this damaged man so convincingly that it is horrifying to even think it. Janet Leigh was terrific, her acting did not outshine anyone but certain moments in the film like the suspicious police officer, shows more to her than a pretty face. Martin Balsam as the private detective was one of the most enjoyable ones in this film. I did not expect much from him because the last film I have seen him in is Breakfast at Tiffany's and he did not really do much there.Solid cast, beautiful black and white cinematography, legendary score, and great direction has earned this film a classic status and will remain that way until the end of cinema. I adore the psychological aspect of this film and the choice of black and white photography. This film has shaped modern thrillers and will continue to do so.",10,1,2,5 July 2013
Rosemary's Baby," Not Perfect In It's Screenplay But So Much Of It Is Done Right That It Shouldn't Be Missed
","Rosemary's Baby wasn't the film that introduced me to the works of Roman Polanski but rather it was Chinatown. So I came into this with very high hopes and thinking it may even top the previous film I have watched, due to the hype and the intriguing subject matter. After watching it twice already, I can clearly say that Rosemary's Baby isn't perfect but it has a lot to offer that proves that it cannot be missed.Rosemary's Baby was based off the novel by Ira Levin and was adapted to the screen by Roman Polanski. I haven't read the novel so I cannot say whether or not the film drives away from the source material but what Polanski has given us here is quite interesting with only minor trips that prevent this from being a perfect film. The film mainly follows through Rosemary's experience during her pregnancy and as she gets closer to the end, she also gets closer to the truth. As much as I enjoyed seeing this concept being explored, it was dragged down by the lack of incentive to keep us emotionally engaged throughout, instead all that was bottled up for the second half of the film once the tension started to build. This made the first half felt a little stretched out and at times feeling unnecessary. Polanski cleverly avoids giving any confirmation of our suspicions until the last few minutes of the film as throughout the film we follow Rosemary alone, along with her paranoia and stress, and never gives us any moment of peace from it.Rosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's fifth film. Polanski creates his first hour of the film to feel like a play, with characters just talking to one another in a confined space and allowing the actors to completely use their surroundings in order to gain a natural performance. The last hour of the film is where things start to pick up and the horrors of the situation emerge and have us feel stressed for Rosemary. Though I thought highly in Polanski's efforts in creating the first half of the film, regardless I felt that it was quite slow and lacked a bit of a visual or mental incentive to keep us completely invested. It becomes much more enjoyable in subsequent viewings when we already know what happens to Rosemary and understand what every character's motives were.The cinematography of the film was handled by William A. Fraker, who later on in his career will be nominated awards for his work but for Rosemary's Baby it was under-appreciated. Which I found understandable because this film did truly feel take an amateurish style of photography, with shots only showing what it needs to show you in order to move film along. Fraker for the most part has his camera constantly moving, it is not so obvious as it only really moves because the actors are moving or are doing some action and the audience needs to see it in order for us to gain something from it. As we get closer to the end, Polanski and Fraker allows us to get closer and closer to Rosemary emotionally supported with tighter close ups and using the camera as a shadow following her wherever she goes.Krzysztof Komeda is the film's composer and what he has created is hauntingly beautiful. Komeda's score rarely is in display as the film uses silence to create tension at the start and allows the dialogue more to be in display and not have us be too distracted from the actors. The lullaby chant at the beginning of the film is one of the most frightening things I have heard as it has this undertone of evil under it, but if it is just heard as the lullaby alone without the instrumental or Fraker's photography it would just sound like a mother singing to her child with no dark undertone. I wish that the film did contain more of his score as it was truly well crafted but I guess it would have interfered with Polanski's vision.The film's actors truly have to work their asses off for this film, as it demands so much from them, Rosemary in particular. Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse was so great as she portrays this character who is suffering such elevated stress and who feels alone and lonely during her pregnancy even when there are people around her. Farrow makes us feel like we're the only one who is there for her. John Cassavetes was great as Guy Woodhouse. Cassavetes was able to play a man who doesn't come off at all as unlikable, even if certain events and motives may seem to fracture his character. Ruth Gordon has impressed me on a little film called Harold and Maude, and I think for Rosemary's Baby she is playing a less complex and interesting character, Minnie Castevet. Nevertheless, Gordon doesn't disappoint here with her character rambling on and on, never seeming to give Rosemary or Guy a window of opportunity to even react. Though probably faithful to the novel, I felt that her character needed a bit more for me to truly enjoy watching the character.Rosemary's Baby may not be a perfect film in my eyes but it gets so many things right that I can't help but go back to this when I feel like watching a film that can terrify me and keep me engaged with the technical aspects of the film. The acting is, for the most part, a joy to watch and the film contains patient and subtle cinematography. Polanski has made something wonderful that should at least be given a try even if the subject matter may be too dark for some.",8,1,2,26 January 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," One Of The Greatest In It's Genre
","At one point in everyone's life, they are able to show some sort of soft spot for films like these. When Harry Met Sally is the film that stand out against it's competitors and was able to stick with me with multiple viewings. I adore this film and the film was able to draw out certain emotions from me, which is rare in romantic comedies, that it blinds me from watching this film objectively. This is a prime example of a film that defines the genre it belongs to.Nora Ephron is regarded by some as the greatest writer for romantic-comedy/drama films. I have not seen all of her films but so far I hold When Harry Met Sally as her magnum opus. Ephron has written a story that explores the concept of friendship between man and woman, the role of sex in relationships, and the basic construct of a man and a woman. The film examines the role of fate in love, showing that people self sabotages or be in situations that destroys relationships in order to be with the love of their life at the end of the story. The choice of having New York was a great choice as it allowed the theme of fated love to be much more effective. Dialogue in this film is a stand out because it's what drives the characters in this film, because neither characters have any strong intentions to be with the other for the bulk of the film. The dialogue, and also the strength of the actors, deliver the comedy of the film and it gets me every time because it felt natural and was also able to come off as sweet and endearing.Rob Reiner, from his first feature film 'This is Spinal Tap' and to 'A Few Good Men', has made a string of very well made films and sometimes it's hard to choose which one is his best of the bunch. Reiner wanted the film to be very optimistic, which made it so accessible, and he has made something that is so natural and relatable. The film can appeal to people searching for love, allowing us to understand or think that there is a much larger work going on in finding it, or to people who have already found it. Reiner did not allow the film to really show the other people that Harry or Sally have dated and how these people are not for them, instead the director just has these characters talk to each other about it allowing the film to spend more time with these characters together. The film has the ability to have us be attached to these characters. I love that the film takes it's time with the characters', allowing them to grow and allow us to see the growth of the maturity of the relationship/friendship and the personal maturity of these characters. I was very glad that Reiner didn't congest the film in humor and allowed it to feel organic instead, like it could come out of our own mouths too. I also adore that the film's humor is driven more by the characters and the conversations that takes place rather than the story or the use of physical humor, aside from the diner scene. The film, even in multiple viewings, doesn't lose it's genuine touch which is why it is one of my favorite films of all time.Barry Sonnenfeld as the director of photography for the film was a good choice by Reiner. Sonnenfeld was able to connect with Reiner's vision for the film capturing the relationship between these characters through a long period of time with such accessibility and optimism. Sonnenfeld wants shots to be a bit stretched out in order to get the most out of the scene and allowing the actors to feel more natural and not just act in service to the story. Because the film is focused more on it's characters rather than the environment they are in, preventing the film from feeling like flashy and pretty though at times there are a few beautiful wide shots of New York like on the winter and autumn seasons.The film is soundtrack driven rather than a score driven film and I thought this was a great decision because Reiner chose songs that keep in tone with one another and the tone of the film. The songs are usually big band type of songs which was able to project a sort of class that other films lack. This though has made a big impact on future films/TV shows set in New York.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal demonstrated amazing chemistry as they both look and play roles that clearly show in paper that they are meant to be together. Both actors deliver their lines so naturally that certain moments can allow us to really relate to conversations and events in our own lives. Crystal's humor may not appeal to everyone but in my opinion it really worked here, he wasn't too over the top and instead of being the center of attention on screen, he was able to share it with Ryan which supports in making the film amazing. It's nice to see Carrie Fisher do something great instead of the Star Wars franchise. Fisher has amazing comedic timing and she doesn't try to distract us from the lead characters. This also applies to Bruno Kirby who has moments that just has you laughing.When Harry Met Sally is one of the greatest of it's genre and it contains such likable leads and played by actors that are able to drive the film forward. Ephron has written an accessible and relatable script and Reiner has crafted a brilliant film that enhances the themes that drives Ephron's script. This is a film that I would recommend to everyone due to it's universal themes.",10,1,2,10 December 2013
There Will Be Blood," Not Anderson's Best But Good Enough
","There Will Be Blood is said to be Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece by many but I think of it as just a good film done by a great director. The film may grow on me in time, as it did in my second viewing, but my review will be based after my second viewing. This is like Apocalypse Now where as I watched it over and over it started to become better and better.Paul Thomas Anderson is director as well as a writer. His writing here is good but not great. The plot of this film is a miner, Daniel Plainview, who struck oil and became a rich man out of it, he then made it his business to drill and harvest the oil around America. His jackpot was this area in Little Boston, which had an 'ocean full' of oil, and wanted to create a pipeline to the sea. There is also conflict and competition between Daniel and the preacher Eli Sunday. The film is like a rise and fall story of Daniel Plainview, at first we like him as he is just a poor man with nothing trying to scrape silver to gain some money and then as his ambition and empire grew, he became a horrible man obsessed with greed and power. The story is interesting and at times I think Daniel Plainview is similar to Barry Lyndon. For the most part it was interesting and entertaining but there are small moments where I felt the film just misfired, and that is the scenes with his brother. It is an important plot point as it shows a side Plainview we have never seen but I felt it wasn't executed well. The competition between Eli and Daniel was the best part of the film, to see whether who's ambition would win over the other. Both compete for the community's support either through Eli's faith and sermons or through Daniel's oil that could allow there city to flourish and gain wealth. The climax is a moment that is driven through just dialog but it was done really well that waiting 2 hours for it is worth it.This is my first Paul Thomas Anderson film and I did have the bar set up high for this film. It didn't meet my expectations but it was good enough for me to watch his other films, in particular The Master. I like the fact Anderson took the time to explore many areas in Plainview's life like his relationship with his son, his past, his struggles at the start. Anderson wanted this film to be slow and patient in order to flesh out the character enough and give us an impression that this man is not what he used to be.Robert Elswit, the film's director of photography, has brought his style from Michael Clayton in this film. It takes it's time with shots allowing for performances to stand out more. The film also doesn't try to be flashy or pretty but rather just appropriate in the time period they are trying to create. I think the best moments that was captured on this film was the burning derrick scene. It was done beautifully and gives us an indicator that what lies ahead is not going to be good.I was surprised to see that Jonny Greenwood did the score for this film. I've only really known him as the guitarist in Radiohead but he really made take notice in this film. The music is eerie and dark, and sometimes quite simple. I like the fact that the film did not take a grand orchestra kind of feel and decided to keep it light but impactful.The acting was one of the highlights of this film. I have never seen a film by Daniel Day Lewis before watching this and he played this tortured man well. The finest moment in the film for Lewis is the climax where he and Paul Dano (Eli) is driven by regret, anger and betrayal. Dano was great in the film, especially in his sermons where lets it all out. The supporting cast were also good but the focus is really on the main two, and also Plainview's son (H.W. Plainview played by Dillon Freasier).There Will Be Blood is a film that needs repeated viewings and requires patience in order to appreciate it. It contains strong performances and good cinematography and also an excellent score from Greenwood. Anderson's screenplay may have moments that I personally do not like but has enough gems in there to keep me entertained. I hope the next Paul Thomas Anderson film I watch impresses me a bit more than this.",10,0,0,14 July 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Writers Are Too In Love With Their Work
","Will Ferrell is part of a group of comedians that include Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and Ben Stiller, and each have their own comedy films where they shine. I have yet to see all of Will Ferrell's films, but from the ones I have seen, it is either Anchorman or Blades of Glory where he shines. Though it's his best, it isn't a perfect film.The film is written by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Anchorman's issues derives from the lack of a great story. The complications of the film doesn't really arise until halfway through the film. So the first half of the film introduces it's characters and the atmosphere of the working environment, which would be fine if the script has funnier lines and much more interesting moments. The film also relies on improvisations from actors, in particular Will Ferrell, and sometimes they just don't land. The film does improve during the second half with segments that are exciting and crazy. I did also enjoy the film's shine on the social balance of the era, with the battle against women and men in the workplace, and the film also gives off a message on the importance of acceptance and respect of diversity in the workplace and community.The film is directed by Adam McKay. This is McKay's first film, and I think he did a decent job for a comedic director. Using the era of the 70s allowed him to create a beautiful design of the era with costumes and production design that has the audience believe that these people are within the decade. Though McKay captures the 70s workplace well, he doesn't seem to have a complete vision of how the screenplay would unfold, with the first half being draggy and tiresome and the second half fueled by immaturity and physical comedy. The second half is miles funnier than the first half, as I have a tendency to appreciate childish humor. There are segments of the film where McKay keeps the camera too long on Ferrell and he just rambles on, giving me the impression that both McKay and Ferrell are too in love with their own work that everything that comes out of them are pure gold. If only the film is consistent and gives a bit more of characters like Brian Fantana and Brick Tamland screen time, then the film would be almost perfect.Thomas E. Ackerman is the film's cinematographer and he does a decent job in capturing the characters doing their funny moments. There isn't really a lot about the Anchorman's photography that makes it stand out but it does capture the image of the 1970's very well with saturated colors that pop off with each shot.Alex Wurman did the musical score for the film and it is quite effective. Wurman's score does make you feel like that Ferrell and Co. are a legit news team, and the score hits the spots it wants to get a reaction from us. The use of Afternoon Delight is amazing, and it became something that is stapled on the film when people reminisce about the film. Though I do wish that there was something more from the score, but that's just me nitpicking.The film is led by Will Ferrell and I think he did a so-so job in the role, though I do enjoy his commitment to the role as you can really tell that he is in character. Ferrell tends to ramble on improvised lines and at most times it gets a bit tiresome and needed more from it to be funny. Ferrell does improve in the second half as he gets placed in situations where he ends up acting petty and childish, which had me cracking up a few times. David Koechner is a bit of a let down, who is given lines that are not hilarious and felt over done. The gems of the film are Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana and Steve Carell as Brick Tamland, as they play characters that are random, inappropriate and at times flamboyant. Christina Applegate was good as Veronica Corningstone but it sometimes feels that Ferrell and McKay didn't write enough great lines and funny scenarios for her. Though she is attractive, it doesn't distract the audience and it has concentrating on her intentions in the film. The film does include a number of cameos that had me laughing and without them, a certain fight scene would not be as effective if it weren't for these appearances.Anchorman does have funny moments and it does have a great view of the workplace of the decade, but the film does take a while to kick in and the writers are to precious of their own work that they find it hard to let go of scenes that just seem unnecessary or at least needs another rewrite. I would still watch this film again though, due to it's extremely funny moments that flows well in the second half.",6,0,0,8 January 2014
Paths of Glory," A Film Rivalling Kubrick's Best And The Other Films Within It's Genre
","This film is one of Stanley Kubrick's overlooked films, others include the films that came out before it, but just because the film is overlooked doesn't necessarily mean it's good. Paths of Glory is the best of his overlooked films. Before watching this, I heard so many great things about it but I always try to be objective when I come into a movie to avoid unrealistic expectations and prevent myself to be too excited or disappointed.Paths of Glory is based on the book of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb. The screenplay was written by Kubrick, Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham. Thompson and Kubrick have previously worked together on The Killing and I thought they did a decent job on that one. Paths of Glory is definitely an excellent tale of loyalty, mercy, sacrifice and the politics of war. There are many war films that fail to captivate me but this one has such a great story and such an empathetic and likable protagonist that the film had me engaged the whole way through. The film's dialogue, in my opinion, is much better written here in comparison to Kubrick's previous film as it felt more realistic and doesn't try to stand out. I understand that both films are totally different in genre and style but I am just judging it with what works for me personally. People who expect the film to show more chilling and intense action sequence may be disappointed as there is only one area of the film that contains this, but I didn't mind it because it's great plot made up for it. There are definitely some stand out scenes in this film including the ending, the courtroom and the charge on Ant Hill.Kubrick comes back to the modern war genre, his previous being Fear and Desire. He definitely showed his capabilities as a director in this film by creating a war film that is intimate and personal. Kubrick understands the importance of substance over style and that making this film more character driven, it haves the audience care about the tragic and sadness of it much more. This film definitely competes with the other Kubrick greats but it lacks the brilliance and originality that his subsequent efforts would deliver. Kubrick is not a stranger to controversy, though his most controversial films were released much later, and this film definitely created quite a buzz in certain countries which I think just supports the film's greatness.The film's photography was handled by the German cinematographer, Georg Krause. This is the only film so far I have seen from Krause's long list of films he has worked in. The film's photography may not stand out or stylistically as much as Kubrick's previous film but there are moments in here that are very memorable and excellently shot, an example would be the long shot of the camera moving down the trench seeing the soldiers just standing on the edges of the scene. The black and white photography by Krause will not have anybody turn heads and be in awe but instead it just brings the viewer into the story and have the image be appropriate in enhancing the film's themes and plot. Paths of Glory is the earliest film of Kubrick that I have taken notice of his style that allows a shot to be patient and have the characters do a long take of a scene, this makes the film feel a lot more natural and relying less on cuts in order to drive the film.Gerald Fried comes back to do the score for this film and it certainly is different from his previous film with Kubrick. Fried's score doesn't feel as cheesy or as over the top here in comparison to The Killing. The score feels very patriotic and strong. The use of drums to create that sense of tension really makes certain moments feel right. I can definitely say that his work here is much more appropriate and an improvement over his previous work.The acting aspect of the film is driven by Kirk Douglas. I have always admired his acting and he always seems to play characters that are very likable and can empathise with. Douglas shows a lot of vulnerability and compassion for his character, and this feeling is even more heightened with the supporting cast that primarily interacts with him are cold, heartless and egotistic. The stand out in the supporting cast is George Macready as he played an egotistic and cynical antagonist that polarises with Douglas moral values. It's always nice to see the usual actors that come back in Kubrick's films, as they are always playing very different characters and they always stand out.Paths of Glory is one of Kubrick's well made films and it definitely competes with the other highly acclaimed war films. It has a strong performance by Douglas, excellent direction and writing from Kubrick, and a fascinating story of the politics of war.",10,0,1,25 November 2013
Blade Runner," A Great Mixture Of Science Fiction And Noir
","When contemporary critics and audiences discuss about their favorite sci-fi films and they usually contain the same films; and one of those films include Blade Runner. I do think that Blade Runner is a fantastic science fiction film but I also think it ranks up with the best neo-noir films of all time.Blade Runner's screenplay is written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and it is based on Philip K. Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. This film definitely progressed Peoples' writing career, attached with films like Unforgiven and 12 Monkeys. I have not read Dick's novel, so I came into this film blind. The film's plot takes a story that seems to touch familiar ground in previous noir films but putting a sci-fi twist to it, and I think it's intriguing and had me constantly thinking about the social and political structure of the film's world. Fancher and Peoples has written a protagonist that doesn't tell or show much and it had me curious on what his view is of the current situation and the world. I did find some of the dialogue a little vague and lacking texture but it does achieve in driving the hardboiled tone that Ridley Scott was going for. I also wished that there was more depth in the story, allowing us to explore the comprehensive world that Deckard is in.Ridley Scott directed this film, who amazed me with his previous film 'Alien'. Scott approached Alien in a more straightforward kind of way, focusing more on the terror and the need for survival. Blade Runner on the other hand is much more complex and walks on the tight rope between two completely different genres. Scott was able to balance both noir and sci-fi, which made this film very unique for its time. I felt that Scott was held back in achieving his true vision as some moments feel a bit empty and need a bit more time to achieve it's true potential. The film is a major step forward in special effects and the scope of what effects can do. The film's effects are clearly influenced by other sci-fi films that preceded it, which includes Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars.Blade Runner's director of photography was the late Jordan Cronenweth. The cinematography is one the main areas that convey the noir-ish tone of the film. The film definitely feels stylish which is one of the main reasons that attracted me to the film again and again. Cronenweth's use of shadows and the use of low key lighting accentuate the dark emotional weight of the film's story. The exterior scenes, which is filled with neon lights and rain, look gorgeous and keeps the audience feeling mesmerized. The film's photography has influenced future films like Total Recall (2012) and Minority Report.Blade Runner's score is composed by Vangelis, who previously worked on Chariots of Fire. I really like the score of this film as it incorporates the futuristic sound of synthesizers and electronic while also keeping that classic noir sound, music driven by either saxophone or piano. It definitely sounds more personal and intimate in comparison to big science fiction films like Star Wars, which is operatic and grand.Harrison Ford is definitely great in this film but cannot say that this was his best work. Ford does not have a lot to work with as his character does not have a lot of emotional depth. Rutger Hauer was fantastic in this film as he portrays with such unpredictability and eeriness that he kept me on my toes during the film, particularly the third act. Sean Young was great here, sexy and innocent, but I felt that writers did not write enough about her character.Blade Runner is a science-fiction and neo-noir classic, and has influenced many films that came after it. It has a great story with an interesting setting, supported by great acting, stylish photography and an inspired score. It may not be perfect in my eyes but it shouldn't retract anyone from watching it.",10,1,6,31 October 2013
Flight," There Is Too Many Problems For Me To Appreciate This Film
","I have not seen all of Robert Zemeckis' films but with the ones I have seen, either it was good or just so-so, I think 'wow'. The Back of the Future, even the third one, is spectacular, Romancing the Stone was light and fun with colorful characters and great chemistry between the two leads, and The Polar Express is a beautiful Christmas film using motion capture and a film I can watch time and time again without getting bored. Not all of these films I just mentioned are perfect but they are great films and are effective on what they are trying to do. Flight is Zemeckis' return to live action and it takes a more serious tone compared to the ones I am familiar with. The film has flaws and it has it's strong points.A screenplay written by John Gatins and honestly, this is the first time I have heard of him and Flight is the first film I have watched from him. I came into this, due to trailers and posters, thinking that it's going to be heavily focused on a plane crash but instead the film's real focus is the effects of alcoholism. There are moments of the film, where this focus works but at times feels pointless. The moments that work are the focus on his addiction's damage to his relationships and career. What also worked in the film, are the story points where they discuss about his case in the plane crash and whether or not his addiction could have caused it. Even with these great moments, they are bridged between pointless and boring moments like the protagonist's romantic relationship with the drug addict, or the scenes with his family. They felt a bit forced and added only a little bit, the divorced family aspect, to the plot. At the start of the film, Kelly Reilly's character was introduced a little too heavily. It makes the audience think that she is that of an important character and I felt that the film took a bit of a wrong turn. The film's plot was decent but could have been improved in certain areas.Robert Zemeckis clearly wanted to make a film about the dark side of alcohol addiction. Yet the film doesn't feel dark in it's tone but rather a little positive. The plane crash sequence felt suspenseful but not in a way that would make me think twice on stepping on a plane again or whether the flight crew is to be trusted. I get it, the focus is on Whip Whitaker but if there was a sense of weight on the damage that may have been caused due to his condition, then the film would feel more effective. The film didn't really show much of his love for flying, which he desperately wants to keep, and it seems we have to just accept the fact that it's his love and passion.With the films I have watched that has Don Burgess as the director of photography, it always feels light. It seems almost positive at times regardless if the subject of the film is dark or serious. This is just a judgement based on the films I have seen from him; I have not seen his other works like Priest, Source Code, or Contact that I assume may have a dark tone. Because the film here has a dark matter to it, it should be handled by a cinematographer who is capable of capturing the damage of alcoholism, but there must first be an intention from the director in order to really create that atmosphere.The soundtrack of this film is top notch. The songs comes from amazing artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lou Reed, The Rolling Stones, and Marvin Gaye. When they come on, it doesn't feel out of place and sounds appropriate to the scene especially the song 'Under the Bridge'. Alan Silvestri is the composer for the film and I felt that his score was a little underused. I did not really notice his impact until the climax, it sounded great and dramatic.The acting in this film is what saved this film. Denzel as always brings his best and plays this tortured man without going to the point of melodrama. I had no idea the supporting cast of this film was going to have big names. Don Cheadle was great, he was really subtle but excellent. Bruce Greenwood, whom I am only familiar with from Star Trek, was really good in this. Brian Geraghty was pretty good from The Hurt Locker and I felt he gave a better performance here, even if his role is minor. But when John Goodman comes into the scene, he steals it and everyone plays off him great, in particular the hotel scene. Goodman plays a little eccentric but not to the point where you are distracted from the point of his appearance. The chemistry between Reilly and Washington was the my only issue as it felt like they were just saying what they were told to say and do what they were supposed to do, and also their point to the story was useless in my opinion.The film is decent and does have enough good points about it to give it a watch. This didn't hit me as it did for some people but it is deserving of it's appreciation in Denzel Washington's performance. I ever feel like watching something from Zemeckis, this wouldn't be at the top of my list.",5,0,3,10 July 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," An Improvement Over It's Predecessor
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the sequel to the popular book adaptation and films in the middle have the tendency to become known as the weaker one of a trilogy or saga but this film piles on to the catalog of films that proves that sequels can still hold up or at least become better than their predecessor. I thought that the first of the Hunger Games film series was good with slight issues bringing down, but it's sequel definitely improved upon that by expanding the problem affecting the world of Panem in a much bigger scale.Catching Fire has different writers for its screenplay which Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt. The first film had Gary Ross, Billy Ray and Suzanne Collins involved with the screenplay. I can definitely say that Beaufoy and Arndt does a much better job here as they seem to have really understood what made the novels unique from the others that it's being compared to. The writers have taken into heart the weight and fear of the rebellion as a result from the actions of the first film. I have read the novel so I am aware of the events that take fold in this film but the film never seemed to bore me as the subject of the rebellion fascinated me and also i enjoy the aspect of the first hour of the film the after effects of Katniss in an emotional, psychological, and physical level. My main gripe with the film's script is The Quarter Quell. It just didn't feel as exciting or thrilling as the first film. This is probably due to the execution of how it was done, making it feel like something from the Harry Potter series. The inclusion of Arndt and Beaufoy was a great one as their previous films had us really invested in the story and characters and proves that sometimes the most intimate and calm moments can get an emotional response from us just as much as the visceral and chaotic moments. The film does progress similar to the first film but I cannot regard it as a negative due to the novel also going towards this direction.Gary Ross stepped down as director for this film and Francis Lawrence took over. When I first heard about this news, I was sad to hear Ross not directing this feature and being replaced by Lawrence. Lawrence's previous films have not really appealed that much to me, though I have not seen Water For Elephants, but he has shown to be a very capable director here. Lawrence's direction here is much more patient, establishing the anarchist tone and terror in the first half of the film. This is where he shines because he indulges in this concept and starts to show what makes this film different and unique in comparison to the previous film. Along with the script, Lawrence starts to show his weakness with the story of the Quarter Quell. The Quarter Quell fails to outdo the previous film's intensity, lacking in execution.The director of photography for this film is Jo Willems, and this was the first time I was exposed to his style. Willems and Lawrence have decided to take a more careful and precise approach to its photography. This is an improvement as it allows us to be less distracted and allows to feel closer to the characters, and also it does appeal greatly with the story driving the first half of the film. This style also shows more of the actors' ability in particular scenes. By removing the shaky effect, the film becomes more of a smooth painting and allowing us to take in the beauty. Willems photography here is much more colorful and it pops more in particular scenes. District 12 doesn't look as depressing as it does before, but the image is still able to remain faithful to Tom Stern's depressing take on the world of The Hunger Games.James Newton Howard is the composer of the film and it's predecessor. Howard is a hard worker, just looking at the list of films he has done in recent years proves that he is a versatile composer. The score for Catching Fire continuous the style of the first film but in this film it takes a little more melodramatic style which is a bit of a let down. I still haven't fully embraced the main theme of the series but it has grown on me since I have first seen The Hunger Games.The main cast from the previous film have come back for this film. I am not sure whether the stable style of photography have shown much more of the actor's abilities or that the actors themselves have improved. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson was fantastic and at no point, except for maybe for one scene near the end, did it feel overly-dramatic. Liam Hemsworth was used a little more here but it still isn't enough for me to really care for the character, I barely sympathised for his pain and suffering but rather just saw it as a plot driver. The three actors that I thought were great to watch in the previous film includes Banks, Tucci and Harrelson. These actors were able to bring their dramatic moments and also being used as comedic relief to lighten the tone. Malone was fantastic here and I hope to see her in more films. Hoffman and Sutherland play well together but both will truly shine in the next two films.Catching Fire is definitely an improvement over the previous film but it still has it's flaws that prevent it from being an excellent film. The Hunger Games film series have definitely proved to be among the great mainstream book series adaptations in recent years. I am looking forward to what Francis Lawrence will do for the next film of the series and hoping to improve upon the flaws in this film.",8,1,17,25 November 2013
The Thin Red Line," Incoherent And Erratic But Will Grow On You
","My first viewing of this film was not pleasant, I felt that it was just too introspective and did not have a driving plot, or at least an interesting or dramatic one, that gripped me. A few months later I decided to give this another try and see if it's able to change mind. In a way it did but at the same time, it's previous flaws are still prevalent but at least much more tolerable and clearer with the second viewing.The film was based on the book by James Jones, who also wrote From Here To Eternity, and the screenplay was written by Terrence Malick. I have not read the novel so I cannot say whether or not this film is accurate or that it approaches the same way that the film does. Malick's screenplay on the other hand is a hit or miss for me. There are moments that are brilliant and definitely makes it stand out against the other WWII films. The main issue that I have with this film is that it is too introspective, which I don't mind as long as there is an interesting plot to drive when the voice overs are not present. A little over half of the film is driven by a main plot but then the last hour and 20 minutes is more of self-reflection and each main character's perspective of the situation. The screenplay contains themes of faith, life, death, war, peace, love, sacrifice and family.Terrence Malick's direction in this film feel so incoherent and erratic. At one moment intensity occurs but then it just slows down all of a sudden. It isn't as bad as it was in my first viewing but it did still bother me a little during my revisit. This disjointed feeling does throw me off at times but at the same time it makes the film different and unique from the other war films that this film is generally compared to. True, sometimes I do wish that it does have that excitement and physical intensity of a film like Saving Private Ryan but at the same time I wish other war films had this deep and self-critical view of the war and it's soldiers. His work here may not be perfect and far from his magnum opus, The Tree of Life, but it has grown and improved on me that I am now confident in coming back to this film knowing that it has this great quality that other films don't.The film's photography was handled by John Toll, worked on films like Braveheart and The Adjustment Bureau. Malick is a director who loves natural photography exposing the beauty in nature and the use of natural light to fill the scene. I am one of those who come into a Malick film expecting beautiful photography but this film just doesn't get up there, this is due to the fact that I have seen Malick's work with Emmanuel Lubezki. There is still beauty in Toll's photography, the scenes in the hill in particular, and it does still get the job done when it comes to putting Malick's script in picture. Toll's photography is much deeper in my opinion than other Malick films, and it makes sense given that this film is more about experience and feelings rather than plot and visceral focused. I do wish that it was more surrealistic but I guess that it's just asking too much as the film's setting and plot is quite grounded to reality.The film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. His score for The Thin Red Line is great, it does what it does and it is able to get an emotional response from the audience. However there are moments that I felt needed a little more emotional kick from his score as the situation felt grand and important. Also I picked up that his works on multiple films have a similar sound, or at least a trademark of sorts. This kind of disappointed me as he could have given his later films a much more original style rather than coming back to what he has already used. His later works still are effective though for those films. Do I think The Thing Red Line is his best work? I think not but it is definitely nowhere near his worst.The film's cast is extensive and bloated, in a good way. I don't mind that characters just all of a sudden come in and play a small role but there are multiple moments in the film that felt like the scene needed a little more time and a much more subtle way in introducing it's characters. Maybe it's due to the fact that Malick cut around 2 and a half of it's original running time. I did wish that the film did have a central character that we would follow for the most part and have little side moments with the others but what he has done with the final cut is good enough. The entire cast in this film were great, they took their roles to heart and gave it their all. This made the film much more believable and also made the introspection aspect of it much more interesting than what it already is. Stand out performances include Caviezel, Nolte, Harrelson, Koteas, Chaplin and Otto.This maybe the favorite of the general audience when it comes to Malick's work but for me it just didn't hit that mark. This may grow on me further on subsequent viewings but for now I can only say that this is good war film that deserves to be watched at least once as it has a large cast, great photography, a moving score and interesting direction from Malick.",7,1,3,21 November 2013
Jackie Brown," A Great Heist Film That Is Currently Under-Appreciated
","I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's, not including Four Rooms, as a crime trilogy of sorts, and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film, because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.Jackie Brown is definitely a left turn from Tarantino's films as it wasn't an original idea but rather he adapted Elmore Leonard's novel, other notable work include Out Of Sight and 3:10 To Yuma. This choice of not adapting an original story is strange but it doesn't matter anymore after you have seen it, because it's still an entertaining film. I haven't read the source material but I have read reports that this film adapts the novel accurately and that Leonard's novel is filled with dialogue. This film indeed has that element, which works in favor of Tarantino as he has a complete understanding of how to make dialogue look and sound interesting. This may be dismissed by many due to the fact that it lacks the style and charm that was found on his previous two films, the film instead takes a conventional approach to it's storytelling but personally this isn't really an issue for me as the story is still entertaining to watch unfold and Tarantino doesn't completely lose his touch with this film. True, the film relies on the story in developing it's characters rather than having them spill out words that collectively will shape their personalities, but Tarantino's dialogue and style isn't the star of the film but rather the motivations and intentions of the characters.Looking at Quentin Tarantino's career, his films differ from one another and the director is starting to walk the same lines as Kubrick in not repeating oneself. Jackie Brown is the director's heist film and he has achieved in not grounding the film on the same style and level as the other heist films it is now compared to. The film may not scream out Tarantino but it does at the very least experiment. The heist itself was a genius in execution, how difficult it must be to have us see the same heist and not feel repetitive and tiresome. There are also moments in the film where it uses a split screen showing two moments at the same time, and the film also has unusual choices of transitions. This is the first time we get to see Tarantino's ability to let the audience gain introspection of the characters.In order to get that dark and gritty style that the film needed, Tarantino opted for a change in cinematographer and hired Guillermo Navarro. Navarro is now known as a frequent collaborator with Guillermo Del Toro and those films usually have this murky black tone to it and the credit goes to Navarro's photography. This is also one of the main reasons that it doesn't have that look that is prevalent on the director's previous two films. Jackie Brown's look is definitely one of the reasons that the film has personality and it does allow us to perceive the story with seriousness that it demands. The film's dark tone does lose that humor that Tarantino was known for but that aspect isn't truly necessary here to engage the audience, though there are moments where it does get you laughing.Again, Tarantino stays away from the traditional film score and fills the film up with musical nuggets that works perfectly with the scene. The previous two films touches on tracks within the Rock N' Roll and Pop genre, while here he chooses tracks within R&B genre. These tracks have so much soul in them and it does in a way throwback to the classic films that Pam Grier was in. Though I do wonder if the film would be improved using an original score, even if it retains that quality that the soundtracks give but I guess we'll never know.The film's cast includes a return of Samuel L. Jackson and a number of stars who are known to have lost their touch, in particular Pam Grier. Honestly, I have yet to see a film that Grier is in but after this film, it proves that she has acting chops and that she brings great personality in a role that it's hard to not keep your eyes off her. Grier should have been nominated for Best Leading Actress at the Oscars that year but that is just my personal opinion. The rest of the cast were great with notable stand outs like Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda. Forster plays it more casually but not being near the borderline of laziness, while Fonda brings the sex to the role and she was able to bring the immaturity and bratiness that the role needed. Keaton and De Niro are a bit underused and their characters doesn't really have more to them that I could grasp on to. Jackson on the other hand still brings his usual style that was also found on Pulp Fiction but he changes it enough that it doesn't feel like he is repeating himself.Jackie Brown is an entertaining crime-heist film that definitely needs much more attention. I personally felt that this film is much stronger than Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't capture the greatness that Pulp Fiction was able to give off, regardless of it's stellar cast, amazing music, excellent cinematography, and a story that had me locked on to until the end of the film.",10,14,16,7 January 2014
The Breakfast Club," Can't help but empathise and attach to these characters
","John Hughes, who is known more for his writing rather than his directing. I have not seen everything Hughes has written, or even directed (Planes, Trains and Automobiles) but I have seen some of his popular and memorable work like Sixteen Candles, Home Alone, Weird Science, Pretty In Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful and Ferris Bueller. Something that I have picked up after seeing enough of his work is that he is a writer who creates these characters that are lovable and adored. When I was a child, I always wanted to be as fearless and clever as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and that is due to his writing. After watching this film, I feel that he has created his magnum opus in directing and writing but though it's his best, it has it's flaws.The plot of The Breakfast Club is a bunch of high schoolers serving detention. This is where I felt that Hughes' writing may not appeal to some people as this film is definitely not like other high school films out there. Hughes was bold to write about 5 people sitting in a library and talk. The film's goal is not very evident from the start but if you invest yourself within these characters then you would understand Hughes' intentions. It is about empathising the problems of others and understanding that teenagers are beyond the stereotypes society has placed upon them and that we all have our uniqueness that define who we are. This film focuses on these teenagers relationships, status and personalities. Hughes has created five very unique individuals who are viewed by each other within their stereotypes. This then takes the film into a dialogue and character driven direction in order to flesh out these characters and explore the emotions and hardships of their position. I personally found this film to be interesting and definitely relatable, which will be the reason why this film is universally adored.I felt that this was a personal film for Hughes and that he really cared for these characters. He achieved in crafting something that is so deep and at the same time entertaining which allows for one to revisit this film time and time again. What make Hughes so clever is creating young characters in his films that does not feel like they have been recycled from his other work. His most personal moment of this film, I assume, is the scene where they all sit down together and share their personal feelings and views. It really felt like Hughes has been in the situation before and just recreated it for this film.John Hughes and Thomas Del Ruth seem to have gone with a low budget feel to its photography and most of the camera's focus is on the actor's and their emotions and reactions. I felt that this style was appropriate and it does not distract us when key moments are taking place. There is very little movement to the camera and it allows us to take in scenes and focuses a little more on the characterization.The pacing, I thought was done well for a plot that takes it's time in moving things along. It takes it's time with these scenes, except for the hallway sequence which was paced a lot faster to induce tension. Some audiences may find this quite boring at times and may want for more things to happen.The music is driven by pop, new wave songs in the time period and fits very nicely with the setting. The music in this film gives people that sense of nostalgia and may not help themselves but to click along with it. I though, am a product of a later generation so it may not give me that heavy sense of nostalgia but it does get me clapping once in a while.This movie would have not worked and fallen apart if casting failed at acquiring actors who can understand the characters they are playing themselves. Thankfully the actors chosen are perfect and irreplaceable. Chemistry between the actors were excellent and all five play off each other well. These actors would end up working together commonly in later films.The Breakfast Club is a film that you may want to go back to, especially if you are a teenager, and relate to. It would make you think about others and understand the uniqueness that make that person an individual rather than a shade that can be identified solely on their surface.",10,1,1,30 June 2013
The Social Network," A Relationship Destroyed By Ego And Ambition
","Facebook. The social networking site that have been used by millions and allowed people to become closer to each other. Facebook may reignite old friendships or destroy current ones. The aim of Facebook was always to bring people together but yet the film doesn't see it that way. This website caused a destruction of a friendship fueled by ego, ambition and visionary differences.The Social Network is about a boy in college who has decided to create the Facebook and how this idea affected his friendship, relationships and partners. The film's screenplay is adapted by the novel, The Accidental Billionaires, written by Ben Mezrich. I myself have not read the book so I came into this blind and my only knowledge of Facebook is only at a consumer level. Aaron Sorkin adapted the novel into a screenplay that is entertaining as it doesn't try to become to complicated. The film's main focus is not on the creation of Facebook as that is only a supporting plot tool in the main storyline, which is the slow separation between two friends. I have no idea whether the film is accurate or not but it is damn entertaining. Sorkin has written fantastic dialogue in this film that feels natural. He also knows how to write conversations that not only are necessary to the plot but doesn't feel too cheesy or overused. Everything that is written seems to develop more about Eisenberg and Garfield's character and that the more they talk, the more you understand about these people. The first time I watched this, I felt that the ending didn't really conclude much about Facebook's aftermath, detailing about its importance and contribution to the world, but it is not ever about that. In my second viewing, I started to realise that the relationship between Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) and Saverin (Garfield) is the main point of the film and how one's ego has affected the relationship. This is drama that have been tread before but feels fresh and executed excellently.David Fincher is a director I associate with in films that are dark and moody. This doesn't film doesn't feel that but rather it is more emotional and sympathetic. I didn't mind his direction here as he has created something intellectual and different from the other sad story dramas in recent years. I can't say this film is original but it is his execution that makes it different from the pack. He wanted this film to feel very personal and intimate, just as a relationship would. There are moments in here that are heartbreaking to watch and some moments are much more subtle but yet still does something for the audience. I cannot say this is Fincher's best but it does show something different from him.This film was edited well, it feels smooth and slick. The film cuts a lot between actors as their emotions and facial expressions drive the story forward. It's not trying to become something of its own like it was on Fight Club but it does try to aid more in its ability to tell the story.Jeff Cronenweth has done three films with David Fincher; Fight Club, The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I felt this was his most safest compared to the three. It's very focused on capturing the drama rather than being something different and off the wall. The title sequence, where Zuckerberg runs through the campus of Harvard and the final shot that slowly zooms in on Zuckerberg's face, was shot beautifully. Cronenweth's work on this one is not something that I would remember as much but it does apply appropriately to the drama.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' work on this film is definitely a plus for me. There was a composition that plays after Zuckerberg's break up with Albright (Rooney Mara) that combines razor violins that haunts the track with a piano that is feels so simple and delicate. It not only sets the film up to a sad start but it also enhances certain moments in the film that make the drama even more dramatic, particularly the scene where Garfield walks up to Zuckerberg and smashes his computer and having an argument. That particular scene is the final cut in their relationship that destroyed their friendship, the ultimate betrayal. That particular composition is used in scenes where Zuckerberg has lost someone important in his life. It is heartbreaking to listen to.Both Garfield and Eisenberg gave their most emotionally driven performances I have ever seen. I don't know if it's accurate or not but it doesn't matter as long as their performance drives the story forward and that they are believable in their roles. I felt that Garfield should have been nominated for a supporting actor at the Academy Award as his performance dominates everyone else in this film. Justin Timberlake in this film plays Sean Parker efficiently, he knows how to convincingly act like a jackass. It was a character though I did not like when on screen as I felt he was written to unlikable but I guess that was the point. Rooney Mara's character is a crucial piece but she was a little underused in this film, all is well though cause she has a leading role in Fincher's next film. This film definitely proved that both Garfield and Eisenberg has acting chops and are Oscar worthy.This modern drama is not about Facebook's impact on the world but it's impact on the guy who made it. It is emotionally driven and will have you either liking this film or be intensely uninterested. It has good cinematography, along with a memorable score soundtrack and a stellar cast. Definitely great but not Fincher's best.",10,0,0,3 July 2013
Back to the Future," Zemeckis' Film Is Ambitious And Multi-Generationally Approachable
","Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' 'Power of Love' is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully 'Biff'. He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.",9,1,1,8 December 2013
The Fighter," David O. Russell Marvleous Return
","The Fighter is the first film I have seen from David O. Russell and this is the film that really made me took notice of him. The Fighter had some strong competition during that year which may have caused the film to be lost within the hype of the other films like Black Swan, The Social Network and Inception.The film's screenplay was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. The great aspect of the film's writing is that the complications and the relationships in the film feel natural and empathetic. The film focuses on these relationships and how it affects the protagonist. From the beginning of the film, it is easy to see that Micky Ward is driven by the influences from his life and it keeps going that way until Ward himself finally has a grasp on his needs and what is essential to succeed in his career and in a way his personal life. People may see Micky Ward as a guy who can't decide what he wants and not independent enough to make his own decisions. This didn't bother me because these characters are so well defined and their presence and effect on Micky that his emotional and mental condition throughout the film is justifiable. The film also touches on Micky's brother, mother and girlfriend. Their stories and relationship with each other are interesting to watch even if at times it may come off as cliché or melodramatic. The dialogue in this film for the most part surprisingly entertaining with moments that will have you laughing or feeling sad. The well written relationships and the entertaining dialogue drives this film effectively even if the plot sometimes doesn't stray off the mainstream.David O. Russell directed this feature and I see The Fighter as his comeback film showing what a force he is in the industry. David O. Russell really wanted to make this film be focused with the characters and their relationships rather than the style and visual beauty of the sport. That move was risky as I was afraid Russell may not bring anything new to the genre and it'll just recycle the stories with new characters. Russell wanted this film to be driven more by the performances and he succeeded with characters you would just love to see on screen and I felt he really did bring the best out of these actors because they all seem to be outside their usual stereotypes. While that is going on, he was still able to craft a well done underdog story driven by the protagonist's relationships.The Fighter's cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema who only gained recognition and success in his work in Let The Right One In. Hoytema and Russell has taken a much more hand-held personal camcorder kind of style of photography having us feel like we are standing next to these characters as things unfold. I personally liked this approach and at first I was a bit afraid that the hand-held style may lead to borderline erratic but it's maintained and carefully handled here. The film jumps back and forth a few times with a cinematic feel and a television sports broadcasting style in telling the story. The former features bulk of the film and the latter is only during the main fights. The latter at times do take away from the personal and intimate approach and this is mostly felt on the deep scenes between characters during the fight, particularly at the climax. There are moments in the film where Russell and Hoytema have taken influence from previous boxing films like Raging Bull.The Fighter is much more soundtrack driven rather than score driven and it does work for me, though I do wonder how different the tone of the film would be if Michael Brook, the composer for the film, was given the opportunity to create a score replacing the soundtracks. Sometimes in sports films, soundtracks do become a bit cliché and tend to use the same type of music but here I didn't feel that as the tracks are placed in specific moments that it didn't distract me or having me feel that it was cheesy. Michael Brook's score was great when it comes on but it's very rare that I do hear it due to maybe the fact that Russell might feel it may detract from the characters and having us think that it's more than what it is, well it's not and Russell doesn't want us to search for something that isn't really there.The acting in this film is the main reason that this film is given much praise as it boasts the best performance from Christian Bale, Mark Whalberg, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams so far. I was glad to see that the Academy was able to give them credit where it was due but I was a bit disappointed to see Whalberg on not being nominated. I was amazed on Bale's transformation, just from the first shot where he appears he just looks sickly and disgusting. I was also impressed with Adams transition from her good girl characters to this tough and assertive woman who takes control of the scene every time she's on. Melissa Leo definitely was a standout in this film too who always strives for attention and to be the best in the scene, she seems to get the bets reactions from the actors therefore making the scenes much more effective. Jack McGee was really entertaining to see here, either being subtly funny or being able to add on the drama of the scene. I wish he is able to get much better roles in the future.The Fighter so far is one of my favorite sports films of all time and also it is tied as my favorite from David O. Russell. I am glad to see Russell coming back and continues to make great films (SIlver Linings Playbook & the upcoming American Hustle).",9,0,1,5 December 2013
The Godfather," Coppola's Iconic Film
","Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel.The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel.",9,1,2,7 July 2013
