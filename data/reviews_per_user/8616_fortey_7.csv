The Ring," a clearer 'explanation' of The Ring
","***spoilers - don't look if you don't wanna see it***I feel I should write this to help should anyone out there be relying on any previous posts if they didn't get this movie.Let me start by pointing out that The Morgans didn't give birth to Samara. She was adopted and no one knows from where.  It's never indicated Samara has 'carrie-like' abilities.  She's a really creepy girl.  She doesn't move things with her mind, she screws with people's heads in a bad, bad way.  The closest she gets to carry is creating pictures out of thin air.  She's not telekinetic though.Anna is not obsessed with Samara's problems.  She is afraid of Samara.  The girl is driving her insane, which is why the father puts the girl in the barn, to keep her away.  It is here she has horses and TV, two things she clearly comes to hate.Samara's institution scenes indicate no love for anyone, especially when they are replayed at the very end.  The tone of her voice is slightly changed, as is the inflection.  It was clear to me that she was saying she knows she hurts people and she will not stop.  She was a bad little girl.The 'I made a copy' bit that kept Rachel alive is a direct reference to the tape.  Why?  Because it spreads the little girl's evil.  Make a copy and show it to someone, and that person will die.  It's what the girl wants. Aidan can't be a reincarnation of Samara because her spirit still exists, quite obviously.  If he was one, the writers had an odd vision of how reincarnation works.Samara was not the 'unproperly put to rest' ghost.  That was what the false ending of the movie was trying to make you believe.  It was some nice trickery on the part of the filmmaker.  However, when Aiden says 'why would you help her?' you know that something is amiss.  If you hadn't figured it out there, when Samara crawls out of Noah's TV and kills him, that should drive the point home.  Rachel didn't save a good spirit and put it to rest, she freed and evil one and let it loose.  This movie has a sequel in Japan, and will obviously have one here.  Hence the killing and bad news will continue",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
Ghost Rider," Yet More Nic Cage Fun
","We should all know the plot of the movie by now. Forget that. Instead, let's appreciate some hidden gems this movie had to offer.<ul><li>The Devil can wander the Earth at will. He can take your soul and make you a fire-headed demon bounty hunter. He can cure cancer and then have you die in a motorcycle accident. What he cannot do is take a piece of paper out of the handle of a shovel that belongs to the Ghost Rider he made himself.</li></ul><ul><li>Despite any preconceived notions you may have about Hell and the potential for many millions of burning souls therein, apparently the real power lies in some little backwater town. Those souls are extra juicy or some such and they will lead to all manner of badness. Need specifics? Well, you can't have them. The movie doesn't offer any so you'll just have to trust that for some reason, apparently, it would be bad if the Devil got like 1,000 souls from this little town that slaughtered itself, never mind the bajillion other souls that would have conceivably made their way into his hands over the course of human history. I don't wanna split hairs but I think the most heinous thing that ever happened in human history was not some middle of nowhere crap town offing itself.</li></ul>-Nicolas Cage can stand and point like no other. In fact, throughout this movie he will take up the awkward and curiously head-scratch inducing pose of standing and pointing at others many, many times.-Young Johnny Blaze and his girl defy the very nature of reality as we understand it. How so, you ask? Well, they inexplicably were both 18 together, yet Nicolas Cage ends up aging far faster than Eva Mendes when they're adults. Cage is actually only about 10 years older, but thanks to genetics he looks about 20 years older. Good casting, guys! Pat yourselves on the back.<ul><li>I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.</li></ul><ul><li>For those who loved The Wicker Man (and who didn't?) you'll be pleased with the prison scene in this film, in which Nic Cage is back in fightin' form, swinging wildly at the group of thugs who want to molest him, or whatever. Watch out thugs, he's flaming! - This movie shows real love by the filmmakers. What kind of love? Love for the same lame special effect. In this case, it's a morph applied over an actor's face. It happens to almost every single key character in the film, in fact. From the obvious Ghost Rider, we also get to experience it with the Caretaker, Mephistopheles, Blackheart and his 3 useless as all get out, totally unoriginal and laughably pathetic cronies. They all morph back and forth from regular joe to some toothy character and back.</li></ul><ul><li>You may not be aware, but the son of the Devil is an effeminate Goth boy.</li></ul><ul><li>You may also not be aware that the Devil is about as menacing as an insurance salesman.</li></ul><ul><li>Nicolas Cage's hair will most likely distract you in every scene. Lately it seems like they try to give him a new, awkward hair piece in every movie int he hopes that one day they'll stumble on an appealing look, but they missed the mark a little here. It resembles the back of an angry badger, prickled up and ready to strike at any moment.</li></ul><ul><li>When Ghost Rider first uses his flamey montage power on a random street thug, we're treated to what may be the most bizarre scene ever in a film, in which a chunky goth girl describes Ghost Rider for the camera. Like something out of a poor sitcom, devoid of laugh track so you know you weren't wrong in thinking it wasn't funny, that one moment stands head and shoulders above all others in the movie as a triumph of awkward, bizarre choices that were made in the making of this movie. Why does it exist? We don't know. Is it...light? Funny? Did someone write this and laugh? Does God hate me? Such questions will plague you for a good 10 minutes after watching the film, after which you'll just stop caring.</li></ul>I could go on, but many other aspects were already covered. I will, however, give a superfluous nod to the stab wound vs gun shot debacle. Why that happens, no one can explain I'm sure. But it's just more icing on this very, very bad cake.",2,5,9,11 October 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Blah
","Everyone knows this was a weak movie. But why? Why so weak? I have some ideas...Behold the end of the film, when the utterly useless character Angel, who was put in the movie for no conceivable reason, shows up to save his father. He flies in as his dad is dumped off a roof. Flies in wearing a dress shirt and a jacket. With his wings out.The X universe has hundreds of characters to choose from in terms of new mutants for a movie. In X3 we get 3 emo kids, one who can hop around fast and sense powers that is supposed to be Callisto, one who turns into a porcupine, and a transsexual who claps.Juggernaut.Juggernaut.Every action scene featuring Dr. Frasier Crane fighting people with gymnastics.Cyclops and his inexplicable death. We don't know how it happened, or really even why. We do know it had no point other than to ensure making X4 would be close to impossible.Prof. X reveals how devastatingly powerful Phoenix is, something that was apparently of no importance in the first 2 movies, sees she has escaped and immediately turns saucy, giving lip to Wolverine. Because maybe it was his fault..that the repressed super powerful mutant got angry.I'm a category 3 mutant. Ooh, I'm a level 4. Wait, what? Pyro, I know you can shoot fireballs and all..but could you pose like you're on Broadway while you do it? Thanks.Juggernaut.Do you think fans would like to see a Sentinel? Probably... let's put the head of one in a quick and lame Danger Room scene.If you can control the weather, probably an awesome way to fight someone is by rising into the air then spinning towards them.The awesome power of the Phoenix can reduce dozens of people and vehicles to atoms in mere seconds. However, it can only remove Wolverine's clothes and a a bit of skin on his chest and arms. His pants and hair will remain untouched.Magneto, a domestic terrorist and multiple murderer, who caused untold millions in destruction and waged war on the US itself, who created Al Qaeda type videos to be played on Fox news, is playing chess alone in the park.Juggernaut.The list goes on. And on and on. In the end, one this is clear. Brett Ratner put this whole franchise in its grave for good.",3,4,5,8 February 2008
Transformers," Michael Bay Still Sucks
","I enjoyed Transformers, I suppose, but at the same time can't help but feel somewhat dumber after watching it. That's the same feeling you get after any Michael Bay movie, however. The robots more or less look cool, except for the mouths which was some foolish stylistic choice which was already proved a non-issue with movies like Spiderman where we know the movie can play without seeing the character's face, nevermind needing to see a giant robot's lips when he talks. But whatever.On the upside, much action chicanery abounds. Stuff blows up and there's giant robots. Huzzah! On the downside, I'm not sure anything in the movie really makes sense if you even try to ponder it. Since it's a movie based on a cartoon based on toys, I let that slide and still give it a 7 out of 10. But really, why was part of Megatron's plan to take over all the machines on Earth if he showed up 12,000 years ago? How many machines were hanging around back then? And when did Megatron learn English? Did he have a wi-fi connection in the ice there? Were Scorpinox and Starscream just sort of ignored at the end of the film because, despite what they said, they fully intended to make sequels or were those just loose ends no one considered because Michael Bay is a poor filmmaker? I put money on both being true.The magic box that turns any machine into a fully armed robot probably sounded good at the time, but...what? I mean really, what? All of that is easily overlooked of course. What isn't easily overlooked is the dialogue. Because even when I was wincing, I could still hear it. I think it's entirely possible that every line that comes out of Optimus Prime's little metal mouth is the stupidest line ever. This makes for an interesting paradox of logic, as he has more than one line and, logically, they can't all be the stupidest line ever. But somehow they are. I wish this movie had a script editor who wasn't a 7 year old with head trauma. That would have really improved things.That said, maybe in the sequel the robots won't be so cheeseball when they talk and perhaps the Decepticons will have some manner of personalities. It's kind of sad that a modern filmmaker can get away with not including that in a multi-million dollar film with the promise of maybe getting it in a sequel, but meh. What ya gonna do?",7,3,9,3 July 2007
Mulholland Drive," I think a lot of people were duped.
","I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people, but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of middling intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius.Lynch, to me, is like Tarantino.  They're both great, but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe.  No director can change the world, so chill out.  And both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day.  And clearly, since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie.  Face it, much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood.  We can all make up meanings, Lynch may have his own view, but none of that matters.  It was strewn about the screen incoherently.  Admittedly, the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story, but then it falters.The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls, the lawyers... come on.  I can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all 'Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't it great?? It's so weird and crazy!'  Weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style.  However, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that.  It's like all those half assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool.",1,79,160,6 November 2002
30 Days of Night," Not bad, not great
","30 Days gets a lot of hype for reinvigorating the vampire genre. People who aren't clever may even use the term 'new blood' because they feel it is a cute pun. Whatever. In a nutshell, the movie is pretty decent for a modern day horror flick as it's not a Saw knock off, a teen horror or a Japanese remake. Kudos for that. It does have drawbacks that stop it from being exceptionally good, however.To start with, the entire concept of the movie seems cool if you just at first hear it. A town that is bathed in night for en entire month gets hit by vampires. Yes indeed, what a concept. Except it's 2007 and if vampires have been surviving just fine for this long, who cares? Are those extra few hours of night every day, in a town with 150 people in it, that important? Seriously? Wouldn't this have worked just as well if the sun still came up? With communications down and vehicles out, where the heck were those people gonna go? Which brings me to another point... why is the town so isolated if it's night? I manage to do stuff at night all the time. Why can't planes still fly? Or trains, or any other thing? Wouldn't life have to continue as normal, wouldn't these people have adapted to that? The vamps attempt to cover the tracks at the end by burning the town. Convenient exposition tells us it's so when people show up again, they think it was just a tragic accident. Call me crazy but decapitated corpses laying all about a burned down town and an oil pipeline that was smashed to pieces look slightly suspicious. Maybe covering their tracks isn't a huge deal, but unless the most Neanderthal investigative team came to check it out, someone might have noticed it was more than an accident.30 days. Obviously this is a key point in the film. That's a long haul. I never read the graphic novels to appreciate if the fact that this is an entire month is significant, but it sure isn't significant in the movie. This could be 3 days for all the difference it seems to make. We're never really shown that the length of time has taken any toll whatsoever on the characters involved. They must be sleeping terribly, they're not bathing, and, realistically, it should be freezing cold in every single building, but for the most part they just seem slightly inconvenienced. Two things indicate a passage of time in the movie - scruffy beards and the odd slugline at the bottom of the screen letting us know time has passed. It's really inconsequential.The movie is also a little longer than it needs to be, insofar as it repeats the same theme a lot. Run and hide and run and hide and run and hide and every so often the number of living people dips a little lower until just a handful are left. And at the same time, we're tossed really random things that get explained very poorly. Like the little girl vampire at the general store. She speaks English, unlike the vamps who raid the town, yet no one else seems to know who she is. Where the heck did she come from? And speaking of little girls, what's with the little girl at the end of the film that Melissa George saves? At first I assumed she was bait like the previous girl we see in the film, only this one is followed by a single vamp who makes no effort to come after the survivors. But..why? This isn't really a plot issue, but I found myself confused by bald vampires. I could have sworn that bald vampire was killed like 3 times.The UV lamp scene has to be mentioned, if for no other reason than I almost slapped my head in frustration about it. He runs to granny's house, turns on the generator, hold sup a UV lamp and burns one vamp. Then, surprise, they cut the power. But he runs out the back door and gets away because none of them thought to actually move with any speed or cover that back door while he was in there. It seemed like the vampires were intentionally throwing the game in that scene.Again, having not read the books, maybe there's a little more story, but honestly the whole in medias res thing with the vampires was bizarre. We never learn where they came from, other than apparently somewhere in Europe, if I had to guess, or much about their little human harbinger who sets up the town for their arrival. All in all, he's a convenient plot device that is quickly dispatched so we need not worry about him any further.Finally, the end of the movie was just a little bit ridiculous. To me at least. I mean really...he injects himself with vampire blood so he came duke it out with the poor man's Vincent D'onofrio with a faceful of really bad teeth, then he sits and watches the sunrise. Oh, poetry.Now, aside from all those slams against the movie, it's probably still worth watching if you're down for some impressive gore tossed at you here and there, and some interesting ambiance.",6,0,1,26 October 2007
Donnie Darko," hmm
","I find it hard to understand how a movie can 'suck' because of a smurf joke and the use of music that you may find unappealing.  I can understand how a person might not like a movie, no matter how many people like it, someone won't..different strokes for different folks.  However, be objective.  YOU do not like it does not equal the movie sucks.  It means you do not like it. If I don't like the Mona Lisa, is it a crappy painting?  If I think Romeo and Juliet is bad, is Shakespeare a talentless author?  I dare you to make those claims and have anyone respect your opinion afterwards.Consider the comments made by the numerous people who loved this film. Clearly there must be something here, lest you consider yourself so presumptuous as to be more enlightened about what is entertaining than the average joe, as inexplicable and ridiculous as that is.Personally, I consider this one of the best films I've ever seen for many of the reasons others list.  It's something vastly different and new, well acted for the most part and visually appealing.  And any movie that paints Patrick Swayze as a degenerate has to be good, don't ya think?",Null,0,1,15 July 2002
