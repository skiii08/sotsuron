Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining and that's what matters
","This movie has received a lot of hate and while it's true that it's not as great as it could have been, it's a very entertaining, fast paced ride that looks stunning and manages to draw you in that beloved galaxy far far away.On to the details.The GOOD:1. It's Star Wars.2. Most of the locations and costumes look breathtakingly beautiful.3. The pacing is good, you can't possibly get bored watching this movie despite it being over 2 hours long.4. The music is brilliant. John Williams outdid himself yet again.The BAD: 1. The plot. It's unnecessarily complex and nonsensical at times. The film is aimed at younger audiences and it's very hard to follow it during the first viewing.2. Character depth. There is very little character development. Too many characters share screen time and you can't really get attached to any of them. This is tied to the plot problems. Generally the movie lacks strong focus.3. The CGI. It's too much. And while most of the time it looks good, it also does look fake. Especially the aliens and their costumes. Whenever there's live actors mixed with CGI on screen, the faces of the aliens and the texture of the CGI costumes look annoyingly fake.Overall, it's a very entertaining film that gets the job done. I'd give it a 7.5 if I could. Between 7 and 8 though, I'm leaning more towards 8.",8,9,14,23 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," What's the point?
","First off I should say that I have not read the books, so I can't really say which version is more faithful to the vision of the late author. I've watched the original Swedish film however and as a movie it's infinitely superior and more exciting to watch as a mystery. Simply put, the original movie is more entertaining.In the Swedish version the plot unfolds brilliantly, allowing the viewer to really follow the investigation and get enthralled in the story. The Hollywood adaptation is basically 2.5 hours of Daniel Craig talking here and there without much coherence. Most major twists and turns happen through logical leaps within moments that you can't really follow.Daniel Craig's performance is not bad however, the writing and the pacing is what makes this movie bland and uninteresting. And then you have Lisbeth's character which is so overwhelmingly amazing in the Swedish version that there isn't any comparison really. Again, Rooney Mara's performance is not bad at all, the character just isn't as brilliantly written unfortunately.Which really begs the question, what was the point of this remake. The original is just 2 years old and is superior in every way imaginable. I suppose if you are a native English speaker that refuses to watch subtitled movies it might appeal to you, but if -like me- you get to watch both of them subtitled, there is really no reason whatsoever to watch this version.",6,5,8,3 May 2012
