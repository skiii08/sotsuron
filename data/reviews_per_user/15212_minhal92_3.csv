Your Name.," Emotionally moving love story
","I don't often write reviews but I don't remember the last time a movie made me tear up so much. I felt like the characters at some points 'overrun with emotions' and with subconsciously teary eyes. 
Everything in the movie was brilliant, the animation, the scenery and most of all the plot. The themes through the movie were strong, such as the talk of the threads of time or the ribbon, and much of the plot that at the time didn't seem very relevant came back in a way to remind the viewer. The ending was elusive too, I wished that they would remember each other and meet but weather they would or not remained uncertain.
I won't spoil what happened but I can confidently say its one of the best animated movies I've ever watched and I've watched several. Many of the themes felt similar to 5 Centimeters Per Second and if you liked that movie you'll definitely like this one.",9,2,3,4 March 2018
Shutter Island," Amazing!
","I have to say, this movie was excelling, it was mind blowing to say the least, amongst the top 20 movies I've ever watched and I've watched quite a few. Brilliant movie making small hints about the plot were dropped through out like subliminal messages, making the movie just the more brilliant. The actors acted really well, another hit movie by Leonardo DiCaprio who's movies always seem to be brilliant. One thing that must be said is that this movie must be watched with concentration and in one go, its not worth it watching it in parts cause if you miss any of the plot and fail to get it the whole movie won't make any sense.. Try not to get spoilers about the plot of the movie, it'll ruin it.",10,1,3,9 April 2010
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Hateful, unrealistic and full of jingoism
","One of the cliche army movies based on a heavily biased story like with plenty of focus on 'national pride' and super evil enemies (Pakistan).
Complete waste of time, please stay away!",4,0,1,9 May 2019
