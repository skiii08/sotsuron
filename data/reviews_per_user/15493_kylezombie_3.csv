Scarface," pretty bad
","I read a comment from somebody saying that this is Al Pacino's best work in the genre.  By even comparing this film to The Godfather means that you have no right to critique films.  The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made, thanks in part to Al Pacino. Scarface was a poor attempt at modernizing the real 'Scarface,' Al Capone. The acting in the movie, even from Pacino, was just laughably bad.  I found myself cracking up from scenes that were intended to be serious. One of the huge drawbacks to this film is that it goes on FOREVER!  This is the kind of movie where the story could be told in 90 minutes.  This absurd film lasts like 3 hours!  I usually like long movies (The Godfather, Dr. Zhivago, Saving Private Ryan), but I was checking my watch almost every five minutes watching this. If you want a good mafia movie, watch The Godfather, Goodfellas, or Casino. If you want a good drug movie, watch Trainspotting.  If you want a mindless, boring, long movie with lots of big guns, chainsaws, and lots of cussing, watch this film!",Null,0,1,4 July 2000
Mission: Impossible II," This movie is incredible
","I do not understand all the negative feedback about this film.  It is one of the best action/suspense movies I've seen in a long time. First of all, the original movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was so incredibly bad, and the so-called 'confusing' plot seemed very mainstream to me. When I first heard of the sequel, I groaned, but then I learned that John Woo would be at the helm.  My animosity soon turned to anticipation. While Woo's early American films (Hard Target, Broken Arrow) couldn't even compare to his Chinese movies (A Better Tomorrow, Hard Boiled), his latest movie, Face/Off was a real winner. While keeping the suspenseful MI style scenarios intact, Woo also adds his ultra-cool action sequences.  Seeming to not be restricted by the PG-13 rating, he makes his fight scenes almost like a ballet, and his trademark 'violence as poetry' is better than ever. The unbelievable motorcycle chase was exciting and fun, in that James Bond-esque implausible way. The love scenes that spark between Cruise and Newton after their car chase were very good, and nothing prompts good passion like a near-death experience. Now, while some scenes were fairly predictable (like all the masks), Woo keeps everything pretty fresh; with the exception of some of his trademarks, like the doves, the slow-motion, and the gun-play that he used to use with such candor with the god-like Chow Yun-Fat. I don't understand all the negativity that this movie has sparked, especially since this was made for pure entertainment.  It's rare that you see a movie like this that is smart as well as action-packed, and John Woo once again delivers.  I hope that his next movie, 'King's Ransom,' will be just as intense and exciting. I definitely recommend that everyone check this film out.",10,2,3,24 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Better than everyone says
","Where does it say that a movie should be judged by comparing it to a previous movie?  MI:2 wasn't like the original movie, but that in no way is a bad thing.  Mission Impossible was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialogue was laughably bad- 'Asta Lasagna, don't get any on ya.' And, if you didn't understand the plot the first time you saw it, then you have no right to critique any film.  I find it hard to believe that anyone under the age of 10 didn't understand what was going on.  Those are probably the same people that are saying how bad the sequel was. Mission Impossible: 2 was designed to be an implausible movie.  Of course there were unbelievable stunts, like when Ethan did a back-flip while running forward.  But that was the point!  It was supposed to be a bunch of crazy stunts.  No one ever questions the fact that James Bond dives off a cliff after a falling plane, or when Arnold lifts up an incredibly huge gun after getting shot in the shoulder!  It's supposed to be mindless action. Do you really think that John Woo thought the motorcycle chase was 100% realistic? Everyone is complaining about the fact that Cruise and Newton fell in love after one night.  Is this the FIRST time we've seen this in a movie?!  Of course not!  Did anyone question that whole fact in Titanic?  That whole movie was based on the fact that two people can fall in love immediately, and it is the most popular movie of all time.  Why doesn't everybody lash out at James Cameron because HIS movie was unrealistic? Anthony Hopkins' role in the film was most probably a volunteer job.  Lots of actors like to volunteer for a movie that they would really like to be in, without being credited.  Emilio Estevez wasn't credited for his role in the first Mission Impossible.  It happens a lot more than people realize. Plus, Hopkins gets to give one of the coolest lines in the film, 'This isn't Mission: Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission: Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.' A lot of people were saying that Ving Rhames didn't have a big enough role. Did you even see the movie?  I've seen it twice now, and he's in it the whole time! I don't understand why people can't just sit back and enjoy movies these days.  John Woo has come out with another winner, and I will continue to enjoy his films.  I recommend that everyone go see Mission: Impossible 2, because it has a clever plot, good performances, and unbelievable action.",10,1,2,31 May 2000
