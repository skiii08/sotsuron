Moneyball," Lost interest half way through
","I watched this because I've been intending to watch it for a long time, mainly because I love Sorkin's writing. I'm afraid I didn't really enjoy it: I couldn't really bring myself to care that much how a sports team fared, which I suppose removed all the jeopardy. I lost interest about half way though.",4,2,4,30 December 2019
First Man," Absorbing
","Film about Apollo 11. There was some very absorbing stuff about the effect of the mission on the relationship between Armstrong and his wife (and their wider family), but it was sort of lost between a lot of not-very-tense tension scenes and 'look at the big machines' shots. I didn't really feel that I got to know any of the characters as well as I would have liked.",6,0,0,30 December 2019
Jackie," I didn't like this as much as I expected to
","This is the biopic of Jackie Kennedy, covering the hours and days after JFK's assassination.For whatever reason, where others saw complex emotional performances, I thought they were much more on one note.I thought that there was too much exposition of how the central character was feeling through slightly clunky dialogue with the priest and the journalist.The soundtrack has been roundly praised, but it didn't do much for me: again, it seemed a bit like it had to reinforce the emotions throughout, and none-too-subtly, which again didn't help to give the film an air of a complex emotional state.I think what I'm saying is that I would have preferred this movie to rely more on close lingering emotional performances from the central characters, and less on 'this is what I thinking' expositional dialogue and music.But others clearly feel very differently about this music and rave about the emotive performances, so maybe I was just having a bad day.",5,1,1,30 December 2019
Drive," Really enjoyed this
","Really enjoyed this, despite the occasional bit of uncomfortably extreme violence. More existential and thoughtful than I expected it to be.",8,1,2,30 December 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Slow and thoughtful
","Watched this because I recently read the book. It is a slow and thoughtful film about a young lad who falls in love with someone ten years (or so) his senior, an academic who comes to stay with his father over a summer break. I liked this less than the book: it struck me as more physical and less psychological, and a bit less interesting as a result. That said, some of the cinematography is brilliant, and the Italian setting looks gorgeous (even if it looked very different in my imagination!)",7,1,3,30 December 2019
