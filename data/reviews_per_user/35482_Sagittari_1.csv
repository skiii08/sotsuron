Sucker Punch," Good music, Nice Action, Just a little bit more soul needed
","More than 600 reviews don't know if it's smart to write another one, but i i will try to write form a different point then the others.When i start watching it the first thing that caught my attention is the MUSIC i love it when people know how to use music in they movies. I think it has a great chemistry with the scenes. Later i found out that Emily Browning is preforming few of the songs used in this movie, where she did a great job, here is a comment from Youtube where 2 user are argue about the song :<ul><li>User 1: MARILYN MANSON'Sï»¿ VERSION VERSION IS BETTER!!!!!!</li></ul><ul><li>User 2: NEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!!!</li></ul>I watched this movie without knowing what to expect, i didn't read any reviews or watched any trailers, so i had no high or low expectations. And i think it's that best way to watch a movie.The story confused me in the beginning but it's getting all clear and it has a nice thrill in the End. It's a Classic Zack Snyder movie (if u watched 300 and Watchmen u know what i mean), just the characters needed more soul.U will like the movie if u like action/fantasy scenes good MUSIC and hot girls with guns, and u will hate it if u expect a perfect story and deep character emotions. Movie: 6/10 but i gave it an 7 because of the great SoundTrack. :D",Null,1,1,12 July 2011
