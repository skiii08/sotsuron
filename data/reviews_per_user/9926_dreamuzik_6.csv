Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Very entertained, but not a perfect second
","Watching the precious Sherlock Holms is quite shock to me. I've been reading the stories since my childhood, and Robert really did well in performing the detective. It's so good to see the first, so I have been look forward to see 'A Game Of Shadow'. It end up with delight, but not satisfaction. The frame of the movie extended due to the genius professor. However, the storyline became so straight which decrease a taste of complication. Moreover, with more emphasis on the fighting scene, it turned out to be 'less exciting' sometimes, because it filled with slow motion fighting, which loosen the rhythm of the movie. With all the disappointment mention above, I still felt entertained in the end. Everyone just did their jobs well, the conversation is fun, the music is even better than the first one. Despite some disadvantages within the movie, it's still worth watching.If you're book fan of Sherlock Holms, you would find out disappointed because the quiz in the movie is not so mystic. However, if you take it as an action movie, it's still doing well in many aspects.",7,1,2,28 December 2011
Shutter Island," A movie worth artistic acclaim, but not entertainment applause
","The movie issued earlier than Inception, why do I compare than together is the scheme they were trying to make to engage the topic of reality and dreams. (The following comments include some spoils in the movie)Inception is conscious traveling between dreams, this one is the opposite. The difficulty of the topic is how to make people feel suspense in the movie, in this part, I can only say they failed. I can tell what would happen in the end, obviously many people does, because the theme here is being done too many times. Modern people who love thriller or mystic movies would find out disappoint because the movie would not satisfy them. However, it would not decline the joy of watching the movie to me. The atmosphere is tense, everyone showed great acting skill in the movie, moreover, the scene created with very artistic visual impact, it did good jobs on many aspect of a good movie. Not being critical, it's a very enjoyable movie to me, just people who likes more complicated thrill movie would not satisfy.",8,0,1,17 November 2011
American Sniper," First time giving an 1/10 on IMDb
","With great expectation on a highly Oscar-Nominated movie staring profound actor Bradley Cooper, which turned me down so much after witnessing a movie with empty perspective but only self-ego of American.On the angle of movie production, this is very old-school war movie style, there are nothing new but tedious street gun fighting in this movie. If you want to find exciting war movie elements, save your money and time, just rent 'Saving Private Ryan' or a much better sniper movie 'Enemy At Gate' home. The emotion part of a soldier is not touching in the movie, people would not drown a tear with this unlikeable character.And the story telling is what turned me down so much. It showed the news cut of 911, and then the army goes to Iraq instead of Afghan? What's the sense of it? Every middle-east Muslims are terrorists? The way to protect your home and family is by invading innocent people's home? The aim of the sniper is revenging over the death of friends, and the goal is execute one single sniper and then killing a bunch of armies by direct bump into their base and returned home save and sound with some scratch? How heroic and how vainly it is.American invaded Iraq twice with non-justified reason, and there are still people like Clint Eastwood evilize middle-east country and rationalize the invasion of Americans who tried to profit through making war? For God sake it took such a long way to end the second ridiculous Iraq war, stop trying to persuade people that American is always right.Please stop promoting movies which makes the world away from peace and wasting people's time. It's also disgusting that Oscar giving it a ticket to best motion picture, please don't promote the movie which tore the world apart.",1,795,1603,20 January 2015
Bad Teacher," Not worth wasting your time
","Attracted by good performers like Justin Timberlake in Social Network and Friends WIth Benefits, this one is just a crap. Bad script, boring conversation, bad editing, the only worth compliment is Diaz who did a good job in performing a 'bad teacher', however, the ending turned out to be surprising, or saying precisely, far fetching. The rock songs in the movie is the only one worth watching, however, why don't you just buy the CDs of Judas Priest or White Snake?? Removing the rock songs in the film, you can find that the original sound score is empty, just like the content of the movie.If you want to enjoy the joy of laughing, skip this one, because you wouldn't find laughter in this movie.",3,3,7,28 December 2011
Inside Out," Inside Out surpass what Pixar ever did
","For myself, 'Up' 'Toy Story' are two best animation movie pixar ever made, also in the animation industry. The story, characters, fluency, editing are just perfect in its genre. However, I can't believe that Pixar just surpass itself with this movie 'Inside Out'It's a little shy to say it, along the time watching this movie, the moments I was not laughing, I was crying. The idea of brain reaction is so interesting, and how memories are delicate is also heart-breaking. It combines the adventure elements of 'Up' and 'Toy Story', and the elements that deeply discuss how our minds change when people grow up, which I believe can touch everyone in some points. Inside Out can be the most original and intoxicating movie in 2015, it would be a lost if you miss it!",10,2,28,15 August 2015
X-Men: First Class," Best in the X-Men series, even in its movie genre
","Superheroes movie has developed overtime, they start to discuss the inner depth of human(though most of them are not human sapient) mind.X-men series is the one that's fancy and excited to me, but not so deep in discuss a topic, it lacks good persuasive why some mutants wanna kill all the human. When it comes to X-men 3, the war became ridiculous to me.However, when it came to the 'First Class', it really astonished me. The storyline is so attractive, the combination with cuba crisis is marvelous, I was keen to watch how it going in my second viewing time. The people are more attractive than the series because this movie make people know more about their inner depth, instead of only how they shoot their fire.'First Class' pushed X-men to an epic level, it can be the best superhero film after 'The Dark Knight' to me.",10,1,4,1 October 2011
