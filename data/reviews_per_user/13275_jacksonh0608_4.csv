The Avengers," What we've all been waiting for
","This movie is what every comic book movie has ever wished it could be. It has everything the audience wanted and more. Not just an exploding good time but a legitimately good film. It's well written, has character and plot development, stunning visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and most importantly, the avengers themselves. My favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they don't all appear at once. The avengers come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first, only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them. It's a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little. The cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in. They have dynamic and rope you in every second. You can even put aside Captain America's dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good. Best part? No romantic crap in this movie. Everything is short, simple, and to the stuff we care about.",10,5,11,22 June 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Completely ridiculous, terribly unrealistic, and an absolutely great time at the movies!
","So let's analyze this at a basic level. How many movies have been made about a president that kills vampires AND saves the union? Well obviously this is the first. With the potential to be a complete flop, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter holds its ground with adrenaline pumping action sequences and creative connections with the vampires' involvement in the Civil War. Is it silly? Well duh, we all saw that coming. But like Blade and Underworld, it redeems vampire movies (after Twilight screwed it up). What makes the action scenes so alive is the same slow motion action that made 300 such a hit. My only complaint in the movie is part of its middle section when the vampire action temporarily comes to a halt. For plot development purposes it's necessary; maybe just lasted a little too long. It's a great time at the movies and good, bloody, ax spinning, vampire killing fun.",8,5,10,22 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The one fans have waited for
","So I've been reading all of these bad reviews on the new Spiderman movie and I just don't get it. What's so much better about the original trilogy than this one? NOTHING!! The original trilogy has nothing on this movie. Let's break it down. In the original trilogy we have Peter Parker who is so obsessed with Mary Jane it just gets flat out creepy, Mary Jane who is the worst friend/fianc√©/girlfriend/actress in New York, Harry Osborn who... Well nobody really cares about him, and this list goes on! this film is a much better adaptation of the comic book story than the original (those who disagree, sorry you didn't actually read it). The actors were perfect in their roles and the characters are so much more likable. I especially like how Andrew Garfield nailed the witty banter and smart-ass attitude that Spidey is known for! Tobey couldn't pull that off (ex. 'It's you who's out Gobby, out of your mind!'.... -_-). If you watched the TV show or READ THE COMIC then you want to see this movie. Enjoy the ride, have fun, and hang on. It is everything it needed to be.",9,2,5,25 July 2012
Twilight," I mean... Really?... This is sad...
","Let's go ahead and cut to the chase. This movie sucks. It just sucks. And that's all there is to it. Did I read the books? No, and I certainly won't now. The idea sounded interesting, vampires and werewolves (not entirely original but hey whatever) fighting with a girl thrown in the mix who falls for the bloodsucking Edward Cullen. Doesn't SOUND bad, until you hear the dialogue and acting jobs of these guys. Bella (Kristen Stewart), has the personality of a bucket and Edward (Robert Pattenson) sparkles with a more flamboyant shine than Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. Putting aside that nonsense, we have ourselves a movie with pointless scenes that just kill time (ex. that poorly made baseball scene) and a plot that leads. Well, to nowhere, I guess to the sequel unfortunately. My biggest complaint with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Edward just complains about being a vampire, Jacob hates him because Bella hangs out with him more, and Bella has the same facial expression for the whole film. It's badly; written, acted, filmed, the list goes on. That's all I gotta say. Anything else you need to know. Watch the movie, I hope you make it through the whole thing.",2,8,11,23 June 2012
