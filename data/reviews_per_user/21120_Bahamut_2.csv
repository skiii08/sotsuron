The Blair Witch Project," Great movie
","This is one of the most creepy movies I have seen in a long time.  While many aspects of the movie are not up to what we're used to from Hollywood, I don't think that it matters, because we're supposed to believe that the film was made by 3 (very) amateur film makers.  In fact, all the equipment was rented.As for the acting, the 3 kids are supposed to be acting like, well, 3 ordinary gen x-ers who slip gradually into a world of madness that up until the very end they can't and won't accept as real.  I believe they hit the mark.We all have local 'witch' stories or have found ourselves in a situation that scares the he** out of us - in this film we get to witness this process.The MOST creepy scenes involved the sounds the group heard at night from the woods.  I watched it several times and was creeped out by these scenes.I hope that we get to see more films where the emphasis is more on classic scare tactics that the more modern blood-fest we're used to.9/10",Null,0,1,23 October 2000
American Beauty," A fantastic film
","American Beauty is an outstanding film about dysfunctional America and one man's attempt to rise above the monotony and mayhem.  There have been many comments about this film; I feel that the oscars awarded this film are well deserved.  I felt the same way about 'Fargo' several years ago - both films have outstanding scripts combined with great acting and directing.If you haven't seen this film, go rent it.",10,0,0,4 June 2000
