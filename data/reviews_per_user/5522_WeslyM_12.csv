Antz," A fable for contemporary neuroses
","'Antz' is an enjoyable, engaging contemporary fable that gracefully illuminates the value of group cooperation as well as personal individuality and integrity.  The voice casting is gleefully on target; you can't help but love a movie that includes both Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone.  The computer animation is absolutely first-rate, drawing the viewer into the story rather than calling attention to itself; the individual characters voiced by Allen, Stallone, and Sharon Stone are especially effective.  In its heart of hearts, this is a Woody Allen picture--the situations, humor, and neuroses are all classic Allen.  The opening and closing panoramas make it clear that the movie itself knows that it's a Woody Allen picture.  The movie may be a bit too intense in places for extremely young children; one battle scene, featuring an assault upon the ants by monolithic termites, bears more than a passing resemblance to the 'bug attack' sequences featured in last year's 'Starship Troopers.'  DreamWorks is to be especially commended for resisting the marketing temptation so eagerly embraced by Disney in 'A Bug's Life.'",9,0,0,3 May 1999
Mulan," Another strong Disney heroine
","Disney's most recent animated film contains fewer of the crowd-pleasing elements that made 'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Lion King' into box-office bonanzas (although there is a tiny dragon, Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, and a horrifyingly cute roly-poly dog does make a mercifully brief appearance early on).  Instead, 'Mulan' tells a surprisingly mature story through beautiful animation in the classic style.  From lush gardens to stark snowscapes to ornate temples, the settings frame and complement the storyline beautifully.  When her father is injured and unable to represent his family in the emperor's army, Mulan disguises herself as a boy and rides forth to take his place and defend her family's honor.  Disney has released a series of animated films with strong heroines ('The Little Mermaid,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Pocahontas'), and 'Mulan' continues the trend. (One might wonder at Disney's agenda; the only central male character in a recent animated Disney film ['The Lion King'] is not human.)  Mulan's cross-dressing adventures are fascinating enough to engross child and adult alike (in the end, she manages to include her faithful soldier sidekicks in the joke), and Shan-Yu, the leader of the Huns, is as wicked a villain as anyone has a right to hope for.  It all comes to a fine, satisfying conclusion, and the story's emphasis on the value of family relationships makes for a worthwhile shared experience.",8,1,2,4 May 1999
The Big Lebowski," A celebration of coolness
","The Coen Brothers strike again, and provide yet another glimpse into the skewed world inhabited by their imaginations.  This perfect and unexpected follow-up to their popular and critical success 'Fargo' is an absurdly loony movie that defies simple categorization. Is it a comedy, a thriller, a mystery, a neo-noir?  The truth is that, somehow, it's all of that--and a bag of chips.  More or less, it's about bowling, mistaken identity, and a soiled rug.  Jeff Bridges is so mellow, so cool as The Dude, and Julianne Moore, everybody's favorite indie darling (let's just forget 'The Lost World'), is perfect as the mind-bogglingly bizarre Maude.  Look for appearances by all the usual suspects (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro) as well as a few new friends.  'The Big Lebowski' celebrates coolness, hallucination, and nihilism, and it elevates bowling beyond the status of New Religion directly to The One True Faith.",9,0,1,3 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Meeting Shakespeare's Muse
","What were William Shakespeare's inspirations?  Who was his muse?  These are questions that have occupied the thoughts of scholars and lovers of literature down the centuries.  This raunchy, brilliantly witty film suggests sly answers to these questions by showing us Will Shakespeare as a very real young man, with a very real, very bad case of writer's block. His new play, 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,' is not going well.  He has been paid for the play already, and has debts beside.  He badly needs for inspiration to strike, for his muse to grant him a vision.  The fates are kind, and inspiration does strike in the form of Viola, a beautiful young courtesan who loves the theater and wants nothing more than to act on the stage--in an age when women are forbidden to do so.  Viola's gender-bending deception initiates an avalanche of riotous activity as well as a torrent of literary brilliance for Will.  Romeo remains, but Ethel disappears forever, her place taken by Juliet, and pirate adventures on the high seas give way to the greatest love story of all--one mirrored by the love between Will and Viola, and just as impossible.  Joseph Fiennes is wonderful as Will Shakespeare, bemused and befuddled, passionate and brilliant, clear-eyed and heart-breakingly beautiful.  Gwyneth Paltrow continues to surprise and delight with the depth of expression and emotion in her performances.  The supporting cast is dependable and solid--standouts are Judi Dench as a crusty, scathing Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as competing playwright Christopher Marlowe.  There are plenty of in-jokes and references to Shakespeare's work for the literate crowd, but this rollicking funfest can be enjoyed by more than just English Lit majors.  Perhaps the best thing of all is that, as my friend Jeff said, the story ends well. After all, what else could a good film about Shakespeare do?",10,5,9,4 May 1999
Elizabeth," Not your mother's costume drama
","This is not your mother's costume drama.  From the very beginning, when the opening titles run over a psychedelic montage of religious iconography, you know that something different is happening here.and it isn't Masterpiece Theater.  Dark and brutal, lurid and violent, this film unfolds like bloody flower.  Religious intrigue, political machinations, sexual scheming--it's like an Umberto Eco novel.  Cate Blanchett is an astonishing actress, a truly startling screen presence.  She inhabits the body, mind and soul of the Virgin Queen with an ethereal grace underlain by steely resolve.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth's inevitable transformation from a clear-eyed, idealistic girl with love in her heart to a coldly practical monarch who will be married always and only to England is heart-breaking--all the more so as the practicality is born only out of absolute necessity.  Joseph Fiennes is dark and brooding, smolderingly sexual as the poor, sincere, doomed Lord Robert, who does all the wrong things for the right reason: his love for a girl who has become a woman.  But that love is returned to him by a woman who has become a queen, and, as Robert himself says, 'That love could corrupt the soul of any man.'  In the end, Robert's corrupted soul undoes them all.",10,0,1,4 May 1999
Dark City," A worthy descendant of 'Metropolis' and 'Blade Runner'
","Nobody saw it.  Nobody liked it.  I don't care--writer/director Alex Proyas ('The Crow') has given us of the most visually audacious and thought-provoking genre films in years.  Fans of genre fiction, television, and film (for instance, 'Blade Runner') will be familiar with the themes presented here: What is the nature of humanity?  How do I know where I belong?  Are my memories true?  Is there some great conspiracy underlying everything I know?  Am I the subject of some secret experiment?  How do I know what is real?  Who am I, really?  Am I sane?  How can I be sure of anything--or anyone?  Who is in control?  'Dark City' is unrelentingly demented, dark and vicious, disturbing in the extreme, and well worth seeing.  In repeat viewings, I've come to realize that the acting is far more subtle and intense than I had at first realized.  Kiefer Sutherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly and Rufus Sewell are all in good form, and what at first might appear to be lack of depth in characterization is actually a finely realized 'incompleteness' in the characters themselves. The special effects are first-rate, especially considering the relatively modest budget; the on-screen transformations of the city as it is 'tuned' are wondrous to behold.  A personal fascination of mine is movie trailers, and the trailer for this film (included on the DVD) is easily the best of 1998.",9,1,3,4 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The costs of war; the worth of the individual
","Spielberg was shunned by the Oscar nominations last year in large part due to the controversy over who deserved the writing credit for 'Amistad.' (Then of course there's the whole white-director-black-story issue, for which he's been paying ever since 'The Color Purple'.but don't get me started on that.)  It may have been the best possible move for him to work with Tom 'He Can Do No Wrong' Hanks this time out.  This is definitely a five-hankie picture: I wept continuously for the first twenty minutes and was on the brink of tears for almost the entire remainder of its three-hours-plus running time.  Spielberg has an uncanny ability to confront us on film with things that require our social and individual attention--consider 'The Color Purple,' 'Empire of the Sun,' 'Schindler's List,' 'Amistad,' and now 'Saving Private Ryan.'  That these films were made by the same man who directed 'Jaws,' 'E.T.,' and the Indiana Jones movies is astonishing.  No other filmmaker working today produces this variety of films, from those intended to prod and provoke thoughtful adults to those that speak so clearly to our children and to the child in each of us. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a devastating depiction of and meditation on the costs of war, a heart-breaking but ultimately affirming examination of individual human worth.  Tom Hanks is Everyman, with whom we can all identify, and Matt Damon is the titular Private Ryan, a beaming, scrub-faced, bright-eyed beautiful boy whom we all want to save.  What is one man's life worth?  What are the consequences of inhumanity?  What is the value of integrity?  This film shows us that society cannot answer these questions; the answers lie inside, and must come from within.",9,0,0,4 May 1999
Meet Joe Black," When movies are at their best...
","Movies are at their best when actors are allowed to do what they do: act. Director Martin Brest isn't afraid to allow his principals (Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and Clare Forlani) to take their time making their characters real for us.  And these characters are real--they not only live, they also breathe on the screen.  In fact, Brest luxuriates in the story-telling process and allows us to revel in the glorious results.  This is an exquisitely emotional film, delicate and beautiful, brutal and incisive. Although some reviews have criticized its length (approaching three hours) and pacing, the truth is that virtually every scene is vital.  In fact, some sequences seem to move with somewhat less smoothness and subtlety than others, suggesting that, even at its current length, the film has been extensively edited for time.  Hopkins is ferociously good; Pitt is enigmatic and engaging; Forlani is breathtaking, luminous, a revelation of deep and naked emotion.  Inspired by 'Death Takes a Holiday' (1934), 'Meet Joe Black' is less concerned with what happens in the next life than with how to live fully and with integrity in this one.",9,0,0,4 May 1999
Pi," 'Pi' defies description
","On the surface, a mathematical thriller with religious overtones.or is it a religious thriller with mathematical overtones?  Or is it an analysis of the nature of sanity, a consideration of how we fit in and find a place in the world where we live?  See it and decide for yourself.  The black-and-white cinematography is somehow simultaneously both subtle and lurid.  'Pi' defies description; it is imaginative, engrossing, and shocking, easily the most daring and outrageous film I've seen this year.  Writer-director Darren Aronofsky deservedly won the Directing Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival.",10,1,4,4 May 1999
A Bug's Life," More of a kid-flick than 'Antz'
","'A Bug's Life' is clearly oriented more toward children than is 'Antz.' The story is more kid-accessible, and the characters as well as the overall style have a much higher 'cute' factor.  (For example, consider the fundamental decision to make the ants in 'A Bug's Life' light blue and lavender, while comparable characters in 'Antz' are more mundane shades of brown.)  The central and supporting characters are a varied assortment of different insects, which makes for easy identification and increased toy sales.  The voice casting is a delight: Phyllis Diller is an absolute hoot as the ant queen; Kevin Spacey embodies sheer villainy as the head grasshopper meanie; David Hyde-Pierce gives dry voice to a worldly, jaded walking-stick.  Gary Rydstrom's sound design is remarkably rich and detailed, putting the viewer right in the middle of each meadow, underground anthill, and grasshopper swarm.  The story makes some of the same points concerning individuality and cooperation as does 'Antz,' and they are no less meaningful (although perhaps a bit less original) for having been heard before.  If possible, Pixar's animation is even better than PDI's outstanding work in 'Antz.'  Exterior shots are unbelievably detailed, with single leaves visible being blown by wind in the trees and individual clusters of clover leaves weaving and bending as the bugs hop across them. 'A Bug's Life' is a riotous, rollicking roller-coaster ride of a flick.  I saw it in a theater full of families with kids, and a good time was had by all.  The hilarious 'outtakes' over which the end credits roll are an especially imaginative touch.",9,0,0,3 May 1999
The Truman Show," Insightful and delicately beautiful
","Peter Weir is one of the most interesting directors working today.  His casting of Jim Carrey as the titular Truman may have raised some eyebrows, but then Weir has never been known for his conventionality.  Weir has a way of drawing great (or at least greatish) performances out of his actors: Robin Williams in 'Dead Poets Society,' Rosie Perez in 'Fearless.'  And Carrey has shown seeds of greatness before; rent 'Doing Time on Maple Drive' (if you can find it) to see what I'm talking about.  Truman's entire life, since the day of his birth, has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set, the only world Truman knows, and televised worldwide as 'The Truman Show.'  Truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today: an absolutely innocent person.  This goes a long way to explain his public's fascination with him.  Ed Harris brings a bizarre dignity and ethic to his portrayal of Christos, the god-like creator and director of 'The Truman Show.'  This delicately beautiful film shows us the utter hypocrisy of our media and the herd-like docility with which we accept that very hypocrisy.  Although it doesn't offer many answers, it asks a lot of the right questions.",10,0,0,4 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful and lyrical, a scathing condemnation of war
","Terrence Malick is one of Hollywood's true iconoclasts.  After directing two of the most visually stunning and influential films of the 1970s ('Badlands' [1973] and 'Days of Heaven' [1978]), he disappeared from the scene for twenty years, writing and directing nothing until this film.  Like his earlier films, 'The Thin Red Line' is a beautiful and lyrical work; it is also a scathing condemnation of the effects and consequences of war. Every actor in Hollywood was hot to land a part, and the cast is full of recognizable names.  With but few exceptions, this is not a problem for the film.  Never have I seen such a cast of big-name actors so thoroughly subjugated to a director's will.  Standouts are Ben Chaplin as a young military officer, conflicted by the things he is forced to do and can view only as atrocities, and Nick Nolte as an aging general turned monstrous by his blind, overwhelming pride and ambition.  (John Travolta and George Clooney, however, make such brief appearances that they are actually distracting due to their high recognition factor.)  Malick is not afraid to indulge in overt philosophizing; contemplating the nightmare of conflict, one character wonders in voice-over, 'This great evil: where does it come from?  How does it sneak into the world?  From what seed or root does it grow?'  Caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding, these men find themselves demonstrating both cruelty and compassion, brutality and benevolence, and wondering at the meaning of it all.  We can do nothing but wonder, too.",10,0,0,4 May 1999
