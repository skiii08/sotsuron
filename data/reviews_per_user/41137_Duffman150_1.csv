Requiem for a Dream," excellence in movie form
","This movie did an excellent job of showing the breakdown of society on a personal level.  This movie did on the personal level what Traffic did for the losing battle against drugs.  Darren Oronofsky doesn't dissapoint and is one of the most notable up and coming directors of our time.  There was excellent acting on the part of Jared Leto and Marian (i am sorry i don't know this actresses name although i heard she was a main player in A Beautiful Mind).  This film was about the path of self-destruction that drugs led to for 4 seperate people, a mother, two friends, and a girlfriend. All said and done, two thumbs up, ***** out of *****, 10/10.  Thank you Mr. Oronofsky for making this film.",10,0,0,25 May 2003
