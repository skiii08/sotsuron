The New World," No match for The Thin Red Line
","Once I heard that Terry is making this movie I was jumping around. That's because The Thin Red Line is one of my all time favorite movies. One just can see how Malick evolves from Badlands to Days of Heaven to The Thin Red Line. Unfortunately I must say that The New World was not what I expected. Its not because of the actors - to my opinion one needs to respect the directors choice for the role, because just he knows how the movie will feel like. Probably, if I had not seen the Thin Red Line, I would of liked The New World. Here also you get the dreamy atmosphere, the lead role voice over and, of course, the beautiful photography. But somehow this movie just doesn't go so far as did The Thin Red Line. Maybe the emotions weren't so strong, maybe the war was the advantage for the Red Line. Maybe. But still, this movie is better than most of the pictures you see in cinemas. Watch it and tell me, maybe I am wrong.",7,0,3,21 June 2006
