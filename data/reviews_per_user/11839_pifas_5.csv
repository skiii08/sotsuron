Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Awesome
","There's nothing new to write or say about Tarantino's fourth effort. This film, as well as he's done with his prior movies, is cooler among the coolest. I strongly believe there's no need on writing stuff about the premise or the multiple and very well used tricks he spent on it -besides, I'm pretty sure hundreds of others here are gonna do it-, so I'll keep it short and say that never mind whether you are a Quentin fan or not, this is a must to see, to appreciate, and to give to the word 'joy' a whole new perspective and weight. You now The Bride is on Bill's track, her anger is the strongest will, and this, on Tarantino's hand, is spectacular. That's why both parts are no less than awesome. Can't wait to have my hands of both on DVD.",10,0,1,24 May 2004
The Ring," A crappy remake
","First of all, I'd like to start by saying that, in a very personal taste, I liked Ringu much better than this one. The only thing to receive applause in The ring are, without a doubt, the photography and the make-up. Anything else is poorly done: the story, the way to unfold it, the overdose of go-seek-a-scare scenes and the need to explain things at the end of it (which, by the way, wasn't that clear). Sure, Hollywood did a great job in matters of visual but, in a real content of the movie, which goes from the adaptation of the cursed video to it's plot development, it failed big time. I'm not one against the US remakes. I enjoyed The magnificent seven (from Sturges) as much as I did The seven samurai (from Kurosawa), but, let's face it, Hollywood also has stroke several times on adapting real art foreign films like The wings of desire (from Wenders) as to make a crap film named City of angels. My belief is, The ring, falls on this last category.In terms of pacing I would recommend watching Ringu first instead of The ring, for anyone interested in seeing both. The japanese is slower but sure is better constructed and explained. My biggest complaint about The ring is that this one traded the whole creepy, evil and an air full of a perverse presence atmosphere from the original (and it's sounds), for more expensive special effects and a more sped up rhythm. This changed the whole aura of creepiness for the urge of an immediate disturbance. Sure, I got really scared a couple of times, by being caught with the guard down may I say, but they were moments frightening enough to give me those chilly goose bumps -the best one occurres near the beginning-; but that was it. Nothing else captivated or demanded my attention. It appears to me that Hollywood wanted an attractive package to sell rather than one good film that could be really apreciated by moviegoers with a brain inside their heads.Also, the changes and additions in this film are more than evident. Despite being almost a carbon copy in it's first hour, The ring falls short on it´s task to get you IN the movie starting from the cursed video, that works better as a resemblence of the surrealistic and goofy movie Un perro andaluz (made by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí in the late 20's), than the images that comes from a distressed mind (which actually are). Sure Ringu is slower, but besides the lot of talking involved there's also a strange, weird feeling in the air; it´s something like an evil presence that you can guess and watch in some secuences, and verbinski wasn't capable of capture that in here. That´s way I like Ringu, and that´s why I also recommend it instead of The Ring.",3,1,2,26 March 2003
Spirited Away," Life beyond Pixar
","There's no doubt that Pixar Animation Studio is the greatest thing on animation in modern times. I use to love any effort by them, being Monsters, Inc. my all-time favorite so far. However, yesterday I rented this movie 'cause I've been hearing some great things about it, and after watching it, I just have to say that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi it is not just a great movie, this adjective is almost insulting: it's awesome, it is spectacular, it is mind and sight challenging, and is a round film from wherever point you wanna see it. Said in a few words, it's a masterpiece of modern times, which spends most of his time in a parallel (and surreal) world of ancient Japan. Sen to Chihiro... has so many powerful stuff to stand out for. It has one of the strongest imagination I've seen in my entire life on animation, and also there's a lot of inventiveness, believable profiles on characters (and they're animated!), perfect on detail drawing (yes, hand made, traditional drawing), pulse accelerating action, humor, an outstanding and subtle soundtrack, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Even the closing song is not less than beautiful.As much as I love and respect Pixar, this one blew me away enough to place it on the same level as the films made by the most popular animation studio. I just couldn't believe my eyes as I was watching it. Is that simple. This experience is magical, involving, marvelous, and one more great thing about it is that you don't have to be a manga fan manga to truly enjoy the trip; just have to be an animation lover. Well done animation. And that doesn't happen much; it did to me with The iron giant, but that was some time ago.
Mr. Miyazaki, I knew nothing about you or your work before Chihiro, but, from this point on, you have become my hero and I can't wait to have on my DVD player any other piece of animated heaven you've created.",9,4,9,29 January 2004
Amélie," Great movie, and yes, a happy one. So?
","I don't know if everybody out there has the same feelin', but I've been hearing some people say that this movie, based on Jeunet's prior work, is just a happy one. Yes, so? I don't understand what's wrong with that. Not everything made under his name has to be made with a surreal, dark atmosphere. I really enjoyed Amelie as much as I did Delicatessen and The city of lost children, and the whole aesthetics of Alien: resurrection. Who gives a damn if this one is only for making you feel good?; we should be grateful instead for that simple reason. No matter what, I really enjoyed this movie as far as finding myself leaving the theatre very lighthearted and smiling. Filmmaker Jean Pierre Jeunet has become one of my cinema heroes now, just because of his fearless, relentless and wide open vision.",8,0,1,31 July 2002
Shark Tale," Comparisons are not fair
","I've seen in a lot of comments on Shark's tale that many reviewers says Pixar's Nemo this, and Dreamworks' Shrek that. Well, I think that comparisons are not fair. This film has pretty much edge (maybe not as much as any of those), but overall I believe it stands on it's own for all the elements and details it contains. I didn't think once on Finding Nemo watching this because the story, besides being underwater, it's solid enough to capture your attention, and it has to do also with the great cast in voices and the terrific job they've done. The only thing I agree with is that Dreamworks' tends to be more adult oriented in it's jokes, and despite I prefer Pixar in many entries, it's because of that (it's humor) that I enjoyed this one a lot, adding the scenarios, the metaphors they use, it's satire on mobsters, the well rounded characters despite their motivations (and I also loved the strong resemblances with the ones whom put the voices on, at least De Niro, Scorsese and Smith, which I consider it gave an extra in defining the character), and all the references in pop culture that whale with the 'wash me' written on it was superb, and so it was Ernie and Bernie playing that Oscar's game on Playstation.I'm not exactly new in animation, so I'd like to think of myself as someone who can recognize whether if a movie is good or not, so when I rented this one didn't expect much based on all the things I've read, but I'm glad to see that I was way wrong. One could argue that it may be due to my low expectations, but I don't think so. I liked the story, the animation, the gags, the characters, and so on. I know it's not a masterpiece, but I chuckled hard with the little details thrown every now and then, and did it harder with the humor displayed by Lino, Lenny, Oscar, Ernie and Bernie. I rented Shark tale to see if it was worthwhile, but now I must have it.",6,1,4,16 February 2005
