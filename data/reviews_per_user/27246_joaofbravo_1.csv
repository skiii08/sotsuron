Requiem for a Dream," Amazing everything.
","Notice how the seasons, how the soundtrack played and replayed at specific moments, how the fast-paced scenes all reflect the state of the characters.
To me, this film is not about drugs or addiction, but about how blindly following one's dreams and disregarding all the rest can have nefarious consequences.",10,0,0,18 April 2019
