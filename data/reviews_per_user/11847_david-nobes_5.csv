Casablanca," My all time favourite
","This is far and away my favourite movie of all time. I first saw it on some TV Sunday matinée when I was a teenager, and instantly fell in love with Ingrid Bergman.The movie appears to be filled with clichés, BUT many of those clichés originated from this film. The dialogue is snappy, the characters are wonderfully scripted, and even the minor characters help make this a memorable experience. This was helped at the time by the casting of many refugee artists in minor roles, including the extras in the street scenes.There is no scene wasted, no unnecessary aspects to the story-telling. The lighting is atmospheric when it needs to be. And the ending ... well, I won't spoil it, but it became an instant classic.",10,2,3,2 May 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Where is the magic?
","First up, I know the Narnia stories. I read them first in primary school, and I read them to my children when they were young. I have also read much of Lewis' other writings, as well as Tolkien's and know about their gentle rivalry. The upshot is that Peter Jackson did a better job with Lord of the Rings than Adamson has done with the first of the Narnia chronicle, and I think it's because Lewis' writings were simpler - naive even - whereas Tolkien created an entire world, languages included.But the lack of spark transcends Lewis' material. There is no magic. Everything seems to proceed in an almost nonchalant way. I went with my daughters, and we were all a little underwhelmed. It didn't excite us, it didn't get our pulses racing, and we shed not a tear at the scenes that were clearly intended to do so. Yes we know the stories well, but we knew the LoTR story even better, and it grabbed us.Finally, some of the scenes may not be appropriate for the intended younger audience.All in all, an OK adaptation, but as one daughter commented, the BBC adaptation was less technically sophisticated but ultimately better.",6,1,1,18 December 2005
The Imitation Game," An excellent movie with excellent performances
","This is an excellent movie, well written and well acted. Benedict Cumberbatch shows, yet again, why he is the actor of the moment. He manages to capture 'tortured but brilliant' very well. Keira Knightly has clearly outgrown her days of Pirates of the Caribbean. The rest of the cast also do a very good job, and there are some good 'one-liners' that I will have to try to remember to use in the future.The movie doesn't shy away from directly yet not in a preachy way tackling issues of discrimination and prejudice. It also tells the story well and concisely.I went and saw this film the day after seeing another recent 'bio-pic', Mr Turner, which seemed unfocused and without plot or direction. This movie was so much better. I would go see it again, and I have certainly suggested to my friends that they go see it!",8,3,8,8 January 2015
The Dark Knight," A complete movie - even better second time around
","Well I just saw the movie for the second time, some weeks after seeing it the first time during the opening weekend. I have to say that knowing what was coming made me pay attention to the actual content even more than the first time, and you know what? It held up, in my opinion. Surprisingly so. So all of my comments below apply, except for the one about the bit I didn't like. Still didn't like it, but appreciated it more in the overall context of the plot and character development. So what I said the first time was:This is a movie that is so complete, it actually is better than the hype (and that was a hell of a lot of hype, wasn't it?). It works on SO many levels; it actually IS a darkly philosophical, character-driven action movie. That sounds like a contradiction, but as my companion put it so nicely afterwards, the action sequences actually pushed along the plot and the character development.Philosophical? An action movie? Well, yes. Just type in the words 'good evil philosophical' and 'Dark Knight' into Google and you get the likes of this link, amongst 57,300 weblinks: 'The Dark Knight - A Philosophical Review' www.gregboyd.org/blog/the-dark-knight-a-philosophical-review/ As I said, the movie works on so many levels.So why don't I give it a 10 then? Because I didn't want what happened to Rachel Dawe to have happened. Yes, it was true to the spirit of the story. Yes, it was consistent with the story, and in fact was necessary for the further development of the Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne characters, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT. So there.Amendment: The second time around I was able to be prepared for the moment and appreciate its place in the film. And there was SO much more to see and to catch the second time that made the movie that much better for me (and for my friend who normally doesn't like 'action' movies - she liked it better the second time, too).That said, this is now THE Batman movie, in fact THE action movie. It has set a new standard for the quality and the depth. I for one cannot see a third in this current sequence coming out anytime soon, because this one has done such a good job.And as I said before, it was _better_ the second time. There aren't many movies about which you can say that, except those on the 'Best of' lists. And this certainly belongs on that list.Oh, and Heath definitely deserves at the very least a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor.",10,3,7,26 July 2008
V for Vendetta," V for very good cinema
","I wish that IMDb had rankings in steps of 0.5. I think V for Vendetta belongs at 8.5, not 8, not 9. It is very well done and thought-provoking, but not good enough to be a 9, but better than 8.I wanted to see the movie when it was in the theatres, but missed my chance, so was glad to have an opportunity to see it in DVD, which I did a couple of nights ago. I will also watch it again before the DVD has to be returned.The story is generally well-structured, but there are a few moments of dislocation when the action changes locations or time in a way that is a bit jarring. Overall though it is a memorable film, and worth seeing more than once.",8,0,2,17 October 2008
