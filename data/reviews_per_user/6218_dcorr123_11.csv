Antz," Excellent animation AND one of Woody Allen's best
","This is one of the best Woody Allen scripts I've seen in a long time. Z is Woody Allen all the way; he just can't get excited about drinking out of another insects anus. The animation is very good overall and sometimes very creative, being stuck to the bottom of a running kid's shoe comes to mind. This is a much more creative film than 'A Bug's Life'. I do find it interesting though that in both of these films the hero is a male ant although ALL workers in ant colonies are female.  I'm surprised there hasn't been a feminist outcry over this ;)",8,0,0,27 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Some thoughts on a great movie. *spoilers*
","I must first confess my own bias: I've been a longtime fan of LOTR, having read the work several times since the 60's as well as other Tolkien works.When I first heard of the project to make the movie, about a year and half before its release, my initial thought was: New Zealand?, Egad!  That's where the Hercules and Xena TV series were made.  What was produced, instead, far exceeded my expectations. Thank you New Zealand and Peter Jackson.                                                       I won't attempt rating LOTR against movies like The Godfather or Casablanca. That would be comparing apples and oranges; but within its genre LOTR stands alone.   Concerning length: We live in an impatient world.  If one finds three hours too long for a movie, how long will it take them to read the book.  For myself, I was amazed that three hours went by so quickly.Concerning cliches:  Many negative reviewers complain of this. All cliches have a point of origin, at which time they are not cliches. If one didn't take that into consideration, much of the World's great literature would be regarded as collections of  cliches, e.g. the works of Shakespeare.  At the time Tolkien produced his works fantasy literature hardly qualified as a genre.  Most of what existed was from ancient or medieval sources.  The enormous subsequent growth of the genre, as well as Dungeons and Dragons games and such is a product of Tolkien's influence.     
Concerning faithfulness to the original: I have seen few novels, or even short stories, faithfully adapted to the screen. Some, in fact, are hardly recognizable as the original story. This movie is a more faithful adaptation than most works.  Indeed, I have seen few movies based on *actual* history done with much accuracy to historical fact, including *Best Movie*  Oscar winners. I see nothing wrong with substituting Arwen for Glorfindel in *Flight to the Ford*.  Glorfindel had no subsequent relevance to the story and there's nothing wrong with introducing more romantic interest into the story.
I do wish *The Council of Elrond* was longer.  At 32 pages, it is the longest chapter in LOTR and, in my opinion, has much of interest even if lacks action. Of course, since they already showed Saruman's treason as a separate scene, that part isn't necessary but there was a great deal more in that chapter.  In fact, now that I write this,  it occurs to me that some of the other events discussed in the Council could have been treated in a like manner thus illustrating the breadth of the threat.  I have mixed feelings about excluding Tom Bombadil. His nature and role in the story have long been the subject of speculation among Tolkein *scholars* and there have been reams written about that subject. 
One part that does bother me a bit, is the gift giving in *The Farewell to Lorien*  (which is in the extended DVD but not the theatrical release).  In the movie Galadriel gives Sam a coil of Elven rope as his gift.  In the book, coils of rope were part of the standard equipment.  Sam was instead given a box of the soil of Lorien and a seed of a mallorn tree, appropriate for a gardener. This would become a great boon to Sam's work of restoring the damaged Shire in the last chapter of LOTR.  My initial thought was that this indicated that last chapter would be cut from *The Return of the King*. It is anticlimactic for modern audiences. I did notice however that Sam's daughter Elanor is listed as a character in the final movie.  Hopefully Galadriel will yet give Sam that gift.  Concerning casting: I initially had reservations about the casting of Frodo. In the book Frodo was 50 (although that's equivalent to early 30s for a human) and Hobbits are described as having faces that are *good natured rather than beautiful*, etc.  Elijah Wood pulled it off very nicely anyway. While I concur with the praise for Ian McKellen's performance, I would like to say that I thought Ian Holms' performance as Bilbo was even better, even if it was a smaller role. I also much liked Sean Bean's performance as Boromir.",10,1,1,10 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Growth of a Masterpiece Continues, *Spoilers*
","Many reviewers, professional as well as us amateurs, have commented that *The Two Towers* departs much more from the novel than did *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  I have gone over both movies comparing them with the novel and don't find this to be the case. One difference between the movie and the book is organizational.  In the book, all of the events involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, etc were told as a continuous story followed by the events involving Frodo, Sam and Gollum even though these events were taking part concurrently.  The movie instead interwove these.  This gives the appearance of being more of a departure than it was and actually I find the movie approach in this respect more satisfying.  Presumably, this approach will continue into *The Return of the King*.  Another seeming departure is that the last 4 chapters of each of these halves of the story were excluded.  That much of this will be presented in *The Return of the King* is fairly certain.  Gollum, e.g. does say that She will be able to help him recover the ring, referring of course to Shelob. I assume that the chapters after the defeat of Sauron will greatly reduced. Except for the very important *Scouring of the Shire* most of these are rather anticlimactic. Faramir's behavior is different than in the book. In the book he never attempted to take Frodo and the Ring back to Gondor.  However in the movie he does, in the end, realize the *truth* and lets Frodo continue his mission.  I find this probably more believable behavior than the more noble image depicted in the book.  To some extent the same can be said for the Ents.  In the book, Treebeard was well aware of Saruman's crimes against the forest and I find it unlikely that he had to wait until the coming of a couple of Hobbits before he felt motivated to take action.  On the other hand, I find it also unlikely that, as in the movie, he would have been unaware of Saruman's crimes. Either way, this part still leaves me a bit dissatisfied.  I did find the addition of Aragorn's plight, after falling over the cliff and being presumed lost, a bit contrived.  I assume that's so they could add more of the Aragorn/Arwen romance to the story but maybe they could have found a better way.  And talking of Arwen, the movie gives the impression that she has, after all, taken the ship over the sea.  That could of course lead the way open for Aragorn, instead of Faramir,  to marry Eowyn. That would be a significant departure.  My bet is that Arwen will prove not to have sailed after all.  Further speaking of Elves, I was glad to see Elves, lead by Haldir, come to the aid of Rohan at Helm's Deep.  The Elves after all ultimately had a large part in bringing all these troubles about to begin with even if that's not apparent in LOTR.The highlight of this movie for me is Gollum. I've always regarded him as the most interesting character in LOTR anyway and was hoping they would do his part well.  Not only was it done technically superbly well but they capture much of the combined revulsion and pathos of Gollum.  I'm in the ranks of those who would like to see an Oscar for Andy Serkin.Finally there is the battle of Helm's Deep.  This was done as spectacularly as I anticipated (based to a large extent on the short battle scene presented as a prologue to *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  Many have hailed this as the most spectacular battle scene you will ever see in a movie. Maybe to date, but this is but a skirmish compared to the Siege of Gondar/Battle of Pellanor Fields in *The Return of the King* !   Prepare to be blown away by that one.",10,0,0,10 January 2003
Amadeus," Outstanding production although historically inaccurate
","This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The movie is visually stunning and the music is great of course. F. Murray Abraham's performance was certainly of Oscar Caliber. I have given the move a rating of '9'. I would have given this movie a '10' except for the inaccuracies and, in particular, the injustice to the character of Salieri. Salieri was not the court composer when Mozart arrived in Vienna; Gluck held that post. Salieri was the conductor of the opera. When Gluck died Mozart replaced him (Gluck) as court composer. Salieri's chief 'fault' was his own self-deprecation. He often bemoaned his own limitations as a composer. It seems that if you claim to being a failure, people are willing to believe it to be a fact. Western Society likes 'winners'. In fact Salieri was a better composer than he thought himself, if not as great as Mozart, and was an outstanding musical teacher who's pupils included Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert.",8,2,4,22 July 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the best science fiction films ever
","The art direction/special effects were certainly the best ever at the time it was produced and still stand up very well. The movie was originally shown in Cinerama theaters (the closest thing then to IMAX). The music is perfect. Too bad they don't give Oscars for choreographing film to non-original music. This is a fine example of absolute film making, psychedelic 60s style. The story is told largely through the visuals and the music, with little or no need for dialogue. Actually I think the story as presented this way is a pretty straight forward one of a more advanced 'caretaker' civilization nudging mankind along in its evolution.  I don't see why some people feel they might need to read the book to understand it. Actually I think the movie is better than the book. Finally there is the matter of the space station. If we had kept the pace of development, as it was at the time this movie was produced, we might have a real space station instead of the 'double wide' they're currently building.",10,1,3,27 July 2000
Men in Black," while we scurry about in short, pointless lives...
",A constant stream of wit from 'God damn bugs' through 'not much of a disguise'.  Just about every alien contact/conspiracy theory pop-culture urban legend comes under their sharp gun-sights. An excellent cast. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones proved to be as good a team as any since Robert Redford and Paul Newman or Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. It would be nice to see them teamed again. Vincent D'Onofrio was great as the 'bug'.,10,1,2,21 December 2001
War of the Worlds," Not only better than the 1953 film, also better than the book
","In the book the story is being told, in retrospect, by a survivor, a writer of works of a philosophical nature, presumably Wells himself. In spite of the hardships and moments of what must have been extreme terror, he seems remarkably unemotional. The result is that you don't get any real sense of the horror of the situation, nor do you, at least I don't, particularly care about the protagonist's fate. The 1953 movie improved upon that, giving us the plight of Gene Barry and Ann Robinson to care about. But with the 2005 film, the focus is on a single family, in particular, Ray Ferrier and his estranged children and their experiences. Yes, Ray is lacking as a father and doesn't have his children's respect. Note that throughout the early part of their ordeal, Rachel looks to her brother for comfort and protection, not her father. However, great disasters can bring out the best as well as the worst in some people. In this film we see Ray grow as a father and with that his children's love and respect for him also grows. This gives you characters for whom you can really care and makes for a much better story. Ray's attempt to sing a *lullaby* for Rachel is at once humorous and touching.The alien machines are much more menacing than those in the 1953 movie. They largely fit the description in the book, but in this film's depictions, they are truly terrifying. Not only their general appearance, but especially, their movements and *behavior*. Wells himself states how *natural* their movements were and that those writing from second hand experience could never fully appreciate that aspect. Also, the various *tentacles* that they are equipped with are also from the book. The scene where Ray and his children look back out over the river, from which they have just escaped, seeing the tripods *fishing* the river, while still other tripods stalk the shores, zapping everyone in sight, ranks as one of the most chilling moments in any science fiction movie.Yes, I agree that the 1953 version of War of the Worlds is one of the best science fiction films of that decade. There is no way, however, that it is superior (IMDb 7.2) to the 2005 version (IMDb 6.7). Even more inexplicably, although it has as 6.7 rating overall, for some reason, IMDb seems to have a preference for listing mostly bad reviews up front. The first 50 reviews listed have an average rating of 3.5, with 20 of these having a rating of only 1 out of 10! For those who may wonder if there is something *wrong* with them because they like this movie, take heart. Three percent of the IMDb voters give Casablanca a score of 1 out of 10! There are times when the critics need critiquing.First of all we have the usual crowd of Tom Cruise and/or Steven Spielberg *bashers*. Nothing much is going to please these people. Worse yet, there are even, apparently, Dakota Fanning *bashers* as well, may they burn in Hell.There are, of course, *plot-holes* and scientific inaccuracies. I haven't see a science fiction movie or read a science fiction novel that didn't have a fair number of these and there are very few that I haven't seen or read.Some objectionable objections: 1. The wrong side of the bread sticking to the window. Wrong, we are not seeing into the room from outside. We are seeing Ray's reflection in the window, looking out. You can tell that by the visual *echoes*.2. Ray's *silly* choice of Boston, as if it would be any safer? Until he met the camera crew at the plane crash, he thought there was only the one tripod. Moreover, as Robbie pointed out to Ray, the only reason he went for Boston is that he thought he could *dump* the kids on their mom.3. Boston is relatively untouched. Possibly. In the book, the entire invasion was limited to southeastern England. They *breathed a sigh of relief* in Paris and elsewhere that the Martians were stopped in England.4. Dakota Fanning's *constant* screaming. Review the 1953 film. Use a stop watch if you want. You'll find that Ann Robinson screams just as often, perhaps more so as a percentage of total dialog, and she's older than 10! If this were reality of course, you'd find Gene Barry and Tom Cruise screaming just as often.5. Stephen Spielberg's *silly* snake like probe. No! That was H. G. Wells' *silly* idea. Apparently *silly* enough to be included in both versions of the movie.6. For no particular reason the aliens suddenly turned into vampires? Read the book. That's what they were in the book. In fact, it turned out that the aliens had no digestive system at all and took blood in direct intravenous transfusions. The *red weed* by the way is also in the book, although there it is not a *crop* but apparently only a *hitch-hiker*, i.e. a *true* weed.7. The aliens were not *smart enough* to realize that there could be potentially deadly germs. That, again, is another element from the book as well as the 1953 film. In the book Wells had an explanation for that. Autopsies of the aliens revealed the presence of only common Earthly bacteria. Apparently there either never was any bacteria on Mars or the Martians had eliminated them so far back in time that they were no longer aware of the existence of such life forms.",10,0,2,26 July 2006
WALL·E," WALL-E is an environmental criminal
","The first half of WALL-E is wonderful in all respects. It has visually beautiful animation. WALL-E, and his pet cockroach are engaging characters. Then we arrive at the Axiom. It's all downhill from here. WALL-E ends up helping the human inhabitants of the Axiom return to re-colonize the Earth, although the 'evil' ship's computer tries to stop the return. These super obese human slugs are the mindless descendants of those who wrecked Earth's environment and then abandoned it. They now live in 'blissful' ignorance, entirely dependent on the ship that has been their home for centuries now. These are the last beings that have any business being allowed to settle on a still fragile and barely recovering Earth. WALL-E, however, makes it possible and effectively facilitates the final destruction of Earth's environment. The human slugs of the Axiom should have remained to live out their pointless existences, as wards of the ship's computer, until their own final extinction.",8,0,1,10 May 2012
Braveheart," Rousing action, England takes a beating and so does history
","A very entertaining, well made action film but history is out the door form the beginning: 'They're saying good-bye their own way, playing forbidden music on forbidden instruments' to the end: The princess telling her dying father-in-law, the king, that she is pregnant with Wallace's child. Actually bagpipes were unknown to the Scots before their introduction by the English and were still unknown to the Highlanders in Wallace's time. King Edward died several years after Wallace and for that matter neither did the princess give birth. There are many other such fallacies throughout.  The great victory of the Scots over the invading English was not in 'open' battle; the Scottish archers mowed the English troops down as they attempted to cross a narrow river ford on the way to Stirling castle. The Scots never wore blue face paint. That was a practice of the pre-Gaelic Picts who were recorded by the Romans as doing that. Wallace's army never conquered York. The largest English city they took was Carlisle, just 30 miles south of the border.",8,1,2,27 July 2000
Gladiator," Where was all that money spent-a big disappointment
",I didn't watch this movie expecting great acting or literate writing. In this I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I also didn't expect to see any real history presented. Even otherwise great movies take more than a little liberty with historical fact but this one was so far off they might as well have used completely fictional characters. The real disappointment is with the much praised visuals. When Maximus and the other gladiators enter the coliseum it is announced that they are going to present a re-enactment of the siege of Carthage.  In the REAL coliseum they presented such shows with casts of hundreds of gladiators complete with elaborate staging. Parts of the coliseum were even flooded to support ships for naval battles. You would think that with a huge budget and modern effects capabilities they could have done much better.,7,0,0,25 January 2001
Princess Mononoke," not a review, just a few of my favorite images
","The *cinematography*: wind blown prairies and lakes, morning sunlight filtering through the forest, sudden, brief mountain showers: Hiroshigi as an animator! Too bad they didn't work in a snow scene too; the Emishi lived in the north of Japan which gets plenty of snow.Iridescent dragon flies.San pre-chewing food for Ashitaka: moving and erotic.The Great Forest Spirit/Deer God as the Night Walker: Liquid Godzilla.Vegetation springing up in footsteps of the Great Forest Spirit and butterflies feeding in the tracks afterward.The Great Forest Spirit's pool and the islets within: a graveyard littered with bones.Dead Kodamas falling from the trees like autumn leaves.One objection: The apes. They appear in three separate animation styles, the first two being well below the standards of the rest of the movie. Only in their last scene are they even convincingly apes, although even then they are not the right kind of ape. Japanese macaques are instantly recognizable with their bright pink faces and bushy gray-blond hair.",10,6,11,10 January 2007
