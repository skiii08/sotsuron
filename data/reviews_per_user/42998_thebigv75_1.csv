Blade Runner 2049," A worthy sequel to Blade Runner
","A worthy sequel to the original that, in many ways exceeds it and improves upon it. 2049 didn't answer most of the burning questions we had, but it made us think deeper about them, and at the end of the day, that's what a good movie should do. Create intrigue and spark discussion...still, it would be nice to get a definitive answer to whether Deckard is a replicant or not. He may know what's real but WE DON'T!! Hats of to the cast and crew for a flawless effort in making an incredible movie.",9,4,12,12 November 2017
