Mission: Impossible III," A real good action movie
","My expectations were low when I heared that there will be another sequel to Mission Impossible. The overdrawn action sequences, the flat and uninspired story from MI:2 were still in my head. Yes, the action was spectacular to , indeed. And the movie was still great to watch. But it was far beyond a real good action movie, like Face/Off and so many others has been. It was a B-Agent-Movie with the budget of a Blockbuster. So, what to expect from MI:3? More action, more overdrawings, more stupid story lines, more plot holes. As always in sequels. But wait ... there was an article in a newspaper that said 'MI:3 is the best of the series' ... can it be? Yes, it can. MI:3 is just great. It's full of new ideas, full of fresh action, full of nice twists and ... it's full of P.S. Hoffmann. What a great actor! What a great role for him! He is not much more than a supporting actor, and he doesn't has to say more than maybe 10 lines. But still he's the heart of this movie, he beats Cruise and the other cast easily with his small role. That said, it's still an action movie. Not more, but also not less. The first part of the movie is a real thrill ride, the action scenes are hilarious and the mutli-channel sound effects might be the best I've ever heared in a movie. Dolby Digital at it's best. And Hoffmann adds some theatrical elements to this movie, and this is real good. While the movie loses more and more energy and thrill as it comes to the end, and while there are unfortunately more and more rather overdrawed (in some scenes the audience laughes out loud where it was meant dramatic) action scenes - it never comes down to a point where it's getting boring. Yes, it's maybe 20 or 30 minutes too long. And some other things explained before make this movie far from perfect. But anyway - it's a simple action movie, so if you don't expect more, you will get 130 minutes of thrill and fun. Highly recommended!",7,0,1,8 May 2006
Batman Begins," One of IMDBs most overrated movies
","Batman Begins is one of IMDBs most overrated movies. Don't get me wrong, its still a great movie, and its definitely the best Batman movie out there. But it has nothing to do with IMDBs Top 250, and sure not with the Top 100 ... It COULD have been if the whole movie would have been as great as the first half of it, but from there it starts to constantly destruct itself. It fades from a movie with a deep, great story (and also great storytelling) to that what you expect from a movie that's expensive like that: a summer blockbuster to fill the cinemas. You can't do that without big fights, big explosions, big pictures. So the movie ends up in a simple action movie story ... and when you leave the theatre you are sad because you know this movie could have been so much more than it had been. The strenghts of Batman Begins are mainly the serious story, the placement of the movie in a realistic and not fantastic environment, and the first part of the movie which tells us how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. It's not only a movie for Batman 'fans' ... everybody should see it. It's really good - a good summer blockbuster. But don't expect what the IMDb rating of more than 8 stars tells you ... its not that great, by far!",6,0,1,26 June 2005
