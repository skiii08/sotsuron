Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Possibly the funniest film I have ever seen
","Having seen the TV series Ali G, I had high hopes for Borat's big-screen debut and I wasn't disappointed once I'd seen the film. This movie is so extreme, so over the top and so downright silly, that it has already become a classic. The excellence of Borat is that he lulls people into dropping their guard to such an extent that we see their prejudices exposed. The rodeo ranch bloke in this stood out as an example of backwards, ultra right-wing bigotry second to none. Its scary to think such people actually exist! The great thing about the film was its road-movie/travelogue type plot: Borat drives across America in an ice cream van hoping to marry Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson. Along the way he gets down with some wannabe rappers in the ghetto, destroys an antiques shop, causes a stir at a polite dinner party, encounters some bizarre drunken students and most comically and disgustingly of all, wrestles naked with his vastly obese director in a scene which induces so much cringing you think your face will pop! There are too many moments of hilarity to mention. Go and see this right now. I can't wait to see this film again. Its a quote minefield!",Null,5,10,13 November 2006
The Big Lebowski," Excellent
","The Big Lebowski is a superb film, mixing comedy and, at times, surrealism. Focusing on the Dude (Jeff Bridges), the ultimate slacker, we follow the escalation of oddities in his life after thieves mistake him for somebody else and pee on his rug. He then tries to get compensation from his namesake, Mr Lebowski, the man the thieves intended to nobble, but afterwards gets dragged into increasingly crazy intrigues revolving around a missing lady! The supporting cast was brilliant, with John Goodman absolutely hilarious as a gun-toting 'Nam veteran with an obsession with bowling. He helps push the Dude into bigger and bigger mishaps with his flawed logic and unhelpful interferences. There are twists and turns as the film winds its way to the finish, with plenty of laughs. I would rate this above Fargo, another excellent Coen film. Big Lebowski is that good.",Null,0,1,18 August 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Disappointing and overly self-indulgent
","As a fan of Tarantino's 90s gangster flicks, especially Pulp Fiction, I really wanted to like his latest offering. I wasn't all that impressed by Kill Bill, so was hoping this would be a return to form. Sadly, it didn't quite do it for me. The story is an interesting one: a team of Jewish American soldiers are sent to Vichy France to hunt down Nazis. There were a few entertaining set-piece action scenes and the odd bit of snappy dialogue. Overall, though, the film seemed to drag on at an achingly-slow pace. I could see that Tarantino was trying to build some tension etc, and the opening scene where a Nazi interrogator spends some time in inane banter with a man harbouring Jewish refugees was really well-played. The nerves increased as I wondered whether he would find the Jews hiding under the floorboards and there was some decent suspense. What undid the film, though, was that such scenes were more or less replayed several times over. I felt that Tarantino was too concerned with paying homage to various things/people/music, rather than directing a tightly-scripted film. This could have been really punchy at about 90 minutes, but it rambled on for over 2 and a half hours. The finale was pretty good and made up for that somewhat, but when it was over I just felt a bit empty: this could have been so much better. I don't think Tarantino will be able to match his earlier achievements and I probably shouldn't compare films which are admittedly different. Yet I couldn't help feeling disappointed that this latest Tarantino movie wasn't on the same level as Reservoir Dogs: we know he is capable of greatness, but maybe he's got nothing left in the tank...",Null,10,16,4 February 2010
Shaun of the Dead," A stunning film that lives up to all its promise
","Shaun of the Dead is superb. Simple as that. It is clearly targeted at fans of Spaced and university students. It will entertain both. The script is razor sharp and loaded with jokes. Nick Frost excels in particular as Simon Pegg's co-star. Most of the big names from the current crop of British comics make an appearance, if only fleetingly, in a film that is perfectly paced and a joy to watch. There is nothing pretentious about this film, which is refreshing to see in a world of schmaltzy Hollywood blockbusters. There is a good dose of comedy violence, well played out, and adding to the film immensely. Simon Pegg is rapidly becoming one of Britain's national treasures. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold. Long may it continue!!!",Null,1,2,21 April 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Far too long
","This is not a terrible film, but it does disappoint. To be honest, its just far too long and repetitive. The film essentially consists of a series of endless chases, hammy swordfights and the odd pout from the beautiful Keira Knightley. The film struggled to hold kids attention in the cinema where I saw it: they were in and out like tramps on a kipper! The film is oddly paced, with a bit of slow, dull speech followed by what seems like an eternal 'caper' of some sort. The plot revolves around Captain Jack (even more over-the-top than film one) having to repay a debt to Davey Jones, a squid-like pirate blah blah blah. The film ends on a cliffhanger which cries out 'money spinning third film on the way' as blatantly as could be. There is no reason why this shouldn't have been around 90-100 mins long. Tightly edited it would have bounced along at a decent pace and would have been more enjoyable. The special effects were reasonable I suppose. The sea monster style pirates looked interesting, but the great cracken beast which acts as the film's scary element (for kids) looked rather pathetic and was clearly superimposed onto the screen, but such is the way with CGI nonsense. Film one was harmless pap and this is too. A shame really. I would admit, however, that the odd scene will make you laugh. At the start, Captain Jack escapes from a coffin in a pretty amusing manner...but if that's a film's highlight...oh dear!",Null,3,6,11 August 2006
Troy," Another film desperate to replicate the success of Gladiator but it fails!
","Troy could have been a terrific film, it really could. The story is well known and a very good one, but in this nothing seems to work. Pitt is truly dire as the lead, his emotions poorly conveyed and his general screen presence sadly lacking. As for Orlando Bloom, well, the man should be banned from ever again appearing in cinema. His performance is so embarrassingly wooden that you sometimes imagine the film is set in a forest. He adds nothing at all to anything he stars in. The battle scenes were not too bad, but the pace of Troy is agonisingly slow at times and you soon wish it was all over. Sean Bean makes a welcome appearance, but only for a short while, and it's sad to see him passing the time in tripe like this when we know he can perform so well in shows of Sharpe's ilk. Troy should be remade with some decent actors and more action, then it might be worth a look! In terms of battle scenes, the viewer is left feeling short-changed. Troy is one to miss.",Null,0,11,11 May 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Sensational war movie
","This is undoubtedly one of the finest war movies ever made. No other film comes close to matching the quality of the cast in A Bridge Too Far. There are a whole plethora of big name stars in this blockbuster, all at the top of their game. The film is centred around the disastrous Battle of Arnhem in which the Allies suffered heavy casualties as the Hun refused to concede defeat, despite the fact that Germany was doomed to failure in the Second World War. The film is not exactly accurate in some of its portrayals, not least the scene when Robert Redford storms one of the bridges. In real life it was a Brit who carried out that role, but Hollywood is Hollywood! Regardless, the film is superb, moving performances conveying the horrors of war. Well worth seeing.",Null,2,4,27 May 2005
The Terminator," Arnie at his best
","Terminator is one of those films that demands a multitude of repeat screenings. The storyline is genuinely interesting, a cyborg from the future (Arnie) having been sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor. Sent back to fight the cyborg is Michael Biehn. There are numerous brilliant moments in Terminator, but undoubtedly the film's finest hour comes when Arnie crashes a car into a police station before unleashing his machine guns mercilessly on the entire police force! There is so much shooting that even the most devoted of action fans will not be left wanting. Possibly Arnie's most famous one-liner makes its debut before the police station attack, 'I'll be back' being delivered with acres of Austrian menace! There are a few slow moments in the film, particularly the scenes where we are introduced to Sarah Connor, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for these few minutes of dullness. The sequels are not as good as the original, this film having been made in the mid 80s before the ultra-sanctimonious censor brigade got their hands on Hollywood. Too many films promise raw violence and don't deliver, Terminator does. Well worth buying.",Null,1,2,21 April 2005
We Were Soldiers," Gibson on another ego trip
","This isn't a terrible film per say, but neither can it be described as good. Set in 'Nam there are some well-directed battle scenes, but the rest of the film is fairly sugary and too self-important. Mel Gibson seems obsessed with religion and there is plenty of 'Thank God' and 'pray to God' trollop sprouted out in this. The dialogue is moribund at best, whilst the female cast in particular doesn't shine. Gibson plays his by now usual God-fearing leader, with strong morals blah blah blah, but its just too self-righteous to entertain. We Were Soldiers is worth catching, but only for the action scenes. The rest of it belongs in the cutting room.......",Null,1,2,22 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Doesn't deserve the enormous hype
","Return of the Jedi seems to be very popular and so it should be...amongst kids. Anybody old enough to drink however will be left fairly unimpressed by George Lucas' third Star Wars film, unless they're some kind of sci-fi obsessive. I fail to understand why Star Wars is consistently voted one of the best series of all time. Sure the films have their moments, but its very concerning that people have devoted their lives to them! There are too many ridiculous and immature moments in Return of the Jedi to make it anything other than a good kid's movie. The army of teddy bears at the end lowers the quality of the film immensely. The obese frog creature Jabba is welcome, but they go and kill him off too quickly. Harrison Ford steals the film, but isn't in it enough. Skywalker is at times far too worthy and righteous. The robots are just plain irritating, one of them just making inane beeping noises and the other sprouting out nonsense in an ultra-camp English accent. Overall, not one of cinema's best offerings......",Null,2,3,22 April 2005
The Expendables," Provides a welcome care home for 80s action stars
","There was a lot of hype before this film and that's hardly surprising given the stunning cast list. Stallone, Statham, Li, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Rourke, Lundgren...the list goes on. OK, so a few of those big names were only cameos, but so what? The first scene in cinema history featuring Sly, Arnie and Bruce was full of in-jokes and set the rest of the film up nicely. The plot was a run-of-the-mill nasty general/CIA rogue get taken down by a team of hotshot mercenaries, but that's fine by me. The film had plenty of old-school action and didn't take itself too seriously. There were some great laughs to be had from the interplay between Stallone and his co-stars, especially Statham. Stallone himself is showing his age a tad, with plenty of veins and stretched skin making him look much older than his co-stars, but there's no doubt that he can still hold his own on screen. I would have preferred a full-blown 18 rating, to match Rambo IV's excellent levels of carnage and mindless violence, but there was still a good dose of firepower on display. They could easily make a sequel, ideally with Schwarzenegger taking on a proper role once he's finished playing politics.",Null,2,5,3 September 2010
Knocked Up," Too long for a comedy
","This isn't too bad a film, but in reality it shouldn't have run over 90 minutes, let alone the 2 hours plus it actually weighs in at. The plot is simple: a spliff scoffling loser somehow pulls a gorgeous babe for a one-night stand. Only problem is, he 'knocks her up'. The film then charts the unexpected relationship as the pair decide to keep the baby and come together. There were plenty of jokes in the first half, many in poor taste, but that suits the genre. However, the later stages really dragged, with an endless birth scene and too much schmaltz. There was no need for a film of this type to attempt a serious element. Some of the scenes are funny, especially the sex scene where the baby is duly made. But by the end of the film, any laughs have worn off and I was relieved that it was all over!",Null,0,1,10 October 2007
Alien," An all-time classic that stands the test of time
","Alien is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. What is so impressive about the film is that the pacing feels exactly right. There is an ideal blend of character development, suspense and then action. For 1979, the special effects are surprisingly good and many years later the film still looks great. The Alien is of course one of cinema's greatest creations, the shape of the creature being unlike any other and holding a wonderful distinctiveness. The storyline is simple, but effective. Corporate greed forces the mining crew to investigate a planet on their way back to earth. Inhabited by scores of strange slimy eggs, one of the crew, John Hurt, is attacked by a reptilian like 'hand with a tail' for want of a better phrase. Stuck to his face it is planting an alien inside him, an alien that spectacularly erupts from him whilst eating dinner! There then follows the rest of the film in which the remaining crew members hunt for the escaped beast, unaware initially that it is growing ever larger and deadlier. One by one the crew are picked off in a series of well executed scenes that are at times subtle and then violent. Sigourney Weaver eventually emerges as the star of the film, the last one left on-board the space ship. Along the way she uncovers the chicanery of Ian Holm's Ash character, who is in fact an android working for the company and operating a myriad of Machiavellian policies. In one of the highlights of the film, she battles with the out of control Ash in a frantic attempt to learn the truth and save her life. The film ends in typically dramatic style and leaves you feeling more than entertained. The next three films in the series were all good efforts, but perhaps this one is the best? Regardless of its ranking, it merits a place in any film fan's collection.",Null,5,9,14 June 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Slick return to form for the Ocean's series
","After a pretty poor offering in Ocean's 12, the team have gone back to basics with this third film in the series. Danny Ocean and the usual suspects team up to try and swindle slimy casino baron Al Pacino, but this time it ain't just about the money. They want revenge after he'd betrayed their friend in a business deal. The whole movie was lively and snappy, not dragging at any point. Mixing humour with oodles of cool, it was all very entertaining. The twist involving Andy Garcia lending them money was a bit unrealistic, but made for a fun plot. Some of the card tricks etc were nothing we haven't seen before, but so what? A good film with plenty of action and plenty of laughs. Al Pacino was a bit over-the-top, but that suited the movie and it was good to see him back in a top-line picture after a couple of recent duds. Check it out.",Null,0,1,17 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Subtle brilliance
","Lost in Translation is a film destined for cult greatness. Its probably too subtle to be a mainstream hit, but is certainly a favourite of mine. Exploring the bond of friendship that develops between a grizzled old actor (Bill Murray) and an unsatisfied newlywed (the gorgeous Scarlett J), this film delivers some really great moments. Murray and J's characters gravitate towards each other in a Japanese hotel, loneliness initially uniting them. As the film develops they become rather like soul mates. Along the way, there are some hilarious observations of cultural differences between the West and Japan, such as the intensity and noise of Japanese talk shows and the awkward fish-out-water instances everybody encounters in a new setting. The film may be low key, but this is because it is all about the two leads and their thoughts about life and each other. It isn't a movie that everybody likes. I have met many people who didn't 'get it', but if you do, you will love it. 10 out of 10.",Null,0,2,11 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas cashes in yet again
","Not being a huge fan of the series I was sceptical about the idea of George Lucas reviving the franchise. Phantom Menace was torrid and this continues the theme really. This is an example of a big studio mercilessly cashing in on the loyalty of the fans by churning out mindless drivel like this, safe in the knowledge that loads of people will still flock to see it. The plot is slow and ponderous, the acting as wooden as in Phantom Menace. That young bloke who plays the future Darth Vader is one of the worst actors of all time. He seems to be in physical pain when he delivers his lines, so laboured are they. That Natalie Portman is a pretty girl for sure, but sadly she can't twin her natural talents with any gift for acting. Basically this film is mindless junk, so dull that any sane person would never watch it twice. Sci-fi in general is not my favourite genre, but this certainly doesn't convince me of its merits. Tripe!!!!!!!!!!",Null,1,2,10 June 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Better than the sequel but that isn't difficult!
","This film is complete tripe. Make no mistake about that. But when you compare it to Bridget Jones 2 it looks a lot better. Its better than movie 2 because at least it was new, if not original, following on from all those 90s English chick-flicks. There are a host of familiar faces in the film, most of whom coast through the film clearly waiting for the cheque to arrive. Jim Broadbent is welcome in the film, but after his brilliant appearances as Slater in Only Fools and Horses its sad to see him wasting his time in this bilge. The jokes are predictable and come with so much warning that you have time to redecorate your house before they arrive. Renee bumbles along as Bridget, her English accent all well and proper, her acting sadly not. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth play themselves as usual, and many blokes who view the film will secretly be hoping that Arnie makes an appearance to blow them away with a machine gun! Alas, they limp on. The music backing the film is that kind of cheap, cheesy commercial radio pop that is supposed to be 'uplifting' but is actually dated and boring. This film will amuse those who like the genre but for those who seek a little more you will be left cold. Overall a lazy effort from Richard Curtis who is in danger of destroying his credibility. He should really get back to Blackadder, we're well overdue a fifth series.............",Null,2,3,20 April 2005
Predator," A film without fault
","Arnie is a commando. He has some commando buddies. They meet up with Carl Weathers and abseil from helicopters into the jungle. They're all on a big mission, ostensibly to save some cabinet minister or someone. They find some badguys. Arnie ruins their luncheon by pushing a truck armed with explosives right into their midst. Outrageous amounts of shooting take place. Jesse Ventura steals the film with his sensational medigun, a weapon so powerful it sets people on fire after a few rounds! Arnie throws a knife into some passer by, 'Schtick around' being his handy advice. But when the shooting stops Arnie feels betrayed, Carl Weathers lied! Horror of horrors these old pals are now in great dispute. Little do they know that they share a common enemy...the Predator, some kind of alien hunter that has arrived from space with the expressed intention of turning everybody it finds into some kind of quirky evening wear. The team move on into the jungle, the spectacled disgusting joke peddler being the first to die. Ventura is next, his stomach exploding in a cacophony of splurting blood! Bill Duke doesn't like that one bit, Ventura was his best mate, so he fires off thousands of rounds from the medigun into the trees, his commando mates doing the same. They all miss! The Predator has got away FOR NOW! Arnie has a plan, 'If it bleeds vee can kill it' he quips! The race is on to catch the killer, traps are laid, but when the Predator falls for them his powers of escape are better than they had all predicted. It breaks free and Richard Chaves finds out what happens when a gigantic log is hurled at high speed into your chest! Suffice to say he doesn't benefit from the experience. Bill Duke and Carl Weathers decide to track the creature, and amazingly discard much of their ammo! They both end up in a rather bad way, Duke's head exploding and Weather's arm being shot off, naturally the rest of him soon following. By now just Arnie is left intact, his American Indian friend having unexplainably decided to offer himself as pray! Just the crippled Chaves and some peasant girl remain. Chaves soon finds himself dead, whilst the girl runs off. Arnie then gets shot in the arm, but it causes him no worry, because his skin is obviously made of cream coloured armour. He jumps off a waterfall, he does the same moments later, but no side effects are suffered. Swimming through the cleanest river water ever seen Arnie lies helpless on a muddy beach. But alas, this saves him, for the Predator is very thick and doesn't notice him, the mud hiding his presence. Arnie then turns into a cross between Ray Mears and Tarzan before taking on the Predator in a series of fights. Things are going badly for him, he's seconds from death, but then rather luckily the Predator opts to stand under one of Arnie's log traps and is seriously wounded when the huge heap of wood descends onto his 7ft frame. Arnie gives a sigh of relief, but he's premature. The Predator is still alive and has detonated a bomb! Arnie runs faster than Linford Christie and then the bomb goes off. It can only be described as a nuclear explosion so large is its mushroom cloud. It destroys a forest. Not a tree is left standing. Only one thing has survived...Arnie! Yes, he has been shot in the arm, battered by a giant alien, jumped off a couple of waterfalls and outrun a nuclear holocaust, but did you ever expect him not to make it? Of course not! Predator is a stunning film, packed with action and one-liners, very funny at times and not too long. Arnie plays Dutch relatively straight faced and gives one of his best performances. Jesse Ventura is particularly good as the loudmouth tobacco chewin hick warrior Blaine. This is a film that can be seen again and again, yet still entertains. Few films come close to it.",Null,0,1,22 April 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Should have been better
","This is another of those films that promised the world, but didn't deliver. Granted, its not bad, but it should have been so much better. The story and acting are all generally fine, but what is lacking is the biting violence of the first movie, and to a lesser degree T2. By going for a 12A rating, the team behind this accepted that it would have to be very tame so little kids wouldn't be scared. That is where it goes wrong. This film should have been an 18 without question. The action scenes are quite entertaining, but they never go far enough, and there is a scandalous lack of gore for a film claiming to be from the action genre. T3 summarises what is wrong with so many of today's films, they are antiseptic, pale imitations of their 80s forebears. Had this film been made in say, 1988, I have no doubt that whilst the special effects would have been much worse, the film overall would have been vastly more action packed. Arnie is on top form as the Terminator and the support stars are all fine, but when you look back at T1 and T2 you realise that this is not in the same league. Arnie should also have been in this film more often, that he wasn't detracts from the film. A missed opportunity.",Null,1,2,22 April 2005
Aliens," Outstanding sequel that replicates the glory of the first film
","Whereas Alien focused more on suspense, in Aliens the emphasis is on all out action and firepower. It doesn't disappoint! James Cameron directed the film, just two years after the success of Terminator and he was still clearly on top form back in 1986, long before the days of Titanic tarnished his legacy. The basic plot concerns the shady dealings of a big corporation which seeks to exploit the Aliens for financial reward, their value being high to the military. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley to advise on how to deal with the monsters, but quickly becomes indispensable to the army that is sent in to deal with the creatures. Large amounts of firepower are released, but casualties are high and the mission quickly becomes an escape attempt. Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, two of the most underrated action stars around, add a good deal to the film along the way. There are massive numbers of aliens in this sequel, in contrast to the single deadly killer of film one. A longer film than Alien, it nevertheless doesn't waste a second and the Director's Cut has some nice added scenes as well. The conclusion is brilliant, Sigourney going all guns blazing to rescue the kid from the clutches of the queen alien! Cue loads of machine gun action! As far as action films go, this is pretty much perfect.",Null,0,1,14 June 2005
The Exorcist," Very 70s but not too bad
","This is one of those films that you can't fail to have heard about before viewing it. Famous for being banned, it certainly has some controversial scenes, but nothing that will destroy civilisation. The story is of a young girl, for some reason called Regan, who is possessed by the devil. She becomes rather rude and demented, her manners vanishing noticeably. An exorcist is called in to sort things out, but finds that Regan is a tough cookie to crack. The young girl is absolutely barmy and there are some chilling moments when she loses control and attacks people, but luckily it all works out in the end. The famous head turning scene looks a but comic nowadays, whilst the vomit episode has been spoofed so many times its hard to view seriously. Nevertheless, this is a good film.",Null,1,2,27 May 2005
Alien vs. Predator," A wasted opportunity
","AVP could have been one of the best films ever made...however it must be considered one of the worst. Fans expecting plenty of action and violence will be very disappointed by this stale offering. It has obviously been heavily watered down to get a lower rating, thus allowing younger people to see it. This was a mistake. The film should have been an 18, no question. The Alien and Predator monsters are still fantastic creatures, but in AVP you get the feeling that they are barely exerting themselves. There is a distinct lack of blood and gore, and nowhere near enough firepower. The original Alien and Predator movies had all that in bucketfulls, AVP has a few lame action sequences, too many of them ending quickly and cutting away before the real violence can be seen. As for the cast, only the great Lance Henrikson adds anything to the movie, but he is underused. The rest are all Z-listers who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The wordplay is dire and you soon find yourself wishing they would all be eaten by the aliens! The plot is also poor. AVP suffers because Sigourney, Arnie and Danny Glover are all absent. One of them should have been included. AVP is a wasted opportunity that will leave true action fans cold. Don't bother with it, it only tarnishes the franchise.",Null,4,8,20 April 2005
Meet the Fockers," Succeeds where so many sequels fail
","I was expecting something fairly poor before I watched this, but I have to say that this was a pleasant surprise. So many sequels have been obvious cash-ins that you have to be sceptical about follow-up films. Thankfully this is good humoured fun. The big names from Meet the Parents are all back, De Niro again stealing the show as the control freak ex-CIA dad! Stiller is also on fine form as the unlucky Greg. Basically, this is something of a rehash of film 1, but its done very well. Dustin Hoffman was an inspired choice as Greg's dad, whilst Barbara Streisand is surprisingly good as his mum. By having such wacky and off-the-wall parents for Greg, there's a great contrast to the serious and up-tight parents that we met in film 1. The parental clash seems to be between ultra-Republicans and laid back liberals, but this makes for some good comedy. There are plenty of embarrassing moments in this, which repeats the theme of film 1. Worth watching.",Null,0,0,27 May 2005
Zulu," Patriotic brilliance
","The central theme of Zulu is of plucky British resistance against a vastly larger enemy force of highly skilled warriors at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. The battle scenes are first rate and entertainingly capture the spirit of Victorian colonial warfare. Baker and Caine excel as the British officers, ably backed up by an excellent cast. The historical background to the film is equally interesting, Britain's troubles with the local population in Africa leading to bloody fighting and destruction. The great bravery and comradeship of the British Army is captured nicely, whilst the supreme talents of the Zulu warriors are also recreated spectacularly for the audience. The real history behind the film differs somewhat according to what you read and Zulu certainly played up certain themes to produce a more gung-ho picture, but overall it cannot be faulted. The whole film exudes professionalism and is well worth seeing.",Null,7,9,6 May 2005
Driven," Has a film ever had more wrong with it?
","Driven is possibly the worst film ever made by Sly Stallone. There are so many things wrong with this film that its difficult to know where to start. Sly wants us to believe that Driven is depicting Formula One, yet it is painfully obvious to anybody with even a remote knowledge of motorsport that the single seaters in this flick are Champ Cars! Also, since when did Formula One cars start racing round ovals Sly? Can you answer that? No of course you can't, because the only Formula One oval action comes at the final turn of the Indianapolis circuit! The standards of acting in this film are beyond embarrassing, they are utterly imbecilic! Sly is as wooden as mahogany, whilst Burt Reynolds does an extremely poor Frank Williams impression. Oh what Sly? Was that supposed to be convincing. The film has no credibility at all! This film is so unbelievable it is annoying! The scene in which Sly and his team-mate race Champ Cars around the streets AT NIGHT IN FULL TRAFFIC WITHOUT HELMETS is so absurd that some kind of fine needs to be imposed! Firstly, it is impossible to start a Champ Car without electronic help and a team of mechanics, secondly your face would be blown apart even at low speed in a Champ Car minus helmet and thirdly, the bumps and potholes of an unprepared street would probably destroy the suspension! Come on Sly, how on earth did you think you could get away with that one? The acting is appalling, nobody shines in any way. The lines couldn't be more clichéd. The racing scenes look less convincing that some cheap old computer game. The storyline is dire and couldn't be more predictable if it got down on its knees and begged! The ending defies belief and is possibly the most contrived conclusion I have ever seen! Sly what were you thinking? This is junk! This is filth! This is beyond terrible! I cannot express how completely rubbish Driven is! Sly has starred in many great movies, Rambo and Copland springing to mind, but with this tepid offering he gives massive ammunition to his critics! In fact he gives them a nuclear bomb!!!!!!!!! Driven is one of those films that should never have been made! Sly we know you wanted to make Rocky on wheels, but with this you have tarnished your entire career!!! This film should win awards for how unbelievably bad it is! Worth seeing if only to marvel at how wrong Sly got it.",Null,0,1,21 April 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Merits a place in a cinematic hall of shame, its that bad!
","So much has been achieved by mankind over the ages. Man has walked on the moon, Concorde was able to break the speed of sound and the car has brought greater degrees of mobility to billions. How then can mankind have conspired to produce this film. It is so unforgivably tedious that those responsible for it should be charged with crimes against humanity. It's that bad! The endless song and dance routines sap the very life out of you. So over-the-top is the acting that one feels urges to unleash shotgun justice on all the participants immediately. All of the major characters are outrageously annoying, all of the minor characters invite your derision. The songs are appalling, but in the worst possible way. They stay in your mind and poison your sleep. You hum the tunes for days afterwards vainly hoping to forget their sheer banality! I cannot emphasise enough how bad this film is. Jim Broadbent is a fine actor, but he should hang his head in shame for starring in this sorry rubbish. To anybody with even an ounce of common sense regarding their film tastes, do not watch this movie! It will haunt you for days! This film has probably driven fathers to drink, their marriages have collapsed, their kids have turned to crime, people have been murdered and all because of this horrific offering. Moulin Rouge is probably the worst film ever made in terms of how much it will bore you to tears. Avoid it like the plague.",Null,6,13,21 April 2005
Children of Men," Highly accomplished
","Children of Men is the best film I have seen at the cinema this year. I didn't expect it to be so good, but it more than surpassed my expectations. The story concerns a world in which fertility has mysteriously ended, rendering the human race to a fate of extinction within 50 years or so once everybody has finally died. Set in 2027, the world is a bleak and violent place, in which military rule plays a large part in everyday life as law and order have collapsed and terrorism grows. Clive Owen, a former peace activist who has turned to fags and booze to ease his pain at earth's sufferings, is reluctantly drawn into an underground battle between terrorists out to promote immigrant rights and the authorities keen to persecute all opposition. When he discovers an immigrant woman who is pregnant, he realises he must help her find the 'human project', an undefined but much-hoped for scheme to save humanity. Cue lots of chases and thrills as he battles violent terrorists on the one hand and trigger happy troops on the other. Along the way, we meet Michael Caine, sporting a silly wig and seeming to portray a cardy slut. Children of Men certainly has its lighter moments and is worthy of great recognition. Go and see it!",Null,2,5,24 September 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Toilet humour galore
","This is a great film, well worth seeing a few times and just as funny now as it was over a decade ago. It's essentially a vehicle for Jim Carrey to show off his array of face pulling and odd voice skills with Jeff Daniels starring as his retarded mate. The film is all about their journey across the States to deliver a briefcase to some chick that Carrey has the hots for. Naturally she doesn't feel the same! There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Carrey can't stop urinating into beer bottles whilst Daniels is driving. The subsequent stoppage by the Old Bill sees the cop make a poor choice when he decides to take a swig from one of Carrey's offerings... That pretty much sums up the film, toilet humour, but its all well done! The undoubted highlight of the film is Daniel's frantic attempts to find a toilet to relieve an urgency brought on by Turbolax! Ensconced on his bird's bog he's let it all out and then some before she utters the immortal line 'I hope you're not using the toilet, it doesn't flush'! Comedy gold! There are numerous other funny scenes, too many to mention really. When the focus switches to the serious characters the pace can be a tad slow, but thankfully these scenes are fairly short. The soundtrack features plenty of easy listening 90s and late 80s rock, all harmless enough. Dumb and Dumber is Carrey's best film by far, its a shame that we haven't seen anything of this calibre from him for so long. Another of those films best seen as a group.",Null,0,2,21 April 2005
The Evil Dead," A film that aims to shock
","The Evil Dead is one of those movies that sets out to offend. It certainly succeeded in offending the British censors in the 80s who promptly banned it! Whilst most of the film now looks hideously dated and isn't at all harmful, there is one scene which even I feel went a bit too far. The scene where a young woman is 'assaulted' by a tree, was, I felt, in very bad taste and really didn't need to be included. Aside from that, the plot is the usual 'five youngsters go to a remote house and get attacked etc'. It's all done fairly well and with extreme gore. The special effects are cheap and nasty, but they do the job. As horrors go, this is one of the best. No character will escape unharmed. It shouldn't be banned, but those who easily offend will not like it so stay away. More of a cult hit than a family film...",Null,0,2,12 December 2005
The Dark Knight," Excellent
","The Dark Knight was a fantastic surprise for me in that I really enjoyed it. I tend not to be into comic book films etc, but this was a very entertaining and action packed piece, with memorable characters and a decent plot. The Joker, of course, is the star of the film. I've never been a fan of the late Heath Ledger's films, but in this he was outstanding. The menace he conveyed was brilliant and he stole the film in every respect. Christian Bale made a good, understated batman, and there were good performances by the bloke playing Two Face and also Michael Caine. In England there has been plenty of controversy that the film was given a 12A rating, but I don't see why the Daily Mail is so insanely frothing at the mouth. Yes, its quite a violent film, but the actual attacks/incidents are not generally shown on-screen, more alluded to or the camera pans away etc. One scene in which the Joker stabs a man in the face was skilfully edited for impact, but wasn't gory as we didn't see any blood and so on. Overall, a brilliant film. My only criticism was that it was a tad too long, but I'd still happily buy it when it comes out on DVD.",Null,6,12,7 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," What's all the fuss about?
","The Harry Potter franchise is, to be quite honest, rather over-hyped. This fifth instalment was full of endless teenage angst moments, which bored the hell out of me. The acting, particularly in so-called 'emotional' moments, was moribund at best. The film features surprisingly little magic for a film about wizards; rather, it dwells on never ending references to the baddie, who turns up at the end of each film for a ding-dong with Potter. Boo-hoo. The special effects had all the panache of a squashed orange. So what happens in this film? Well, not much. Harry uses a spell in front of a 'muggle' which translates from geek to standard English as 'non-magician'. The powers-that-be get all hot and bothered and say he's out of Hogwarts. Sadly, he doesn't seek gainful employment, but weasles his way back in, as if there was ever any doubt! Harry bags himself a filly, for a snog, but seems to have eyes for some Irish lass as well. On the whole, a very poor effort this film: JK Rowling is one of those champagne socialists who's lucked into a few hundred million because people are so easily pleased.",Null,0,1,23 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Highly atmospheric classic
","What a great film. Few movies come as close to this for atmosphere. Kubrick manages to provide an excellent story played out over 2 and a half hours of superb screenplay. The real highlight is the score, a series of classical pieces, including Strauss. The many moral or ethical questions posed by the film are open to debate and I will not walk too far down the path of amateur psychologist. All I will say is, I think the film was about man's conflict with technology and all the issues that entails. Hal, the demented computer, is brilliant. Chilling and distant, Hal is an ideal 'baddy'. The film is not one for those with short attention spans with long sequences of no speech and often silence. It's great stuff though. The central plot concerns a mission in space which promises to find out startling new things about the universe: Hal's job is to safeguard the mission, even from the crew themselves. This is where the conflict originates. The crew question Hal's sanity and decide to switch him down. In a highly chilling scene, however, he lipreads the plotters intentions and takes 'suitable' action to stop them. The struggles between the last surviving crew member and Hal are highly entertaining and tension-packed. For such an old film, this looks good as well. The apes at the start are clearly there to provide the most imaginative scene-leap ever. 8/10.",Null,1,5,24 February 2006
Alice in Wonderland," well-crafted fantasy adventure
","There have been numerous versions of Alice in Wonderland, but Tim Burton's take on the famous story is a welcome addition. By bringing in some new plot lines and a different theme, Burton injects a bit of fresh energy into what is a well-known tale. We find Alice now entering womanhood, trying to fend off the unwanted marriage plans of a sickly aristocratic oik. Finding herself back in Wonderland, Alice has little recollection of her earlier visits; was it all a dream she wonders. As she travels further into Wonderland, she encounters many of the familiar faces, and they were portrayed very effectively. The Cheshire Cat was brilliantly voiced by Stephen Fry, whilst Alan Rickman did a fine turn as the caterpillar. Johnny Depp was an intriguing mad hatter and Helena Bonham Carter was good as the egocentric 'off with their heads' Red Queen, complete with bulbous head and giant red hair. The 3D special effects were good and made a good film that little bit richer. The colours were vibrant and the action scenes interesting. The film is obviously pitched at a younger audience, but has plenty of entertaining moments for parents too. Overall, the latest Alice flick was good fun.",Null,1,5,6 March 2010
Avatar," Incredible
","Some films just have to be seen on a giant screen and Avatar is perhaps the ultimate example. In 3D and at the pictures it looks stunning. I don't know how James Cameron and his team have done it, but Avatar is the most amazing visual experience I've seen from a film. The blend of colours and effects are spectacular. I've often been very critical of the so-called blockbusters which rely on special FX, but Avatar does it all so well. The story revolves around the battle to save the moon Pandora from the ravages of commercial miners. Clearly there are big themes concerning the rights of tribal peoples V imperial objectives. Leaving that aside, there is plenty of action, with very impressive set-piece battles featuring all kinds of futuristic military might taking on a range of weird creatures. The characters are interesting and engaging, with Sam Worthington a good lead as the disabled marine who is transformed via some unexplained techno-wizardry into a humanoid. The film was quite long, but never relented. A must-see at the cinema: if only I could afford a 3D home cinema!",Null,1,2,13 January 2010
Rocky III," The best Rocky film
","Rocky III is the franchises' best offering. Mr. T steals the show as heavyweight contender Clubber Lang who batters Sly early on in the film to win the world title. Cue a rematch in which Sly is out for revenge, and naturally annihilates his opponent after suffering implausible amounts of pain! The fighting is of course highly unbelievable but that's fine in Rocky III because it adds to its comic value. The movie does have a couple of stale moments, but overall its well worth seeing, if only for the look on Sly's face when his coach dies! Sly isn't very convincing in his portrayal of a man in anguish... Eye of the Tiger is a top theme tune, but the training scenes between Apollo and Sly needn't have been so camp.... On the whole however, Rocky III is not bad at all.",Null,9,12,22 April 2005
Psycho," One of those must-see movies
","What can be added to the praise that this film has received? Not much, so I'll just give my own personal reasons for liking it. The plot is superb and simple. A young gal nicks 40 grand and heads outa town. She ends up at a crusty old motel with a nutcase of an owner, Norman Bates. The odd chats, the murder in the shower, the cover-up, the hunt for the missing lady, the private eye's death, the unmasking of Bates' multiple personality. All brilliantly done. An excellent score as well, it really fits the picture. This film is no nonsense and also highly entertaining. Numerous cinematic devices are employed by Hitch to great effect. The remake didn't have the same character for whatever reason. Black and white worked. I'd recommend the DVD with Hitch's personal tour of the set, it was very funny.",Null,0,1,18 February 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Brilliant
","One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest must be regarded as one of the best films of the 70s, if not all time. Jack Nicholson is at his absolute peak as Randle, the film's lead character. The film revolves around a pyschiatric ward and captures the sheer brutality that used to be witnessed in such places. The supporting cast is outstanding, very believable performances coming from those playing patients. Danny De Vito especially is very convincing in his portrayal of somebody with mental difficulties. Nicholson steals the show however as the wisecracking con trying to fake a mental illness in the mistaken belief that the ward will be easier than prison. The first half of the film is very upbeat and entertaining, the second sees things unravel spectacularly, leading to a very sad ending. There is nothing wrong with One Flew, its everything that a film should be. Rather than taking the usual Hollywood cop-out of a schmaltzy happy ending the film tries something much more rewarding. Full marks to all involved with the picture, its a credit to movie-making.",Null,0,2,21 April 2005
American Gangster," A classic already
","American Gangster is without doubt the finest film released this year. With a top-drawyer cast, atmospheric soundtrack and excellent storyline, it never flags despite a long running time of over two and a half hours. Frank Lucas is an ambitious black gangster who decides to cash in on his connections with the American military in Vietnam to transport enormous amounts of drugs back to the States. This puts the noses of his competition well out of joint, but Lucas quickly establishes his dominance. The film essentially tracks his rise and fall, Russell Crowe putting in a barnstorming performance as the cop who brings him to justice. American Gangster has some very stylish violence, but never strays into glorification. Go and see this flick ASAP.",Null,1,4,21 November 2007
Platoon," Thoughtful and poignant demonstration of war
","Platoon is a masterclass of how to make a film with a message. The underlying theme of Platoon concerns the ultimate horror and sometimes futility of war. Set in Nam' during the late 60s we follow the war through the eyes of a raw young volunteer (Charlie Sheen). Starting out full of ideology and belief in his cause, his experiences lead him to conclude that war entails enormous and often wasteful sacrifice. At times, Platoon is very sad; scores of young soldiers, often friends, being slain in combat. We witness the internal rivalries that split an army, the cynicism that can develop and the differing methods of coping with battle. Platoon is not a sensationalist war movie. It has a deep statement that many viewers may resonate with. The action scenes are well staged and take place very much from the perspective of the man 'at the front'. The cast does not feature any major stars, but perhaps because of this, Platoon can be viewed without the Hollywood cult of personality. It perfectly suits its' genre; a war film that plays it straight. One for any collection.",Null,4,7,9 October 2005
1408," genuinely chilling horror
","I don't tend to enjoy horror films, but 1408 was absolutely stunning. The plot was simple, but well-executed. John Cusack plays a writer who churns out populist 'haunted house' books which expose the myths and hearsay of hotel owners eager to pull the wool over tourists' eyes. He receives word that room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel has a blood-curdling past and is eager to stay in the room to prove that it is all made-up. He arrives at the hotel and the manager, played by Samuel L Jackson, does everything he can to talk him out of staying in 1408, but Cusack persists and gets his way. As Cusack is taken up to his floor by lift, the anticipation builds and Jackson offers one final warning, but his advice is rejected. Cusack checks into room 1408 and has no idea what is in store for him. At first glance, he is totally unimpressed and believes the room is just like any other. His cynicism lulls him into a false sense of security. Hereafter, the film really starts to get tense, as small oddities begin to occur and you get the sense that Cusack isn't alone in the room. Before long, Cusack himself grows concerned and his early swagger is replaced by mounting fear. The suspense of the film increases and increases, with Cusack coming under siege from numerous evil spirits and ghosts. He seeks in vain to escape the room, but to no avail, before a few red herrings indicate it was all a dream. He wakes up on a beach and is seemingly free from a vivid nightmare. Yet this is all an illusion and he finds that he never escaped. Ultimately, it becomes plain that he will never leave room 1408 and he goes out with a bang, destroying it in a haze of flames. There were so many genuinely chilling moments, that this has to rank as one of the best horrors for many years. It had echoes of the Shining. Definitely a film worth watching.",Null,0,0,29 December 2010
Blade Runner," Overrated sci-fi that nevertheless has some merit
","I have mixed feelings about Blade Runner. It has an excellent storyline and general plot: a blade runner has to track down and kill some crazy replicants intent on vengeance etc. The atmosphere of the movie is brilliant and the music is ideally suited to it. The portrayal of the future looks great: dark, ominous skies and technological advancements combining to form a bleak and desolate world. What lets the film down, however, is the acting of Harrison Ford. He just doesn't seem to have put the effort in. His lines are delivered with all the panache and elan of a stroke victim. I have never seen a lead so lazy in his acting. The general pacing of the film is also a tad too slow, at times we have to suffer Ford's interminable monologues with nothing of substance happening for minutes. The film rallies towards the end and has a few brilliant closing scenes, not least Rutger Hauer's impressive turn as the chief replicant, going mad and then coming to terms with his own mortality. Hauer is the star of the film in fact. Overall then, this is a good film, but not a great one. The story promises so much, but somehow it just doesn't deliver quite how I'd like it to. 6/10.",Null,0,1,5 March 2006
Casino Royale," Bond is back on form at last
","After a few lazy efforts in the series, Bond is well and truly back on form in Casino Royale, a film that restores some much-needed swagger to the franchise. I have to admit, I was a sceptic about Craig playing Bond, having never heard of him before he was cast etc etc. How wrong I was. Craig delivers a bravura performance right up there with the best: he can blend subtle humour with all the hardman/cool dude stuff so crucial for a film of this type. The plot in this was fairly simple: Bond has to win big at the casino to stop the baddies funding terrorism with their winnings. Its all done very well, with some really excellent action sequences, especially the epic chase early on when Bond is after some Ugandan bloke with crucial information. What was odd, however, was the idea that Bond has just become 007. We therefore have to more or less ignore the other films and imagine he's starting out again. The movie is much more modern than recent efforts and although this made for a grittier and better quality picture, I couldn't help but miss old characters like Q and Miss Moneypenny, although the latter more or less crocks up as Vesper, Bond's new bird. I'm no fan of Judi Dench and would prefer her to sit out future sequels, but the film was so good she didn't detract. Overall then, this is one of the best Bond films I've seen. So much so that I viewed it twice in three days and may well go again! You should do the same if you haven't already.",Null,1,3,21 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Finally they make another 'old school' action movie!
","The Die Hard series is always good value, but after a decade and more since the last film, I was worried that the fourth instalment would be weak. How wrong was I? Die Hard 4 is absolutely stunning, with ridiculous amounts of action, one-liners and general mayhem thrown in. Some of the set-pieces are top-drawer, especially the scene in which McLane speeds a car towards a helicopter, jumps out, with the car launching up into the chopper, a massive explosion the result! Of course, McLane is hurt, but a few scenes later seems recovered as if nothing happened! Pure gold! This film is 'old school'. The hero doesn't pussyfoot around, he unleashes shotgun justice as and when its necessary. The amount of firepower in this film is something which will please fans of the other films, there's plenty in there! The comedy is good too, especially McLane's struggles to contain his mirth in the company of the supergeek Warlock! Go and see this film NOW! Then order the DVD! Its that good!",Null,2,5,7 August 2007
Click," An interesting plot and a few good laughs
","Click has a pretty interesting central plot, although it also exhibits plenty of American film clichés. A workaholic husband and father (Adam Sandler) just can't manage to spend that crucial 'quality time' with his 'wonderful' family. Pressure from the egomaniac boss (the Hoff) forces him to devote most of his time to corporate brown nosing. Living on a diet of fast food and with little chance to unwind, Sandler's character is headed for disaster it seems. He then meets a kooky professor type (Christopher Walken) who gives him a 'universal remote' which promises to make life easier. As Sandler begins to explore the capabilities of this device, he finds that he can pause life, fast forward and even go back in time to revisit his 'greatest hits' so to speak. Initially, it all seems to work so well: he can spend more time at home, whilst easily managing his work. Yet things begin to unravel: the remote memorises his commands, so when one night he can't be bothered to put the effort in to making love to his stunning wife (amazingly!) he fast forwards!!! From that moment on, he never gets to experience sex, its always fast forwarded. The device takes over his life as he misses more and more of its experiences. Things spiral out of control, as he skips divorce, an enormous weight gain and even the death of his father (the Fonze). This film has a fairly serious message about making the most of life and not passing things by, no matter how annoying they are etc. Its all back-of-a-cigarette-pack level philosophy, but its OK for a film like this. The ending was suitably contrived, but that was to be expected in such an American mainstream comedy. It was surprisingly short of laughs by the end as it took on a much more serious tone than expected. Walken was good as the crazy professor, but you have to ask yourself, should such a renowned actor really be plying his trade in such a throwaway flick? I guess the pay was too tempting! Career resuscitation was offered to the Hoff and the Fonze, making this something of an old-timer comeback. On the whole, I enjoyed Click, but what would have pleased me would have been a nasty ending to shock the audience from their cosy expectations.",Null,1,2,12 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the Star Wars batch
","The Empire Strikes Back is a pleasant enough film on the whole, with a nice easy to follow story and some likable characters. It can only really be described as a kids film, but is still worth a look for adults. Why it has spawned people who worship it is beyond my powers of observation, presumably super sci-fi fans would disagree. The least entertaining aspect of the film is the laborious collection of training scenes between Skywalker and the warrior frog Yoda. They seem to go on for ages, yet add nothing to the film. For an early 80s flick, the special effects aren't too bad, whilst there is a nice twist at the end when Vader turns out to be Skywalker's dad. When he cuts off Skywalker's hand however, you will be left unimpressed, not a trace of blood! Overall, not bad, but hardly a classic as so many people seem to regard it!",Null,0,1,10 May 2005
Sin City," Not your usual Hollywood fare
","I'm in two minds about Sin City. Parts of it were quite entertaining, yet there were moments when I felt that the whole thing had become more than a little over-pretentious. Overall though, this is not a bad film, but is certainly an acquired taste. It will appeal to comic book fans, but not being one myself I can't be sure what makes 'em tick! Anyway, the film is essentially a series of segments in which we follow one of the leading characters for say 20 or 30 minutes as they meander around Sin City. There's a good deal of violence, generally cleverly done, but action fans be warned, this gets a bit artsy at times. The way this is filmed evokes the film noir spirit, with splashes of colour thrown in to emphasise key themes et al. Sin City is certainly stylish. However, the drawback of following one leading character for so long is that when you chance upon one you dislike you're stick with them for too long. Bruce Willis was on fine form, but Clive Owen hardly sets the world alight with his performance. Mickey Rourke was strange, but does that make his scenes good? It's all down to your own film tastes I suppose. Red blooded male viewers will be pleased to see a dazzling array of scantily clad ladies throughout the film, a bonus when some of the dialogue gets a tad dull in particular. Elijah Wood makes an odd appearance and dies a rather inventive death in one of the film's highlights. Basically, Sin City has enough good moments to entertain, but in the middle I began to wish it would finish soon. Luckily it rallies somewhat towards the end, thanks especially to a good turn from Willis. Sin City won't appeal to everyone, but its worth a look.",Null,1,2,13 June 2005
Gangs of New York," De Niro or Pacino would have made this a classic
","This was a film that given the right cast could have been rather impressive. It didn't, so it wasn't. In short, the film suffers from the presence of Mr.DiCaprio, a man so utterly devoid of acting abilities that he should be prohibited from ever starring in anything again. He stumbles through the film looking less like a man and more like a delinquent paper boy. The script is fairly self-righteous and just a bit too dull in my opinion, making Gangs of New York one to miss. The much hyped battle scenes are also a tad pedestrian and really should have been much more violent and gritty. Somebody like Robert De Niro or Al Pacino could have taken this film and made it their own, but by having such a poor leading man this is not one of cinema's best offerings, far from it in fact! Day-Lewis should not be so smug either, he didn't put in such a good performance in my view, over the top but not funny, a poor combo. Overall this film is a waste of time.",Null,1,4,30 April 2005
Braveheart," Disgracefully bad
","Mel Gibson has an awful lot to answer for. Braveheart is despicable tosh that distorts historical truth beyond all decent conventions. So much in this film is a lie that the uneducated masses with no previous knowledge of the period will believe something that just didn't happen. There is so much that is inaccurate in Braveheart that I shall only mention a few key errors, all of them unforgivable. For a start William Wallace and Edward I did not die at the same time, as is implied, in fact Edward died a couple of years later! Also, Willy Wallace certainly did not father the future Edward III that is also alluded to. The English thrashed the Scots in 1298, but in this film it appears that the Scots put up more of a fight. Wallace certainly did not fight with Robert the Bruce after the battle either! Gibson distorts the truth to satisfy his rabid anti-English opinions. The man is a bigoted idiot with no respect for history. Moving on to the film itself, there are a few so-so battle scenes, but the rest of the film is essentially false junk. The dialogue is ponderous and moronic, whilst the first hour is utterly soul destroying so boring is it. There is a nice scene when Edward I throws a chap out of a window, but if that's the highlight of a film you know there are problems! People should not be taken in by this rubbish. Had Edward I survived a little longer in reality he stood a good chance of conquering Scotland so weak was the Bruce dynasty. Anyway, avoid this movie, it is nothing but anti-English propaganda!!!",Null,4,11,10 June 2005
Gladiator," A very accomplished film
","Gladiator is one of the best films of this decade. Crowe is on top form as the lead, Oliver Reed putting in a handy turn as his mentor. The battle scenes are epic, especially those between Barbarian Germans and Roman troops at the start. The warrior fights are also very well done, plenty of blood being spilt. The storyline is interesting and not too cheesy, unlike so many other Hollywood movies today. The only blot on this film's copybook is Richard Harris who's monologues are just a tad dull. Phoenix is not bad as the villain however. The musical score works nicely too. Gladiator is well worth seeing and for a 15 rating contains plenty of action.",Null,0,1,10 May 2005
Back to the Future," Fantastic 80s movie
","Back to the Future is a film that really rewards a repeat viewing. The plot is highly entertaining and has something for everyone. Michael J Fox stars as Marty McFly, a wannabe rock star and high school pupil who gets drawn into time travel by the Doc (Christopher Lloyd). The Doc's creation is a DeLorean which is hooked up to nuclear power and takes McFly back to 1955! The car itself looks incredibly cool and to the people of 1955 looks like some kind of space ship. The plot sees McFly encounter his parents when they were his age, with lots of butterfly effect moments threatening to unsettle the space time continuum! At one point, McFly accidentally prevents his parents from meeting and falling in love, thus risking his never being born. There are some really funny moments when his mother begins to fall for him, rather than his father, forcing him to take ever more desperate risks to make sure his dad ends up as her husband. The best scene for me is where McFly lays down a fantastic cover of Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode to a bemused 50s audience, complete with wildly over-the-top 80s style electric guitar solos. The film gets more outlandish, before McFly and the 1955 version of the Doc manage to send the DeLorean back to 1985. This is a very impressive family movie, with plenty of action, comedy and an interesting storyline. The sequels were also top-notch, although the third film didn't quite match the standard of films one and two for me. Overall, though, one of the best trilogies ever made.",Null,0,0,17 February 2010
Atonement," A sad film
","I had no idea what this film was going to be about, having heard nothing of the book and seen no trailers. What a pleasant surprise. This was a thoughtful and, at times, rather sad piece, with some strong acting. Keira Knightley's new lover is accused falsely of a terrible crime and carted off to jail, eventually ending up in the army during World War Two as an alternative to staying in prison. The film chronicles the breakdown in Knightley's relationship with her younger sister, who had accused the lover. The mood is pretty bleak at times and the film ends on a surprising note for someone unaware of the book. The sense of desperation experienced by soldiers at Dunkirk was well captured. Not a film I would traditionally go for, but well worth the time.",Null,0,0,10 October 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Hit and miss
","This movie is essentially a series of sketches and one-off jokes. Some work, some don't, but on the whole, this is likable, if instantly forgettable fun that will keep you entertained for a short while. Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a man who has taken Nascar by storm with his win-or-bust approach to racing. As he makes his millions and wins plenty of races, a challenger appears in the form of Sacha Baren Cohen, playing a gay French driver from Formula One. The two then battle for supremacy etc etc. The plot isn't really important to be honest. Certain set piece scenes were very funny, such as the shocked reaction of the sports commentators on finding out the Frenchman bats for the other side! Somewhere in this film there's a message about how wonderful it is to love your family blah blah blah, but ignore that and just enjoy the jokes. I have to say I'd much prefer to see proper coverage of the real Nascar here in England, but in the absence of that, I'll watch pretty much anything to do with it.",Null,0,1,24 September 2006
