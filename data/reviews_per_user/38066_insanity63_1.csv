Requiem for a Dream," Watch it at all costs
","The only reason I believe this movie deserves an 8 is because it caused me to go into a state of panic and depression.AVOID this movie at all costs unless you want to get some mental therapy later.Honnestly the acting as great. Ellen burstin's craziness & paranoia was magnificently acted. She made me feel deeply sad about her state of loneliness and yearning for acceptance, A+. Jard Leto was annoying as usual, but nothing less can be expected. And Jennifer Conolly played her usual callus self, brilliant and looked the part of a messed up crack head.Fantastic, but not my cup of tea.In a twisted way the Exorcist calmed me in the same light this movie etched on my sore spastic nerve.",8,0,1,14 June 2005
