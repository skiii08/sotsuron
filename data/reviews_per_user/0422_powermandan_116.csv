The Rock," One of the Best Action Flicks of the Decade.
","In the 1990s Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Wesley Snipes were some of the hottest action stars that came out with mindless but very cool violent movies. Occasionally, there would be an action movie not starring a 90s action icon. Furthermore, there would be an action movie that had all the right stuff that would make it stand beside Die Hard or Terminator. The Rock may not be at their level, but it is better than most action movies you see.The biggest hit for The Rock is its general premise: after locking down and taking over Alcatraz, a vengeful marine (Ed Harris) and his crew steal a lethal poison and place it in missiles and threaten to destroy San Francisco unless his fellow comrades get royalties they much deserve. Only an FBI chemical weapons expert (Nicolas Cage) and Alcatraz escapist (Sean Connery) know how to save the day.Sure it may sound like just a general hostage story, but knowing Harris' motives really set this apart from other hostage movies. I actually rooted for Harris to make it out alive and/or align with Connery and Cage after all hell breaks loose. He is so sympathetic and steals every scene he is in. He and Sean Connery are the deepest characters in the movie. Although they appear to be bad at first, your mind soon changes. Nicolas Cage is his usual flamboyant self who is not quite as likable as Connery or Harris. John Spencer, David Morse, and William Forsythe are the forerunners and they each help raise the quality of chemistry and plot development.Of course, an action movie has to be fast-paced and well choreographed in order to pass. And by-golly this does! Many awesome gunfights and explosions that cause the stakes to rise and plot to advance.Tremendous!3/4",9,3,4,4 September 2015
The Devil's Advocate," Entertaining As Hell!
","Pun intended for the title. While not many horror factors are incorporated, the constant subjects of the devil and hell and death are very creepy. But they are fun too.Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors on God's Green Earth, pulled off very sick devils. As an actor, playing either God or the Devil is one of the highest callings. De Niro pulled off a pretty sick devil in 1987's Angelheart. Ten years later, Pacino dazzles us with his own devil. Reeves is the movie's main character, but it is Pacino that steals the show. While Angelheart is a straight-up horror movie, De Niro's devil is simply scarier than Pacino's, as this is a thriller with a horror undertone. I also found this to be a better movie.Pacino plays the devil who is the head of the world's most powerful law firm located in New York City. He recruits Keanu Reeves, who's 64-0 record proves he can punish the guilty one day then make the guilty look more innocent than a child the next. Reeves and wife, Theron, move to a lavish New York life, too good to be true. Reeves is unaware what's on the line as everything of his could go straight to hell.This really gives lawyers a bad name. Sadly, it is true. Sometimes, lawyers can be bad people as they free monsters. This Gothic fairly tale makes fun of this theory in an-over-the-top way, that is thrilling, fun, and scary. This was done before Keanu Reeves sold out and Pacino started doing good and bad movies, so both actors do mighty fine jobs. Supporting actors such as Charlize Theron and Craig T Nelson are just as good.3.5/4",9,5,5,9 December 2014
The Benchwarmers," The Concept Has Been Done, But The Movie Never Gets Old.
","The Benchwarmers does not star Adam Sandler, but it is a Happy Madison creation starring some of Sandler's best friends. His other best friends were off doing his other creation entitled 'Grandma's Boy' which as much better than this.This was back in the days when Sandler films were actually good and funny. This is not great, but it has good morals and truly funny moments.The Benchwarmers is about the bullying misadventures of three geeky friends: landscaper Gus Matthews (Rob Schneider); video clerk Richie Goodman (David Spade); and paper boy Clark Reede (Jon Heder). All have been subjected to bullying their whole lives and want it all to stop. When the guys witness a group of little league kids harass a nerdy rich boy, it reaffirms Gus' gift for baseball and gives Clark and Richie confidence. The guys meet the kid's billionaire father, Mel (Jon Lovitz), who has an idea to start a baseball tournament with them playing against the little leaguers. Just as the guys are blossoming and doing well in the tournament, a secret about one of them is revealed that changes everybody's perspective of the issue.Yes, there are flaws. Yes, most of them are forgivable. Mel says to start a round-robin tournament, but it is just regular one-game elimination: completely different from round- robin. Then there's the scene when they meet Mel: it makes no sense. Then there's Schneider's wife being played by Molly Sims: its always odd seeing a a hot chick that's taller than her ugly husband.Then there are flaws that are unforgivable (two to be exact). The first deals with the status of bullies and the victims. The Benchwarmers themselves--the geeks--have dead-end jobs that's just sad to see 40-year-olds do. Then the guys that bullied them when they were younger, (and still do) are successful business men and own their own stores. This is a very wrong message to send to people--if you bully, you will become a success. That's so wrong! A terrible message! If anything, it is the other way around!The other flaw is the reveal that I mentioned that changes the fate. It turns out that Gus was the biggest bully in his town at the time who picked on everybody hardcore. He picked so hard on one kid who was a midget so badly that he had to be put in a mental institution. Gus feels tremendous guilt and does not want to have kids because he is afraid of karma. When the story breaks, he gets kicked out of the team and everybody betrays him. I've always hated that aspect. Gus says on TV how bad bullying is. And it is very evident how much he's changed. He's such a great person now. He's not the same person he once was! His eyes are filled up with tears as he tries to hold back his cry of guilt after his friends find out about it. Does that not say something!? It leads to some good talk about bullies and everything, but they could have had that talk if the before part was changed!Luckily, the comedy makes up for this. Then there's how well the characters were written.3/4",6,0,0,13 April 2016
Scarface," Say Hello To My Little Friend!!!!!
","Godfather, Scarface and Goodfellas are the greatest mob movies ever made. The best is The Godfather, hands down. The second best is this--Scarface--a violent depiction of a Cuban refugee's rise to the top of the crime underworld. Al Pacino is at his most insane as protagonist, Tony Montana, a ruthless criminal from Cuba who makes his way to Miami is the Spring of 1980 with his best friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). As they get to know exactly what it is like in the Mafia, Tony explodes with fury and becomes the top mobster in the world. As Tony is riding high, his paranoia, greed and brutal actions make him a sought after target he can't escape. When Scarface in 1932 was released, it was a major controversy and was released a year late due to its extreme violence. Over 50 years later, similar things occur, with things almost being banned and nearly getting an X rating. This day in age, Scarface really isn't bad. Kids these days are exposed to profanity, sex, drugs and violence everywhere they go. Scarface is a very violent film, but other action directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam have made more violent movies than this. But what is good about the violence, not like I'm trying to make light on it, is how well choreographed and artful it is. DePalma is at his best here. And the acting...where was Pacino's Oscar? After a few years without a great flick, Pacino storms back, only to have another robbery. His accent is dynamic, this style is genius, his character is ruthless and evil, and that's so good. His determination to get to the top and protect everything he has is kind of inspirational: a nobody rises to the top of the world. Every rapper's house is not complete without Scarface. Every movie lover's house isn't complete without Scarface either.",10,0,2,21 November 2014
Antz," Shockingly Awesome!
","Antz was the second computer animated film after Toy Story as well as the first from Dreamworks. It is one of those controversial pictures for being very parallel to another movie--A Bug's Life. While A Bug's Life is a nicer family movie, Antz is an edgier ugly movie. After not watching this in nearly 17 years, I decided to check it out after seeing a list of movie copycats. I do not like CGI movies thinking they are clichéd, but Antz is definitely one of the few exceptions.Take one look at Antz and it is evident that it is a edgier than A Bug's Life. But I was shocked to see just how insane it was. Thinking it was going to be a movie for 10-year-olds, there was brutal violence, alcohol abuse, and actual profanity. An ant is drinking at a bar and I thought it was a little bit odd for a kid movie, then Sylvester Stallone's character actually says 'bitchin'.' After he says that, I was suckered in and thirsting for more.In Woody Allen's only animated role, he plays a little factory ant named Z who tries to find importance in his life. He falls in love with a Princess and switches place with his soldier friend (Stallone) in an upcoming battle with termites to impress her. Right away, the writing is witty and genius; easily the best writing I've heard in a movie like this, not because of any swearing. The battle is intense and creepy to some. Death is also played about pretty wild. A sole survivor, he returns and kidnaps the Princess. Her fiancé, General Mandible (Hackman) wants to destroy all factory workers, but Z's act of individualism sparks a revolution. Right after watching this, I saw Gene Siskel ranked it as the 7th best movie of 1998. I would also rank it 7th best of the year. It really is that good.4/4",10,1,2,28 February 2015
50 First Dates," Easily One Of Adam Sandler's and Drew Barrymore's Best.
","Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore scored high in classic 90s comedy, The Wedding Singer. Their second collaboration tops that, making it one of the best movies either party has done.Henry Roth (Sandler) is a vet from Hawaii and is the ultimate bachelor who gives girls the best first date of their lives, then ditches them. When he meets art instructor, Lucy (Barrymore), he realizes that he's finally ready for commitment. The catch? Lucy was in a car accident one year before and suffered a rare brain injury where she attain any new memory after the day of the accident. She lives everyday thinking it is her father's (Clark) birthday. They go on a series of dates, that is truly funny and heartwarming.This is the Adam Sandler I miss. He does wacky and immature comedy that plugs many laughs, and still gives a wondrous life lesson. The problem with him today is, he can't find an even balance between the two. The Grown Ups movies had good lessons, but weren't funny and the second one made no sense. Blended has a nice serious side, but was not funny at all. 50 First Dates is hilarious, makes sense, and has great seriousness that it needs. The main idea of this is that love has no boundaries. Henry doesn't mind that Lucy forgets who he is everyday, because he loves her so much and is willing to do anything for her. This general premise has been done, but 50 First Dates is nearly at their levels as a whole. The comedy and moral are at all-time highs for the two stars.3.5/4",10,1,1,19 January 2015
The Hangover," An Immediate Classic!
","2009's The Hangover launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifinakis and Justin Bartha, as well and revamping the career of comedy director, Todd Phillips. The four stars did star in several things before this, but where always pushed in the back and not very recognized, unless you've seen the movies many times. Todd Phillips did other classic comedies in the past such as Road Trip and Old School, but not a lot of good ones after Old School. I remember watching the trailer for this bout three times and knowing that it would be one of those typical, nowadays, dumb comedies. I actually thought this would be worse because of the lack of well-known stars. When I went to the theatres to watch it for something to do, The Hangover became one of my favourite comedies ever and one of my favourite movies in general. I was not expecting such a great flick at all.The Hangover follows Doug (Justin Bartha), who is just about to get married and goes to have a bachelor party in Las Vegasfor the night with his two best friends (Cooper, Helms) and soon-to- be brother-in-law, Alan (Galifinakis). By morning, Doug is missing, the three boys can't remember anything and see things they did that are best kept in Vegas. When Doug is found, it is a major surprise, at first. After many watches, Doug's whereabouts become very predicable, but the laughs stay the same.I remember watching this and thinking this was similar to Dude, Where's My Car? In that, two dudes search for their car with no memory and danger headed their way. In this three friends search for their groom with no memory and danger coming their way. But this is more serious since Dude was part sci-fi.Since its release, The Hangover has become the benchmark and measuring stick of R-rated comedies. Because if I'm not mistaken, The Hangover is the biggest R-rated comedy ever. MacGruber, Hot Tub Time Machine and We're The Millers have all been compared in some form or another to The Hangover. I thought it was much better than MacGruber, a bit better than Hot Tub and as good as Millers. The Hangover may last as comedy's big benchmark until there's another sleeper hit.What really makes this is the four main guys. Phil (Cooper) is a prep-school teacher who is the coolest guy of the group. Stu (Helms) is a geeky dentist and in great possession of his girlfriend. Alan is a stupid and highly immature man-child who grows attached his new friends. Doug has the least amount of screen time, but is pretty awesome when he is on screen. The chemistry and development is what makes these guys so cool. Other known stars include Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor and Mike Tyson who make the movie even better.4/4",10,1,3,24 December 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Cinema's Greatest Hero!
","AFI (The American Film Institute) ranked Indiana Jones the second best hero in film history after Atticus Finch. Why!? Atticus is a lawyer that loses his case! If there was a group of terrorists or evil Nazis, Atticus would last ten seconds at the most, whereas Indiana Jones could, and has, taken them. I know that Atticus is a realistic hero, but he is still a fake creation by author, Harper Lee. Indiana Jones is also a fake creation, but he is more of a hero than anybody else. To Kill A Mockingbird is a great movie, but its got nothing on Raiders. Laid back archaeology Professor Jones, is summoned to seek The Ark of the Covenant with special powers from the biblical day before the Nazis can find it. He then clads up his leather jacket, satchel, whip and cowboy hat, turning into his alter ego--Indiana Jones--an unbeatable adventurer that defies certain death. Two things set this apart from the other movies. Number one: everything is iconic. From the ball chasing him to the very end is a series of non-stop memorable moments and dialogue. Number two: the best story. Nothing against the other movies (even though the last one made no sense), but this one has the most complex storyline and subplots. Temple of Doom had the weakest (I like to say 'simplest') story, but fantastic action and thrills. Last Crusade had a stronger story, but had slightly inferior action and thrills. Raiders does the best in keeping the action, filming, thrills and story in an even proportion. A very, very high proportion. From a story aspect, this is held in high regard. From a technical aspect, this is held in an even higher regard.",10,2,5,15 December 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Greatest Sci-fi/Family Movie Of All Time!
","I don't think this is the best sci-fi movie in general. Check out the Star Wars flicks, for instance. Get a little more picky with the genre ET is, and it becomes the best. I have lost count with how many times I have seen this movie, but I don't care. It never gets old for me. In 1977, Spielberg created the sci-fi masterpiece 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' which perfectly balanced aliens and reality. Unfortunately, 1977 was also the year of what many believe to be the best sci-fi flick and the biggest movie at the time: 'Star Wars: A New Hope.' As majestic as Close Encounters was, Star Wars was easily the better film...by a long shot. Five years later, Spielberg tops Close Encounters with what was sure to be his best movie: 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.' Guaranteed a Best Picture or Best Director win, Spielberg loses both to Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi.' Attenborough always felt that ET was the superior movie, and many people these days think so, as Gandhi has not been able to stand the test of time. As A David Lean-esque film, Attenborough directs a marvellous film, but as a 'narrative picture' there's very few layers that make some scenes dry and boring and the overall product dragged out. 'Without the character of Gandhi, the movie is nothing.' ET is original, fun, shorter and touching. It follows the story of ten-year-old, Elliot (Thomas) who's parents are divorced, is non-comparable with his siblings (Barrymore, McNaughtan) and friendless. That is until a lost alien arrives and rebuilds him, and helps the alien. ET is not a kiddie or immature film. Everybody can see this and feel emotionally connected with is, as it is about feeling lonesome and how friendship can heel someone. Spielberg wrote the screenplay inspired by some of his own events, his parents got divorced and he felt alone in the world. Watching this can save and inspire people going through similar situations.",10,2,6,2 December 2014
Casablanca," The Most Magical Movie Ever Made.
","Humphrey Bogart is the coolest actor ever. Sure there are actors that are better than him, but none have his spunk that only he can deliver. After first starting off with movies, the world fell for his bad guy gimmick and he changed his birth-date to Christmas to make himself seem nicer (or so I read). His breakout role was in the complex mystery The Maltese Falcon, where he plays cop, Sam Spade, with an edge. Every cop after has just been trying to match Spade in toughness and coolness. Casablanca was the role that really made his versatility grow and made him one of cinema's greatest heroes.During this time, there was roughly a movie a week that was released. All of them blended in together very well and nobody really cared about Casablanca. It was based on a relatively unknown play and the actors treated this as if it was just another movie. Nobody knew this would stand the test of time and become more loved over the years. When Orson Welles made Citizen Kane, he knew it would become the best movie ever. The people in Casablanca could not say the same thing.Casablanca is said to be the greatest film of all time more than any other. The only other movie that's a worthy contender as the best ever is Citizen Kane. The Godfather is also a good rival. But Casablanca is a nicer and more feel-good movie than Citizen Kane and The Godfather,but it has mostly been Citizen Kane and Casablanca that have been rivals since the beginning. Citizen Kane changed the way movies are made with unbeatable camera tricks and the best delivery of a life lesson ever, whereas Casablanca uses just great acting, a great story, and great dialogue. It is about a tough nigh club owner in Casablanca, Morocco named Rick (Bogart) who re-encounters his old flame (Bergman) with her war hero husband (Henreid) laying low. Rick is the only one with letters of transit that can help them escape, and only she can convince him to do it.What makes a movie so good? It has to have good acting, a good script, a good look, great filming, be relatable and emotionally connecting. Casablanca has all of those, minus great filming techniques. What makes Casablanca so special? Awesome swing music a none swing fan would like; great acting by a star-studded ensemble; a wide variety of emotions such as comedy and excitement and drama; unbeatable and quotable dialogue, more than any other in film history; and the amount of love that's in this: he is willing to sacrifice himself for her, she wants to be with Rick, and Rick reawakens his love for her. This is raved as being the most romantic movie ever. There's crappy Zac Efron movies these days that are more romantic than this. But this has the best and most original love story ever.Since Casablanca's release, there have been various copycats and adaptations of it, but none have ever been able to capture its magic. It is the best movie that did not rely on any special effects or filming usages.4/4",10,1,2,22 December 2014
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The Best Live-Action/Animation Film Ever!
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit was not the first movie to combine cartoon with real things. It was just the best movie to do so and still remains the best.Who Framed Roger Rabbit helped popularize the double usage. Yogi Bear, Smurfs, Casper, and Alvin & The Chipmunks are some of the best known movies like Roger Rabbit of recent times. The first reason Roger Rabbit surpasses those is because of the kind of animation that is used. The pure CGI stuff used in Yogi Bear and Smurfs is easy as hell in comparison with this. The 80s was when people needed to draw out cartoons by hand. I highly doubt there were 50 frames drawn by hand per-second used for the cartoons, but whatever. I saw a special feature that looked through how the actors would be communicating with the cartoons, and that was enough. Roger Rabbit provides constant asking 'How do they do that?' I don't want to know anymore behind-the-scenes tricks because the magic would be lost.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not specifically for children. Kids under the age of 9 should be accompanied by adults. There's sexual innuendo, drinking, smoking, and profanity out of youngsters' reach. Besides, adults would appreciate the work that went into it and understand the story better. This is a neo-noir, so the story is guaranteed to be complex. Bob Hoskins plays a down-on-his-luck detective named Eddie Valiant who is sent to spy on Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica who is suspected of cheating on him with the owner of Toontown. It is true and Roger is heartbroken. The next day, the man is murdered and Roger is the prime suspect. Baby Herman explains Roger is innocent and mentions the man's plans of Toontown. Soon, Valiant uncovers a deadly conspiracy of betrayal, lies, deceit and murder in which Roger and his wife are just a small piece of the puzzle.This is a truly funny movie and all characters are lovable. This uses every film noir trick in the book but adds warmth and hilarity with wonderful cartoons.4/4",10,1,1,26 July 2015
Detroit," Adequate Recreation For A Dark Time.
","There's been lots of movies as of recent about racial equality. All their hearts are in the right places, but none are really great or come out at a high degree. 'Detroit' doesn't either, but it comes the closest.'Detroit' was released fifty years after the riots in 12 Street in Detroit. Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow brings this time to the screen in a riveting fashion. Although not as good as her 'Zero Dark Thirty' or 'The Hurt Locker,' 'Detroit' does show that she is one of the best directors working today.This movie deals with a mob of black people from Detroit that riot the streets to make a statement against racist police brutality. As a result of the riots, police get worse and so do the riots, so the vicious circle of violence is plunging the city into the ground. The first 20 minutes or so is just showing the web of violence with no development, just war on the street. Bigelow's two big films are war movies, so it was only natural to try to use her specialty in a different light. I found it unnecessary. I understand that the riots were basically wars on the streets, but riots tend to feature a great sense of brutality and unease. The movie doesn't get deep enough into the horrors of the riots.After awhile of seeing the violence in the streets, the movie finally switches gears and finally introduces the audience to characters we can root for in this awful time. Developing characters is key for the audience to get a real sense of danger they face. At the centre of it is the R&B group The Dramatics. They want a record deal and for the violence to just stop. They wind up at the Algiers Motel where they meet up with a couple of white girls. Having a good time, one of them has a toy gun that looks real and scares everyone. It's pretty funny. The gun can use blanks and shoots it as a joke to show how insane the police force has gone. The police arrive thinking there's snipers and violently raid their room. The room is far too big to be a motel room, so I didn't buy it entirely. The police violently scare and abuse each person into making them confess to where the gun is. This second act is pretty similar to Truman Capote's 'In Cold Blood.' If you are familiar with 'In Cold Blood,' you will likely appreciate the seemingly coincidental parallels between the two. This large chunk of the film works so well because Bigelow pulls no punches and really tries to evoke emotion though great movie-making and accuracy of police horror. Will Poulter is at his most vicious as the lead cop that terrorizes these innocent people. The 'In Cold Blood' aspect takes up the majority of the film over something trivial. But cops really were like that. The gun was never found, the cops get off scot-free, and no one knows exactly what happened.Here's why it will always remain a mystery of what exactly happened: the cops were brutalizing these people, keeping them in one position so they could not see everything that was happening. And the cops just stick with their story.After the 'In Cold Blood' chunk of the film, it sumps into a generic courtroom drama. The first and final acts are too generic to make the movie as a whole live up to its potential. It's similar to 'Cast Away' in that respect: people only want to see Tom Hanks on the island, before and after that are boring.The cops are one-dimensional and the character development is not very high either, so the overall value does not reach its potential. And two of the three acts are average. Saved by a great middle, 'Detroit' is an adequate movie I recommend to be watched.3/4",7,0,1,5 December 2017
Citizen Kane," Rightfully Called The Greatest Film of All Time.
","Just what makes a great movie? One that is sure to stand the test of time and take your breath away? It must have: a compelling script, strong development and chemistry in the plot and between the characters, excitement, emotionally-connecting, great camera tricks/computer enhancements, great sets and costumes, and has a strong message. Very few films possess all of these traits and Citizen Kane was the first one to do so. The make-up is flawless, the camera tricks are sheer genius and unrepeatable, astonishing acting, and you feel just about every kind of emotion possible. Citizen Kane has been raved as being the greatest film of all time more than any other movie. If Casablanca or The Godfather outrank it in a list, Citizen Kane is right behind them. Everybody that disagrees with this not being THE best will certainly think it was great to say the least.Citizen Kane follows the rise and fall of a controversial newspaper tycoon with reporters trying find the meaning of his dying word: 'Rosebud.' At the very end, you find out what Rosebud is and it explains nothing. Orson Welles leaves it up to you to figure out why Rosebud is so meaningful and how it is always relevant. Kane wanted people to love him and wanted various things to make himself happy. The richer he grew, the less happy he became. Rosebud symbolizes the last period of his life where he was ever truly and shows that money cannot buy happiness. Money not buying happiness is a subject that has always been talked about and will always be talked about. But Welles executes it in such a way that is sure to have a lasting impact on the viewer. Sure the movie possesses everything positive about a movie, but the way the message is delivered makes it more than a just a piece of cinema. No other movie has ever been flawlessly made with a strong delivery of an important life lesson.4/4",10,4,6,28 July 2014
Monster," The Best Performance of the Decade and One of the Best of All Time!
","I was not even ten when this movie came out. But seeing promotional material was quite disturbing and I had a hunch that if I were to see that I wouldn't be able to handle it. My parents didn't even allow me either. Fast-forward years later to a time where I am an adult and nothing phases me, I decided to watch Monster because I never forgot the acclaim it received. I shouldn't say that nothing phases me, sometimes movies do depress me, but Monster is one of the few films that really packs a punch. Charlize Theron is the best in this, but I was also surprised at how much more the movie had to offer other than her embodiment.The only flaws I would like to point out are the lack of facts given to the backstory of infamous serial killer and protagonist of the film, Aileen Wuornos. Not much is said about her early criminal activity and violent behaviour prior to the movie's timeline, including a failed marriage that she had when she was 20. The movie treats Aileen as if the murder of her first john was when her reign of terror began. Well, that's Hollywood for you! Luckily the changes made aren't that bad and don't effect the overall experience much.Aileen Wuoronos was a woman from an abusive family who had a long criminal record, a very early pregnancy and severe abuse and mistreatment from everyone around her. She never experienced any love, and that takes a toll on her mental health and perception of the world around her. Charlize Theron transforms herself into Aileen in ways that must seem painful and plays her to a t. Her wide-eyes, trembling, and deep stares, and overwhelming emotion really make this such a hard character to play. But Theron does it and does it right. Wuornos moves to a town in Florida where she stumbles into a gay bar and meets unhappy lesbian, Selby. Christina Ricci always captivates the audience with her performances, with her role as Selby being added to the list. Although not as good as Theron, Ricci is still great. Apparently, Selby was not the real person involved with Aileen because of permission purposes. I don't think much difference would have been made if they used the real girl involved with Aileen.Aileen and Selby are the only good people that each other has known for quite some time. Selby is living with family friends who are not supportive of her sexuality. And I already stressed Aileen's loss of hope. Although Aileen is not a lesbian, it is the emotional comfort that she finds in Selby that leads to anything sexual.The first john that Aileen kills is the most disturbing part of the film. She is beaten, raped, and is about to be raped hard to certain death before she is able to make an escape and kill him in self- defence. She then quits prostitution and hunts for real jobs to support her and Selby. Her lack of qualifications, criminal record, and unprofessionalism cause her to fail the interviews and she returns to prostitution. She goes on to kill more johns and steal their money, some of the johns of whom aren't even violent. But she is reminded of before and is determined to provide. Complications with the johns arise and loyalty with Selby becomes tested, which leads Aileen's to life in behind bars before being executed in 2002.I have seen Youtube videos of the real Aileen and it is more than evident that she was mentally ill. Instead of jail, she should have been in an insane asylum. She is scary in some videos, but it's not her fault. She is the perfect example of somebody suffering from the Battered Woman Syndrome. And, I can't express enough just how amazing and convincing Charlize Theron is. But aside from her, everybody is mighty fine. And the writing was great too. It wasn't a picture full of just crying and yelling and rape. There's actual layers, and juice...themes. Some of these are primary components that lots of these depressing factual films lack.Monster is an amazing and compelling movie about acceptance and love. It may be a sad watch, but it is definitely worth it.4/4",10,1,1,10 October 2016
Shakespeare in Love," Everything A Movie Should Be! Just Not The Best Of 1998.
","I am a huge Shakespeare fan, so I found this movie very captivating and well-done. This had everything a movie should have to high degrees. That is why it won so many awards. Thing is, as much as other say, this is not 1998's best movie. Like others, I agree that Saving Private Ryan is the best. But my personal favourite is American History X, as it has the best acting and I have a deep personal connection with it. But SIL is a better piece of film than AHX. If I'm not mistaken, Shakespeare In Love is mostly fictitious. So the script writers came up with their own dialogue in Elizabethan language. Do you know how hard Elizabethan language is to comprehend and write? The movie being Elizabethan impressed the heck out of me. The whole movie isn't Elizabethan, but the parts that are, I am proud of. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and the acting is very good too. The whole style covers up an ordinary love story: William Shakespeare is writing Romeo & Juliet and falls in love with wannabe female actor pretending to be a boy. They fall madly in love, and it helps him with the story and with future plays. But there's rivals and feuds that get in the way. Sounds dull and unoriginal? Well, it's not Truman Show or Life Is Beautiful, but the script, music, acting, sets, and subplots are enough to make this movie very lovable. Sure it has its dumb moments, but not enough to ruin a perfectly fine movie. I must say this again. Shakespeare In Love has everything a movie should have.",10,0,0,26 November 2014
Rocky V," The Most Original and Underrated Rocky Movie.
","I love all Rocky movies equally. If I had to pick a favourite, it would have to be the first. I don't know why I like that one the most. If most people had to pick a worst, it would be this. I can see why people would find this the worst, but I don't get why it received so much negativity.Having just defeated Moscow super-boxer, Ivan Drago, Rocky returns home. The Balboas discover that while they were gone, Paulie left power of attorney to their accountant who took all the money and accidentally lost it all. Plus they discover they have years of unpaid taxes. With Rocky's status, he would just need to do a few more fights to clear the money problems. But they find out that Rocky has suffered an irreversible brain injury that could be fatal if he continued fighting. So they move back to the ghetto and Rocky trains young upstart, Tommy Gunn, who is a huge fan of Rocky's. Rocky distances himself from his family and resentment from them towards him grows. When Tommy betrays Rocky, he learns he must fight once more. The first problem is getting Stallone's real son, Sage, to play his son in this. Rocky's son ages 5 years in 1 month. The next problem is how easily they moved back to the slums of Philly. Rocky is the biggest boxer in the world, so why didn't he do some commercials and other celebrity endorsements like he did in Rocky 3? These are the only problems I have with this.What makes this movie great and the most original is the distinct message, subplots, and final fight. In every Rocky movie, the message is to follow your dreams and don't give up. They are conveyed differently in each of them. This one's main message is the importance of family. As Rocky's trainings were growing stronger and stronger, the respect from his family grew weaker and weaker. When Rocky finally does wake up, that last bit has a huge impact. Also, the subplots were great too, just like the others. The main and best one is crooked fight promoter, George W. Duke worming his way in Rocky's affair and Tommy's rise. Rocky knows all about people like him that do well at first then drain their clients dry. But Tommy doesn't. This subplot happens all the time in real life and is great to see on film. The last great thing is the final between Rocky and Tommy. Tommy challenges Rocky to a fight anywhere, which ends up being on the streets at that moment. The street fight is very well done. All haters of Rocky V admit that they loved the fight between Rocky and Tommy. Some say it might be the best in the series.4/4",10,5,6,5 August 2014
12 Angry Men," The Best Courtroom-Drama Ever Made!
","To Kill a Mockingbird garner the reputation as the best courtroom drama as it ranks the highest on most lists. It is a great film, I'll admit, but 12 Angry Men blows it out of the water. Funny thing is, this takes place in one room for 98% of the whole movie. There's about one minute in the actual courtroom in the beginning and one minute outside the building at the end. The rest is in the room where the jurors decide whether or not the defendant is guilty. When a movie takes place inside one room throughout the whole movie, the script has to be extremely strong and exciting. 12 Angry Men's script is those. It follows 12 very distinctive jurors who know that a Spanish-American youth murdered his father. All evidence gathered points to him, so all think that they can reach a guilty verdict right away. But Juror #8 (Fonda) is the only one that thinks the kid is innocent. One by one, Juror #8 convinces the eleven others that the young man is not guilty as they carefully analyze the evidence they were given. Each piece of evidence that is turned around is sheer genius and very thrilling. I actually consider this to be a courtroom- thriller because of how exciting it is. I found my heart rate rising at the site of each piece f the puzzle being put together. I could only imagine how this movie would have turned out if Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Fun fact: only two jurors' names are revealed at the very end, with the audience forgetting they do not know anybody else's names. Aside from this being very thrilling and educational, and having a great script and characters, it deals with themes of racism and family, as both play important roles on why the Jurors vote 'guilty' in the first place. Scale of 1-10: 11/10!",10,2,3,22 November 2014
The English Patient," An Underrated Masterpiece!
","The English Patient is a 1996 adaptation from the book of the same name that has a reputation as being too long, boring, overrated, and one of the worst movies to win so many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Director. I agree with some of these negative claims up to a certain extent, but the movie has redemption.The English Patient is about a mysterious man (Fiennes) with no identity who is horribly burnt after a plain crash and is cared for by a french-Canadian nurse (Binoche). He reveals that he is Count Almasy and tells the story of his affair with married Katherine (Thomas) and their journeys in the Sahara desert and the surrounding corruption and betrayal.I will agree that The English Patient is too long. 163 minutes is a bit of a stretch and causes there to be some boring moments. If twenty minutes of the movie was cut, the result would have been better. But the length does not make for anything bad. That is what people overstate. That is why the episode of Seinfeld when Elaine hated The English Patient was so funny. Dissing this movie just because it's a bit long and has dull moments is far-fetched. Like Lawrence of Arabia and The Searchers, The English Patient is full of glamorous and lovely shots of the sun-filled desert. If you find this movie boring, it is not bad to look away from. The flashback story of the patient's pre-burn days is the better half of the movie and is wondrous. The burn days for him aren't very wondrous, but are still worth seeing.The English Patient won many awards, beating everybody's favourite, Fargo. Fargo is a true masterpiece, but The English Patient isn't that far behind it. I watched The English Patient twice; I enjoyed it the first time, but loved it the second. It was a major leap. Just why did The English Patient win Best Picture and Best Director? Simple: The English Patient has more to it. In fact, The English Patient was more deserving of its win for Best Director. Although the Coen brothers filmed Fargo to a very high degree, Anthony Minghella provides calibre filming, enchanting shots on location, beautiful costumes, haunting make-up, unbeatable sets, and glowing music. Fargo does not have all these. What Fargo does have may outweigh everything else in 1996, The English Patient offered more than any other movie in 1996.4/4",10,3,5,27 January 2015
Hostel," Boobs and Blood Does Not Make Great Entertainment Nor Great Horror.
","Eli Roth is a frontrunner in horror's underground. The only reason he is not as big or as admired as Wes Craven or John Carpenter is because Roth relies only on blood. The story is a last minute thing and the addition of nudity is immature fun, but his number one thing is blood. Three years before this he did the horror-comedy bloodbath 'Cabin Fever.' I used to like 'Cabin Fever' when I was a teenager, but then I grew up. 'Hostel' is not much of a step up...or down.The year before 'Hostel' was released, the brilliant horror movie 'Saw' was released. 'Saw' like 'Hostel' is a torture-porn gorefest. Difference is, 'Saw' has good acting and brains. Hostel's goal was not to capitalize on the success of 'Saw,' that's just Roth's style. Capitalizing on its success is just something that happened.The storyline is heavily cliched: two American friends backpack across Europe with their Icelandic friend. In Amsterdam, the trio get involved in tons of sex and drugs. The acting by everyone is bad and the orgies are not enjoyable. These people delivered their lines awfully or if there was no spark of originality or fun. Usually explicit sex and drugs amp things up. Not here!Then the movie switches gears. The Icelandic one goes missing, then the movie turns to a thriller. This gear switching gives some hope. We find out there's a crew of people that snatch up tourists and torture them. The torture is what the trilogy is known for. Unfortunately, it does not work here. The question that lingers in everyone's mind is 'Why?' What on earth in the point of these people kidnapping the tourists and dissecting them? In 'Saw' it was a game and Jigsaw was basically a monster. But there is really no point in why these people perform these grotesque acts. Providing a clear answer instantly would have made this a better-liked film. And its really too bad because Roth does not dive into the horror right away. Remember in 'Halloween' when Carpenter waited before Michael Myers was clearly seen? Roth does the same thing. But too much negatives around it diminished this good quality.The final act makes this movie worth watching. Do yourselves a favour and just skip to when Jay Hernandez gets kidnapped. He tries to make an escape and its pretty exciting. Not perfect, but still much better than the rest of it.In a movie with no point and really bad acting, an enjoyable final act prevents 'Hostel' from being a piece of trash.2/4",5,0,1,8 March 2018
L.A. Confidential," Neo-Noir At Its Best! My Favourite One.
","This is my favourite neo-noir film. I think this is the best because it has the 1950s look and vibe in which regular noir films actually were. The general look of this film was only rivalled by Titanic in 1997, in which both films were dead-on in capturing the looks of their respective time periods. This was most critics' favourite movie of the year. I understand why.LA Confidential is a confusing movie that takes several watches before fully understanding it. When you finally do get the full understanding, it certainly feels good. It is about three very different cops in the City of Angels (Spacey, Crowe, Pearce) that investigate a brutal massacre at a coffee shop called 'Nite Owl' as well as a void being let open by now imprisoned mobster Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle). What they discover are corruption. scandals, lies and betrayals along the way.Kevin Spacey gets top billing which is false advertising since he is more of a minor character. He was the best-known actor at the time while Pearce and Crowe were relatively unknowns. But that's not a big deal. The movie's general plot and subplots are all super complex and are character-driven which is great. Spacey plays Jack Vincennes who loves the spotlight shining on him and wishes for all the publicity he can get. He has ties with Sid Hudgens (DeVito) of Hush Hush magazine which helps both of them get what they want. Jack uncovers some drugs before the killings.Russell Crowe plays Bud White who is merciless and fierce, especially toward violence against women. He discovers a ring of high-level hookers made over to look like movie stars and falls for a Veronica Lake look-alike (Basinger).Guy Pearce plays Ed Exley who is straight-laced and wants to live up to his father's legacy. He tries to be the voice of reason before and after the massacre, as he is careful and smart about how he undertakes everything. Each men have their own separate paths than intertwine and make them better.The story constantly unfolds and swerves in such fascinating and bizarre ways. it is the best feeling in the world when you come to understand each character and each story to a full 100%. The stories and characters in this have rarely been touched in noir or movies in general. Aside from the stories and characters, the look of this movie added onto the script is what makes this my favourite neo-noir movie. The costumes, set pieces, lighting, everything from 1940s and 1950s film noir are captured to the fullest in this. Other neo-noir movies like The Usual Suspects are not as flashy or brilliantly constructed than LA Confidential.4/4",10,2,3,11 June 2015
Spider-Man 3," Really Not As Bad As People Say.
","People were all excited to see Venom in Spiderman 3 since Venom is Spiderman's coolest and most popular villain. And since Spiderman 2 was so well-received, it would only make sense that the follow-up movie would possibly be better. I will be the first to admit that this was not as good as Spiderman 2, but I would say this is the second best Spiderman movie made. A little bit better than the first and much better than these new ones. I can see why some people would nit- pick at this, but they go too far by saying this was trash and that it was the worst superhero movie they'd seen. Ever see Superman IV? That's about was bad as 1959's Santa Claus.The movie starts off with Peter planning on proposing to Mary Jane, but her frustrations with her Broadway career and jealousy of Gwen Stacy liking Peter gets the better of her. That is a flaw. We waited for two full movies for Peter to get the girl and he still can't? However, Maguire and Dunst are great actors so there is really nothing to worry about. Plus this adds tension because everybody wants Peter to get Mary Jane and he still has troubles. But you know he is just one step closer. There is also Harry Osborn who has become New Goblin and wants to destroy Spiderman. He gets amnesia in the process, but soon comes out of it and adds problems to Peter and May Jane's relationship. I don't think that Franco was all that good as Harry and New Goblin, but because of the build-up and characterization, the feud is awesome. And Harry screwing up the relationship makes the love story original and not very dull. Plus, there is Flint Marko who turns out to be uncle Ben's killer. He becomes Sandman and wants Spiderman gone. Flint is a bit weak, his story and place was weak, but when he turns into Sandman, look out! He is soooo awesome. The last villain is Venom: Edward Brock Jr. Eddie Brock is an up-and-coming photographer that envies Peter Parker as Parker outdoes Brock and his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, takes a liking to him. Played by skinny Topher Grace, I found this to be the biggest flaw. A bizarre piece of goo crash-lands on earth and turns Spiderman black. It also alters his personality. Peter becomes mean emo-Peter who struts around and dances randomly. Some parts of this were dumb, but Maguire was very convincing. Realizing the toll it takes on him, Peter takes it off and it lands on Eddie Brock, turning him into Venom. Another thing I liked about the toll it takes on Peter was his transition from nice, timid, Peter to vain, weird, emo- Peter. He was convincing as both, and his links to the emo and back were very well-done. A transitional character down the right way, like here, always impress me. Eddie Brock has always been displayed as a big guy, so Grace was a wrong call. Plus Venom is barely in it, when he is, they mostly show Brock's face. So I can se why most people would feel cheated by that. But when Venom is actually Venom, it is awesome. Everybody has to admit that Venom looked really cool. The end sequence when Spiderman fights both Venom and Sandman is monumental. The stakes were high and you really thought Spiderman was going to die. Then Harry finally saving Spiderman and both fighting Venom and Sandman was even cooler. The actions sequences and special effects were dazzling, so I don't get why those weren't praised like int he others. The character development and chemistry is an all-time high in the series, but some of it was too much, so the viewers felt cheated. The use of villains made the viewers feel cheated too, but it really want that bad because the positives erased most negatives. But because this was poorly received, producers tried too hard to come up with a great story for Spiderman 4. With too many disagreements, the plug was pulled and Sony rebooted the series. I hate what they've done. Spiderman 3 had the stuff for a sequel we were waiting for. Dr. Connors still had a piece of the goo that Peter gave him, Eddie Brock's death wasn't shown very well, so there would have been more Venom and maybe even Carnage. Instead, we now have arrogant, undeserving Peter Parker with villains used worse than this.Tobey's Spiderman is a true hero. He was played as a total loser that got powers that gave him the confidence he needed to be a better person. He always triumphs over odds as the going gets tough.3/4",8,3,4,27 October 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," Not Bad. But This 8.2 Rating Needs To Go Down A Lot!
","The superhero picture has really overstayed their welcome. I don't mean just Marvel, but DC and others. There's too many clichés, everything is too superficial and everything blends too well with others of similar nature. Now, superhero films are being targeted towards younger children with overly-stylized and colourful sets, and some of the worst jokes possible. Superhero movies now a lacking seriousness and passion that used to make them great. These ones now are far too silly to be taken seriously.While comedy is violently stuffed in these films, the main thing that kept the latest Thor movie from being more than just 'okay' is that the story made no sense and all the characters were out of place. Dr. Strange appears in it just because. There's some cool monsters in it just because. Cate Blanchett parades around the majority of the movie just because. I know people dig just seeing random cameos and cool things for no apparent reason other than to look cool.Thor and Loki's sibling rivalry is still rocky. Thor either awakens or happens to come across Ragnarok. Cate Blanchett the human version of Rag? Already forgotten and don't care the least. Thor gets transported to a universe (maybe just a planet, but no biggie) where fights happen like UFC. His opponent is the Hulk. We've all seen the excerpt from the trailers. Well Thor's escapades in that universe are weak with uninteresting characters leading the way. And you guessed it: bad jokes! Meanwhile on Earth (or whatever planet the main story is) has Cate Blanchett taking over. She looks cool, but is rather bland. And still: bad jokes!I know that this movie tries to be part comedy, but please don't. The jokes in all the movies (except for Iron Man) are horrible movies that only 6-year-olds will be amused with. Next Marvel movie, please don't force so many jokes!! NONE OF THEM ARE FUNNY!!!!So the jokes suck, the characters suck and are out of place, the stories make no sense, but the action and special effects though...wow! The opening scene has Thor fighting Ragnarok which blew me away. The fight between Hulk and Thor is awesome. There's a few other scenes of breathtaking visuals and sweet action that I loved!This movie is a standard pass.2.5/4",6,6,15,5 November 2017
Once," A Tiny Movie With Enormous Results.
","There is a scene in the Irish musical 'Once' in which our nameless characters--our Guy and Girl--play a song in a music store. Guy sings lead and plays guitar while girl plays piano and sings backup. Clocking in at just over four minutes, this song is so emotional and enchanting that we feel the effects of that one tune long after it ends. Sometimes one scene can define a film. To me it was our two stars singing the song entitled 'Falling Slowly'.'Once' could have been made with a big budget, but the director chose to make it micro budget and left the script skeletal. This allows more authenticity and takes us closer to the leads. The home video camera look makes this feel like a documentary, plus the immersiveness into the characters' lives make the viewer feel like they are watching old home movies of their best friends.'Once' is a love letter to music. Music is a universal art that is so personal and speaks to the soul. With music, so many people feel that their lives make sense. Director John Carney shows on film exactly how this can be. Each song in this movie is very emotional, but getting to know the characters on screen increases our affections. And the characters are developed pretty well in a short amount of time. Guy is a busker who also works at his father's vacuum shop. He recently broke up with his girlfriend, but he still loves her. Girl is a single mother in a townhouse who is separated from her husband. She wants her daughter to grow up with her father. Are Guy and Girl the perfect couple? In a romantic sense, no. It crossed their minds to get with each other, but their relationship is platonic and purely musical. She helps him with his music career (which includes getting a professional demo) and motivates him to get back with his girlfriend. Their intimate relationship does not need to be romantic.Listen to each song. Pay attention to the lyrics and the heart that Guy and Girl are pouring into them. The songs reflect their lives in such fascinating scenes. The simplicity of a guitar and a piano can go long ways.See this passion project and download all of the songs. The characters are charming and the songs are enchanting.4/4",10,2,3,31 August 2018
Crash," The Most Underrated Movie To Win The Oscar For Best Picture.
","Crash ranks near or at the top of overrated movie lists and worst movies to win Oscars. Sure Capote, Brokeback Mountain and others around the time were good candidates, but this beats those. I think that the main reason why people dislike this is because of the use of multiple story lines. Some may be better than others, but all are fantastic. All connect in powerful ways with powerful endings. Each story's build-up and development makes the whole movie exciting. And the emotional-charging premises have huge impacts on the viewer that will leave the the viewer speechless and teary-eyed. This movie does not have exceptional timing techniques or anything like that. Just fantastic acting, powerful stories, and great editing that make up for what it does not have.",10,2,5,5 November 2014
Taxi Driver," A Truly Amazing And Remarkable Character Sketch.
","This is Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's best movie. Although Scorsese has done better pieces of film, this still surpasses them. De Niro does his best performance and was robbed of his Oscar win. Yes, his performance in better than Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. Raging Bull is Scorsese's best piece of film and De Niro's second best performance.Taxi Driver is one of those movies that are almost biographical as they centre on just one person. Centring on just one person means the character and plot development are going to be very sharp and deep. This is about a former soldier scared from his experiences and gets a job in New York driving a taxi during nights for twelve hours. He falls in love with a girl named Betsy, but the relationship fails. As he keeps slipping into a world of isolation, depression and anxiety, he becomes determined to fix up the streets and make the world better. He plans to assassinate a Senator and save a child (Jodie Foster) from prostitution and her pimp (Harvey Keitel). We see exactly what is in the mind of De Niro as he grows more into a mentally unstable state. What's cool is, he becomes a hero in the process. The American Film Institute ranked Travis Bickle (De Niro) in their list of Top 50 Villains. I don't get why that is. He cleans up the streets and saves a child from prostitution. This is the second best character study film in history, on after Citizen Kane.",10,1,4,31 December 2014
Glory," Overall, A Very Solid Film.
","It seems to me that 1989 was the year of racial equality. Check out all the hit movies that came out that year: Glory, Driving Miss Daisy, and Do The Right Thing. Even Black Rain, Lethal Weapon 2, Henry V and Casualties of War dealt with racial issues in some form or another. But perhaps it was Glory that paved the way for more movies of its kind for years to come.Glory stars Matthew Broderick in a 100% serious role as real life Robert Gould Shaw. I had my doubts with Broderick playing the protagonist in such a serious film and, well, I was satisfied. Usually when people break typecast roles, their anomaly usually automatically comes out great. With Matthew Broderick, this did not apply. I didn't think he was bad, just satisfactory. It wasn't that Ferris Bueller was stuck in my head or anything like that. For one thing, Broderick constantly switches from an Irish accent to a regular American accent. What the hell? But other than that, he wasn't captivating or dominant and there was a medium level conviction. If somebody else played the role of Shaw, I likely would have placed Glory higher on my Best of 1989 list.So Matthew Broderick is not A-1 in this, but that's fine. There are many other redeeming qualities. Glory takes place during the Civil War and is about Shaw who quickly moves up the ranks as a soldier and is assigned to train a pure-black army of slaves in battle. Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman are part of his squad and they lead a cast of equally talented lesser-knowns. This was Denzel's first Oscar win and it still remains one of his best performances. He steals every shot where he appears on screen.Probably the biggest flack given to this was that it is not from the point of view from one of the black people. This was the first all-black American army troop and a white man is the protagonist. Yes, Shaw does not know what it was like to be a slave in those times, but having Shaw as the main character is good because he is so unused to the cruelty inflicted on his men. Shaw is the character that changes the most, because he first thinks that the men are being mistreated for valid reasons, when it is really exploitation. The regular side of the coin really gets a chance to see how he and his people are and how he must change. He is scared about making the change, but knows it is the right thing to do.Every good war movie needs to have great action, and that is exactly what Glory delivers, all the way through to its shocking ending. What I also liked was how much overall chemistry there was and how much the plot moved forward. The movie actually starts off a bit slow, but it keeps a constant pace of getting better and more rich. Maybe I will think more of this the next time I watch it.3.5/4",9,1,2,4 January 2016
Rocky II," The Perfect Tie-In!
","It is rare that sequels surpass the original, and Rocky II is no different. It is a continuation from the first, finishing one adventure. This is the left-over movie. Does that mean it sucks? No! Despite this not measuring up to Rocky in 1976, Rocky II is where the inspiration just begins.It picks up right where the first one left off at with the press following Rocky and Apollo into the hospital with both men drastically injured. Rocky successfully went the distance with neither men winning. Having to spend some time rehabilitating, Rocky quits boxing and tries to work with brother-in-law, Paulie (Young) at a meat factory. It doesn't last and Rocky realizes his true calling. With an angry Apollo taunting a vengeful rematch, Rocky must not only fight for himself, but for his new wife (Shire) and child.Rocky II tends to deal more with Rocky's family and married life. He marries Adrian, they have a kid and there's lots of homie stuff. This is meant to to show what Rocky is fighting to keep, whereas the first one showed what Rocky is fighting to get. There is more chemistry that happens across the board int he first, but Rocky II is dragged in various sections. There's too much time focusing on Rocky's downtime from boxing. When the movie shifts to the boxing portion, it becomes more inspiring than the first and very exciting to see. He trains harder for a more gruelling match. The actual fight in this is a big step up from the first since the first showed only about 1/4 of the fight. This shows about 90% of the fight and is great to see this nobody from Philadelphia finally come out Heavyweight Champion of the World.3.5/4",10,1,1,23 January 2015
Romeo + Juliet," The Best Modern Day Shakespeare Adaptation.
","Flamboyant and overly-fashionable director, Baz Luhrmann's breakout film has become a sensation in the world of romance and Shakespeare. He casts some recognizable stars with young upstarts that would dominate the screen for years to come. Luhrmann brings the timeless story to the present in such a way that has some people loving it and others hating it.Taking place in the present, everybody are surfers/punks. It is cool to see Shakespeare being to hip and cool. The guns, cars, music, and costumes really appeal to this generation's teen.Romeo & Juliet is probably the best known Elizabethan play as well as the best known love story ever told. For those that don't know the plot, Romeo Montague's (DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet's (Danes) families have always had violent feuds in Verona, Italy. As young teenagers, they meet, fall in love, get married, then kill themselves because each think the other is dead after they wake up with convincing evidence--all over a three day period. People that don't like the story hate how young they are, how quickly they get married, and how easily they commit suicide. First of all, the play is 500 years old. Second of all, that is what Shakespeare wanted people to think about. Kids their age and younger always say they are in love and they want to get married. Don't go saying they are too young to fall in love and get married when that thought crossed your mind! As for the suicide, it fits. Dying to be be with the person you love is the most romantic thing of all. I can't help but feel heartbroken when they die. Aside from that, their deaths were the only way for the Montagues and Capulets to restore peace among themselves and all of Verona. When I first read this play and studied it in high school, I was one of the only people that liked the ending because I thought it just 'fit.' I had no idea why for the longest time. Now I know.Romeo is regarded as one of DiCaprio's best known roles, but not one of his best-known performances. I would easily say it is in his top five. Everybody else in this is not quite as well known as Leo, but they shine in this and in their other movies. Most of the criticism I've seen from this are from the performances themselves. They say everybody has no idea how to act Elizabethan or how to deliver Shakespeare lines. Roger Ebert said Pete Postelthwaite was the only exception because he was the one that knew how to deliver the lines. Sure he is a talented actor, but nothing is entirely wrong with the performances. The actors talked as if they were thinking it, not with a rhythm. Sir Laurence Olivier was the first actor to break the rule of Shakespeare being rhythmic and natural. So the acting really isn't bad. People were just unused to seeing these Hollywood giants saying things they can't understand.4/4",10,4,7,19 February 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Better Than The Original? Maybe. Unbelievable Ride? HELL YEAH!!
","The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I don't care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else he's ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacino's rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone who's family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleone's most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New York's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman.If there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know Michael can destroy him and all he has. One reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. That masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. So maybe the first one is better.Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppola's direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.4/4",10,5,7,4 December 2014
Fargo," Probably The Best Dark Comedy Ever Made.
","Aside from Tarantino movies, which happen to have comedic elements, this is the best dark comedy I've seen and the highest rated one on many sites. At first, I didn't see what was so great about this like the way Roger Ebert raved about it. The whole movie is funny from the overly- polite midwestern accents. Reminded me of Canadian accents. But I did not find it to be a masterpiece. Then I tried really watching it, and I never looked back.The film is about a used car salesman named Jerry Lundengaard (Macy) who rigs his wife being kidnapped by two criminals be doesn't know (Buscemi, Stormare) as ransom so he can get needed money from his father-in-law (Presnell) he knows he would not get any other way. The kidnapping leads to three homicides where pregnant cop, Marge (McDormand) does some investigation and is soon hot on all their trails.In the first 20 minutes or so, we meet Jerry then witness the kidnapping and the murders. This start has always been exciting. Then we meet Marge and the story really starts to unfold as she does some detective work and Jerry gets what's coming to him. For some reason, the movie lost my interest when we meet Marge. After we meet her I became more interested with just hearing the people say 'yeah!' and 'you betcha!' After not watching the movie for a while, I tried really watching it and I finally understood what all the commotion was all about. The story is the one of the most original you'll ever see. Originality is what makes movies great and this has it. What makes the story and events original are the characters. All characters, even bad, are lovable and well-developed, the whole movie is exciting with character-driven twists that add sheer excitement, great morals and some nice filming techniques, all while keeping funny accents with humour so dark that it messes with you. There's nothing not to like. Jerry is probably the antagonist and villain since he was the brains behind ransom and started the chain of events. He is developed so well and there is so much sympathy created for him that the viewer feels sorry for him anytime he is brought down or is seen through. He never gives up and is greatly determined. Marge, the protagonist and hero, is the most original female hero ever. She is as awesome as The Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Nobody wants to see Marge nab Jerry. Steve Buscemi is like a creature that eats away at his boss's enemy. Stormare is kick-ass psycho that plays by his own rules and answers to nobody. Both of them are funny together because they are totally different: a chatterbox and a mute. These, as well as the other characters, are so real and well-developed that they drive the movie. A pure, original character driven story and important morals that arise are Shakespeare-like. Add great filming, odd humour and thrills, you get one of America's best films ever.4/4",10,2,3,18 October 2014
American Pie," A Serious and Legitimately Good Comedy.
","This movie is the best teen comedy of the decade, hands down. It is like 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High: The Next Generation.' It follows a group of four different, but close high school friends: the geeky Jim Levenstein (Biggs), athletic Chris 'Oz' Oztreicher (Klein), charming Kevin Meyers (Nicholas), and oddball Paul Finch (Thomas), who make a pact to lose their virginity before graduating high school, which prom being the last chance. Jim tries to score with sexy exchanged student (Elizabeth), Oz tries to make it with a straight-laced choir singer (Suvari), Kevin tries to win the trust of his girlfriend (Reid) whose relationship is ending, and Finch pays people to support a new reputation of his. Supporting characters include Jim's guiding father (Levy), obnoxious party animal Steve Stifler (Scott), band geek and Jim's last-minute partner (Hannigan), Stifler's sexy mom and Finch's last minute effort (Coolidge), sex expert Jessica (Lyonne), and wannabe cool Chuck Sherman 'the Shermanator' (Owen). These other characters add to the hilarity, heart and memorability.Despite this movie being about sex and totally hilarious, the character development and chemistry are strong, and Kevin's and Oz's subplots are more dramatic than funny. So any super-conservative person would be surprised at the right mix of comedy and drama. The seriousness isn't sad or boring, it is there to strengthen the quality of the movie. Also, everything this movie has is realistic and relatable with the hard times of high school. So it may be about trying to get laid, but that is an aspect that nearly every teenager faces. As the guys get closer to doing so, they also learn lessons on love and adulthood. And since each friend is different, more lessons can be made and the movie gets strengthened even more. Without these strong dimensions, it would just be a stupid late-night comedy.4/4",10,2,3,25 July 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The First Instalment of the Greatest Trilogy in Film History.
","Star Wars, The Godfather, and Indiana Jones are the best trilogies ever. Among them are the three adaptations of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth epics: The Lord of the Rings. What makes this trilogy superior to the other three I mentioned is that they feature an instalment that is considerably inferior to the others. Return of the Jedi is the worst Star Wars, Godfather III is the worst Godfather and Temple of Doom is the worst Indiana Jones. I would have to call Fellowship the worst Lord of the Rings movie, but it is not considerably inferior to its sequels.Australian director Peter Jackson brings the timeless sequel to The Hobbit to life. In Middle Earth, Rings were made to different races that gave power. One Ring ruled them all, owned by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron lost the ring in battle and is stubbled upon by a hobbit named Smeagal (Serkis). He goes crazy as the Ring consumes him and becomes a little creature known as Gollum. The Ring leaves him and is found by another hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Holm). When Bilbo leaves, the Ring is no longer left with an owner, so Sauron and his ugly band of Orcs are reawaken and seek the Ring. After wizard, Gandalf (McKellen) discovers the Ring's unspeakable powers, Bilbo's young nephew, Frodo (Wood) becomes the carrier and is joined by a group of warriors to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece. I found each sequel better than the last. But there are some people that are not fans of any of them. Famous film critic and award winning journalist, Richard Roeper, gave this movie thumbs down when he and Roger Ebert reviewed it. he later changed his mind after seeing the other movies, but still. And I know of people that don't like these movies because they found the whole fantasy subject to be too cheesy and unrealistic. Well, that's what a fantasy movie is: unrealistic. People that don't like these movies are completely ignorant to movies and storytelling. The whole premise of these movies are long and complex that need lots of explaining. Most people generally don't understand the story, which is why my summary is long. It may follow the general monomyth archetype, but it is full of subplots and backstories that make the plot more complex and original than other monomyth archetypes. But what people love to praise is the general filming. People that don't like the LOTR movies fail to understand how difficult and masterful the movies were made. Take any five minutes of this, and think about how much work was put into it. All the make-up, costumes, set pieces, choreography, etc, etc. That is why these movies are such joys to see and why you can't take your eyes off of them. I honestly don't think there has been any movies since that have been harder to make than this. If so, they're not that much harder.Peter Jackson recently finish his trilogy of The Hobbit. The Hobbit is one novel that's a prequel to LOTR. Jackson made three epics of one 400 paged story. I don't think he should have done so. The Hobbit movies are not at the level of the LOTR movies. If you ask me, Jackson should have done two Hobbit movies in 1998 and 1999, then do the LOTR as is. He would have ended on a better note then.4/4",10,3,3,8 February 2015
Armageddon," A Ton Of Fun! Even if it is no good.
","Armageddon is one of the most recognizable films in all of cinema, but not so much well liked. This is very divided, with very few people claiming the whole movie to be a masterpiece. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but you know.This is a blockbuster meant to make money. It is evident that millions of dollars were put into this, hence millions are needed for the movie to be any sort of success. Director, Michael Bay does his first and best super-explosive picture. Bay makes many high-powered explosions just for the heck of it. Starring in this is Bruce Willis along with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi, all giving subpar performances with awful dialogue. Luckily, the negatives don't last...long.Armageddon is the twin of Deep Impact. Both are about humans preparing for a massive comet heading toward Earth that will cause extinction. While Deep Impact is more serious and accurate, Armageddon is mostly a mess of it. In nicer terms, this is the fun version. The first hour and some takes place on Earth with the preparation and subplots. Early meteors hit and Bruce Willis is angry that his daughter (Tyler) is seeing a handsome coworker (Affleck). There's huge explosions and violence just for fun. The acting is bad too. Everything (almost) is inaccurate and unrealistic. Deep Impact is far better. Even the background music and Aerosmith songs weren't enough to fully brighten up any scenes. But the take-off scene when they head into space is when the movie gains ground. The visual and sound effects are amazing and the set pieces are awesome too. Sadly, them being in space is way too long. Bay abuses his privilege. Good thing the ending is truly good.2/4",5,1,2,3 March 2015
North by Northwest," The Greatest Mystery/Thriller Of All Time.
","Alfred Hitchcock's speciality is thrillers. Some are straight thrillers, some conjoin with romances, horror, this conjoins with mystery. Hitchcock has combined these two, but has never done a better and more exciting film. Nobody has ever or will ever do a better, more exciting film. Having said that, is this better than, say, Vertigo or Psycho? Arguably. But Vertigo is a romance/thriller, Psycho is a horror/thriller and NBNW is a mystery/thriller. This does surpass other movies of its kind like Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon. The general story is a classic case of mistaken identity where a complex, top-secret government plan is under wraps. The movie grabs you by your collar the in the first two minutes and never lets go as the thrills and curves never stop coming at you full force. The main character (Cary Grant) careens to different ends of America as he must keep up with the game of cat-and-mouse he dies to get out of. Unlike Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon, NBNW features chase and danger sequences that add more excitement to its already mammoth exhilarating plot. Screw running, screw the gym. This movie can get your heart rate going in a much more enjoyable way.",10,3,5,30 October 2014
American Beauty," When Kevin Spacey is on fire, NOBODY can touch him!
","This is the best film of 1999 and the best way to end the millennium. It is a film about quirky characters that drive the movie to greatness, with Kevin Spacey shining as the crown-jewel. He plays and ordinary man who is a major push-over, letting his boss and family (Benning, Birtch) walk all over him. When he becomes infatuated with his daughter's new friend (Suvari), he goes all out and decides to stand-up for himself in every way, no matter how honest or hurtful he becomes. Meanwhile, his daughter develops a fling with the interesting new neighbour (Bentley).Both plots are driven by really deep characters that the audience will fall in love with. Benning, Birtch, Bentley, Suvari and Cooper all give performances of a lifetime. But none were quite as good as Kevin 'the King' Spacey. In American Beauty, Spacey outdoes himself in all his previous films, even as the crippled Verbal Kint in 'The Usual Suspects.' He outdoes Denzel Washington and Jim Carrey who played real-life people to a T. Spacey's performance in this will rank near the top of ever poll of 'best film performances ever.'4/4",10,0,1,31 July 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still Mesmerizing After All These Years.
","Terminator 2 is without a doubt one of cinema's all time greats. It is also one of the sequels everybody can agree on is better than the original. Everything that T2 has to offer is innovative to all of film. Sure there are some head-scratching moments that people can't help but question, but that is when James Cameron expects people to infer and figure things out for themselves. I don't give much thought to these questions. Just sit back, relax, and be wowed.In 1997, machines take over the world causing most of humanity to be wiped out. John Connor is the leader of the resistance who is gaining the upper hand. The machines send back a cyborg (Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah (Hamilton), a prevent Connor's birth. John sends his friend (Biehn) back in time to protect her, who ultimately becomes John's father. The whole paradox of John's father is very interesting. They destroy the Terminator and Sarah's knowledge of the future has her going crazy. That is where T2 comes. T2 is a sequel where it helps if the first is watched. All the questions are filled in with this, watching 1984's just makes this experience better.In the future, the machines have created a liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator (Patrick) that can transform itself into anything. They send it back in time to 1994 to kill John's 10-year-old self (Furlong). John and his crew steal an Arnold model and program it to be good and send it back to protect him. Arnold gets John and explains what's up. There's some action between him and Patrick which is awesome. Patrick is a skinny guy who is more powerful than Arnold. I think it's funny how both their facial expressions never change during any of their fights. They are machines, and both men must've found it hard to keep their faces from changing shapes. We get a good look into the life of Sarah Connor, who has been put in a mental institution where she is abused. John and Arnold break her out, but Sarah is still hunted by her previous encounter with his model and an idea of judgement day. They must work together to protect John and thwart Patrick. Patrick makes lots of really cool kills and transformations. For 1991, the effects are as real as can be. Of course, there's some dazzling effects with Arnold's model. The innovative effects were the first things that were noticed. Of course the action plays a big part as they were very well done too. The complex plot and ideas of how modern technology can destroy the world, trust, and family are played about in very important and unique ways. I love the way the movie constantly unfolds and gets from place to place. So many moments just fly by that cause you to keep your eyes on the screen. Cameron does this the right way, with build-ups and pay- offs, showing that it was necessary to have. The thrills and suspense are done so in perfectly, wondering how Patrick can get kills and if he can destroy the trio. Cameron also adds some humour. Arnold is the king of one-liners, making every movie he's in funny in some parts. Playing a robot with more lines is guaranteed to make almost everything that comes out of his mouth a gag. The chemistry between him and Edward Furlong is wonderful and funny too. Furlong has a squeaky voice, so he's just as funny as Arnie. He teaches him how to be hip, with hilarious results. In the process, Arnold becomes the closest thing John ever had to a father and makes him feel important.I love everything T2 has to offer. It was the first R-rated movie I'd ever seen and still blows me away all these years later.4/4",10,2,4,10 April 2015
We're the Millers," The Best Comedy of the Decade!
","Today, there's very few original movies and very few movies that are truly funny. We're The Millers is one that is original and truly funny. Not dumb or cute, the hilarity actually keeps you in tuned and uses the comedy as a source to tell the story and make the viewer feel good. Most comedies these days try to uses the comedic elements as a source of amusement and is just, there. This also has heart, intelligence, and meaning. Almost no comedy made in years incorporate all three of these traits in one.Jason Sudekis plays low level drug dealer from Denver named David Miller. When he and neighbour, Kenny (Poulter) witness a gang of thugs harass low-life, Casey (Roberts), they intervene but David is ripped off and his drugs are stolen. When his boss, Brad (Helms) gives him a job to smuggle tons of weed from Mexico, David must come up with a plan to do the job safely. With the help of an RV, the kids and stripper, Rose (Aniston) pose as his innocent family. The plan is foolproof, until they find out they have been double crossed and must deal with a true hallmark family.From the first joke to the last, We're The Millers will guarantee leave your sides aching. Not since The Hangover has there been an movie this funny or awesome. Actually, I found this funnier than The Hangover. Better? Maybe. Either way, the hilarity is at an all-time high. The whole idea about the importance of family is good too. The Miller family starts off hating each other, but then become more concerned with one another as they each become more like an actual family instead of a fake one. That is where the heart and depth comes in.4/4",10,0,1,7 February 2015
Apocalypse Now," A Phenomenal Achievement. Coppola Outdoes Himself!
","In high school, I had to read Heart of Darkness. Although it was a good book, I did not understand any of it so my teacher had to explain everything. It was a harder read than a Shakespeare play. Apocalypse Now is a loose adaptation that surpasses the book. A few years after Coppola does the best movies ever--The Godfather Part 1 & 2--he directs arguably the best war movie ever made. Apocalypse Now is inferior to The Godfather movies, but is a much better piece of film. This was ten times harder to do than Coppola's other flicks.I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made about war. But it is not a straight-up war movie like this. As a straight-up war movie, this is the best. Saving Private Ryan is pretty close. But Apocalypse Now has a different kind of approach. Spielberg tried to make Saving Private Ryan to look like actual footage. Coppola tried to make Apocalypse Now look real too, but make the look more revolutionary and usable in every kind of film. Another thing that sets this apart is the weirdness that Coppola incorporates, used from the story. Martin Sheen (in an underrated performance) plays a soldier who seeks out Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. Along the way, he encounters many odd tribes and rituals. When he gets to Kurtz's kingdom, the weirdness reaches an all-time high and the result of his stay changes him forever. Coppola creates some odd tribes that is genius for movies. The general filming with stuff like cinematography is revolutionary and mind-blowing. Coppola never did better than this and very few directors have done better than this.Apocalypse Now is a story about how war can change people and does the best job in showing how and why.4/4",10,3,5,10 December 2014
Rocky IV," May Be The Cheesiest In The Series, But No Less Fun Than The Others.
","Rocky IV and V are two of the most hated Rocky movies. I can see why. Rocky IV is more of a cartoon and V was more of a money grabber. But since we get the same cast members playing our favourite boxing crew, nothing can go terribly wrong.Rocky is semi-retired and is challenged in an exhibition match against Russia's super boxer, Ivan Drago (Lundgren). Before Rocky makes up his mind, his bored and retired buddy, Apollo Creed steps out of retirement and challenges Drago himself. Creed underestimates Drago and is killed before the end of the second round. I've always been sour with Apollo getting killed by Drago that easily. I know that Rocky wanted another reason to fight, but his death was so sudden that it was a bit unrealistic. Rocky accepts Drago's challenge and goes to Russia to avenge his friend's death. Of course, Rocky wins. But given Apollo's death, Rocky's victory, and Drago, there's no way Rocky could have won. Drago abuses steroids and becomes way more powerful than he was when he fought Apollo, but Rocky is literally half his size! The training sequences show that Rocky does stand a chance of living, with really cool music playing and that adds to the fun and cheesiness. I know that Rocky was a lot more prepared than Apollo, but Rocky gets brutally hit hundreds of times and gets knocked down many times throughout the match, but still wins! Drago gets knocked down once and that's the end. That little bit is unrealistic. It is a revenge match where the good guy must triumph by the end; even if that means making everything unrealistic. Luckily, the fight is one of, if not, the best in the series.",10,2,4,24 January 2015
Spider-Man," Spawned a Genre. Screw This New SpiderCat.
","Before Spiderman, there wasn't very many superhero movies. Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers.Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson: his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing 'chemistry.' The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it!4/4",10,8,14,22 October 2014
Ratatouille," Magic. Plain and Simple.
","The critically acclaimed Disney animated film by Brad Bird has more humanity and originality than most films of the 2000s. It may be led by a rat and hundreds of other rats in his colony, but do not let that fool you into thinking this is a silly movie for boys who like gross things. If you are unappreciative of this, then you do not know much about the art of cinema.Patton Oswalt is pretty funny in general. He provides the voice of the star of this picture: a rat named Remy. His family lives in the country where he peaks into a house and gets inspired by the world's greatest chef, Auguste Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) to become a chef himself. Remy's perseverance causes him to become an expert on making excellent food. But he's a three-inch rat. What could he do? This sounds like a very unoriginal underdog story. Just stay tuned for the story to unfold.The owner of the house blasts the rats which causes Remy to get separated from his family and wind up across from Gusteau's restaurant. Remy was in Paris the whole time but never even knew it. Now that he is in the city, he can be close to he idol's work. Gusteau recently passed away and mean food critic Anton Ego (one of Peter O'Toole's last performances) has made the restaurant lose its prestige. Gusteau has been appearing to Remy as his conscious and motivator.Imagine the most elegant and fancy restaurant you can. An appetizer the size of your fist costing over $100. That is this restaurant. Sure there are other animated films better looking than this, but the overall value of the look should not be overlooked. Once we see it, we fall in love and want to go there ourselves.Meanwhile, a useless janitor at the joint and total geek named Linguini (like the food) sees Remy and a bond between the two is formed. Although they speak different languages, Remy gets on Linguini and pulls on his hair which causes his body parts to move as a reflex. Linguini is now Remy's puppet. Back at the restaurant, Remy hides in Linguini's hat, puppeteers around and great dishes come about. Linguini doesn't know what he's doing, it is all in the rat. Head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) is really mean and tries to find the secret behind this wimp's success.'Ratatouille' is a relatable story about passion. We feel Remy's love for cooking as much as he does. In fact, the entire food aspect of this is rubbed off onto us. In the duration of the film, we feel like cooking is the best job in the world. Job well done.It is also one of the very few animated movies where the peril and action is limited. The biggest scene of danger is near the beginning when the old lady empties her shotgun on Remy's clan. The biggest obstacle is understanding. Who is going to believe that Linguini is being controlled by a rat? How will Ego find the food that Remy creates? These gentle and modest things are handled with such care and precision so that it stands out among other recent Pixar films.And, of course, the animation is excellent. The real looking rats and fancy setting do not clash. It is simply perfect.One thing that gets overlooked is the music by Michael Giacchino. He is one of the best music guys working in film today and he has made his best soundtrack in this film.'Ratatouille' is a delicate, delectable piece of cinema to forever be cherished.4/4",10,2,2,18 September 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Couldn't Help Comparing this to The Original Trilogy.
","Spiderman 1 and 2 were masterpieces. Spiderman 3 in 2007 caught a bad rap because it was much inferior to the previous ones. So they rebooted the series. Thing is, they did it way too soon: 5 years after the finishing if the original. Everything would have been so much better is they waited longer. But noooo! I watched this with an unbiased conscience and did not expect it to be as good as the original. Many times whenever I have low expectations, I am proved wrong. Not with this.Let me start off with the story. Peter Parker is left in the care of his aunt and uncle some time before his parents die. Years later, as an emotionally scarred teen, Peter finds some answers about his parents that change him forever. The only thing good about this is giving a backstory to Peter and his parents. Nothing on Peter's childhood involving his parents were mentioned in 2002's. Props there. Plus there is lots of science involved, so any science nerds would love that aspect. I hate science, but thought it made great filming. In general the story has a good pace, but it is so unoriginal. A teen trying to find his place in the world has been done so many times with this not being any different. Then there is the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Sure the chemistry between them was better than original movies, but this is so unoriginal and boring. Peter gets the girl after the first try and it turns into cheesy Channing Tatum/Patrick Swayze love fest that makes you reach for a barf bag.Now let's talk about characters. Martin Sheen wasn't a bad Uncle Ben, but his death scene was hilarious and forgettable. Sally Field sucked and Aunt May. The ones that played them in the original were much better and the relationship between them and Peter were much, much stronger. Flash was not a good bully. Curt Connors (acting wise ) was good, but was a crappy villain. James Franco, whom I thought was the worst villain in the previous was better than Connors. Gwen Stacey was likable, but unoriginal. Her father was likable, but unoriginal. Peter was likable, but inferior to Tobey's. Andrew Garfield does not do a good job of playing a meek, timid, geeky teenager. Tobey owns that portion. Garfield just looks like a One Direction dude with glasses and a skateboard. People say Garfield was wittier and did more wisecracks like in the comic. Tobey did wisecracks too, but Garfields are too long and unfunny. Busting the car thief was extremely dumb. Tobey would have done one line and kicked his ass. After becoming Spiderman, Garfield doesn't really change, staying a confused, sad teen with no goal in life, except finding his parents' history. That makes him one-dimensional. Tobey goes from being a total geek to a sophisticated gentleman. Tobey outacts and outdoes Garfield in every was. Tobey also gained lots of muscle and easily could have whooped Garfield's skinny ass.Lastly the movie itself. Spidey's suit looked sick. Better than Tobey's? Maybe. Science thing superior to the oldies? Yes. Uncle Ben's death? Hilarious, and all because Peter couldn't get a bootle of milk he could not afford. Peter's ambition? gives up pretty easily finding his uncle's killer and is dead-set on finding his parents' history. Peter's family background? Better than the others by explaining his parents, which barely do! I know that they wanted to make the viewer want to see the sequel but going through a full movie just saying where they worked sucks. Peter exploring his new powers? Pathetic! Spidey saving a kid? Both almost died because of Peter's sheer stupidity of negotiating with a 6-year- old! The lizard villain? Looks exactly like that Jim Henson kiddie show from the 90s called 'Dinosaurs.' Action good? Yes. But there's many parts where the camera shakes at such a wide range with no focus for so long while Spidey's flying around, you may need your barf bag again.Final thoughts. This movie was not bad, nor good. The action saved what was a major stinker. The story isn't boring, there's just unoriginality and stupidity surrounding it. And it is very forgettable. I noted specific things in this review because I watched this just yesterday. Yet I still forget half of it!1.5/4",1,2,3,19 October 2014
Aliens," Better Than The First! To Me.
","Seven years after the groundbreaking movie, Alien, James Cameron picks up the sequel which many people find better than the first. Sure there are some people that disagree, but the ones the think this is the best are entitled to think so. 1979's Alien was a sci-fi/horror, whereas this is a sic-fi/action.About 60 years after the deadly encounter with the alien that wiped out her crew, Ellen Ripley is found on a spaceship and brought home. No such aliens have been found and foreign planets have been starting to colonize. She joins a team of tough space marines to destroy any aliens they find and save any human residents. The mission proves deadly as they face many aliens and the Mother Alien. Ripley must not only face her fears again, but also protect a little girl who's family was destroyed by the aliens and who has been like a daughter to her.The element of horror incorporated in the first was great and original, but everything that the first movie had was done better. The action is better, special effects are better, sets are better, cinematography is better, excitement is stronger, the pace is faster. I do love both movies, this one just did a bigger number on me.4/4",10,4,6,13 November 2014
The Exorcist," Has Rightfully Stood the Test of Time!
","At the time of its release, The Exorcist was the scariest film ever made. With so many technological advancements and boundary-pushing done these days, The Exorcist is not THE scariest movie like it once was. In fact, there are a few scenes that are rather funny. But as a massive movie buff, I can assure you that this is one of the scariest movies ever. Maybe it is not number one anymore, it is still up there. In fact I would perhaps call this the scariest movie I've ever seen. Not really an easy choice, but still.The Exorcist is just a fun little monster movie about a 12-year-old (Linda Blair) who plays with a Ouija board and is possessed by a demon. Well, it is rather unclear if it is a low-ranking demon or the devil himself. Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) goes to many doctors but none seem to do the trick and eventually gets a hold of priest/psychiatrist (Jason Miller) to perform an exorcism.The movie follows two parallel stories with Blair's curse and Miller. Miller who is working at a university and is dealing with his mentally-ill mother who dies. I found this portion of the movie to be rather weak. Perhaps I was just underwhelmed. Either way, it should have been much stronger. His character is developed well and he does a mighty fine job of acting, but the plot development was shallow.Obviously, the stronger story is the one with Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn is a wealthy actress who lives with her daughter and housekeepers and assistants. I was hoping this could have been stronger too. We get such a brief look into the life of this family, it is as if this story isn't worked on much. I know that they wanted the horror to erupt right away, but a stronger plot for this part of the film would have strengthened the movie overall The more we know, the more we feel. The more we feel, the more scared we get.Linda Blair finds a Ouija board and plays with it a bit. Ouija boards are said to really deliver curses. I don't buy it all. From then on, she slowly descends into uncontrollable insanity. While the family subplots are weak, the regular plot makes up for it. Blair's descending is perfectly paced. Obviously, Linda Blair's acting is top-notch--the best performance I have ever seen by a child actress. But what separates this from other supernatural horror movies is its wonder of what is mental and what is superstitious. That is what Burstyn is torn between figuring out is the best solution to save her daughter.Eventually, it reaches a point with Linda Blair where we see that she is clearly possessed as she becomes a scary monster. Her voice changes, cool make-up is added, things around the house fly about, and her body bends in bizarre ways. These days, you can't help but laugh at some of the situations that happen. Take her walking down the stairs like a spider. Or when she trash- talks the priests. I am Christian and I couldn't help laughing.When Miller finally becomes the official exorcist, that is when he becomes more interesting and the movie's suspense is added. Up until this point, the movie has a drama touch to the horror instead of suspense. Every movie has more than one element to it and the horror did not have much suspense built into it. Problem? Not really. I just thought it would have made for a more compelling viewing. Regardless, Miller and a senior priest performing exorcisms is lots of fun with an ending that will leave you cheering.So even though I thought the movie could have been better, there's still enough good elements to erase most of the bad ones. The realism behind it all and the fantastic creations make this the top horror movie.4/4",10,1,2,18 October 2015
Gandhi," A Remarkable Movie About The Greatest Man Of The Century.
","Why do people not like this? Why say this is one of the worst movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture? Nobody knew this would not be a timeless movie. Sure Attenborough himself admitted ET was the better movie by miles, but Gandhi is a different kind of movie that is meant to give information and make people think, as Attenborough says 'a visual interpretation.' Either way, say this is boring or fun, everybody must admit how well-done this movie was. Maybe it was inferior to ET in some standards, but Gandhi rises above ET in the most. Sir Ben Kingsley is chilling to the bone as the Mahatma, giving one of the best screen performances ever. The way he walks, talks and behaves is so much like the real Gandhi that residents mistaken Kingsley for the real Gandhi. Some of his speeches are so fascinating and inspirational about freedom and unity, you know he deserved the Oscar win. Aside from Kingsley's acting and everybody else's acting. The general filming was monumental too, at David Lean and Cecil B. DeMille levels. Although this is inferior to those men's top works, Attenborough brings back that style just when we need it most. The movie may be boring as it suffers from a dragged excessive length that could easily be condensed, the sets and shots are very nice to look at. And the story is one that had not been done in years. I found this to be the 80's Lawrence of Arabia.Take a rare, epic look at the man that set an entire country free and united all of its nations.4/4",9,2,3,15 November 2014
American History X," The Best Acting Ever Filmed. Coming from an actor and hardcore movie buff.
","I am an actor, as well as a film fanatic. I have seen them all from De Niro in Taxi Driver to Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. None, and I mean none of these performances are quite as good as Edward Norton in this. This movie is about Norton who is a reformed skinhead who tries to prevent his little brother (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. One thing great is how big of a shock Norton was. Norton is a geek: his name, face and voice are all proof. But he is far from a geek in this. There are 3 Nortons: a nice high school kid, a monstrous neo-Nazi and reformed gentleman, all of which he does so convincingly with such passion that connects deep within the viewer's soul. The kid he plays is so nice and innocent. The monster he plays is so angry, frustrated and full of boiling hatred. This stage is the most intense acting I have ever seen too. The anger, intensity and apathy can make the viewers very uncomfortable. Yet, he is so well developed that you have no choice but to sympathize him. An actor has done a job well done if he can push the buttons of a viewer. The reformed man he plays is heroic and so philosophical that the viewer will love him. What really sets this performance apart are the transitions from his character's stages. It is during the transition that where the themes of the story are shown. Sure he is only briefly a regular high school kid, but going from a racist monster to someone reformed was so perfect. It is done in such a smooth and gradual flow that is unlike any other chemistry for a single character. Other great pieces of chemistry for a single character don't flow at a gradual pace like this.I think that this is one of the greatest movies in history that deserves high ranking on many lists. The acting by Norton is better than everybody else's, and it also has a strong delivery of an important message. These kinds of movies have the biggest impacts on viewers. I found this to be the 90's version of Raging Bull. Both contain intense acting be the main characters who are fuelled by extreme anger and personal demons who find out that hate is wrong and a waste of time. What makes this better is Norton's performance and the message being clearer.4/4",10,0,1,18 August 2014
The Usual Suspects," The Best Brain-Popper Since The Maltese Falcon.
","I think The Maltese Flacon was the first movie that required multiple viewings because of how complex and confusing the story is. Fast-forward almost fifty years to the movie that is just as hard to follow and just as good as Bogart's classic. ('The Usual Suspects' actually comes from a line in Bogie's best-known film, Casablanca.) In fact, this is such a confusing movie, famous and knowledgeable film critic, Roger Ebert called it one of the worst movies of 1995. Why did Ebert not like it? Because he couldn't figure it out! I have seen The Usual Suspects enough times that I know exactly what it's about and I could help anybody understand it. It really feels good figuring out an all-too complex story.The complex story unfolds with a massive explosion at a harbour where one mangled survivor in the hospital puts together a police sketch of Keyser Soze: the crime boss and brains behind the operation, who has never been seen. Meanwhile, disabled Verbal Kint (Spacey) escaped and spills his guts to Agent Kujan (Palminteri). He confesses that he and four other con men (Baldwin, Byrne, Del Toro, Pollack) met at a rigged line-up and do a series of heists that leads to the infamous Keyser Soze's right-hand man (Postlethwaite) to do the ultimate job. As Kint's story progresses, the movie becomes all that more confusing. As the movie nears the end, twists erupt with an ending that will leave you speechless. It is one of those endings that is just as shocking as finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost is The Sixth Sense and Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father. It is also one of those endings where the viewer has to make some rash decisions about what they think they saw. Once all the pieces of the puzzle are in place and you fully understand the movie, the greatness of the flick grows and you feel a great sense of accomplishment.4/4",10,0,1,15 January 2015
Die Hard 2," I Wouldn't Call It Better, But This Was Pretty Damn Cool!
","Die Hard is the greatest action movie of all time. Nothing else has surpassed it, not even its sequels. While Die Hard 2 recycles the story of the original, this elevates the stakes and opens up a larger can of whoop-ass!1988's Die Hard had a simple concept: one cop battles twelve terrorists who have seized a building. In 1990's Die Harder, one cop battles even more terrorists in an airport. The first Die Hard was fresh and magical, had a cooler bad guy and had more build-ups. This one has a more complex plot, more twists, better and more action, and more at stake.John McClane (Willis) is taking a Christmas vacation with his wife (Bedelia) in Washington DC. Meanwhile, sadistic Col. Stuart (Sadler) and his crew of terrorists completely take over the airport to guarantee the safe arrival and getaway of infamous drug lord (Nero). The terminal security and police won't listen to John who knows about terrorists very well. Planes will crash and loyalty will change and only John McClane can save the day and his wife from certain death.As I mentioned, this has better and more action (probably the most violent in the series). There's one action scene were the terrorists take out a SWAT team and McClane explodes out of an air tunnel and destroys them all. Easily the best scene in the series. Although this does not have quite as much suspense built up as in the first, Die Hard 2 makes up for it by having super intense violence and chase scenes. The base of the terrorists isn't even in the airport, so there's the wonder of 'how?' The terrorists shut down the lights on the landing, so any landing plane will crash. We want his wife to make it out alive. This is where the stakes are raised again: she stands a greater chance of dying than in the first.I love everything this movie has. It is almost as good as the first and one of the truly best action flicks ever!4/4",10,0,0,1 September 2015
The Butterfly Effect," Massive Thrills!
","The Butterfly Effect is a home-run scored in accordance with how smart and compelling a movie can really be. Sometimes with a great script and great concept, lousy actors can really screw it all up. Having Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart in the leads really caught everybody off guard. It showed that they can do more than just comedies.In the best performance of his career, Ashton Kutcher gives the very well-created character of Evan. As a boy and teenager, Evan suffered from blackouts that would erase his memory from certain events. Doctors advise him to keep a journal as a way to deal with his growing disability. Throughout his childhood, he's always had a thing for Kayleigh (played by Amy Smart). Kayleigh grew up in her abusive father and violent younger brother. She had the opportunity to live with her mother, but she chose to live with her father to be close with Evan. This first chunk of the movie explores Evan's childhood and his relationships with those around him. Although dark and sometimes depressing, the story and characters are so well done that your eyes are glued to the screen. Each blackout Evan gets keeps the viewer wondering what he missed.Eventually, Evan moves away. From then on, he gets no more blackouts and he is a successful college student studying psychology. When he stumbles upon his old journals, old wounds upon up and blackouts start happening again. In a turn of events, Evan discovers that by reading his journals, his memory can skip back to that time where he was on autopilot and change things-- ultimately time-traveling. Now the plot really takes off and the characters we are growing to care about will be transformed in unimaginable ways. As Evan changes the past, good and bad arise. Evan is a very caring man, so he tries to change the past for everyone around him.What really makes this so awesome is its unpredictability. The viewer has absolutely no idea how Evan will change the past and how different the present will be. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. Yes there is great acting and great filmmaking, but it is the character and plot development that really make this a huge treat.4/4",10,1,2,16 November 2015
No Country for Old Men," A Little Overrated, But Still Awesome.
","I just want to say that Fargo is Joel and Ethan's best. No Country For Old Men does not even come close to it. All that say this is 2007's best, I might agree with. I actually thought that there wasn't many great flicks that came out that year. This would not have been so well-received if it came out ten years earlier. However, I did like this lots. The Coen brothers never let me down. Like the other movies they've done, No Country For Old Men features cool characters, intriguing dialogue, and loads of suspense. This follows a redneck (Brolin) who finds a suitcase of money from a drug deal gone wrong. He is followed by a nutcase (Bardem) that escapes from prison and is after the money. A sheriff (Jones) may be the only one that can bring peace to the bloodshed that soon happens. As I said earlier, all characters are awesome. Bardem is probably the best one as he plays a stone-cold killer that is as evil as can be. Brolin is the character that everybody roots for and Jones plays a great sheriff with a troubled past. The first little bit contains very little dialogue. Little dialogue during a cat-and-mouse game adds lots of suspense. You are interested with what diabolical move Bardem is going to do and how Brolin will keep the money. How can characters be developed well with little dialogue? Watch and see. Eventually, more dialogue does come in, along with more of Jones, while still trying to stay the same noir-western style as earlier. Nothing is wrong with that, it just needs to be as clever as before, if not more. The movie is still exciting and fun, but it eventually just gets stale as the plot slows down, so the suspense decreases. The movie changes from a thriller to a drama. If a movie is a thriller, keep it a thriller, but add drama to it. Or is a movie is a drama, make it an exciting one. I didn't mind the Coen brother changing the genre the way they did, I just thought the movie lost something when it happened.4/4",10,2,3,27 November 2014
Liar Liar," A Freaking Hilarious Film With Lots of Heart.
","In 1994, Jim Carrey broke out as Hollywood's favourite funny man in movies with Dumb & Dumber, The Mask and Ace Ventura. 1995 and 1996 saw him starring in the lesser like Ace Ventura sequel and The Cable Guy. 1997's Liar Liar made him show the world that he was still the real deal.This is one of Jim Carrey's best and funniest movies. He is over-the-top funny and also displays good acting. He plays hotshot lawyer, Fletcher Reede, who is the best liar in the business. His fibs help him score huge wins in court, while also distancing himself from his son (Cooper). When he misses his son's birthday party, his son makes a wish that he couldn't lie for one whole day and it actually comes true! He gets in trouble with everybody in the courtroom that day as well as everybody out because he depends so much on lying. Sole honesty makes his chances of winning a prestigious case impossible. He must also find a way to keep his ex-wife (Tierney) from taking their son with her boyfriend (Elwes) to Boston.The character of Fletcher is, like most of Carrey's characters, goofy and comical. When he gets cursed with honesty, he becomes extremely outrageous and Carrey's comedic brilliance really pours out. Every time he confesses to something, the entire truth rolls out as he struggles to keep it in and lie. I believe that sometimes wishes do come true. But not lying is too unrealistic. The movie's theme is not to go back on a promise and stick to the truth whenever possible. It is nice to see such a hilarious movie with such a nice moral.",10,0,1,14 January 2015
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg Does It Again!
","A few years after winning his first Oscar for his best movie (Schindler's List) Spielberg wins his second Best Directing Oscar for his next war epic, Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest war movie of all time. In my opinion, this is tied with Apocalypse Now as the best. Both are fantastic war movies, but they're too different to really pick which is better. But I do agree when people say this should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. My favourite movie of the year was American History X, but Saving Private Ryan was a better piece of film. The movie that beat Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love, was a great and deserving flick, but not as deserving as this.This movie has a very simple concept, a war Captain (Hanks) leads a group of eight soldiers in the Normandy invasion during the Second World War to rescue a Private Ryan (Damon) and bring him back to his mother. The closer the group gets, the deadlier the mission becomes with the men dying one by one. Why are eight men risking their lives just to save one? Best war movie or not, this is the most realistic, bar none. The camera is shaky and distorted to capture the most realistic experience possible. Even more realistic than Schindler's List. So much that it looks like actual found footage. That is what makes the movie so brilliant, and so disturbing. The deadlier the mission becomes, the more exciting the movie gets. A fascinating tale of courage and heroism, the end result will leave you clapping with joy.",10,1,2,14 December 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," All Around Perfect!
","Lawrence of Arabia is said to be the best epic ever made and I understand why. In order for an epic to succeed, it has to hold the viewers' attentions throughout the film. Of course there can be moments of down time, but every movie has that. Lawrence of Arabia not only holds attention, it feature everything to make a great movie at all-time heights.Lawrence of Arabia is easily the best movie made about the First World War. Being the best epic is arguable, but there's only a margin of movies about WW1 and none are simply better than this. Newcomer Peter O'Toole is dead-on as Thomas Edward Lawrence--a role many people say he should have won for instead of Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird. If O'Toole did win, the backlash would be the same. I personally liked O'Toole and Lawrence of Arabia more. Lawrence is a hip and cool soldier who wants adventure and is assigned to help Arabian tribes face the Turks. He unites the different tribes and leads them to victory. Throughout the movie are beautiful images of the sun clearing the sky in the deserts of the middle-east with glamorous music. Watching this movie is like looking at an ocean sunset. No matter how many times you see this or how bored you get, you will not be able to take your eyes off this.Anybody that does not like this obviously misses the underlying themes and characterizations. As I mentioned, O'Toole is captivating. But everybody else is amazing too. Alec Guinness plays Bedouin Prince Feisel who was actually mistaken by residents for the real prince. Lawrence is a complex, multi-layered character who is one of cinema's all-time greats. He is a rebellious misfit who brings his theories with him to Arabia. Seeing it is his biggest challenge, he tries to become one with the army while still keeping his own self. Lawrence is an idealist. When he turns out to be a success, he lets it all get to his head and his ego grows. He unites the tribes and leads the men in courage than only he could give. We understand why Lawrence becomes vain, but still want him to keep his general humility. When a tragic situation changes his whole perspective, he wants out but his influence brought them far. That is where the themes of inspiration and leadership/influence really soar. Despite a terrible trauma to him, he still stepped up with the aide of people he once inspired to fight. He gained everybody's loyalty and friendship--two crucial things the movie is about. Just one man whom everybody doubted created such a bang and legacy that forever changed history. When the war finishes, unity breaks with disagreements but there is still some peace among the groups. I found that to be realistic instead of a picture- perfect happy-ending where everybody becomes best friends.I wouldn't say Lawrence of Arabia is sad entirely, there's just one depressing scene. But it is not happy either. It is all fully realistic and we have characters and situations where we can be proud of. The movie succeeds in everything it tries to get across, which is more than enough. Literally everything this movie has is perfection.4/4",10,1,2,13 August 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," One of the Best Superhero Films EVER!
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going strong for a full decade now. The superhero film genre has never been bigger as it is right now. Sure superhero films have existed for decades (even way back in the 1960s with Batman), but only one would come out once every few years. In the first half of 2018 alone, we have had Black Panther, Deadpool 2, and Avengers: Infinity War. With all of these films from this specific genre, fatigue has started to set in.Superhero films follow this archetype: average person falls victim to a mystical force that gives them superpowers; hubris of someone they know causes them to get similar powers of their own so they become a villain that the good guy could easily beat; forced deadpan jokes and an extensive use of CGI plague the rest of the film for well over two hours. Ensemble superhero films (i.e. The Avengers) follow this formula: a mega-villain tries to destroy the world so the assembled good guys team up and fight back with a tremendous amount of CGI and forced humour. Seeing these traits again and again will sooner than later leave audiences wanting a refreshing change. Predictability is all-too present now. Luckily, the third instalment of The Avengers breaks this monotonous motion. It seemed as though it wanted to start a new trend in the superhero genre. The tenth anniversary of the cinematic universe seems like the perfect time to do so.Right away, the film opens up with the villain--Thanos (played exceptionally by Josh Brolin)--laying a beating on Thor, Hulk and Loki after getting an Infinity Gem and ready to get more. This opening has some heroes in trouble and the villain easily getting the upper hand on them. While most of the MCU villains has attitude and are cool to see, not many of them pose a real threat toward the villain. We know that the good guys need to remember something crucial or use a little extra force to destroy the villain. Judging from how easy Thanos had his romp, one question will cloud the minds of those that watch the film: 'how are the Avengers able to defeat that thing?' This baffling question remains throughout the film. The wonderment will keep the viewer entranced.New Marvel superheroes joining the Avengers are Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spiderman (now portrayed by Tom Holland), as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. The combination both teams works quite well. The teamwork and friction between the factions increase doubt to how Thanos will be overtaken. But at the same time, the writing between the teams is so well done, we want to see them working together and their journeys to victory. The minor flaw in this would be that there are too many characters and too many backstories to follow. So this may require multiple viewings. Anything wrong with that? Not at all.Avenger: Infinity War also takes itself more seriously which is something I am personally very happy for. The jokes and punchlines are forced way too much and the deadpan nature makes it worse. That is almost completely gone here. Then there is how deep all the characters are. All of them face doubt, but they know they must save the day. And Thanos actually has justifiable motives. While we want the good guys to win, we hope nothing too bad will happen to Thanos. When was this last time a villain in a superhero movie was developed this well?As usual, the action and special effects are amazing. But since the amount of humanity is at an unusual high this time around, the violent scenes seem more intense because there is so much stuff on the line.This darker sequel to the 2012 blockbuster is a true sight to behold. The darkness is a nice change of pace that is needed to spice things up. And the use of depth and humanity are two things every great movie in history needs. Infinity War certainly has them. Everything in this are just in calling Infinity War a masterpiece as well as one of the best superhero films ever.4/4 stars",10,0,1,17 February 2019
JFK," I LOVE This Movie. I love it! Love it! Love it!
","I am not American. I don't care about history. I hate politics. In other words, I am a very easy target for a movie such as this. This movie stirred up a lot of controversy for inaccuracies and what not, but I don't know much about the case and I don't care about digging deep. What Oliver Stone brings to the screen is an astonishing and exhilarating plot about the mystery and conspiracy behind Kennedy's death, as well everything that could make a film as fantastic as could possibly be.The assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963 remains one of the most infamous and debating mysteries in American history. JFK is based on two books that dig deep into the case and uncover varies wild schemes about the assassins that connect to the FBI, CIA, mafia and others. I have never seen the theatrical cut, only the 205 minute director's cut. Absolutely not one single solitary minute was wasted. By no means was the movie stretched. It is rare that a movie as long as this can keep your eyes glued to the screen for that long. No other epic movie I've ever seen has gone by faster than JFK. Protagonist Kevin Costner investigates everything about the assassination for the whole movie where truths, secrets, and lies constantly unfold and twist throughout the movie.Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney, Jim Garrison who is shocked just as everyone else to hear about the president's assassination. He has his suspicions, but trusts everybody that handled Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) as the patsy. Three years later, Senator Long (Walter Mathau) reawakens Garrison's interest in the case and Garrison's eyes open and he does all he can to seek the truth. Over the next few years, Garrison buries himself in the case where he makes many enemies and isolates himself from his wife (Sissy Spacek) and children. Absolutely nothing stands in the way between Jim Garrison and the truth.Costner gives the performance of his career as a paranoid lawyer who is obsessed with something he will never achieve. A really cool aspect of this is the star-studded cast that follow Costner in supporting roles. Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, John Candy, Sally Kirkland, Walter Mathau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Wayne Night, Michael Rooker, Frank Whaley, Laurie Metcalfe, Vincent, D'Onofrio, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donlad Sutherland, Bob Gunton, and Jay O. Sanders are all the familiar faces I saw. With a cast of this talent, even the littlest scenes are awesome as heck.I officially believe what this movie says about the Kennedy murder. The killers must've had ties with the government. The records will no be available for circulation until another decade from now. If it wasn't an inside job, how come they have tried so hard for so many decades to keep in under wraps? Then there's the 'magic bullet' theory: one bullet could have hit 6 (I think that's the amount) different places at different angles that went through parts of the body. The way Kevin Costner describes this theory is just genius. And Lee Harvey Oswlad was not the only killer. There's no way he could have used a rifle and fire six rounds in three seconds. Cosnter goes frame-by-frame and shows which angles the bullets come from. Eye-witnesses even say they heard gunshots from different areas. Then there's Oswald's murder either hours or a day after the Kennedy murder. There's so many pieces of evidence that prove Oswald was not the only killer. And I was sold on the president's death being an inside job.The way Oliver Stone makes this movie is incredible. In some of his movies, it is evident that he is interested in style for style's sake. But the way Stone edits the movie and does all the cool camera tricks is merely a reflection on the story and characters.This is purely a phenomenal movie.4/4",10,9,18,26 September 2015
Gone Girl," Best Movie of The Year!
","Every so often, there is a movie with full originality, great acting, great filming, and wide twists in the plot. Actually, this isn't 'fully' original since it is about a disappearance, but the subplots and curveballs thrown are good enough! It follows a seemingly happy couple's (Affleck& Pike) journey after the wife goes missing. Throughout the movie, secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was. The themes of dishonestly, media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see. If there wasn't important themes, there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good. This movie is a first-rate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since Inception back in 2010. Inception was an action-thriller, whereas Gone Girl is a mystery-thriller, and I honestly can't remember the last mystery-thriller that was this good. Alfred Hitchcock would have been impressed.",10,2,8,23 November 2014
Get Out," An Atrocious Piece of Filth!
","This is supposed to pass as an excellent film these days? Sheesh!Funnyman Jordan Peele's directorial debut became the biggest sleeper hit in years. The sole reason for this is because Jordan Peele abandons his successful comedy trope for a 100% gritty film. Just because someone goes out of their comfort zone, does not mean the result is anything good. He tries to make a modern-day horror/thriller with a black lives matter theme, which fail dismally.'Get Out' has a very promising start. Chris is a black man in his early 20's and is dating white Rose. They've been going out long enough where it's time for him to meet her family. Her family is wealthy and they live in a remote area in the woods. He is a little uncomfortable since he's the only black guy among them. He meets some other black people in the area that act weird. He's even getting some hypnosis therapy from Rose's mother (Catherine Keener). So far, the movie is very well done. The filming is excellent, the narrative is exciting, and it's weird enough to keep the audience begging for more. When I first saw this, I was expecting this to go for a 'Vanilla Sky' or 'The Game' kind of explanation for all the bizarre things happening to Chris. But nooooooooooooooo!!!There's a twist that happens a little more than half way through that had me turning this off right away the first time I watched it. From that point on, the film hits the bottom of the barrel. It turns out that Rose and her family get black people to come to her family then her mother does heavy duty hypnosis so that they become slaves and sex slaves. I'm not making this up. This is an extremely stupid and retarded concept. Chris' best friend, Rod, is babysitting his dog and Chris is giving him some low-downs of the weird things that have been happening. Rod figures out the brainwashing scheme and reports it to the police. They laugh their heads off. They're right! Howcome none of the audience members or critics that saw the movie didn't think the same as these cops?!? So Chris gets out in one piece, but not without a fight. Him getting revenge on the family is pretty cool. These people getting destroyed was the only way of this movie getting any kind of redemption.When the twist gets revealed, 'Get Out' immediately becomes the single worst concept for a horror/thriller I've ever seen. The best way to describe the weakness of the movie is 'mean-spirited.' 'Mean-spirited' is unrealistic (the movie is very unrealistic) cruelty without any payoff. Watching 'Get Out' is like watching a 7-year-old kind getting mercilessly bullied by an 8th-grader.If you have an ounce of self-respect, you will stay away from this mean-spirited insult of a film!1/4",2,4,21,11 March 2018
The Theory of Everything," Eddie Redmayne WILL Win the Best Acting Oscar.
","Looks like 2015 is off to a good start. It may be early in the year, but I know that Redmayne will not be topped this year. Tough to say if this is superior to The Imitation Game or Birdman, but it is easy to say that Eddie Redmayne's stunning portrayal of renowned scientist, Stephen Hawking is superior to all performances this year.Most people know who Stephen Hawking is. For those that don't, he is a crippled English physics professor who uses a computer to talk and who has come up with very insightful scientific theories. The Theory of Everything chronicles his life from his humble days figuring out science at Cambridge to his battle with the life threatening ALS/Lou Gherig disease. As far as I know, this movie is about as accurate as can be. Every biopic either adds to or bends the truth for dramatic purposes. This must be no different. It must reflect Hawking's life enough to be informative, yet different for entertainment's sake. I don't care how much is accurate, I loved this movie for what it was.I have not seen many reviews for The Theory of Everything yet. I have a hunch that the biggest pokes will be not enough look into his science work and too much focus on his love and life. Personally, I found the home and science aspects to be perfectly balanced. The Theory of Everything isn't a science class! Judging from the rating on this site being lower than other great movies of this year, I feel that my guess is right. But I still found it to be the best. Not much better than the others, but close. I have a bit of a soft spot for acting; many movies I have said to be the best of a year are just because of strong acting. This is one of those examples. If the acting portion of a movie is extremely strong, it outweighs all other aspects that make a great movie. Eddie Redmayne's performance is the best of the year and one of the best I've ever seen. He plays Hawking perfectly, with his deteriorating muscle delivery being flawless. It will take a long time for someone to top this portrayal.3/4",8,0,0,1 February 2015
Good Will Hunting," One of the Best and Most Therapeutic Movies Ever Made.
","1997 was a very difficult year for movies. There was Titanic (that took almost every award), Good Will Hunting, LA Confidential, Boogie Nights, Air Force One, Cop Land, Austin Powers and loads of others. Good Will Hunting was one of the movies that year that continues to mesmerize and inspire everybody that sees it. Sad thing is, the movie was nominated for many awards, but won every little against Titanic. Titanic won almost every award because it had more things to offer. Titanic had the song, score, sets, acting, originality, suspense, among others that were either at par with, or better than other movies of that year. Good Will Hunting was not a great piece of 'film.' There was no (or very little) elements of camera tricks, deep focus, symbolism etc. All it had was a great story and a great script, those were all it needed. Good Will Hunting had the best script of the year and one of the best scripts ever. If a movie has witty dialogue, as this does, it deserves a pat on the back. If a movie contains dialogue that sears the heart and drives your emotions, it deserves a major award. Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor at MIT that solves extremely complicated equations in an instant that most professors take years to prove. After Will gets in trouble with law for the umpteenth time, one of the professors interested in him (Skarsgaard) sets him up with a psychology professor at a community college (Williams) to council him. As a child, Will was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he pushes away anything that gets close to him because he is afraid of being hurt again. Will is lost and scared and it is up to Sean Maguire, who understands him completely to make Will realize how precious his gift is. Both Will and Sean's lives will be changed forever. Good Will Hunting is a movie about searching the human soul for who you are. The therapy scenes, actually almost the whole movie is enough to completely take a toll on the viewer and inspire them and give hope. The acting is top notch by all, especially by Damon and Williams. I think this is Williams' best movie, not because he won the Oscar for it, but because it was one of the few serious roles he did the can change people's lives. We have Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to thank for this life-changing movie.",10,2,5,20 November 2014
Room," An Emotionally Strong Movie I Can Never, Ever Forget.
","Those that have not yet seen Room have not seen it because it is an independent film. Indies are usually hard to come by and are often expensive. Having seen that this was one of the highest rated films of 2015, I felt obliged to give it a watch. I was totally overwhelmed by how much of a psychological impact it had on me. Sometimes, psychological impacts are bad. Room is not one of them.Room focuses on two characters: Ma/Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Very, very rarely are the two main characters of a film as good as Larson and Tremblay. One of the few movies where the main girl and the main guy are this good is Silence of the Lambs. Room is at that level.After receiving her Golden Globe, Brie Larson is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress--a role which she WILL win for. Larson is one of those familiar faces seen in the backdrop of movies such as Trainwreck, but Room finally exposes her acting ability and lets her shine as she deserves.The one that really steals the show is young Jacob Tremblay. He is a cute little Canadian kid who gives the performance of a lifetime. I was actually rooting for the kid to win or at least be nominated for an Oscar. Being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself. Say Tremblay did win, imagine how angry other people would be if a prepubescent beat them. When its good, its good. Tatum O'Neal was 10 when she won. Justin Henry was Tremblay's age when he was nominated for Kramer vs Kramer.Room is a very depressing movie full of redemption that will make you cry sadness one minute then tears of joy the next. When Brie Larson's character was in her late teens, she helps a man find his dog. Unbeknownst to her, she falls prey to a kidnapper and is placed in a 10x10 foot shed and kept there for almost 10 years. She has tried multiple times to escape, but is never successful. She is raped and eventually gives birth to a baby boy called Jack. Jack has never been outside of the confinement and thinks that is all there is in the world. Joy loves her son and shields him from the horrors of the reality. Jack is a happy- go-lucky imaginative young man.A few days after Jack turns 5, Joy tells him the realities and practices an escape plan. When Jack ventures out, he is completely overwhelmed. When they both get out, the adjustments to life outside seem almost impossible. Jack has never seen outside the Room and Joy's reconciliation with her family after years in captivity seems almost impossible.Room is based on a book based on a true story of a Austrian father who kept his daughter locked in a basement dungeon for over 20 years. But the movie touches base with so much more. The very idea of kidnapping is depressing. But it also shows the importance of family. Joy and Jack love each other more than anything, and we feel it. Joan Allen and William H Macy play her parents, and we feel when they reunite. But perhaps the most important thing Room shows is how precious life is and how much there is in the world. Jack was a happy boy, living in a tiny space. His journey outside is the biggest treat of his life. And of course, the acting by all is superb.Room really hits home. It is one of the very best, emotionally-charged movies I have ever beard witness to. One of the 100 best movies of my life.4/4",10,2,7,14 January 2016
Schindler's List," This Really Is Spielberg's Best. Really Is One of Cinema's Best.
","Steven Spielberg is arguably the best film director ever. He may have done some bad movies, but his resume is chalkful of some of the most timeless things to every lay your eyes on. Enter Schindler's List: the true story of a crude nazi-party member (played here by Liam Neeson) that saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. Spielberg outdoes himself using every trick up his sleeve and more, to the max. The movie is black and white to get an old feeling and the filming in general is dynamic and hauntingly real. So it is a feast for your eyes. The acting is uncanny with everything being character driven, which are the best movies to see. As a brutal Holocaust film, it is difficult to watch. As a movie about a bold hero, it is a major triumph. Many different emotions are felt at very high degrees, happy and sad. Very few movies made this well that can carry you through over 3 hours can make you truly sad and truly happy by the end as a major accomplishment. None of these few movies are Spielberg's. Yeah ET and Indiana Jones were masterpieces, but a funny-looking alien and an invincible archaeologist can't be taken as seriously and, simply, aren't quite as good. With the general movie-making being superior, its seriousness sets it apart from Spielberg's other classics. Because this is Spielberg's best, it is evident that this would be one of cinema's best in general. Top 20, heck, top 10! If somebody calls Schindler's List the best movie ever, I would not disagree.4/4",10,9,13,17 October 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," One of Pacino's Best and the Best Bank Heist Movie Ever.
","Some heist classics include Inside Man, Entrapment, and The Thomas Crown Affair. Dog Day Afternoon tops those. The Godfather showed the world how Al Pacino was. Serpico showed that he the man. The Godfather Part II showed the Pacino was the best. Although Pacino has never topped Serpico or the second Godfather movie, Dog Day Afternoon certainly comes close. Al Pacino plays Sonny and John Cazale play his buddy, Sal. They plan to rob a new bank in New York to pay for a sex-change operation for Sonny's lover. The robbery was supposed to have taken just ten minutes, but one thing leads to another and the heist becomes a media sensation. Sonny and Sal demand for them to be taken to Canada on a plane so nothing bad can happen to them.I would call Sonny Pacino's third best character after Frank Serpico and Michael Corleone. He is funny, bizarre, determined, likable, headstrong, all-around deep. As the day progresses and stress grows, the viewer will be found rooting for Sonny and Sal, hoping they make it to Canada safely. Powerful acting and lots of suspense lead the movie to it's nerve-racking ending.",10,0,1,8 January 2015
School of Rock," My Favourite Rock Movie.
","I like to consider myself a rock 'n' roller and metalhead. I love all rock music from Chuck Berry and Little Richard to Alter Bridge and Weezer. (Actually, not really all rock music these days, I'm very picky.) I love all metal from Black Sabbath and Motorhead to Trivium and All That Remains. Several movies look into the subject of rock and roll, but for some reason, I find this to be the best one. Not because they explore the subject of heavy metal along with rock and punk. I guess because it was the first rock movie I'd ever seen and it had a huge impact on me. Well, one reason.In his breakout role, Jack Black plays a talented and hyper musician named Dewey Finn who aspires to be a famous rockstar. Desperate for money he owes to his more conservative roommate (White) and fired from his group due to his out of control behaviour, he lies about being his roommate who is a substitute teacher and goes to make big bucks at a prep school. When he sees how talented the kids are, he decides to make a band with them and gets them entered in the 'Battle of the Bands' contest to win some money and beat his old band.Everybody knows that Jack Black is funny and a good actor, but School of Rock shows his highly impressive talent in music and just how good of an actor he can be. Black really does know all the music knowledge he displays in the film and it really is him playing all those instruments and singing. I got some of my musical knowledge from watching this. I never knew how amazing of a singer Black is. I honestly think he could sing opera. One of the best voices I have ever heard. In his previous band, 'No Vacancy,' Broadway star, Adam Pascal, plays the lead singer. We get to hear some of his juicy chops too. Pascal is classically trained and was the original Roger in Rent, but I think Black is just a natural. It is tough to say who is better. It is also tough to say who is better between Black and the kids. All the kids are great musicians and great actors.Gene Shallit panned this movie, because of Jack Black. He is worse in other films like Year One. Although not his most serious, it does justify that Black can act.Another quality I liked about this is that is about giving the chance to open up and be themselves. In order to be a rockstar, you to have to be crazy and let loose. He subs at a super strict prep school, so the kids are more than just mechanical. He brings them out of their shells which leads to a student writing their title song. But it's not just the kids he influences: Joan Cusack plays the uptight principal who is overly stressed at her work. He even has a positive influence on her. This element is really what sets this apart from the others.4/4",10,4,5,9 February 2015
Amadeus," Absolutely Breathtaking!
","As breathtaking as Amadeus is, not everyone will like it. Everybody will agree the acting as a whole, and by Abraham and Hulce alone, are top notch but there are some people that hate opera, can't stand classical music and will laugh too hard at the outfits. Luckily, I am not one of those people. The acting is always the one thing I pay attention to the most, all other film aspects follow soon after. But with this, the sets and costumes are so good, you can't take your eyes off the screen. You are suckered into seeing a cast of fine actors, with two underrated actors named F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce leading the group. Even if people don't like classic or opera, the way that they are placed in this is sure to blow the viewer away. There is one scene where Salieri (Abraham) plays a fine composition then gives Mozart (Hulce) to critique. Mozart likes it, but makes it even a better piece in an instant. No matter the viewer, they will find that bit really cool.Amadeus tells the fictional story of talented composer, Antonio Salieri in an insane asylum who claims to have killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When they were kids, Salieri always liked Mozart's music and has always been jealous of him. His envy grows the older they get and swears revenge, not knowing Mozart already has a lot on his plate. Salieri attempts to destroy Mozart by any means necessary.In classic take of jealousy and revenge, Abraham gives a white-knuckling performance as one of the the screen's evilest and craziest villains. Tom Hulce's portrayal as Mozart is comical and haunting, funny one minute and serious the next. Not sure if Mozart really was like this, but Hulce gives one of those few instances where a comical character can be serious and Oscar- worthy. The music, sets, and costumes do fabulous jobs in enhancing an already fine movie experience.4/4",10,0,1,4 December 2014
The Game," A Satisfying Mind Game.
","David Fincher's first movie was the polarized 'Alien 3.' All he needed to do to make an acclaimed film was make a psychological thriller and his career was set into motion. Fincher has outdone himself since, but for most other directors this would be their peak.At the centre of the piece is Nicholas Van Orton, played to the usual max by Michael Douglas. He lives the lap of luxury but is very lonely. Having no friends and only one family member (Sean Penn), none of Nick's millions of dollars has made him happy. The suicide of his father is also engraved in his memory.Nick's brother, Conrad, seems to be the only person in the world that cares about him. For his older brother's birthday, Conrad summons Nick to participate in a 'game.' Nick is very reluctant but goes along with it anyway. Ready to be given instructions and get the whole thing over with, Nick's uneventful life soon turns into one near disaster moment after another. He meets a girl named Christine (Unger) who helps him survive. She may or may not be part of this game.I must talk about the twist because I think that's what makes the movie so good. Nick almost getting into deadly accidents and all the scares are just a series of setups by Conrad so that Nick can have fun. Conrad had to get almost the entire town of San Fransisco to play along and fool his brother. Almost anyone else would be pissed that all these near-death situations were just pranks. But Nick is just happy to be alive. He is also flattered that all of these strangers would go through so much just so that he would have a 'good time.' I guess that's possible, but this almost seems to be an adult fable.Nonstop excitement and no predictability make the climax all-the-more rewarding.4/4",10,0,0,25 April 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Some Improvements, Some Non-improvements.
","I knew right from the get-go that these movies would not at all be as good as the Tobey Maguire movies. But watching previews and trailers for this actually made it look promising: something the first one never had. Did the movie turn out to be as good as it looked? Not at all. What really hurt was that it had potential to be great. I knew it would not be as good as the old ones, but pretty close. I was fooled.Not much has changed from the first. Peter and Gwen are still in a relationship that makes Channing Tatum look like Cary Grant. Peter himself is still a wannabe cool kid from One Direction and still looks for answers about his parents. Like the first, the story is forgettable. I don't remember if all the answers are given, and frankly I don't care. All subplots are forgettable too. But what makes the subplots different from the first was that they fell flat on their faces. The first one actually had good development and did not fall. Take Electro: totally awesome villain with a great build-up, then just goes away. Then there is Harry Osborne. I thought Dane DeHaan was a better Harry than James Franco and a better outcast than Andrew Garfield. Funny thing was, he was underdeveloped! How can an underdeveloped guy outdo so many people? Watch and see. When he became the Green Goblin, I thought he was nearly as good as Willem Dafoe. Just as Goblin/Harry were heating up, him too was tossed! Instead, they focus on Peter and Gwen. Peter delivers cheesier and stupider 'wit' that make Jean-Claude Van Damme look like Humphrey Bogart. And Gwen's death? I laughed. Then I decided to re-watch that scene and I actually felt remorse. In theatres, I thought Garfield's crying was awful. It was good the second time. Other than that, all emotions failed by Garfield and Stone. I can't wait for the next movie Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do that is not Spiderman and actually serious.As I mentioned before, Electro and the Green Goblin where great. They saved the movie. Plus the general action and special effects were awesome too. Maybe there was too much computer effects, but the way it enhanced the action and made it look all cartoony, yet real was great. It also improves on the shakiness and no-focus that the first one had.So, the action, special effects and villains improved. The story, subplots, and main characters failed.1.5/4",1,3,8,20 October 2014
Casualties of War," Goes Way Beneath The Surface of Animals In War.
","Casualties of War will probably go down as the most underrated war movie ever. Maybe it isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket, but Casualties of War really isn't far behind it. What makes this hated by some it its subject matter, but in some cases you have to look past what is happening and apply the general circumstances to other things that may happen in other places. Do this with Casualties of War, and you see exactly why it is so good.Michael J Fox abandons his comedic charm as Private Ericsson, a newcomer in the Vietnam War. Some people say that Fox was wrongfully cast and ones that did not see this were unsure of how he could pull off such a serious role. He may not be funny, but he is still like a little like he was in Family Ties. The role of Ericsson needed to be a young underdog, so casting Michael J Fox was good.As a newcomer to war, Ericsson quickly sees how scary battles can be. Luckily, his loyal platoon has his back 100%. The leader of the platoon is the insane Sgt. Meserve, played disturbingly well by Sean Penn. Most war movies focus on how war changes people for the worse, ultimately turning them into sadistic killing machines. Meserve and some other members of the platoon personify the different levels of this, ranging from scared to animalistic.Just as Ericsson begins to question why he is there, the platoon kidnap the most beautiful woman in a Vietnamese village and aspire to use her as their sex slave. Ericsson and Diaz (John Leguizamo) want no part of it, but Ericsson is the only one willing to stand up to his men. The rape is briefly shown, but all the implications and extreme fear in the girl makes the movie disturbing enough. Ericsson is bullied for his refusal and he eventually tries to help her escape. It eventually leads to her extremely brutal death that is heartbreaking. Ericsson is haunted by the events and is determined to prosecute the men that protected him but murdered her.Yes, the movie deals with a soldier trying to stop rape. I saw it as a young man who was faced with a dilemma to stay loyal to the men that protect him and his own country, yet preventing such barbaric acts. It is about a man who must go against the crowd for his own principles. The torn loyalty could be applied to many different real-life situations, not just war.4/4",10,5,7,20 November 2015
Dumb and Dumber," One of the greatest comedies of all time.
","I'm surprised this didn't win any Oscars. The acting is amazing and the comedy is funny to the extreme. Daniels and Carrey are incredibly stupid that your IQ may drop while watching this; but you won't care because you'll be laughing yourself silly. Carrey plays a limo driver who is astonished at seeing Lauren Holly when he's supposed to take her to the airport. When he does, she leaves a brief case behind and Carrey rushes to give it back to her, but its too late. So he takes his roommate and best friend, equally dumb Jeff Daniels to Aspen to return the briefcase to Holly. What they don't know is that the brief case is full of ransom money and Holly's husband will be killed if the money isn't given to the ones holding the ransom.The quest to give back the briefcase, plus what happens before and after is completely unforgettable.",10,1,2,18 April 2012
The Imitation Game," The First Great Movie I've Seen This Year.
","2015's first movie I saw was Unbroken, which stunk to high heavens. The Imitation Game is full redemption. Both are historical true stories, with The Imitation Game being the good one.Benedict Cumberbatch may hold the ticket to an Academy Award win for Best Actor for his role as mathematician, Alan Turing. Cumberbatch plays Turing as evil genius-like, who creates machines to encrypt unbreakable codes during the Second World War, ultimately causing a win.I found The Imitation Game to be like 2002's Windtalkers, since both are about racing against time to keep top secret codes unbroken and winning war. While Windtalkers was clichéd and not well-liked, The Imitation Game had more layers to it and was more original. A subplot to this is the relationship he developed with coworker, Keira Knightly, despite being a homosexual. We get to see his love for codes as a youth as well as his struggles with homosexuality. The only thing that prevented me from really falling in love with this was how much war and political stuff was involved that was over my head. Brits talking about codes and politics was a little too much for me to swallow. It might just take me a few watches to fully comprehend and appreciate.I would not mind if this was the Oscar for Best Picture. I have a hunch that Benedict Cumberbatch will win for Best Actor.4/4",10,1,6,17 January 2015
The Piano," Beautiful And Compassionate.
","Jane Campion's harrowing romance tale quickly became one of the hottest romance films of the 90s thanks to its four leads at the top of their game. I do find this film overrated, but not enough to say I do not like it at all. I cannot discredit so many great things this movie has to offer.When people think of gorgeous films, you think of brightness and a lot of colours. 'The Piano' has a very dark look, but is still stunning to see. Only a supremely talented director like Campion could pull off beauty with such a dark palate. David Lean would even have troubles with this. The look is perhaps the best part of the film, my favourite anyway.Holly Hunter leads the cast as strong-willed Ada McGrath. Hunter plays Ada with fierce determination and a dominating presence. She is mute and has not spoken a word in a few years with it being unclear why. She stopped talking the day her husband got struck and killed by lightning, so it is possible she has a damaged voice box. Her daughter, Flora (Paquin) is also her interpreter through sign language. Other than her daughter, Ada's most cherished thing in the world is her piano. Only Ada knows how much it means to her.Ada has been sold into a marriage to New Zealand frontiersman Stewart plays by Sam Neill. Since Ada is mute and their neighbours butt their noses into their affair, much of Ada and Stewart's relationship gets lost in translation. He doesn't get how much the piano means to her and sells it to their Maori (he is white but adopted their customs) neighbour, Baines (Keitel) and agrees to piano lessons. Stewart doesn't think a great deal of it since they can get money and Ada can still play, but Ada hates what Stewart has done. Since Baines understands Ada, they have an affair. Their chemistry is steamy.Her is my problem with the film: Ada is very selfish and not willing to give her marriage a try. Sure she does not know Sam Neill, but he is actually making an effort. He tries to make the marriage work. He is perfectly okay with Baines giving the piano back. Ada rebelling and cheating on him with Keitel made me resent her. I do not blame Neill for flipping out. I get that Ada is a strong-willed and independent woman, but to me people need to do their share of working out problems and meet in the middle. But it is just Neill that tries to be a good husband while Hunter cheats. I never liked this portion. And since so much of the story is revolved around this love triangle, it diminishes the overall quality.Luckily, the performances are all stunning. Keitel and Neill have done better, but Hunter and Paquin are sheer dynamite. Very worthy of their awards.See this beauty for yourself3/4",7,0,2,28 January 2019
Jurassic World," Despite Clichés and Predicability, The Movie Still Rocked!
","I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a 'near-masterpiece' like The Outsiders and The Aviator.This is the first Jurassic movie where the theme park is actually open and tourists check it out. This does a great job in capturing what it would look like if there actually was a dinosaur park. Lex and Tim are not in it and the two brothers that plays the main kids are much inferior and stereotypes of modern kids. I couldn't help but laugh at them. They weren't dumb, but not good either. It was a flaw I liked and let fly by. Chris Pratt is a raptor-tamer who is also a stereotypical sensitive hero. He is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum, but I had a similar reaction to him as I did with Neill and Goldblum. Bryce Dallas Howard is the the most realistic and multilayer ed character as one of the park's heads. She is the boys' aunt and becomes Pratt's girl. The relationship between the two is a dead giveaway. So the characters are flawed, but still likable.The actual story is a bit worse than the characters. The scientists try to breed different dinosaurs together to make really cool new kinds. Why? To build up tourists. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and have been alive again for over 20 years in the movie. What kind of person would get bored seeing dinosaurs? It would take about 100 years for humans to get bored with dinosaurs. Even if it were true, look at renowned animal parks like Marine Land. They have regular animals but it's always wonderful to see. But the scientists wanting a new kind of dinosaur was cool. The new dinosaur they make is actually pretty cool, kinda like Godzilla. It escapes and everybody must evacuate. It becomes a regular monster movie from there, with every cliché in the book being thrown at you. At least the clichés were taken advantage of. There's lots of suspense built around and jump scares that were mastered. When the dinosaurs raise hell and battle each other, it feels like you're a kid watching a cartoon special. The movie pretty much is a cartoon special since most dinosaurs are noticeably computers.So despite the lack of wow and wide range of emotions that 1993's gave and having forgivable flaws, Jurassic World is one of the year's best.3.5/4",10,99,167,13 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," Like A Regular Sequel, It Is Not As Good As The First. But The Level Of Laughs Is The Same.
","In 2009, The Hangover shocked me by being spectacular and being one of my favourite comedies ever. 2011 saw its sequel which people thought would surpass the first. I knew it would not. With low expectations like the first, I was very impressed. I wouldn't say this is better than the first at all, but I will say it is a nice confident. The guys are back and the danger is higher.Stu (Helms) is about to get married in Thailand, his fiancée's native land. Ready to have a nice, regular time with his best friends, (Cooper, Galifinakis, Bartha) and soon to be brother in law, Teddy, Alan takes a dislike to Teddy and sets off a string dangerous encounters, leaving him and his friends with no memory and Teddy missing. Lost in a much bigger city with bigger crimes, Stu's wedding becomes more jeopardized than Doug's.The first flaw I found was the scenes with frontal male nudity. I also didn't see why Justin Bartha had little screen time in this one too. Right before anything bad happens, he leaves the area to be with his wife who is sick and the family. Bartha was involved in Broadway plays, so I understand why they used less of him, but there's lots of people on Broadway and other things that still do full movies. The last flaw was how recycled everything was. Since the stuff used was very funny, I didn't mind. But that kept me from finding this better. There may be more danger, but it revolves around the same things. One thing I did like was Teddy's whereabouts. It is a more complex and less predicable place than Doug's in the first.",10,0,0,24 December 2014
Logan," Really Not Very Good.
","I've never been a big fan of the X-Men series. The Wolverine spin-offs haven't impressed me either. So far, this instalment has maintained a very high rating on this site. It is different enough from the others to be considered different, but different does not always been better.The first noticeable thing that is different with this is its R-rating. There's nothing wrong with a movie being rated R, especially an action movie. But this movie seemed like it tried to capitalize on the successes of Daredevil and Deadpool by making it similar in tone and grittiness. But honestly, the action here wasn't as amazing as you'd think. It is good, but not great. There is lots of blood and guts, but that literally does nothing--it neither diminishes nor elevates the quality of the action. Maybe if this was directed by the same ones that did Deadpool and some Daredevil episodes, the action would probably have been great. I guarantee it.So Logan apparently takes a more realistic and humane approach than the others. Okay I totally disagree with that. Anyway, Logan's powers are dwindling and he makes a living as a chauffeur. His latest client makes him stumble into a wild scheme that involves doctors trying to replicate mutant DNA since the mutant population is shrinking. He also must care for Professor Xavier.So what other problems do I have with this? Right off the bat, it is way too long! It goes on and on trying to forcefeed the bogus relationship between Logan, Xavier, and the girl. And the storyline is too dull to fill up that much time. And it is told so much dryer than I could have imagined. And finally, Hugh Jackman. I've never understood the big fascination with Hugh Jackman as an actor. He is far too forceful in his delivery. I didn't buy it. None of the others were good either.So good action, and not much else.2/4",5,2,7,13 March 2017
The Dark Knight," The Most Overrated Film of All Time.
","I am a hardcore movie buff. I've seen them all and studied them all. Of all the movies said to be the greatest of all time or a contender of one of the greatest of recent times, this is the most undeserving. Do I really think that this is a 1/10? No. I ranked it this low hoping 9.0 rating would eventually drop. Because 9/10 on this site in 4th place? Many other sites ranked this either at the top or near the top? What the hell?! I will say that this was well made. The cinematography, action and danger sequences were well-done. But not as good as, say, Die Hard. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is what carries the movie and is the only reason why it is ranked so high. Without Heath Ledger as The Joker, the movie would have been as dull as The Dark Knight Rises. Ledger gives one of the best performances in recent memory, but people treat it like it's better than De Niro in Raging Bull or Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. Because of him, they also treat it like it's up to par with the likes of Schindler's List and Shawshank Redemption. I gather those people have never seen either one, because both those movies blow The Dark Knight out of the water.What it my problem with this? It's concept is stupid. Citizens of Gotham blame all crime on Batman, and Bruce Wayne agrees. He thinks Gotham's true hero is DA, Harvey Dent. Dent may be Wayne's buddy, he even he knows it's bogus. As The Joker rises and spreads chaos, Batman is still treated like a villain and Bruce just takes it. What a dumb-ass! And that's what goes on throughout the whole movie! 'You are responsible for all crime Batman!' 'Open your eyes! Can't you see it's The Joker that doing all this? You're welcome for me protecting you! Next time I'll just let The Joker kill you guys and let Harvey Dent save you.' I can see why they would label Harvey Dent as a hero, but can he really save people from a burning building? Or falling off a cliff? No, that's what Batman is for. Batman may not be allowed to kill, but just break his arms and legs: problem solved. And the Joker roams freely out in the open. With patriots and a half- decent police force, snipers would have capped him in an instant. The movie is very slow (practically getting nowhere) and the character development isn't very strong. The characters are developed into stunned pushovers. Good action, The Joker, and Two-Face were the only reasons this movie was worth watching. Joker and Two-Face/Harvey Dent where the only good characters in this.It baffles me how high people can rate and praise such a generic movie. The must not know how ratings work. Do they know who Robert De Niro is? Have they heard of Steven Spielberg? Have they seen Gone With The Wind? Maybe this movie isn't as bad as I said, but it is so overrated, I get sick of it easily and strongly believe it does not deserve the praise it gets.0/4",1,4,15,27 October 2014
Annie Hall," What Woody Allen Is Best Remembered For.
","'Annie Hall' seems to be everyone's favourite Woody Allen picture. It was his first masterpiece as well as his crowning work. When people think of Allen, even if they are not familiar with this, always picture him in his famous green jacket he wears here. It is not my favourite film of his (my favourite of his is the 1986 masterpiece 'Hannah and Her Sisters') but this has the most instant identity among all his films. It is also the one that packs the most hilarity with philosophy.Allen loves basing characters on himself, especially his early films. In this he plays insecure New York comedian Alvy Singer. He doesn't really suffer from depression, but he's hardly ever happy. He only sees the worst in things and never wants to belong to a club that would have someone like him as a member. As a child his parents fought constantly and they literally lived underneath a roller coaster in Coney Island. He's been seeing a shrink for fifteen years and still goes. He's been divorced twice by great women whom he over-analyzes.Alvy soon meets his seeming perfect match: performing artist, Annie Hall. Annie is almost the opposite of Alvy, making her the perfect woman for him. They fall madly in love and their blossoming romance is quite beautiful. With their love blooming, ditzy Annie changes for the better. She develops confidence and does well in college too. But Alvy is not the kind of person that changes that easily. Part of the comedy is Alvy not changing, but it's also pretty sad. Annie's self change is wonderful.Alvy loves Annie and Annie loves Alvy, but their romance just fizzes out (mostly due to Alvy's inability to be happy). There was really nothing either of them could have done to save their relationship. But what Alvy realizes about it is great: despite Alvy and Annie never going to tie the knot, lots great things and fun times happened when they were together. That is the central theme in this film. Annie develops success thanks to Alvy and Alvy writes a play based on his relationship with Annie. Of course, Alvy writes the play with a happy ending. We all want art to come out perfect because it is so hard for reality to be perfect.'Annie Hall' won the 1978 Oscars for Best Picture and Director, besting out 'Star Wars.' I am not at all a Star Wars geek, but the sci-fi opera really should have won the gold; at least Best Director because this wasn't a special feat in filmmaking. This is a gigantic feat in writing and acting, not filming.Woody Allen is a genius and he makes one of the great staples in American cinema.4/4",10,0,0,22 March 2020
Men in Black," The Best Sci-Fi/Comedy Ever.
","I know that some of you will be against me claiming that this is the best sci-fi/comedy ever by saying Back to the Future is better. Yes, Back to the Future is better, but Men In Black is funnier and has a more typical and stronger sci-fi direction. Back to the Future is hilarious and the whole deal with time travel and the science behind it is good, but Men In Black is funnier and actually has more alien creatures throughout it. Therefore, Men in Black is more worthy of the title I'm giving.Aside from me saying this is better than Back to the Future in some respect, this is definitely superior to the sequels and cartoon made about this. The sequels spawned from this featured more aliens and tried to make everything funnier. All that happened was the movies became sillier with less belly-laughs that this one had. This was more serious with funnier stuff. Since the series started with actual hilarity and not just silliness, they should have kept it that way.Men In Black tells the story of a top secret organization that monitor extraterrestrials on Earth. Agent K (Jones) is in need of a new partner, and quickly recruits streetwise cop, James Edwards (Smith) who unknowingly encountered an alien that committed suicide. When a spaceship crash- lands on Earth and the alien takes the body of a farmer (D'Onofrio), both men must thwart the alien and seek 'The Galaxy.'What makes this movie so hilarious and awesome is Will Smith. Having just finished The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and action-buddy-comedy, Bad Boys, Smith breaks out in his funniest and best role. His character is like the Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) from Beverly Hills Cop of the 90s. All of his jokes and honest opinions are side-splitting. What makes him the perfect candidate for the MIB program is how open-minded he is. There is one scene where he and other potential candidates from the likes of Navy SEALS and Army Rangers take a series of standard tests they are used to so the company can pick a successor and he is the only what that questions orders and analyzes certain situations. They take a written test and nobody can write well because there's no flat surface, so he pulls the table in the middle of the room close to him. The scene is funny as hell, but also shows that he doesn't always wait for instructions.The rest of the cast is fabulous too. D'Onofrio is unrecognizable after the alien takes over his body. That is just what makes his character funny as Smith. Check out this brilliant and hilarious science-fiction classic!",10,1,2,9 January 2015
Avatar," A total let down. I don't get how or why this became the biggest film ever.
","I'm one of the biggest film fanatics you'll ever meet. I've seen nearly everything made. This flick let me down. I was more disappointed in this than anything before. I heard everyone saying that this was the greatest film ever made. I believed them. But it came as a shock to me when I noticed that I'd seen before; only it was called 'The Last Samurai,' 'On Deadly Ground,' 'Pocahontas,' and several other things. The acting was good, not amazing. The action wasn't bad, but not good. The effects were great, but there were better ones a few years before. There were no elements of originality. Thus, it was a big bore. Cameron's Titanic and Terminator were a billion times better than this. However, on the upside, I thought that the 3 Oscars it won were relevant. But the 8.3 and grossing is much too exaggerated. Overall, it's one of the most overrated films ever.2.5/4",1,6,10,17 April 2012
There's Something About Mary," Perfect, Just Perfect. I Could Not Contain Myself.
","It has been almost proved that comedies are not as important as serious films. When you look at the greatest films ever made and critics' lists of annual best films, you'll be lucky to find one. When you do look at some of the all-time great comedies, you will find flicks like Some Like It Hot, Duck Soup, and Young Frankenstein. There's Something About Mary is one of those comedies stamped as at the level of the oldies. Some may find it funnier than others, but it is the way everything happens and the way the story unfolds that is just right.Ben Stiller ditches his good looks and starts the movie in a long flashback about when he was a total geek in high school named Ted Strowman who gets a dates to the prom with the most popular and pretty girl in school: Mary. Nobody can deny how beautiful Cameron Diaz looks as Mary. Things take a disastrous turn right away after he gets his sack stuck in his fly. This is perhaps the most memorable scene and the one that rolls out the longest. Mary moves away soon after with Ted blocking the incident out of his mind. Thirteen years later, he randomly starts thinking about her and has a panic attack. That respires his interest in her and his friend (Chris Elliot) recommends Ted hires a private investigator. Ted gets sleazy Pat Healey, played awesomely by Matt Dillon. Matt Dillon is a talented actor who has scored high in both comedies and serious roles. This is his best. Mary now lives in Miami, and after a while of tracking her, Pat also falls in love with her and decides to move down there. When Ted arrives, he learns that he must compete with many men viewing for Mary.The three leads in this are awesome, but it is probably Matt Dillon that was the fan favourite. The supporting cast is just as good, but it is where they fit in and who they are that drive the narrative to perfection. Some guy named 'Woogie' fell for Mary first, but she had to get a restraining order against him; Ted fell for Mary when she moved to his town in high school; Pat fell for Mary after tailing her, and there's a slew of other memorable characters perfectly placed. Lee Evans plays a crippled man who is perhaps the smartest one in terms of getting guys away from Mary.Each subplot is perfect. Learning the true state of Lee Evans' character was when I couldn't help it and my self-containment was gone. I said to myself with a huge smile: 'Oh my God this is perfect. Totally genius.' Now whenever I watch it, I laugh really hard and it makes me feel so good about myself. That's what's up with Mary, the guys want her because she makes them feel great about themselves. The movie as a whole does that to me. (Well, Mary alone does too.)For a comedy to be truly great, there cant by just fart jokes. There needs to be a serious aspect and actual brains in the way the characters are written and the plot is developed. There's Something About Mary succeeds in that.4/4",10,2,3,4 September 2016
Life Is Beautiful," The Best Foreign Language Movie I Have Ever, And Probably Will Ever See.
","Roberto Begnini's Italian masterpiece is won that brings out every emotion that you have deep within yourself to strong degrees. You laugh, cry, cheer, among other. He rightfully won the Academy Award for Best Foreign language movie and went crazy. That was an easy win. Later, he won for Best Actor. As astonishing as Begnini was, Edward Norton was still more worthy for the win. In some of my lists and reviews, I say Norton in American History X is the best acting performance in film history, so I knew Begnini would be inferior. I wasn't trying to be stubborn or biased. If Dustin Hoffman defeated Norton for Rain Man, I would disagree, but I would not mind either. Either way, Life Is Beautiful is a life changing movie with a marvellous story and top-notch acting.The first half of the flick is a romantic-comedy, leaning more toward the comedy portion. During World War II, Begnini plays comical waiter, Guido who's world of fun can get him out of sticky situations. He meets a school teacher named Dora whom he immediately falls for and tries to woo. She eventually gets out of the marriage with an arrogant millionaire she is forced to marry and sides with Guido. This first bit could be a movie all its own. But they did do a movie with almost this exact storyline at around the same time which was Titanic. Life Is Beautiful's bit is more funny and heartwarming. Some of the jokes that Guido does is a stroke of genius on Begnini's behalf. The second half picks up a few years after Dora runs off with Guido and we see them together with a son named Joshua and Guido owning the bookstore he wanted since the start. We also learn that he is Jewish. Guido and Joshua are taken to a concentration camp when Guido must think quickly on his feet on ways to protect his son from the horrors of the Holocaust they will face. He puts his knack for comedy to the test saying that they are contestants in a game where they must earn points and first prize is a tank, and he makes jokes every time Joshua sees or hears something ugly. What's really great about the jokes is that they are actually funny. I know that it is in the middle of a concentration camp, but still. Begnini had to water-down the Holocaust to make the movie believable and lasting. I think that history gurus may not be a fan of the Holocaust being so friendly in compared to how it really was. But this movie isn't about war, it is about courage, honour and the power of love. Guido is a very inspiring character that Begnini was born to play. As good as Norton was, Begnini also blew me away. He is a clown that will do anything to protect his family before himself. None of these themes and characters could have been presented better.",10,1,2,29 November 2014
Up," Pixar Soars To New Heights.
","'Up' has become only the second animated film in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It did not win, but was the nomination worth it? It sure was.One thing I have always loved about the Disney production is that the movies they make show a tremendous amount of humanity. That is the essence of this. I absolutely adored the love story between Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and his wife, Ellie. It opens up with them as children that aspire to explore the world, much like their hero, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan on one day travelling to the mystical Paradise Falls in South America--a promise Carl keeps. It then leads to a four minute montage of Carl and Ellie's lives together. At four minutes and silent, it certainly seems like a life well-lived. It goes through everything from them as children to the time of Ellie's death. Along with its lovely score by Michael Giacchino, this silent montage of life with Ellie is sure to make the viewer weep. We feel the effects of this scene long after it ends. Afterwards, faced with being forced to an old-age home, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and float to Paradise Falls like he and his wife had always dreamed about. The house symbolizes Ellie helping her husband reach his destination. It is almost like her spirit inhabits the house. And with the thousands of balloons helping the house float, it is such a sight to behold. True beauty.Carl meets a child named Russell who wants to help Carl to earn a badge in assisting the elderly, much like an angel getting his wings. When the house floats, it takes Russell along for the ride. They wind up a distance from Paradise Falls, but must walk the house to their destination. Now here is where the movie gets silly: Russell wants to keep a unique kind of bird he calls Kevin, and they encounter a group of dogs with animal language converters that allow humans to hear the dogs speak English. They just annoy Carl to no end. Turns out Muntz, who is surprisingly still alive, has made new dog tools and has been seeking bird like Kevin for years. These action scenes with he dogs and Muntz run on much longer than needed. I gather that was just for the children. Luckily, none of it diminishes what we have come to love.Carl is a multilayered character that is easy to sympathize with. As a child, he was timid but still wanted to explore. After the death of wife, became more grumpy as his dreams of adventure dies. When his house floats, his yearning for adventure resume from where it was years ago. Carl is torn between his new responsibilities to Russell and wanting to fulfil his dream. He wonders what is more important: a house, or people? The arrival of Russell may make things harder, but the kid is someone Carl grows to love like the grandson he never had. And the bird, the dogs, and Russell may be the perfect ingredients for Carl to have the adventure of a lifetime.This thrilling, beautiful and hilarious adventure film it one the whole family can savour. Reasons for loving this may differ with the age groups, but nobody can deny the greatness that 'Up' possesses.4/4",10,2,3,29 June 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Bizarre and Brilliant.
","Stanley Kubrick created a deranged adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella of the same name. The film has since become one of the most controversial pictures ever released and has become to me one of the best movies I have ever seen.What makes this so controversial is the explicit violence and sexual content. The violence is more barbaric (which includes torture) than a cheesy 80s action movie with Sylvester Stallone, and the sex (mostly rape) is also all out with the most rape I have seen in a feature film. The movie is about Alex (McDowell) and his Droods who rape, torture and rob people for kicks. But what makes this so bizarre is the way Kubrick tackled the look of a futuristic-dystopian England. The set pieces to gain a future look are greatly weird and the ones to gain a dystopian look (mostly dealing with sex) are even weirder. So Kubrick knocked the look out of the park.What makes this great is the character study of Alex and his delivery by Malcolm McDowell. He plays such an evil character with such a cool look and vibe to him that you can't help but be sympathetic. He's not one to feel sorry for (right away), but he still has that 'cool' factor. Roughly half-way through the movie, he is betrayed by his Droods and is sent to prison. There, he is shown disturbing videos along with music parallel to his own crimes. He is released completely changed and must deal with the hellacious aftermaths crimes he committed. The study of Alex is an evil individual that is changed to a normal person by the government; a regular person with a mechanical mind. A theme that could be used is 'sorry not cutting it' (not sure of a proper term for this) because he is changed but still must pay for all the wrong he did. The general structure and change is similar to Robert De Niro in Raging Bull and Edward Norton in American History X. So I totally loved McDowell's performance in this. Difference is, Alex is simply psychotic, whereas De Niro and Norton where driven by anger and personal demons. So Alex is scarier because he has no real reason to do what he does. When he changes, he becomes hugely sympathetic. Thing is, that's not him. He has no control over being good. At the end, he is 'cured,' reverting back to his evil self as the government is faulted and Alex is sent to be changed back. But the end is not fully explained, so it is very ambiguous and requires analyzing.The way that society and psychology is used in this is flat-out amazing. The performance by McDowell is a rarity and the story is astonishing. This is not an easy view, but it is one that is needed.4/4",10,2,5,18 December 2014
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino Starts Strong.
","What is a Reservoir Dog? Michael Madsen is one of them. Steve Buscemi is another. What does a reservoir dog mean? I don't know. Tarantino has said during interviews how he got the name but never exactly said the meaning. I don't care what it means, because that's an awesome sounding name! And the Dogs themselves have an awesome image. So the viewer will be suckered into seeing an independent masterpiece. Tarantino knows how to advertise well. All he did was use a bunch of recycled stories and mesh them together to create this. Tarantino had been a movie buff his whole life with no formal or professional training or education in the business. He would just make movies with his friends and gain experience that way. While Reservoir Dogs is probably his easiest film, it is not his worst.Reservoir Dogs has a very simple concept: six criminals (Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Madsen, Bunker, Tarantino) are gathered by a gangster and his son (Tierney, Penn) to pull off a major jewel heist. Everything that could go wrong, does as they discover a rat is among them. These kinds of movies have been done, good and bad ones. Even the bad ones hold some suspense as the viewer is curious to see who the bad guy is. Tarantino, being the genius that he is, gives away who the rat is about midway through, but is able to hold the same amount of suspense by showing the movie out of order and the Dogs in huge trouble. Tarantino loved showing his movies out of order. It made them much better than they actually were. If this was in order, it would have been just another brutally fun dark-comedy. Tarantino putting the movie out of order is like adding great background music to simple scenes, making them ten-times better than they actually are.Tarantino also introduced his knack for dialogue and characterization. If I'm not mistaken, Reservoir Dogs held a record for most f-words in a feature film at approximately 272. That record was broken by Casino in 1995 and again by Wolf of Wall Street in 2013. When I first saw this, I was shocked to hear the f-word be used that many times. When I watched Casino and Wolf of Wall Street, I wasn't really shocked by the foul language like I was in this. I have seen Reservoir Dogs many times since then and the swearing has gotten less shocking for me. Aside from the abundance of swearing, the general dialogue in which these words are placed in are funny and clever. In the opening scene, they talk about the Madonna song, Like A Virgin. A group of thugs would be talking about something weird like an 80's song in a very derogatory manner. The dialogue paves the way for some cool characters. Most may be stereotypes, but the dialogue makes them rise above traditional stereotypes we all know about.Reservoir Dogs is perhaps best known for its look and style. The Dogs are dressed up in black and white suites with black shades carrying hand-guns. Their hide-out just looks like its the place for a gang-beat to go down. That portion is very iconic and has since it has been mimicked in various games and shows that follow. The rawness and brutality this movie has to offer is what was poked at the most and what I'm poked it. Lots of blood and gore, but very little violence. I have seen this at many video places in the their 'action' sections. I felt cheated out. A brutal movie with no violence is a weird combo. Lots of people liked it, but I found this to be a case of 'you can't have one without the other.'Anyway, I highly recommend Reservoir Dogs.4/4",9,0,0,11 December 2014
Rocky," Defined A Genre!
","Before Rocky, there was very few movies about sports. After Rocky, movies about sports were coming like crazy. If there was no Rocky, there would be no Raging Bull, Rudy, Jerry Maguire, etc.Rocky isn't all about sport. It is mostly a Cinderella story for men. It deal with chasing your dreams and not giving up. Sugar-coat that with boxing, and both sexes will definitely be satisfied. Since it is a Cinderella story undertaken in such an original and truly inspiring and intelligent way, it is only natural for this to become one of the best movies ever made.I think everybody knows the general story of Rocky: an uneducated club-fighter from Philadelphia named Rocky Balboa (Stallone) who makes a living collecting money for a loan shark mobster (Spinnell) is hand-picked by world champion Apollo Creed (Weathers) because of his nick-name ('The Italian Stallion') to be his opponent as a publicity gimmick. Rocky isn't sure if he can win, but he makes an effort and trains his hardest to go the distance. Like most actors, Stallone was a poor upstart who came up with the idea of Rocky in his tiny apartment. It was so good that many production companies wanted to buy it from him, but Stallone refused. He got John G. Alvidson to direct, got the right stars, and Rocky was born. He knew it would be a sleeper hit. I'm sure he knew it would win Best Picture for 1976. Rocky was a major success that spawned a total of five sequels. Some better than others, but all of which I loved. Soon after Rocky, Stallone's massive physique got him into mindless and mediocre action movies like Cobra and Tango & Cash. If I'm not mistaken, Stallone has won (or has been nominated for) more Golden Raspberry Awards than anybody in history. Only Adam Sandler has rivalled him in more embarrassing victories. I understand why Stallone has won all these bad awards, but he actually is a good actor. Just look at him in the first Rocky movie alone: he could have won an Oscar. All of Rocky was his creation--one of film's greatest.",10,0,0,23 January 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Did You Really Expect It To Be As Good As 1991's Version?
","1991's adaptation of Beauty & the Beast is my favourite animated film. I honestly do think it is the best ever. No disrespect to Toy Story or Snow White, but the 1991 classic has such beauty and raw power that has an undeniably strong emotional impact. Sure there have been other adaptations of Beauty and the Beast, but none of which was a remake of the cartoon. When I found out that a live-action version of the cartoon would be made, I was thrilled. My favourite animated film ever is being made with real people! The Jungle Book and Cinderella are the recent live-action versions of Disney classic and they soared high. Okay maybe I'm babbling, so I'll get to the point: 2017's live- action version of the beloved Beauty and the Beast is good but not great.Emma Watson dons the role of Belle. She was good, but not great. In fact, she may be the worst cast in this. Dan Stevens is almost perfect as Beast. For the costume he gets, there was no getting better. Luke Evans is pretty awesome as Gaston (I think that's how it's spelled). Josh Gad was great as his sidekick. And Kevin Kline was wonderful as Belle's father, Maurice. But how well do these character's mesh with everything else?In the first little bit, Belle is popular and Gaston wants to marry her. The movie takes off when Maurice stumbles into the Beast's castle. Honestly, the whole chunk before that isn't all that special. The beautiful scenery and looks are what carry it...and the whole movie. This first bit didn't seem to have the joy and spirit that the 90's version had. It's rather bland. It doesn't suck, it just doesn't have much of a reaction on the viewer.When Maurice winds up at Beast's castle, he becomes his prisoner. Belle rescues him and she takes his place. Now the movie is taking off and we're at the point where the cool things happen. All of the animatronics of the accessories were sweet and the castle itself looks wonderful. And of course, everybody's a sucker for the romance between Belle and Beast. The only flaws were that the magic was lost. The little furniture things were cool but not awesome, the scenery wasn't enchanting or glamorous, and it was all too dark. I was expecting the look to be as enchanting as the live-action version of Cinderella from 2015. This one got lucky a few times, such as (obviously) the 'Tale As Old As Time' scene. In terms of looks, that Cinderella wins.The other stuff that deals with Gaston is rather generic. When him and the town's people invade the castle, it is the battle between him and Beast that is actually the worst part of that scene. There was nothing special or intense about it like the cartoon had. With all this upgraded technology, they should have made it as awesome as the cartoon! But whatever, the payoff when Beast and all the objects turn back into humans is wonderful.So the movie doesn't have the magic or charm that the 1991 cartoon had. So the pacing was off (almost fifty minutes were added, a simple fifteen or twenty would have been enough). So it was dark. The movie still has stuff going for it. The imagery is beautiful, the romance is strong, the music is fine, etc. Maybe they're not at the level of the old one, but this still does almost all those well enough. And the flaws I listed are reasons this movie wasn't totally fantastic and why I may not call it one of the year's best.Nonetheless, I recommend it. It's hard not to compare, but this is too good to ignore.3/4",8,3,11,17 March 2017
Pulp Fiction," One of the Very Best Movies In History.
","Pulp Fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever. It continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it. It continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie Tarantino ever directed. People that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this. People with thorough knowledge of film love it even more. I would consider Pulp Fiction to be the best film of the 1990s, beating out other classic in that decade such as Schindler's List and Terminator 2. Like most Tarantino films, he does not put everything in chronological order. That is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end. Even those very, very, very few that don't like Pulp Fiction were obligated to stay till the end. That is also what made Tarantino's first movie, Reservoir Dogs, so thrilling. Also, Tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver. Pulp Fiction has three parallel story lines:The first deals with a couple called Ringo and Pumpkin (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) that are also thieves. They open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant. The scene is brief, but the characters and dialogue is memorable.Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), containing a golden object that is not shown nor told. Another genius movie on Tarantino's behalf. A few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs. This is probably the funniest story. Pulp Fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy. This is the story with most of its elements. This also has the one with the best and grittiest look.Soon after the incident, Vincent is asked to entertain Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), while he is out of town. They have a good time, until she overdoses on heroin that Vincent got from his drug dealer, Lance (Eric Stoltz). Although a small story, the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep. Although this is the only bit with Mia, she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films.The last is about club fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight, but after having a crazy dream, bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent. He goes on the run with his girlfriend (Maria De Medeiros) from Wallace. This is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy. Some bits are shocking, but all fit together. Bruce Willis as Butch is just as badass and heroic as John McClane. As I mentioned earlier, the all stories are done out of order, but are all tied in in a very intelligent way. Writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard, creating awesome characters is even harder, while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part. Pulp Fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved. Only Tarantino could do a movie this good.",10,0,2,5 January 2015
Titanic," One of the Best Movies Ever Made. Haters have no idea.
","At the time, Titanic was the most expensive and highest-grossing movie of all time. It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting. Haters should continue watching NASCAR and Delta Force 2. 10/10.",10,3,6,21 October 2014
Rocky III," The Rocky Movie With The Most To Offer.
","The Rocky series is an ongoing Cinderella story. The first one saw him as a poor nobody who got the chance of a lifetime, the second saw him training harder than ever to get the gold, this sees him as a famous athlete who struggles to regain his pride. This is a more unique Cinderella story, making it a great watch.Rocky III has a different feel and tone than the first two. This takes place a few years after Rocky II with him riding high as the most popular boxer in the world. He has a huge house and a shiny life. The light is a better feel than the dark and dreary sense of the first two. Stallone also incorporates more cinematic elements into this. There's a charity fight between Rocky and pro wrestler, Thunder-Lips (played by a lesser-known Hulk Hogan) and it is hilarious. Hogan goes crazy and anarchy erupts. I die laughing at that. The antagonist is Mr. T in his first and best known film role. As Chicago fighter, Clubber Lang, he destroys every opponent in underneath two rounds. Stallone had a hard time finding the right actor to play Clubber Lang, but when he saw T on the show 'Games People Play,' he was blown away and contacted him right away. T is so good, kick-ass, and over-the-top that you just can't help laughing. Not sure if Stallone intended it on being like that, but I'm glad it was. After Rocky faces ten handpicked opponents and wins, Lang challenges a soft and vain Rocky, much to mentor Mickey's (Meredith) disapproval. Lang destroys Rocky like his other opponents and he is left with no fans. That is until his old nemesis, Apollo Creed steps up and offers to train Rocky for a rematch since Mickey recently passed away. They go back to basics where Rocky must find himself again and regain the edge he lost. Creed is just as funny as Mickey. As you've guessed, Rocky wins his rematch, but in an unrealistic way. He as little blood and bruises than the first, despite taking more punches. Weird! But beating Mr. T is the the most unrealistic but. That's just not possible. But it goes to show what can happen when you persevere.4/4",10,1,1,23 January 2015
The Godfather: Part III," Not At The Level of the First Two, But Still Brilliant.
","The Godfather is raved as being the best movie ever made. It's sequel is arguably better. Sixteen years after Pacino made his biggest captivation in The Godfather Part II, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo reunite to create a third instalment of the two greatest mob movies ever filmed. The Godfather Part III is raved as being one of those movies that's the worst in the series. That's true, just because the first two are better. Coppola has not done a true masterpiece since Apocalypse Now in 1979. Instead, he has done what I like to call 'near masterpieces.' This is is one of them. Even if this was a real masterpiece, I doubt this would have surpassed or been at the level of the first two. The very first one was adapted from Puzo's novel and the second one was half an adaptation and half new work. The main reason why the non-adapted stuff in Part II was because it was so close and fresh off from the first. If they did not wait almost twenty years for a third instalment, then Part III probably would have been better. But honestly, who expected it to be at the level of the first two?Twenty years after splitting with is wife Kay (Keaton), a soon-to-be retired Michael Corleone (Pacino) is being honoured by the Catholic Church for his great contribution. Right before retiring, he wants to legitimize his family by making it non-mob related. Right as the family starts to become normal, Michael is sucked back by his nephew (Garcia) who wants to be the new Don where they must deal with a massive conspiracy by the Vatican.Pretty much the only flaws I found were Pacino's hairdo (just kidding) and Andy Garcia romancing with cousin, Sofia Coppola. Other than that, the movie is great. After almost twenty years, Coppola and Puzo put together a 3-hour work of excellence. The story is great, acting is top-notch thrills are massive. This may not be as good as the first two, but I think it still stands well by their side.4/4",8,0,1,5 December 2014
The Departed," If Shakespeare Wrote A Play About Mafia and Police, This Would Be It.
","The Departed is a motion picture phenomenon that was the best movie of the 2000s without the uses of elaborate special effects. It was also the one that put the entire cast back on the map. Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese were doing well with other movies earlier such as Gangs of New York and The Aviator, but The Departed made them rise to the top again. This is one of Scorsese's top 5 films he has ever made.The Departed follows two parallel stories about two polar opposite young men that are involved with infamous Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). The first character we get to know is Colin Sullivan (Damon) who is taken in by Costello when he was a boy. Sullivan worms his way through Boston's police academy and eventually into the State Police in its Special Intelligence Unit that focuses on organized crime. Damon gives one of his best performances as a slick undercover mobster.Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance since Titanic as Billy Costigan who grew up on the wrong side of town. Knowing of his family ties, Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam (Sheen, Wahlberg) recruit him to go deep undercover to infiltrate Costello. Queenan and Dignam are the only people in the world that know Costigan is really a mole. Costigan is rough and brutal, unlike Sullivan who is calm and rational. Both eventually romance with police psychiatrist (Farmiga).Both infiltrate their respective units which is so awesome. The whole time you wonder: is it harder for a bad to pretend to be good, or a good guy pretending to be bad? Both DiCaprio and Damon's roles sound kind of easy to play, but both characters are too dimensional to be just any thug and pretty boy.Both men learn that there is a 'rat' Costello's crew. The audience knows that both Damon and DiCaprio are rats, but on different sides of the law. The film really heats up as the stars attempt to fish out who the 'rat' is while trying to keep their own true identities hidden. The movie is already red hot, but gets kicked into overdrive as one or both 'rats' become known to each other.A I mentioned earlier, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon give astonishing performances. The Departed has a star-studded cast with the likes of Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, and Ray Winstone, all of who give sick performances.Aside from the general acting, the way the characters are developed and the chemistry between them is just uncanny. Sure the movie is foul and violent, but that doesn't diminish anything. In fact, it just adds excitement. Regardless, the movie is purely character- driven to the max. In fact, the parallel stories and the character-driving is at a Shakespearean level. Shakespeare wrote lots of plays with identical plots that eventually come together and are purely character driven. The Departed is no different.Aside from the character development, chemistry and plot development, The Departed's themes elevate this film to immortal standards and give it the timelessness it has. It is also that last piece of the puzzle that makes is neo-Shakespeare. The themes of identity, right and wrong, loyalty, and family are all undertaken is such serious and original ways. Sullivan is so deep as a cop that he really starts to uphold the law and do right things, while still being loyal to his 'father,' Frank Costello. Costigan life begins to become a big blur as he loses track of who he really is. He wants to do his job, but he also wants out of a life of crime.Martin Scorsese adds his own magic and flair that only he can give. It is his best movie he did in the decade that still has yet to be topped.4/4",10,1,2,12 October 2015
Psycho," Finally, A Horror Movie With Actual Brains and Really High Intelligence!
","Of all the genres, horror is the one where the amount of truly good movies are few and far between. It is the genre that's taken the least seriously. Its true that this is the single worst genre of all. Horror movies are clad with a over-abundance of blood, death, bad acting and no point. Of course horror is supposed to make people scared, but 95% of them fail. While Psycho is not scary like it was 57 years ago, it is still one of the smartest films ever made. And the type of genre that the genius film is, happens to be horror.Psycho is best known for the infamous 'shower scene,' something everybody knows about. That happens to be the turning point. The movie is very good before, and even better after. The 'shower scene' is not even the best part in the movie.Psycho starts off normal drama with a romance story worked in. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary whose life could be better. Her fiancée is Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and their wedding is on hold due to his debts. She is willing to start life anew and steals $40000 in cash. This happens minutes into the movie as it turns into a road thriller. She plans on evading Phoenix and use the money to build her new life with Sam in California. She knows what she did was wrong and is scared of being caught. We the audience hold our breath in hopes of Marion not being nabbed. Tired, she stops in the Bates Motel just for the night. She meets and gets to know the timid owner, Norman who has a domineering mother. She sees that Norman has low self-esteem and has a change of heart. Can her self robbery get redeemed?Then the film REALLY switches gears and becomes the horror movie it promises. There's the 'shower scene' that derails the movie away from Marion stealing money and into Norman Bates. The 'shower scene' had many cuts and changes of angles, with perfect cinematography so that the figure of Mrs. Bates would not be seen. Norman is devastated, but loves his mother dearly, getting rid of the evidence.Marion's sister Lila and Sam hire a detective to search for her. Lila and Sam are worried since they haven't heard from Marion, and they found out about her stealing the money. The detective checks out motels, ultimately landing at Bates. Norman's agitation and inconsistency has him suspicious. Lila and Sam make their way to Bates. They discuss Marion's situation with others in the area and wonder who killed for the money. When they find out Norman's motives and who his mother really is, the level of genius that this flick has kicks into overdrive.When Norman gets sent to an insane asylum, a psychologist explains his mental state. This is the best scene in the movie. One of my 10 favourite scenes in all of cinema. Norman and his mother (who really was domineering) lived as though they were the only two people in the world. She started dating again ten years earlier and Norman killed them both. Unable to cope with her death, he keeps her corpse well treated and acting like she was still alive. But that wasn't enough, he created an alternate personality of his mother and would sometimes dress up as her to maintain the illusion. Since he was jealous of her and her lover, he assumed she would be too. So when moments of passion would arise in Norman's life, the 'mother' part of him would take over and kill. Norman fell in love with Marion and 'mother' killed her. He had not idea about the money. If Norman felt any real sense of danger, the 'mother' part would kill. 'Mother' the detective. The 'mother' part has consumed Norman's life.The whole flick is a psychological lesson in the mind of a madman. There are many other instances of intelligence that branch off. Although far from being the scariest film ever, it should still forever remain the best horror film ever.4/4",10,0,0,11 November 2017
Jersey Boys," Eastwood Lights Up New Jersey's Greatest Musicians.
","This has got to be one of the best musical biopics ever made. I'm talking up there with Ray, De- Lovely, La Bamba and the Buddy Holly Story. Not really sure which is the best of the ones before Jersey Boys, I will say all are equal and Jersey Boys is equal to them. If I had to pick a favourite, it would probably have to be the Buddy Holly Story because I love Buddy Holly the most. Since I love Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons so much, it may be my second favourite.Clint Eastwood is one of the coolest movie star ever as well as one of the best directors ever. Unforgiven is easily my favourite movie he has directed, Jersey Boys is my second favourite. I did notice mostly negative reviews on different sites and by different critics just before writing this. They picked at too much melodrama and subplots, as well as this being somewhat below Eastwood's filmmaking standards. The movies would not have been as good if it was directed by anybody else. Perhaps Martin Scorsese or Ron Howard would have been the only other worthy candidates for this. I guess you have to be a huge fan of the Four Seasons and love musicals in general to love this. Jersey Boys brilliantly documents the early days of lowlife street thugs from New Jersey with ties to the mafia that become musical sensations, to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Yes, this is a true story about Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, but this is adapted directly from the Broadway play of the same name. I hear the play is one of the best out there, and the original Frankie Valli from the play actually plays Valli in the movie. As an actor, he plays him very well, and his singing matches Valli perfectly. Frankie Valli has a very high voice that most people can't quite reach, and those that can don't sound much like him. John Lloyd Young can hit the notes and sing like him perfectly. I thought that there actually were portions where he was lip-syncing, but I was fooled. All the other actors are played with heart and strong believability. Their musicianship is as dead-on as Young's alone. We get a good look into their roots and single lives too. As most would think, too many subplots is bad, but just enough is down so that they are not rushed, yet not so little that they are pointless. The general look of the film keeps the audience intrigued and feeling warm. It bears a strong resemblance to Goodfellas. In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese creates the perfect look of 1950's New Jersey (or maybe it was New York) and Clint Eastwood emulates the look. But it isn't a precise copy. Since Jersey Boys is a musical, Eastwood made everything look nicer and more artsy by adding more colours, nicer costumes and better filming. As the movie progresses past the 50s, Eastwood keeps the sharp look coming.",10,0,1,5 January 2015
12 Years a Slave," Ejiofor Saves A Pointless Stinkfest.
","12 Years A Slave won the Oscar for Best Picture this year. If this was released, say, 25 years ago, this would have received little praise and won very little awards. That just shows how far downhill Hollywood has gone. I can see why people would love it, but place this years ago and nobody would. What is wrong with this? A well-respected black man (Ejiofor) is kidnapped and sold into slavery where he must witness and be victimized to extreme cruelty by his owners. Other than showing how brutal slavery can be, there is no point and the film goes nowhere. Just Negroes getting beaten throughout the whole movie because they can. I know that this movie is supposed to be hard to watch, but that's no excuse to leave important film components out. Pay It Forward was sad, but it has theme, it gets somewhere, there is plot development. 2007's The Girl Next Door had a theme, the plot actually went somewhere. 12 Years A Slave just didn't have a point or story. Django Unchained is a slavery movie that actually gets places. 12 years just repeats the same thing for over two hours. Wolf of Wall Street was more worthy of an Oscar win than this and Gravity, because it actually has a story that unfolds.However, everybody did a mighty fine job of acting. Since Ejiofor is the main character, it is only natural that he would be the best. In fact, I think that he gave the best performance of the year. Sure DiCaprio and McConoughey were worthy, but this is the kind of acting that always moves people the most. Plus people rave this as being the best film of the year, so him not winning was a surprise. But McCounoghey was worthy and I'm glad he won. So I may not have liked this film very much, but the acting (mainly Ejiofor) is the only reason why I would see the again. Other than that, there's no point, like the movie itself.1/4",3,3,6,29 October 2014
A Hard Day's Night," Dated Movie, Immortal Music.
","The Beatles are certainly a contender for the best band ever. How many other bands in history could rival them? Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, maybe Metallica? Regardless of where they stand, nobody can deny them being a perfect contender for being the best of the best. Their music is simply flawless and magical.The Beatles may have released their first album in 1962 but by 1964, they were on top of the world. John Lennon even had the gull to call his group 'bigger than Jesus.' The legendary opening scene features the titular song being played while the band members are running away from hundreds of crazy fans. This is one of the top ten opening scenes ever. Unfortunately, not every scene measures up to the legendary opening.'A Hard Day's Night' is just a series of meaningless shenanigans over the course of two days that do not feel special at all. When they first get on the train away from those screaming fans, they meet up with Paul's grandfather. I was very surprised at how boring it was. Then when they break out into their first song, it is lively and enjoyable. Honestly, what Beatles' song ISN'T lively and enjoyable.Nothing that happens in the movie is particularly interesting or fun. I'm sure it was funny at the time, but that was over fifty years ago. The Beatles were on top of the world. So this is a time capsule of the best band at the top of the world. Does that mean the movie itself is good? Not at all. Literally the only good parts are when they sing. Enchantment grows and amazement resonates. When there is no music, the movie turns into a bore.2.5/4",6,0,1,9 November 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," I Liked This For What It Had.
","Every generation needs a Dracula adaptation. Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992 is one of the most faithful to the original text (or so I hear) and one of the scariest vampire movies ever made. The movie met with polarizing reviews, but I am pretty lenient--I think of this as a good popcorn flick on a Saturday night.Francis Ford Coppola does his best job in directing, even superior to Apocalypse Now. I'm not saying Dracula is even in the same ballpark as Apocalypse Now, but the way everything is set up and the general look of the films are stellar. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is pretty polarizing, but even the haters must admit how awesome this movie looked. The feel is fantastic, the camera movements are awesome, the set design/costume/make-up are all vibrant, the special effects are sick, the atmosphere is perfect, and the music is haunting. In other words, almost everything in front of the camera is done to precision. Then we get to the other things infant of the camera and most of what's behind it...The first flaw right off the bat is Keanu Reeves. I do think he is talented and does good performances. But Dracula shows that he cannot play everything well. His accent isn't as bad as people say, but other than that he isn't good as Jonathan Harker. Winona Ryder plays Mina, who is good in some scenes but bad in others. Everybody else is good, with Gary Oldman (of course) shining as Dracula.While most of the actors are good, the characterizations fall flat and the movie never really seems to find a sense of direction. There never really seems to be a rhyme or reason behind them, or clear motivation. Everything involving the characters is so poorly organized, good thing Coppola is a talented movie maker with a talented cast.Look: 10/10 Characters: 6/10 I love all of the visuals. Overall: 3/4",7,0,1,28 February 2016
Parasite," The Best Film in Years.
","Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say 'now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen.' Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been 'I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever.' Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.'Parasite' could be simplified as 'family vs family' but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.The reason I call this film 'Hitchcockian' is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.4/4",10,15,24,14 November 2019
Platoon," Not Just A Great War Movie.
","Platoon is loosely based on real life situations that writer/director, Oliver Stone went through when he was in the Vietnam War. This is also parallel to Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. I'm going to start out by saying that I found Apocalypse Now to be a much better flick. Platoon is practically the same story with everything inferior, which is why I'm not giving a perfect score. When compared, Platoon is inferior. Even when not compared, this movie gives a great sense of deja-vu. 'Haven't I seen this before?' Both movies are about a Sheen enlisting in the Vietnam War and transcend into madness and insanity while partaking in the horrors of war. Apocalypse Now has Martin Sheen on a mission to assassinate a demigod while Platoon has Charlie Sheen's mental state wearing thin after a massacre occurs. Apocalypse Now has build-ups and gets somewhere with the plot, and has an overall better look. Platoon is certainly not bad. Heck, it IS as good as everybody says. It won Best Picture and Director of 1986, but I think Aliens should have won one of those.I think that any war movie is a great movie. Think about how it takes the action sequences to do and make-up to put on. Platoon's action sequences are excellent. But what makes Platoon the extravagant film that it is, is it's accurate depictions of life in war. While movies like Rambo made war seem fun and cool, Platoon was back to reality. The whole idea of transcending into madness is shown so well by all and is always relevant.4/4",9,3,4,25 February 2015
Halloween," The First Great Serial Killer Movie.
","I shouldn't say it was the first great 'horror' movie. Before this was stuff like The Exorcist and Psycho. This wasn't much of a 'slasher' but Michael is indeed a serial killer and this beats whatever serial killer movies there were before like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. Although not as scary, this is still better. With fantastic filming techniques and uncanny storytelling, this first-rate psychological horror movie set the bar for horror movies to come that has barely been matched. The movie starts off in a first person view as Michael Myers murders his older sister for no apparent reason. The way this is down is genius as there is one steady shot and the viewer gets a glimpse at Michael's perspective. Fifteen years later, 21-year-old Michael escapes the mental institution where he was sent and goes on a massive killing spree on Halloween night. The series protagonist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Pleasance) has known and observed Michael since his first kill and describes Michael as 'pure evil' and 'without conscience.' Loomis may be the only one that knows what to do to prevent Michael from continuing his evil ways. Pleasance is awesome as Loomis and the way he describes Michael is chilling. Also, saying Michael has no motive makes everything that much scarier. It is always worse for people when there is no motive. After Michael dawns his trademark outfit and Captain Kirk mask, Carpenter does a genius move by showing either parts of Michael (like below the head) or Michael from a distance. That keeps the viewer intrigued as they don't really know what the killer looks like or what will be dealt with. We also get to learn about the other protagonist, high-school babysitter Laurie Strode (Curtis) where character development is built to root for her. At night, Michael goes on his killing spree, setting basic horror movie rules (don't have sex, don't ask 'who's there?' etc) so there is some predictability. But everything is executed so well, there's no big deal. Laurie is the only survivor of Michael's victims, and this was also what put Jamie Lee Curtis on the map as the 'scream queen,' and a hero. She was one of cinema's first female heroes as she takes on evil's human force. The pacing of this movie is also genius. After Michael's first kill, we get to know Loomis, Laurie and Michael with occasionally seeing Michael himself. It takes its time, and is somewhat slow. At nightfall (just before the hour mark) is when things start getting faster and Michael's rampage at night causes the movie to get very fast and scare the viewer. There is little blood and a small- body-count, but the suspense created around each death makes the experience extra scary. The suspense this movie creates is unrepeatable. The movie raised the bar on film suspense, and general horror.",10,0,1,11 November 2014
Raging Bull," Modern-day Citizen Kane. It stands the test of time.
","Raging Bull has been raved as the best movie of the 80s and currently ranks number 4 on AFI's list of 100 Greatest Films. I can certainly see why.Raging Bull is a genius piece of cinema. The way the boxing scenes, cinematography and all else was done with simple tricks that make for a great flick. Citizen Kane was perhaps the first movie to use genius camera tricks and filming techniques. Movies with genius filming tricks are equivalent to, or sometimes surpass, heavily computer-generated masterpieces like the new Planet of the Apes movies. It shows that less can be more. It can also symbolize a part in the movie and give a scene deep-meaning. That is why I agree with this being the best movie Martin Scorsese ever directed.Raging Bull tells the story of middleweight boxing legend, Jake LaMotta's rise and fall. He is explosive temper is fuelled by his personal demons of frustration, jealousy, fear and paranoia of his professional and personal lives leads him to the top of the boxing world and destroys his personal life, where he eventually loses everybody that supported him. De Niro was so fantastic and was very deserving of his Oscar. Everybody in the supporting cast was excellent too. This is not a movie about boxing. That is why some people may not like this. If you think of it as a movie about boxing, you will not understand the message or meaning that this movie is trying to convey. Even if you don't think of it as a boxing movie, it may take a few watches to understand the depth. The main theme, which is probably the most important and the movie's main message, is how bad it is when violence consumes one's life: he responds with any kind of situation even remotely negative with the only way he knows how--the monster he becomes in the ring. If you can't figure out the message, you will not think this movie is totally amazing. Once figured out, you will love the movie that much more. Like Citizen Kane or It's a Wonderful Life, the main message is one that is always relevant and comes with a strong impact.4/4",10,3,3,26 July 2014
Straight Outta Compton," The Best Rap Movie Ever Made!
","That's right, this is the best rap flick ever. It tops other flicks of its kind such as 8 Mile and Notorious. While I don't like hip-hop music, the SOC documents the days when it had a technique and was had meaning. Aside from that, Straight Outta Compton has so many things to offer.NWA was a rap band in the 80s and 90s that was part of the hip-hop explosion during that time. Public Enemy and Run DMC were other hip-hop groups around that time, but NWA broke new ground with aggressive, shocking, and truthful lyrics. They were just a group of guys from the inner city that dealt with poverty, drugs, racism and crime. Sure these things are shown in nearly every urban movie, but the way SOC deals with these issues is better done as it helps enhance the plot and evolve the characters. All other flicks have these elements but are not used best like in here. You feel like you are watching something truly excellent. Each member of the group is developed well (some more than others) and the relationship with each other and society is awesome. As a bunch of black guys from the ghetto, they are often harassed by racist cops. It is things like these that they write about and rap about with lots of conviction. There's meaning, not just wining about a bad life. This movie really takes us into what inspires them to rebel and be themselves.When they get to be famous, we get to see life on the road and parties just like in other musical biopics. One thing I loved was the subplot with exploitive managers and producers. Biopics hardly ever show this. If they do, they don't dive deep into like this does. Doesn't sound interesting? SOC make it very interesting. That is ultimately what breaks them up and moves them to different record companies. Something I loved was they showed NWA's influence of society. Not just rappers, general society. In the backdrop of the last little bit is the Rodney King Controversy and how NWA's rebellious attitudes could have influenced shock waves in society such as the Rodney King Case. Most musical biopics hardly show the influences on society and relationships with other groups this well.I hate rap music, but I love this film. Easily one of the year's best.4/4",10,8,39,22 August 2015
Bull Durham," A Sweet Sports Flick!
","I personally don't like sports. They're too superficial to get wrapped up in. And baseball is one of the most boring sports to watch. Other boring sports include tennis, curling, and NASCAR. But baseball is bigger, the most boring of the popular sports. Regardless of if you like baseball or not, Bull Durham doesn't care if you're a fan or not. It wants you to be entertained and just have an all-around good time.Bull Durham is a three-character driven film about life, love, and baseball. Susan Sarandon gives her first great performance as Annie Savoy. I forget her official position with the team, but she is picks one member of the Durham Bulls to seduce to make a better player. She's a groupie and her reasons behind the sex seem too silly--she uses sex as means of making players on the team better. Is she a sex addict? Is she a libertine? Is she trying to fill a void? I think her sexual ambition was too silly to be taken seriously--the only reason I can not giving this a perfect score.Kevin Costner plays Crash. He's spent twelve years in the minors and can't never catch a break. He gets drafted to the Bulls and hopes he can make it to the MLB from there. But he may not be as good as he thinks he is.Caught between Annie and Crash is Tim Robbins, who plays Nuke. Nuke is a talented and immature pitcher who stands a chance of making it big. The main reason Crash got drafted was to train Nuke into honing his craft. Nuke has the speed and agility, but poor aim. And he happens to be the player Annie chooses to be with for the season.The love triangle is pretty cool as both men are attracted to Annie. Annie wants both of them, but it is unclear who could benefit from her more. As the movie unfolds, this becomes more clear. The scenes where Annie gets with Crash and Nuke are fun. The friendship and training with Crash and Nuke is hilarious. The trio together have perfect chemistry.Despite the movie being centred on three people, we do get a good look at the other members of the team and their rituals. Some use prayer beads, some use sex, it all depends which one works. Whichever works, stick with it.A major strength with Bull Durham is that is places the viewer into the escapades of the players. They go to the bars, have some beers, argue with officials, etc. When the lights go down, the viewer becomes a die-hard fan like the ones in the bleachers. The viewer also feels the pressures of the players. But first and foremost, the movie is hilarious. The love story isn't sappy and there isn't a psychological bridge that gets drawn with the players. Comedy is used to fill up and push the movie.There is too much not to like.3.5/4",8,0,1,31 October 2017
The Deer Hunter," An Emotionally Shattering Film That I Can't Recommend Enough.
","The Deer Hunter is a fascinating and intensively depressing movie that speaks levels. It won 1978's Oscar for Best Picture, despite its features. This was before Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. It follows the same pattern of the effects of war, but The Deer Hunter is by far the saddest.The Deer Hunter follows a group of blue-collar factory workers (De Niro, Cazale, Savage, Walken) in Pennsylvania who enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. As a three-hour epic, the film is divided into three parts: before war, war, and after war. The before war bit seems unnecessary and skippable, but it needs viewing just as much as the other scenes. We get a good look at each of their lives, with a main focus on De Niro and Walken. Savage gets married and the wedding bit is long and could be skipped. When the men go off to war, the horrors of Apocalypse Now and Platoon are squashed into less than an hour. Because this is its own creation and did not take anything from any movie, it is unique in that sense. In fact, because all the horrors of war are looked upon and condensed cleverly, and since the characters are so well-developed in the first period, the war bit is sadder and more intense than Apocalypse Now and Platoon. There's Russian Roulette and exploitation that is handled better than these phonies like 12 Years A Slave and Unbroken. When they get out of war, that is when the shattering begins. All men are scarred for life, with Walken a completely changed man whose world is quickly crumbling. He becomes obsessed with Russian Roulette and De Niro attempts to save him. All men are much different than how they were in the first Act. The first Act requires viewing to see exactly how war affects people. The first Act shows how they are, the third Act shows what they become, and the second Act shows how they become it. Because this tends to focus more on the before and after bits of war and not so much of the war itself, it is the best study of war effects and psychological messes. Even if you don't want to see a war movie and are just interested in people's minds and psychology, The Deer Hunter is the movie for you. If you want to see a first rate character study and first rate acting, The Deer Hunter is the movie for you. No matter your intentions, The Deer Hunter will not disappoint and you will never forget the effects on you.",10,0,2,16 January 2015
Unbroken," I Was Fooled.
","I remember seeing previews and sneak-peaks for Unbroken, thinking that I would either love it or really like it. The trailers showed a young man winning track events then becoming a soldier. I love movies like that that cover lots of ground. I thought this would be the next Forrest Gump. I was fooled.Unbroken is a failure at nearly all areas. First off, the first little bit that deals with his early years and track days were sloppy as could be. It alternates between him as a kid and him on a fighter plane in the war, with the plane bits adding to the sloppiness. Why not just wait to show the all the war scenes all at once? It's so much easier for the viewer to get and better to see that way. When his plane crashes and becomes stranded in the ocean for 45 days, that is when the sloppiness subsides, but the movie's greatness stays away. What made the first little bit so sloppy was it was full of just random bits randomly thrown in at random parts. Is it so hard for a situation to have things surrounding it and build-ups? I'm not saying for this movie to have suspense, actually, give it suspense! Make it exciting! Don't make it a straight-up thriller, but have build-ups and links that make for a better flow and an overall better viewing. The main character and two of his friends being stranded is when the movie starts getting a little better. For some reason, I found the whole chunk of the movie when they are stranded to be very well-done. Then computer-generated waves almost ruin the whole thing. Eventually, he gets saved and it taken to a POW camp where he gets singled out and exploited, ultimately turning into 12 Years A Slave 2.0. I thought where would be actual war sequences and not just random exploitation. I don't mind there being exploitation or anything, just as long it leads to something. Not just torture then he walks off and nothing happens!Due to this movie being realistic and (I guess) doing justice to a guy's life, I must give credit where credit is due.1/4",3,3,6,12 January 2015
The Truman Show," As Amazing & Magical As Can Be.
","The Truman Show is original and provocative movie that has a place in all our hearts. Jim Carrey breaks his typecast funny man role and becomes a more serious character. Of course there are cute and funny moments, but it is just his kindness and casualness that gets the audience cracking up. It is not meant to be funny, just nice to see. So nice, the audience can't help but smile. The storyline itself is original and suspenseful. It is not meant to be a thriller, it just happens to be exciting.This was before the days of reality TV. Nowadays, almost everything is reality TV. Everybody in reality shows know they're being filmed, but what if they did not? What if literally everything somebody did was being broadcasted to the world 24/7? That is just what The Truman Show is about. Jim Carrey plays Truman who has had a camera on him since birth. He lives on the island he grew upon which is completely fake. Ever since he was a kid, they have tried everything they can to keep him on that island, even going so far as having his father drown to discourage him from ever sailing off. Actors play his friends, sand is fake and everything on the island is controlled. It is amazing to see all of this, and freaky how possible it all is too. The filming of Truman's every move may seem boring, but the world loves it all, as the title character is oblivious and goes about his life as an average joe. After all, Truman just works at a bank like thousands of others. Sympathy grows towards Truman, but his life is so full of joy.Truman is in his thirties and has had a camera on him in his fake world all his life. After a while, would there not be malfunctions or mistakes? It all starts when he sees his father being taken away on a bus. There have been subtle clues his whole life, but nothing he really gave a second look at. As Truman really starts checking out anything unusual, excitement grows as we have no idea what will happen to Truman. Will he escape? Will he stay? The ending is something that may be small, but really has an impact.No matter how you classify The Truman Show, it was always be near the top.4/4",10,1,1,13 April 2015
Casino," I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.
","I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4",10,33,39,22 July 2015
The Hangover Part III," An Exceptional Ending.
","The Hangover III surprised me almost as much as the first one did. Usually the last movie in a trilogy is the worst, and that's what I expected from this. What really got me with this was I am still trying to decide whether this is better than the first or not. Like a regular third instalment, rules are broken with ties made back to the first. This is the only one that I can think of that does so and still comes out the best.Alan has ditched his medications and Doug has thought about taking him along with Phil and Stu to and intervention. When they are double crossed and Doug is kidnapped by crime boss, Marshal (Goodman) he summons them to find their crazy friend Leslie Chow so Marshal can destroy him.This is the only one that was not about being hungover or wasted and trying to find someone. Trying to find Chow, which slips in and out of their grasp is the only thing remotely related to that topic. The laughs fly right in at the same level in the other movies, but the whole movie has a change of style, so the laughs may have a different feeling. I saw most critics poking at the lack of hilarity that this one ensued. I found this to be a bit of a dark comedy. I laughed my ass off throughout the whole thing, but this did have a darker and grittier tone. The danger is at an all- time high and I was actually scared that Phil or Alan would die in some scenes. But when they go to Las Vegas, that is when the nostalgia comes back. Jade (Heather Graham) returns and her son Tyler (as Alan call Carlos) at age four is the same baby from the first. That was probably the coolest.The Hangover III is the last movie. I doubt there will not be a Hangover IV in another ten or fifteen years. Look at The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Scream, Wizard of Oz, Terminator: they all feature instalments decades after saying the series is finished. If this stays the last one, I will always see Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifinakis, Justin Bartha and Ken Jeong as Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, Alan Garner, Doug Billings and Leslie Chow.4/4",10,1,2,24 December 2014
The Thin Red Line," Pure Brilliance. Better Than Saving Private Ryan In Some Light. But Not For Everyone.
","There are two kinds of movies that are not for everyone. There's movies with disturbing content and brutality that will make the viewer uneasy. Saving Private Ryan is a good example of that. Then there's extremely complex movies that require full attention and lots of analyzing in order to comprehend. The Thin Red Line is an excellent example of that. Overly complex movies are often well liked, but Red Line caught a bad rap since it came out at the wrong time.The Thin Red Line is overshadowed by Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan. Both Private Ryan and Red Line are phenomenal works, but in different perspectives. I actually prefer this to Private Ryan, (ever so slightly more) as it is a thinking man's movie. But my opinion may change. I would actually call this my second favourite war movie ever (behind Apocalypse Now). Spielberg's directing of Saving Private Ryan is nothing short of majestic. He makes the battles look like first person points of view and makes the viewer feel like they are in it themselves. The horrors of war are shown very well, but the general story is absurd and the emotional factor is clichÃ©d. Red Line's battles are inferior to Private Ryan's, but the emotional factor and many other plot and filming devices surpass Private Ryan's.The Thin Red Line provides different narrations to gives an inside look at these soldiers. That is a brilliant move. They are forced to go to war and must face the horrors. Private Ryan is by far the scariest war film ever, but it is patriotic. Red Line goes back to basics and uses the same formula as Apocalypse Now and Platoon do: how war can change people. But Red Line distinguishes itself from those by using more symbolism and philosophy. Jim Caviezel is our main character who is AWOL living in a peaceful Indian village who is taken by Sean Penn to partake in the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is a scene later on in the film where he is back with the tribe and there is tension among everyone. I never understood if the whole experience with the tribe was a hallucination or not, but they do symbolize the negativity that the world has. The battle starts with them getting up a hill battling the Japanese. The higher they get on the hill, the worse everything gets for them. While this movie is going on, there's lots of lovely shots of nature. Nature provides a relationship to the soldiers, both comparing and contrasting. There's nice imaging of the nature-filled areas and the nice sunlight, and there's a crocodile that enters a pond (pretty much a threshold) then we see just its head later on.This is one of the most philosophical movies ever that can easily be misunderstood. if you get it, you will love it. It not, you will be bored to death.4/4",10,3,6,7 March 2015
Click," Adam Sandler's Best Movie Ever!
","Adam Sandler like to have reoccurring themes of family and fathers in his movies. He also creates his own toilet-humour and acts very childish in much of his movies. Ergo, anybody that does not like Adam Sandler may not like this movie because his humour and immaturity does not change in this. However, it is decreased and not as bad as one of his previous films like Billy Madison. This is an Adam Sandler creation and he makes this movie with the only kind of humour and themes he knows.In Big Daddy, the main theme was the importance of fatherhood. 50 First Dates was love no matter what. Click's is that life is too short. The theme of life being too short has not been done very much which makes it very fresh and original. It is also a very important life lesson that often goes ignored and is not talked about as much as money not buying everything. Even Sandler haters must give credit where credit is due and admit Click had a really good theme. Though there is just one major theme, it is still enough to handle.Sandler plays architect, Michael Newman, who's wife (Beckinsale) and kids are happy, but he is not. He is a workaholic who can't stand up to his boss (Hasselhoff) and aspires to one day be head of the company so he can work less and his family can be filthy rich. He meets mysterious Morty (Walken) who gives him a universal remote control that can control his life. At first, Michael uses it in funny and helpful ways. After he abuses its powers, the remote programs itself automatically skipping various stages in his life. Just seeing how far the remote takes him by itself is heartrending and you really feel for Michael. The older Michael gets, the more of a huge and self-centred architect head he becomes, causing his family to push away from him. That shows the importance of family theme, which is done better than Sandler's other flicks because this is done a lot more serious. Michael eventually skips to the point where he is on his deathbed and asks Morty 'why did you make me waste my entire life?' Although he is not that old and skipped about 20 years, it really does feel like he wasted his whole life. When it seems like it is the end for Michael, it is enough to literally make you cry. No other Sandler comedy features acting or filming, or anything like that this good. Sandler does keep his humour, but adds a more serious and heartrending tone to it's lessons, making it his best movie.",10,2,4,1 January 2015
Pineapple Express," One of My Very Favourite Comedies.
","Pineapple Express is one of the many Judd Apatow comedy classics. It is also one of the few that he has done with no sexuality. But there is lots of profanity, drug use and violence. But they are all mixed together in a way that is legitimately funny and not mindless. Sure the characters are dumb stoners, but what comedy doesn't feature dumb characters?Seth Rogen stars as process server, Dale Denton who smokes pot when not delivering subpoenas. His dealer, Saul Silver, gives him a sneak peek at a new brand of weed called 'pineapple express.' We get a good look in the lives of Dale and Saul. They chill out and deliver killer dialogue that always make my sides ache. When Dale accidentally witnesses a drug lord (Gary Cole) and crooked cop (Perez) murder Asian competition, he tosses his roach and takes Saul on the run with him because the drug could easily be linked to them. That is when the movie starts taking off and becomes its own. Before this, it is almost like any other Judd Apatow movie or late night comedy. Difference is, the beginning of this is much funnier. The drug lord and cop think that Dale and Saul are working for the Asians and try to destroy them. Meanwhile, Dale and Saul go on the run and take the middle man, Red (Danny McBride), with them. As the movie progresses, the elements of danger and drama rise, with the laughs subsiding. There's lots of action and seriousness that helps this stand apart from other adult comedies. The entertainment doesn't stop, we just get a new kind. The laughs don't go away, so the movie does not lose its focus.4/4",10,2,4,11 March 2015
Gangs of New York," Put Scorsese Back on the Map.
","Scorsese was on a hot streak in the 70s, then on-and-off in the 80s and 90s. This 2002 masterpiece caused Scorsese to be on a hot streak again like in the 70s. It was also the first movie he did with Leonardo DiCaprio--the start of a great team. The story isn't very original and the movie is too long. The near three hours could easily be condensed to a clean two hours. A regular revenge story with weak subplots that can be confusing as they become blurry. The movie is about a boy who witnesses his father being murdered by the ruthless Bill 'Butcher' Cuttings (Day-Lewis). Sixteen years later, the boy (now Leo) returns to vow his father's murder. But rival gangs, love, loyalty, and Cuttings' ascension makes the job difficult. The acting is uncanny by everybody. But Day-Lewis steals the show. The riots and action are extremely brutal, but very entertaining. As I mentioned before, the movie is too long, but the entertainment and movie making really make up for the slowness. Condensed, this would be in the Top 250 and be considered a Scorsese masterpiece. I don't find this to be a masterpiece, but it is very close to it. Like The Outsiders--it was as close to being a masterpiece without actually being one. But still, I really think that this deserves more. It should be considered more iconic, and more or a landmark in all the aspects this has.",10,2,3,29 September 2014
Windtalkers," It's No Platoon, But It Can't Lose.
","To me, any war or sci-fi movie is a guaranteed winner. The construction of sets and direction or battles sequences and special effects all have to be at very high degrees in order to look even remotely real. In order for a war or sci-fi movie to be bad, the sets, special effects, and battles scenes all have to be poorly done. I have encountered some sci-fis that had poor CGI, but I have not yet seen a badly made war movie. Even heavily clichéd war movies have realistic violence and spectacular action sequences. I noticed Windtalkers got bad reviews, but everybody must admit it was good for what it had.Windtalkers is about a group of soldiers (including Nicolas Cage, Christian Slater, Mark Ruffalo, and Noah Emmerich) during World War II who must protect two Navajo soldiers from the Japanese, as they are the only ones that understand the codes in Navajo language. I am not a history guru nor an expert on any wars, so I very much enjoyed this. John Woo is an action master that did great action scenes and the acting is great by almost all. There was some bad acting, but most were good. Nicolas Cage was good, as this was before his string of bad movies like Ghost Rider and Bangkok Dangerous. He is our main character who is similar to Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now and Charlie Sheen in Platoon--all men are haunted by the horrors of war. The story is a little slow, but is sugarcoated with great action. Also, there are nice shots such as the opening scene as the camera hovers around mountains in the desert. The music, provided by legendary James Horner makes every little thing that much greater. What I saw critics and general reviews poke at the most was the fact that the Navajo soldiers were minor characters and that there was no 'windtalking' or codecracking. That would be my biggest complaint. It is clear that this draws influence from previous war classics, mainly Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, and this may be inferior to those, but it is still and great flick.3/4",8,4,6,6 January 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Utterly Pointless & Severely Overrated!
","I totally love cinema's action genre, always going easy on it. When the latest Mad Max movie first came out, I was pretty disappointed in it. Then all the acclaim and awards started pouring in. Is film dead? Did I just have a bad day? I rewatched it and my initial thoughts have been reaffirmed. The 1/10 I'm giving this is just a bid for this overall rating to lower. Otherwise I'd be giving this 5/10.It made sense for a Mad Max movie to be made now because of the massive upgrades in computer technology. That and it seemed like a nice cash grab. After all, the movie does have a better overall look than the three previous instalments. That's really about it in terms of what this movie has that's better than the others.'Mad Max: Fury Road' is not about anything. The characters are flatter than paper and the story stays in one spot throughout the whole thing. All it is is people driving in the desert with occasional explosions. The audience is expected the care about these characters just because. With underdeveloped characters why should we care? It is super rare when we care about an underdeveloped character. In 'Saving Private Ryan,' Giovanni Ribisi's character was underdeveloped but we felt tremendous remorse upon his death. Nothing that smart ever happens in this.For reader's sake, I will try to give a good summary of the plot. It is after the apocalypse (obviously), the human race is being enslaved (obviously) by the new leader (who is actually cool looking) who has many funny, half-naked Uncle Festers. Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is like a stuffed animal in front of a car and the Uncle Festers try to capture an escaped Charlize Theron. So that's it. There's really nothing more it it than that.One good aspect of the film is the cool images. The Uncle Festers, although cornier than their 80s counterparts, actually do look cool. There's one Fester with a sewn chelsea grin that I liked. The lord guy is pretty awesome and the frequent use of the skull logo is pretty badass. But not all of these are perfect. There's a guitar player on the front of a car that plays and shoots fire while the battles happen. But there's no point in him other than to look cool. The fire that shoots out of his guitar don't do anything. Some cars have tons of spikes that look cool, but they all explode right away. There's no point in having these images other than to look cool.There have been several analysis's about the movie's depiction of survival and feminism. Every movie ever made has themes! Fury Road's use of them are unoriginal and uninspired.On the whole, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a subpar action movie that is NOT one of the best action films ever like so many people say. It is literally just driving with occasional explosions and shootings. I knew this would find an audience like early Chuck Norris and Van Damme films did, but the critical acclaim and commercial success this has received is horrible. Do yourself a favour and just skip this.2/4",1,6,10,12 February 2018
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Cinema's Greatest Hero Is Back For The Best Ending.
","As a regular ending to a trilogy, ties are made back to the first, secrets are revealed and more is at stake than ever. In this, we learn Indiana Jones' real name (Henry Jones Jr.), his old buddies reunite with him and he battles Nazis once again. Only this time, they are in search of the Holy Grail and kidnap Indy's father (Connery) who holds clues on its whereabouts. Indy just wants to save his father, but gets more than he bargained for. I don't like picking a 'worst' in the trilogy, but if I had to, it would have to be this. While it is evenly proportioned like the first, the level is not quite as high. I guess that is why this is raved as being the second best. While this does have a more complex story than Temple of Doom, the action and thrills are not at it's level. As I said in Temple's review, it's action and thrills are among the best in the series. If Raiders has the best story and Temple has the best action, where does that leave this? The acting is great in all movies at the same level, so that's not it. I'm not knocking this, I loved Last Crusade! The complex story, suspense, comedy, filming, effects...with all these properly placed in a movie starring cinema's greatest hero, what could go wrong? I would also call this probably the best ending to a series. Aside from Return of the King and Return of the Jedi, this is the best one. Spielberg and Lucas intended on this being the last one. The movie is called 'Last Crusade' for a reason. And they go out in a blaze of glory! After catching the Holy Grail (which is now a synonym for the biggest kahuna), Indiana Jones, his father and friends strode off on their horses into the sunset. That is the perfect ending! It could not have gone better. Nineteen years later, Spielberg reluctantly makes a fourth instalment. Although enjoyable, it is not a part of this trilogy. Not to me.",10,0,1,15 December 2014
Back to the Future," Heart, Hilarity, and Brains.
","'Back To The Future' can't be unloved by people. It was loved back when it came out in 1985 and its success has only grown. It has become a pop culture phenomenon worthy of all the success and praise it gets.Christopher Lloyd just finished 'Taxi' and was doing a slew of successful films. Eric Stoltz was making a name for himself. But at the last minute, Stoltz was fired and 'Family Ties' own Michael J. Fox was replaced as protagonist alongside Christopher Lloyd. This co-stars some other up-and- comers that would go on to become household names.Fox stars as Marty McFly. He's a high school senior who loves his girlfriend, tries to get gigs with his band, must deal with a mean principal and a weird family. He is also an errand boy for the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who Marty calls 'Doc.' Doc is constantly coming up with odd inventions and nobody can take him seriously, but he does sustain Marty's interest. His latest invention is a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Since that car has been discontinued, everybody's immediate association with it is a time machine. Doc calls Marty to test it at 1am so they can be in complete privacy. But they are soon found by terrorists who Doc fraudulently squeezed plutonium away from. Marty narrowly escapes...The first act is getting to know Marty and his family and Doc. The subplot with the terrorists is also important. Marty escapes by accidentally entering 1955 on the date Doc got the envision for the time machine. Marty bumps into some people from his own present and tells them their fate. But it is his parents that he encounters that will mess up the timeline forever. His mom is a player who developed the hots for Marty instead of his dad. Marty completely screwed up the day they met. His dad is a total wimp too scared to ask his mother out or stand up to bully Biff Tannen. Marty is a hip daredevil who is the key in changing his father for the better and tricking him. This story with Marty trying to reconnect his parents is hilarious. Its my favourite aspect oft he film. Then there's Biff Tannen, who is the best bully in film history. I'm not condoning bullying, but Biff is hilarious. How can Marty return to 1985? His escape was too abrupt to retrieve any plutonium for his way back, so he's stuck. Or is he? Doc says a bolt of lightning is the only thing of equivalent charge to plutonium. Hill Valley's (the film's setting) historic clock towers struck by lightning and it hasn't rung since. Next week will be the day it happens, so Doc and Marty construct a plan for the charge to hit the DeLorean and send Marty back to the future. Funny how these three very important events (Marty's parents meeting, Doc coming up with the idea for the time machine, and the clock tower destruction) take place over the course of the same week.As a time travel film, there are lots of holes and plot errors that cannot be unseen. The wonderment is what makes films like this so groundbreaking. But at least there's enough smarts around this. As I mentioned earlier, Marty dealing with a week in the 50s with his parents is my favourite aspect. The whole 'fish out of water' bit is done so well and so funny. It culminates with Marty doing an edgy rendition of Chuck Berry's 'Johnnie B. Goode' which is my favourite scene in all of cinema. His imitations of various guitar legends such as Eddie Van Halen and Pete Townsend make it even more funny than it is. This movie makes me feel so wonderful each and overtime I see it (which is a lot). it is spiritually uplifting with heart and comedy to make it fun, and complexity to take it seriously.It should always remain the best movie ever made about time travel. 10/10",10,1,1,8 December 2017
Goodfellas," Great Movie, But Pretty Overrated.
","I did enjoy this film, but I think it gets a little too much praise. All three Godfather movies are far superior. This was innovative, but it ranks too high in all lists.Goodfellas is based on the memoir 'Wiseguy' about Henry Hill's life as a gangster. Ray Liotta plays Hill and gives are star-making performance. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy The Gent and Joe Pesci earns a well-deserved Oscar as Tommy DeVito. Hill grew up in urban New York and wanted to be a mobster his whole life. Only, he wasn't cut out. Tommy and Jimmy were his best friends and extremely brutal. There was reluctancy sometimes in Henry. He marries Karen (Bracco) and their family life is well-documented. As Henry becomes more like the other thugs, bis life crumbles and surrenders to the witness protection program. I thought that the story was great as it cover major parts in Hill's life and some infamous crimes in American history. Scorsese also recreates some bits from the book that come out better in the movie. For example, he adds lots to the scene with Spider. I'm not saying this is the best mob movie ever like Roger Ebert said and I'm not saying it sucked. It will never reach The Godfather heights. Although the editing and film techniques were top- notch, it was not enough. One thing I didn't like was that it practically glorified being a mobster. There's so much loyalty and it makes it out to be fun. Being a gangster is not fun. Sure it's good that everybody is treated better, but they do horrible things that puts everybody in danger. Goodfellas does show that the mafia can be bad, but there's so many circumstances surrounding them that can be learned from. Another thing I didn't like was the music. The music was too loud and too good. Great music such as the Rolling Stones and Bobby Darin were playing. They proved to be distracting and did not fit well with some bit. Why not just use regular background music instead of hit songs that are overpowering? Then there's the flow and story. As I mentioned above, the story is good but does not come across to its potential. Some of the scenes go great by themselves but not all work well as a whole. They jump around too much without giving leads in or out. It just goes from thing-to- thing-to-thing-thing over the course of minutes, plus there's the distracting music. I don't mind 146 minutes, but it seems like 5 hours was condensed in half its time. Some parts could have been cut out and replaced with more flows and better plot development. Goodfellas is a brilliant flick, but not one of the best.",1,3,15,10 June 2015
Rock Star," Not Perfect, But Whatever. \m/
","As a metalhead, it makes me so happy to see movies about heavy metal and rock & roll. Metal does not get the amount of praise and respect it deserves. That's something I never understood. These are some of the most talented musicians in the world making music that takes the listener on journey. The best music genre is mixed into a glimpse of life on the road an finding your true self.'Rock Star' is loosely based on the story of Tim 'Ripper' Owens. Judas Priest's Rob Halford wanted to try a solo career and the rest of the band got Owens to fill in for him. Owens was in a Priest tribute band first, similar to Wahlberg's character. He did a couple of albums with them until Halford came back.Mark Wahlberg plays talented singer Chris Cole. He worships Bobby Beers, the frontman of the world's top metal band, Steel Dragon (is that not a badass name or what?) During the daytime, Chris is an IT guy at an office building. By night he is the frontman of a Steel Dragon tribute band called 'Blood Pollution.' Chris takes every little detail of Dragon so seriously to be incorporated into Blood Pollution that they eventually kick him out. He doesn't know where Bobby Beers ends and he begins. Chris soon finds out that Bobby Beers gets booted out of the band and Chris gets the gig as Dragon's new frontman.The beginning of this up until right after Chris' first performance with Steel Dragon is golden. Living life as a wannabe and fulfilling his dream was very relatable. And him becoming Dragon's new lead vocalist was nice as we could totally feel a starstruck Chris. But after Chris' first concert, the movie completely lazes out. When you're a rockstar (and in the world's biggest band), life is full of parties, sex, drugs, and travelling. We see Chris doing all of these and how it effects his longtime girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), but none of these things are done in a very clear and concise way. In the first chunk, we feel exactly what Chris feels. Then we get pulled out of Chris and become just speculators getting little peeks into Chris' time on the road. We can't relate to Chris wanting to find himself and wanting to change like we could in the first half. If the second half of the script was re-written so that it was stronger than the first half (movies need to keep building and move up), the whole movie would be as revered as 'Love & Mercy' and 'The Buddy Holly Story.'Whatever. Since only part of the script is weak and the music is perfect, 'Rock Star' is a great time to have.3/4",9,1,1,11 March 2018
The Godfather," I Don't Think It's THE Greatest. I Think It's ALMOST The Greatest.
","Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more 'best of' lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being 'the greatest of all time.' It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions.The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people 'an offer they can't refuse.' When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings.The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.4/4",10,6,9,3 December 2014
