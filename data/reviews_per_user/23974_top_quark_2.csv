Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very good, easily one of the most enjoyable movies
","WARNING! Possible SPOILERS ahead!!!My first real encounter with Star Wars saga was at the age of 20. I saw the special editions of the OT in theaters and then watched them again many times. They immediately become my favorite movie series. Then two years later, the Episode I came and I really like it. It is not the same as the OT but it is not any worst than it. In fact in many areas it is much better movie.The SW saga is entertaining, enjoyable and the best of the escapism that can be offered by the big screen. It is entire universe without any relation to Earth or our time, with immense complexity and variety of the location, aliens, languages, sounds, everything! It is obvious that a great care is taken to build entire worlds, full of exotic and very good looking creatures and environments. And all of this combined with the simplistic, entertaining and refreshing characters with great care taken to be sure that there are no tragic moments laid out in a way that will make the movie painful to watch over and over again.Now, back to the Episode I.Contrary to the popular belief among some 'hardcore' fans of the OT, this movie is generally on par with the OT (especially with ANH) and in fact is very close to spirit, visuals and everything to the ANH. The pace is OK, actors are good Â– especially Qui Gon-Jin and the young Obi-Wan. Jar-Jar is also OK, although there is too much of him in the movie. It is understandable that the movie is a little childish because the main hero is 9 years old and it is the perfect movie for the children. The space battles are better than these in the OT and the pod racing is amazing and very good idea (being an open-wheel racing fan of Formula One I like it even more). The movie has many plot twists and surprises and the locations are beautiful.In fact, TPM is wonderful combination of the elements that made the PT great with new elements that shows the desire of George Lucas to bring new life to the decades-old SW sage. Here are some of the similarities between the two series: 1. TPM has a hero (a young boy) leaving its boring life on Tatooine to start wonderful adventures. The same goes for AHN. 2. Our hero is forced to cut the ties to its family (in ANH his uncle and aunt are killed, in TPM his mother is forced to stay in slavery). 3. TPM finishes with combination of land and space battle, culminating in the destruction of the main battle station of the enemy (the same thing happens in ROTJ and ANH, TPM is more like ROTJ in this). 4. Our young hero is the one who is responsible for the victory of the good (the same in the ANH final battle). 5. An established hero and mentor dies in duel with the Sith (Obi-Wan in ANH, Qui Gon-Jin in TPM). And the light saber battle in TPM is much better than the one in ANH).In conclusion: TPM deserves the highest rating for the fact that you can watch it over and over again without degradation of the entertainment and joy. There is no doubt that when the PT is complete, TPM will take its place among the best SW movies.",10,3,6,11 May 2005
Elysium," Disappointing on so many levels
","As an avid Sci-Fi fan, I was eager to see the last big SF movie of the summer. The trailer seemed exciting and both director/screenwriter Neill Blomkamp and the main star Mat Damon are big names, so I had some expectations (not very high, mind you). Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. So, let start with the post mortem.The good. This will be a short section. Good special effects, both the CGI and the stunts were spectacular. Elysium was great. The cinematography was fine. There were some cool ideas like the exoskeleton (not that original but it was well done nonetheless).The bad. Everything else. The plot was a mess, the characters were unlikable and/or underdeveloped, the character motivation was absolutely ridiculous and the character development (when there was any) was rushed and artificial.The main character Max is not a likable person. All the sympathy I had towards him quickly vanished when he tried to be a smart ass around the robot cops in the beginning of the movie. How stupid you have to be do such a thing when you have a long rap sheet and are still on parole? We are supposed to believe that there was a big love story between Max and his childhood sweetheart and yet they haven't seen each other for decades. He didn't even know she had a kid. The extensive flashbacks to the 10-year old Max were nothing more than a diversion from the extremely underdeveloped characters.The boss of the smugglers to Elysium is only interested in money, which is fine and realistic but at the middle of the movie he has a sudden and inexplicable change of hart and everything he wants is to help his fellow citizens. Never mind that he practically killed a lot of them, taking all of their money for 1% chance to be healed and 99% chance to be killed.All villains are cardboard cutouts without any soul. Maybe this is a consequence of the heavy-handed political propaganda but nonetheless you will rarely find more ridiculous and unbelievable villains. Kruger had hilarious accent and the Jodi Foster was very weak as the 'tough' but extremely transparent and stupid anti-immigration official of Elysium.Now the smaller but still annoying things: 1. You have 3 ships that are just few hundred kilometers from Elysium but to take them down, you have to call a man on Earth, who launches 4 Stinger rockets in space and they fly with something like a 1000 miles per second to strike the ships about 10 to 15 seconds later. Absolutely deranged. Why not launch missiles from the space station itself? Wait, I know why! To introduce us to Kruger. Weak, weak writing, Mr. Blomkamp.2. The atmosphere of Elysium just stands there even though there is nothing above to hold it in place. Well, the Moon and Mars are not big enough to hold significant atmosphere with their gravitational field, but a space station less than 500 kilometers across is? Would it kill them to have a force field or something to keep the air in place? Again extremely stupid.3. You can be revived 15 minutes after you face is blown by a grenade because 'your brain is still intact'. Still, when you are shot in the heart or bleed to dead with severed artery, you are beyond saving. Wait, what? 4. A man with crappy exoskeleton is tougher than a military robot.5. There are robots everywhere and they seem really capable but the corporations still need low-skilled workers to work on assembly lines doing mundane, simple task that even now are done by robots.I can continue but it's really painful. I hope that most of these shortcomings are caused by the need to shove down our throats the simplistic political views of the director because the alternative is to think that District 9 was just plain luck.Compare this BS with the Slumdog millionaire and you will see a movie that effectively carries a social commentary with much better plot, characters and message.5 out of 10 stars and I'm extremely generous.",5,55,94,14 August 2013
