United 93," devastating
","it is the most powerful thing i have ever seen on film. it is absolutely devastating. watching the towers fall from my window in manhattan-2001, i did not think i could sit through this film and was even angry that it had been made. i was wrong. it honors the brave men and women on that flight and it should be seen. not as 'entertainment' but as a way of honoring those who took a stand together and fought back. as for those who complain that it is propaganda and exploitive-i'm sorry you could not walk away with the feeling that i had at the end of the film. I sobbed and felt sick throughout, but leaving the theatre i was proud of these human beings who had bonded together in a moment of crisis and, together, faced the unthinkable.",9,2,5,8 May 2006
