The King's Speech," Great Film
","This film has taken a wonderful story from history and turned it into an inspiring movie. This film tells the story of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his stammering issue and how he comes to rely on a common man Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to overcome his struggle. They come to meet by the persistence of King George VI's wife, Queen Elizabeth, (Helena Bonham Carter). The film takes place during the time leading up to the beginning of World War II when Great Britain needed a great leader to hold the country together. Even though you know from history that everything works out, the film keeps you interested in the outcome and keeps you hoping for King George VI success.This is a film of a human story, it shows the struggle of a man overcoming his speech impediment so he can become the leader his country needs him to be during a time of war. What I like about this film is that it shows the human side of the King. It tells the struggles of his child hood and lets you see the potential of his great leadership, even though he doubts his abilities because of his stammering problem. You empathize for him whenever he struggles with stammering during important moments. Colin Firth does a wonderful job playing King George VI and does and outstanding job portraying the Kings speech impediment. Watching the banter between King George VI and Lionel Logue was one of the most enjoyable parts of the film. Firth and Rush did a wonderful job making their characters believable and interesting.The lighting in the film helps set the seriousness of the film and helps give it the period correct look. The director uses humor to help lighten the mood when needed so the film stays interesting and helps make the characters likable. The director uses a lot of close up shots of King George VI's face when he struggles with stammering and it shows the pain and determination he is enduring to try and talk. Seeing the pain King George VI endures to overcome his fear, helps inspire the viewer to face their own fears and overcome them rather than be enslaved by them.",9,0,0,5 August 2013
