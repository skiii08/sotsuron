Ford v Ferrari," Great story
",The movie is really good. The actors christian and matt did a great job together. I liked the way ken miles reacted to people for being different and although it did him pain you could see he really cared about everything and was so positive even when he got up by losing le mans. I loved how quickly he moved on. Such a charismatic human he was. But the ending was so sad. Didnt see that coming. I wished that wasnt filmed.,8,0,1,26 November 2019
