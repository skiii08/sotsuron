The Perks of Being a Wallflower," You just can't miss this movie. You just can't.
","I usually don't rewatch movies as to me the plot is usually one of the most important aspects of a movie. Well, of course, this is move is an exception.I have never read the book, so I went into watching this movie with no particular expectation. And it touches me in so many ways. Each character has their own struggles, and however unique they may be, everyone can relate to in one way or another. But what is most important to me is that it teaches me to learn the importance of noticing. It is easy for us to focus on our own problems, and not realizing that others might go through something similar, or that they might need our help as well. That's what Charlie is throughout the whole movie - a wallflower. He notices everyone's struggle, desire, and becomes their friend. As yet, there is not much attention on Charlie, until the very end of the movie where we see the story unfolds. This movie will leave you both happy and sad at the same time - go figure.",10,0,0,8 December 2019
The Greatest Showman," One of the best musicals I've ever seen!
","This is literally my first IMDB review ever and I can't think of anything else more deserving that this movie. For all the musical lovers out there, this is your movie! It's full of energy, the lyrics are extremely powerful and the production is just amazing. Yes, they might not have the best of the best singers like the traditional musicals, but you can easily feel the emotions that are portrayed in EVERY SINGLE SONG. I promise, there will be goosebumps, and possibly tears!And this is just another example of how the critics often look at a movie in a completely wrong way. Go see it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.",10,0,1,29 January 2018
