Sucker Punch," Don't get Sucker Punched
",The story itself was not bad and the movie would have been better if they stuck with the real world or the fantasy world. Wasted a good lineup of bold characters and an interesting tale. This movie deserved a do over. I understand the desire to be innovative and fresh but they took it too far. Thrown into the action from the beginning I got the feeling that I was going to be in for a great ride. Things quickly took a turn and I never quite recovered. Previews are great and I as many others had great expectations based on that. If you end up watching this film you will understand what I am talking about. By dropping the surreal world they could have done more character development. I was not the only person disappointed as others walked out on this film. This movie is a 5 at best. @gowatchthis,5,7,17,25 March 2011
