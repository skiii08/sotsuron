Minority Report," An bland Sci-fi flick
","Don't be fooled. This is definitely not up in Blade Runner's class.  Ithas potential to be one but unfortunately there are too many plotholes to make the film truly succesful.  For example, I found itridiculous that the entire pre-crime unit would fully support asystem that actually only relies on ONE pre-cogs to determine afuture killer.  So much so that if she's taken away it's enough toshut the entire system down as proven in the film.  Why wouldanyone with a brain let them get away with this?  And it's not likethis is one of the 'secrets' that Max Von Sydow's character hidesfrom everyone in the pre-crime dept.  If that had been the case, itwould have been acceptable.  But the fact is, even the drugadministrator person who takes care the pre-cogs know that onlythe female one is the key to everything.To top this off, the idea of using pre-cogs to see future crime itselfis a bit stupid.  The older woman in the film mentioned howpre-cogs are originally children who has this 'gift' of being able tosee future crimes.  Now, surely there aren't that many pre-cogseven in this futuristic world, unless they are an entirely differentrace to human.  But they are just human with 'future-vision' ability. The problem is, what would happen if the female pre-cogs and hertwo other counterpart dies?  If they are human, surely sooner orlater they'll face the same fate as the rest of other humans: death. What will happen once they are dead?  Obviously they can't be aseasily replaced as pencil because otherwise they would have hada substitute when John kidnapped Agatha (the female pre-cogs). So the entire idea of pre-crime and precogs is already shaky fromthe start.Acting wise, Colin Farrell shows that he really is indeed, worth allthe 'upcoming star' hype.  The guy's got talent and I found hisgumshoe-like detective is reminiscent of old film noir detective.  It'sa shame that he's not the main character in this film because itseems that Farrell's character, Ed Witwer is the sharpest, moreinteresting one in comparison to Cruise's character, JohnAnderton.  Speaking of Cruise, he does his usual patented 'toughguy' action here role.  Nothing outstanding but decent enough,especially compared to the acting skills displayed on recent filmslike Star Wars episode 2.  The problem with Cruise, however, isthat he is not the sort of guy that audience can easily identify with.  I think something is wrong when you want the main character toindeed, commit the crime that he's been accused of.  It alsodoesn't help that Anderton isn't exactly the sharpest knife around inthe film.  He doesn't even figure out who the real problem makerbehind his problem is until his ex-wife set him free from thelifetime imprisonment that he was facing due to the crimeaccusation.   Samantha Morton and Max Von Sydow do very wellespecially with the limited amount of screen time that theircharacters get on the film.Action and CGI-wise, the film is mixed bags.  There are someimpressive moments (ie. the spider tracker sequence) and somedull or jarring moments.  I understand that Spielberg wants toemphasise the fact that in the future, the distinction between therich and the poor is even wider.  But the special effects used toshow the 'richer area' is so jarring that I originally thought that thepre-crime is actually a futuristic police department that can go backin time to save other people.  This is due to the fact that the worldof the 'rich' (exemplify by hi-tech expensive apartment) such as thepre-crime detectives' like Anderton and the world of the 'poor' (wholive in your normal-looking house) are so different that when thefilm switch from one area to the next, it feels like I was watchingtwo different film in two different time frame.",Null,0,0,23 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Empty and hollow...
","To say the least.  And to think that I actually went in with a really low expectation really upsets me even more.  I am especially annoyed with the dialogue which seems so childish and sometimes cheesy and cringe-worthy.  Maybe it's just me but I can't stand the way Obi-wan and the rest of the Jedi keep saying 'Padawan'.  It sounds like an unnatural way to talk to me.The next would be the script itself which is very predictable.  I managed to easily guessed the outcome of the majority of the plots without too much difficulty and without any surprise.  I really enjoyed the original three due to the 'surprise' element that often pops out from time to time.  Well, George seems to be getting lazy lately since this movie is just way too predictable.  There's none of that eye-opening situations like Han rescuing Luke during the death star battle or Luke found out the truth about Darth Vader, etc.I also hate the way Lucas write the Anakin character.  Whatever happened to the 'Your father was good man' statement uttered by Obi-Wan in Episode 4?  This Anakin is certainly not a good man that Obi-Wan mentioned in Episode 4.  Yes, he's protective of the thing that he has relations with (his mom, Padme).  But being protective doesn't equal a good man.  All that I see from this Anakin is a rude, childish, and often appeared idiotic man.  He doesn't have a sense of responsibility, he throws tantrums like there's no tomorrow, and he doesn't seem to have a sense of loyalty and friendship.  I can't count the many times I feel embarassed for him everytime he tries to be authoritative but ended up looking like a fool.  I know he's supposed to fall to the dark side, but I expected that him to be a much more grey character where you can actually see the bad as well as the good sides of him.  The Anakin in 'AOTC' doesn't have an ounce of good sides, IMO.My next complaint would be the supposed world of the Star Wars universe that is presented in this movie.  Lucas really has outdone himself in terms of excessive use of CGI.  Instead of being awed and impressed by the vistas of the world he created, I ended up feeling like I am forced to sit through an endless slideshow of CGI worlds.  Not to mention the many films that Lucas chose to 'steal' as an idea for his Star Wars world ('Blade Runner', 'Matrix', 'Gladiator', 'The War of the Worlds' just to name a few).  I am all for imitating.  After all, people say it's the sincerest form of flattery.But come on! If you want to imitate 'Blade Runner', can't you at least do it better?  I see 'AOTC' world and I see 'Blade Runner' world and even with the acid rain in 'Blade Runner', I would rather visit the world of 'Blade Runner' than this fake CGI world that Lucas has created.  At least when 'The Fifth Element' imitate 'Blade Runner' futuristic city, they do with flair and style and a slight innovation (the moving Dim Sum boat, etc).Unfortunately, this column is too short to talk about other things that disturb me such as the no chemistry on between N.Portman and H.Christensen, the unbelievable number of flashing lights from weapons, light sabers, and action scenes that seem to be designed with video games portability in mind (so they can make video games that feature similar situation to the film).   Honestly, I didn't have and never have the problems with the first three originals.  Maybe I am just getting old (if 27 years old is old) or I am just not the audience that AOTC is aiming for.",1,1,3,18 May 2002
