Hereditary," wow
","I just watched this movie a few seconds ago and oh my god. One id the most twisted movies I have seen in my entire life. This is a great movie.
Now I normally dont watch a lot of horror movies but this has to be my favorite one. The acting was AMAZING JUST AMAZING from everyone. Toni Collette was terrific and I also have to give credit to the teenage boy who played Peter.
This is a flawless movie I loved every minute of it and I was never bored with this movie. Thats why im giving this movie my perfect grade",10,0,1,4 July 2020
The Irishman," loved it!
","I just watched the Irishman. Whoahh man what a long ride.
It was a very well directed film, wow 3 magnificent actors in one movie is just soooo mesmerizing. The de aging special effects were pretty good. I also didnt know the movie would be so political
It was a little depressing to see de Niro, pesci and Pacino soo old. One of scorseses finest films this day. The only issue with his movie which i really had was the length. It could have maybe ended like 10-15min after Hoffas death.",10,0,1,7 June 2020

Jackie Brown," Not the best from Tarantino but still good
",This was a good movie. Some great soundtrack and great acting from Samuel l Jackson and Jackie browns actress. While other Tarantino movies might be better this was still not that bad,7,1,2,19 June 2020
