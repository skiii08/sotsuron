Mission: Impossible III," Better than the other 2
","I just saw MI3 and came back home trying to imagine what MI4 will be like in 4 or 5 years, I really liked the TV show from the sixties and the remake from the 90's, when the first movie came out ( 1996 ) I felt a little disappointed, maybe because of Coppola and his very personal directing style, MI2 was much better than its prequel, but MI3 just fulfilled all my expectations, it's captivating and a very good way to spend 2 hours of nonstop action and Mission Impossible gadgets. You will love it if you like this kind of movie, you won't if you go to the cinema to complain and just criticize all you see.Don' miss it.",9,5,9,13 May 2006
