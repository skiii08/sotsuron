The Blair Witch Project," A Great Movie for Those With Imagination
","Let me say that this is a great movie. The concept was totally original and the market was unique and inventive for a change.Be warned if you are of little imagination or don't like to use your brain very much then this movie won't be for you. For those who dislike this movie they can still go watch Friday the 13th part 26.This movie rocked because it made you think. There wasn't anything in this movie that wasn't plausible, that's the true appeal of this movie I think. It's very easy to imagine camping in a dark wood and not truly knowing what is out there. Seriously this movie was able to chill you using sticks and stones. There wasn't a need for a few gallons of fake blood, a cheesy soundtrack and an axe.I found myself dreading whenever night came. I truly felt for the people in this movie and wouldn't have exchanged places with them for anything. The ending was great and if you think back you truly still don't know what happened and you can actually hypothesize on different possibilities.",10,2,4,8 March 2002
