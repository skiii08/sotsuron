Howl's Moving Castle," Amazing
","It's directed by Hayao Miyazaki. every scene of his directed movie is magical, he is a artist, a wonderful artist. It's about a mysterious wizard and a cursed women. And how did the wizard protect the women that he loves in the moving castle. I moved with their catchy music, and the scene of the movie made me feel very comfortable. I'd highly recommend it to all of you.",10,2,2,14 March 2018
