The Blair Witch Project," A bit overhyped, but interesting nonetheless.
","Saw this little overhyped film a few weeks back. Went with reservations. I'm glad to say the film was NOT a disappointment, only I'd read too much about it and had expected more of 'THINGS GOING BUMP IN THE NIGHT'! SPOILER ALERT! The final miutes, when the film's story came together, were terrifying. Having said that, I did not lose any sleep over it. END OF SPOILING!My advice: See it. Alone. At night.",Null,0,1,11 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," War IS hell!
","What can I say? The opening sequences, in fact all of the combat scenes blew me away. If you'll pardon the expression. As for the plot and timeline, obviously they had to fudge things a bit for this to become a coherent whole. Also a bit clicheed in some segments. But overall a very good movie. A little note: An English film magazine asked in their review; Where are the other allied soldiers? Answer: They were to the east, which you'd know if you'd cared to do a little research on D-Day. Schmucks!",Null,0,0,11 November 1999
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful and haunting
","This has got to be one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen. This film does not follow the standard Hollywood war film formula, and is better off for it. It dares to ask questions about warfare and the human soul deemed banal by audiences and critics alike. This film CANNOT be compared to Saving Private Ryan or any other conventional war movie. It is more on par with Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. See it! See it! See it!",Null,0,0,11 November 1999
