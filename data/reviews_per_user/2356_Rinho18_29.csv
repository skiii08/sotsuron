The Blair Witch Project," My number 18 movie
","The Blair Witch Project is my number 18 movie. It is a great horror flick, at least if you see it on the big screen, and it was something very new. When I saw this movie in cinemas back in 1999, I was not that impressed. But when I was home again, alone in my room and heard any noise downstairs, I started liking it.After having seen Blair Witch Project, camping will never be the same. It is the same with surfing after Jaws. The thing I HATE about Blair Witch  is that there was a sequel. The sequel still is the worst piece of cr*p I have ever seen in my entire life. I recommend watching Blair Witch Project either in cinemas, or alone in a dark room. This film includes unbelievable psycho-terror, at least for me. I read many comments who claimed that this just was not scary, but it was. There have been scarier movies, definitely ( The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, It ), but this is at least in the Top 10 of the scariest movies ever. You just have to want it to be scary. I am glad that I love this movie, since so many people did not. Good points : acting, directing, authentic camera work, story, ENDINGBad points : sequel, too short, there could have been more shock effects ( there were just some, but those were very shocking )All in all, I rate this movie 9.8/10 and recommend watching it alone in a dark room.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.CU; Rinho.",10,2,3,5 March 2001
The Mask," My number 151 movie
","The Mask ( 1994 )  has great special effects, a quite original idea and good action + humour + actors. The story : Jim Carrey finds a mask, and then he puts it on and is someone he has not been before, who can pull every single face. Jim Carrey fits in this role, and Cameron Diaz does a good job , too. This film is full of visual astounding FX. It has great humour. All in all, i rated this movie 8/10. I recommend it to Jim Carrey fans and to fans of the comedy genre.",8,0,0,24 January 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," My number 22 movie
","Raiders of the lost ark is my number 22 movie. I love Harrison Ford (my favorite actor ), I love Steven Spielberg ( my favorite director by FAR ), and I love action-adventure movies. And this movie is one reason for loving them. I think part 1 is the best of the Indy trilogy, but part 3 is pretty close. This is maybe the best adventure movie I have ever seen.My favorite scene has to be ( you know... ) when the guy wants to fight with Indiana Jones, but he just shoots him. That is hilarious. There has never been a scene in an action movie that is that unexpected I think. Every other character would have started fighting with him.Good points about Raiders of the Lost Ark : acting, directing, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, action, score, market scene ( see above ), style, story, beginning, Indy 3Bad points : the woman, Indy 2, Can't wait to see Indy 4. Maybe a feature with Indy 1,2,3.
All in all, I rate this movie 9.5/10. GREAT ADVENTURE MOVIE!!! SEE IT, IF YOU HAVEN´T ( but, who hasn't?!?) If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho.",10,0,0,5 March 2001
Mulan," My number 127 movie ( contains story + spoilers )
","Mulan is my number 127 movie. It was very funny.The story : A Chinese girl does not want to lose his father, who has to go to the army the next day. So she just joins the army. She did not to well in serving an old lady, and she had no fun in that. Her family engages the dragon Mushu and the cricket Kriki to get her out of there. At first, she can keep a secret from being a woman. But anytime they notice it, and so she has to leave them. When the army is attacked by another one, she used her mind to get them out of there. And she gets it. In the final battle she defends with her cleverness the Chinese emperor from being murdered, and she becomes a national hero.Mulan is a very funny film. Mushu and Kriki have very funny lines in this movie. My favorite character is Mushu. He was just hilarious.I usually like disney-movies, and this one made no exception.
I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of disney-movies. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho",8,0,0,9 February 2001
Se7en," My number 19 movie
","Se7en is my number 19 movie. It is a great thriller with a great story and great performances. I had to watch this movie three times until I started liking it. But today I love it. It is about a guy that kills seven persons according to the deadly sins. I do not like Brad Pitt that much, Morgan Freeman is quite good, Kevin Spacey too, and Gwyneth Paltrow is OK. But this movie was ( sorry, IS ) just great.Good points : characters, actors, acting, directing, story, and the way that it is told,  ending, style, score, Bad points : cannot think of anything, but it could have been betterAll in all, I rate this movie 9.7/10 and recommend it to everyone who has not seen it yet. It is GREAT!!!CU; Rinho.",9,0,0,5 March 2001
Fight Club," My number 25 movie
","Fight Club opens my Top 25 movies. When it was in cinemas ( about November 1999 ) I did not see it, I thought that I would hate it. When I was in the states last year I saw it on video, and wanted to dislike it. But I just could not. Although I fall asleep about half way through the film, I thought it was really good. So I watched it again about one month later, when I was back in Germany, and loved it. I am a guy, and 17 years old, so I maybe am supposed to like this film, and it is very good. It might be a bit confusing. I think this is aside The Sixth Sense, Toy Story 2 and American Beauty, Blair Witch Project and American Pie the best movie of 1999. 1999 was a good year for film making, there were a lot of good/great movies, this is one of them. I do not like Brad Pitt that much, and even Edward Norton is not one of my favorite actors. But both of them did a good job in this flick. My favorite part of Fight Club was the scene where Brad Pitt explains the rules of Fight Club to the others. That was great. Good points about Fight Club : acting, directing, story, style, SOUNDTRACK, actorsBad points : also style ( sometimes it is just stupid )All in all, I rated Fight Club 9.5/10 and recommend it to everyone between 10 and 35. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho.",9,0,1,5 March 2001
The Fifth Element," Good movie
","I liked the fifth element, because it is a good and exciting action movie. It is very funny in parts, especially the crazy radio moderator Roby Rhods ( Chris Tucker ) has many jokes. I do like Bruce Willis and those action-blockbusters, and this made no exception. There are better sci-fi-action movies, definitely. But this is a good one. I recommend The Fifth Element to sci-fi-action fans. I would put this movie in the same category with Independence Day' or Men in Black'.Good points : action, comedy, Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker, special effectsBad points : Milla Jovovich, styleAll in all, I rated The Fifth Element 8/10 and it is my number 111 movie ( outta 700 about ). If you have any questions, fell free to ask them. CU; Rinho. Bsss!",8,0,1,1 March 2001
A Bridge Too Far," My number 152 movie ( possible spoilers )
","A Bridge too far is my number 152 movie. it deals with the Americans who try to defend a bridge ( at Arnheim ) that they do not want to be blown up by the German army. This movie has a great cast ( Sean Connery and many others ), and it is a good film. it has its great moments ( the guy running for the caps, you know what I am talking about when you have seen the film ). It is definitely not one of the best war movies ever ( maybe because it is quite old ) , but it is a good one, though. all in all, i rated this movie 8/10. i recommend it to people who like either war movies or want to see a good film.",7,0,1,21 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Worst Star Wars movie
","Episode VI is the worst sequel/prequel of the Star Wars-Episode IV movie. I enjoyed the first 40 minutes, but the rest is bad and boring. It is not a good ending of the Star Wars - Trilogy, but it is not that bad either. I rated it a 6(.5)/10.",6,1,4,6 January 2001
Alien," My number 129 movie ( contains spoilers )
","Alien is my number 129 movie. I liked it , because it has a lot of inner suspense and was just good. I like sci-fi-movies, and this one made no exception. The film could have been much better, but it was good. At many times in the movie I thought the dialogue to be a bit lame. But many movies have that problem. My favorite part of this movie is the alien hanging on the head of the dead guy. That was great. I think part 2 was a bit better, but 3 was way worse and 4 was a bit worse. All in all, I rated ´Alien´ 8/10 and recommend it to sci-fi-fans.

Taxi Driver," My number 146 movie
","Taxi Driver is my number 146 movie. It is very original and the actors are great. It is worth being ranked as one of the Top 50 movies of all time. Robert de Niro is great as always, and Jodie Foster gives a great first-performance. All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of serious films. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",8,0,1,28 January 2001
American Pie," My number 21 movie
","American Pie is my number 21 movie. The first time I saw it I did not like it that much, I just found it was quite amusing. But the second time I could almost not stopped laughing, because I noticed all those jokes that are in there. And there are many of them. I almost have to like this movie, since I am a 17 years old guy, and I love it. It maybe is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, featuring one of my favorite characters : Jim played hilariously by Jason Biggs. I heard that there will a second American Pie. I am really looking forward to it, and I hope it won't be less funny.
Good points : Jason Biggs, many different characters, the girls, story, hope for a sequel, comedy, beginning, ending, soundtrack, score, ideas, screenplay,Bad points : sometimes to emotional, I thinkAll in all, I rate American Pie 9.5/10 and recommend it to comedy fans. It is one of the greatest that there is. See it!!!  CU; Rinho.",7,0,0,5 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great movie..
","..but not the greatest of all time. I loved watching this movie (for 3 times so far) because it is great made. it is just perfect on the stylistic area. sometimes it is quite boring, but there are scenes that are worth watching them many, many times. ==> 8.4/10",10,0,0,26 October 2002
Cast Away," Pretty Good ( contains story + spoilers)
","Castaway is a good movie. I just came back from the cinema with my friend and we both liked Castaway. Both of us like Tom Hanks, so this was not surprising.The story : The FedEx-worker Chuck Noland ( Tom hanks ) is very lucky with his girlfriend and with his job. But after a plane crash he is the only survivor and comes to an island anywhere in the Southern Pazifik. But he finds none on that island. He tries to manage himself with the few things he has : a volleyball ( named Wilson, that is almost as lovable as the mouse of The Green Mile ) , a pair of skates, a few videotapes, a rubber boat and some clothes to wear. There is no plane finding him on that island, because they thought that they are 100 miles north of him. He stays on that island for four years, and then he constructs a raft out of wood. He takes his volleyball and a door of the plane to get off there. On the sea he loses his friend Wilson, but then he is rescued by a ship. Arrived in Memphis, again, he gets to know that his ex-girlfriend has a husband, since she thought that Chuck was dead. Delivering a package that he has not open yet, he finds himself at a crossroads, where he has to make a choice between going west, north, south or east and to start a new life there.Tom Hanks is as good as always , maybe this will be his third oscar ( none can understand why Saving Private Ryan was not ). But my personal fav is Russell Crowe for Gladiator. The ending of Castaway is a bit too long , I think, but the scene with the crossroads is good and meaningful. Maybe it is a cliché , but who cares? I don´t !There three two bad things in this movie : the sudden impact before the plane crash, the lines 'Four years later' and 'Four weeks later'. They do not belong there were they belong. I think it was a bad idea to film at first the first 10 days on the island, and then the last week. I should have been more lengthy. But there are also some good moments : the loss of Wilson, the ending, and the crossing ship. This is definitely not Tom Hanks´ best movie. All his ´big films´ are better ( Saving Private Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia ). But it is a good one.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of Tom Hanks or to guys who liked 'Six Days Seven Nights' ( although that has been more a comedy ).If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",8,0,0,29 January 2001
Apocalypse Now," My number 128 movie ( contains story + spoilers )
","Apocalypse Now is my number 128 movie. I usually like movies about wars, and this one made no exception. It is about a guy ( Martin Sheen ) who goes to Vietnam to search for a guy ( Marlon Brando )that exercises control in a province in Vietnam ( the special thing is that he´s American ).When I watched this film, I thought it was more a movie like the last 60 minutes of Full Metal Jacket' . But it was not. There were also some war-sequences, but it concentrates on Martin Sheen searching with a group of soldiers for the guy. And I thought that he finds him way earlier, not 20 minutes before the film ended. I think it was a good war-movie with a lot of inner suspense. And that was the great thing about this movie.
Apocalypse Now is not a film about Vietnam as ´Platoon´ or ´Full Metal Jacket´ are. It just concentrates on the search, and not the war itself. That was a good idea.I was very lucky to see Harrison Ford in this movie, because I just love him. He is my favorite actor of all time.I think that Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest movies of all time, but it is good. I rated it 8/10 and recommend it to fans of war movies, that do not want to see bullets all the time. Warmly recommended!CU; Rinho",8,0,0,9 February 2001
Face_Off," My number 17 movie
","Face/Off is my number 17 movie. It is one of the greatest action movie ever made, but not the greatest. There are three better action movies : Jurassic Park 1 & 2 and The Rock. The actors are good, and the story is one of the best ever told in an action movie. I hope there will be more action movies that are as great as Face/Off and The Rock. There are only a few things that could have been better : sometimes this was a bit slow. The action scenes are great, but not as great as those from Jurassic Park or The Rock.
Good points : action, actors, acting, directing, STYLE, story, beginning, Jamie ( the girl ).Bad points : sometimes to slow, All in all, I rate this movie 9.8/10. It is one of the greatest action movies out there. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.CU; Rinho.",10,2,3,5 March 2001
The Usual Suspects," Very boring
","I´ve heard first about this movie when it was ranked on IMDBs Top250. I think it was ranked #9. So I thought that this movie could be good, or at least, watchable. Boy was I wrong. When I rented The Usual Suspects, I kept myself awake by thinking why anyone could like this movie. It was just very bad and very boring. Maybe I did not like it, because I have just seen half of it. But then I watched it twice again, and I still did not like it. It is not THAT bad, but it is not worth being ranked as #15 of all time, and this is above Saving Private Ryan' or The silence of the lambs' ?!? Why ?!?
After this movie there are two actors that dislike a lot. But I do not remember their names. The only one I still like is Kevin Spacey, but I do not know why, since he has taken part in this film. In about one or two months I am going to watch this film again, and maybe I will like it then. But I do not think so. I am going to sit down on a chair, so I will not fall asleep. But probably this film will be the first one that I will fall asleep while sitting on a chair. The main complaint I have about this movie is : Why was it so slow ? The characters almost act in slow motion. That was very bad.
All in all, I rated this movie 3/10, but I do not know why it is no 1/10, maybe because it is not that long. Or maybe because of Kevin Spacey. I do not know.",8,1,3,4 February 2001
Independence Day," Great
","Independence Day. It is a very good sci-fi-action movie with great special effects. It is still #4 in the box office. A few years ago ( about 1997 ) I watched this film with my little sister about 3 times a week. Till now I have seen this movie about 25 times, at the moment there is no film that I have seen more often, but during the following weeks Jurassic Park will catch ID4 up. Maybe Independence Day is brainless, but who cares? It wants to be an entertaining action movie, and it is. Maybe it is the best sci-fi-movie ever.I have two favorite scenes : the first : the aliens attacking New York and Los Angeles and so on. The second : 'Y'know, this was supposed to be my weekend off, but noooo. You got me out here draggin' your heavy ass through the burnin' desert with your dreadlocks stickin' out the back of my parachute. You gotta come down here with an attitude, actin' all big and bad... and what the hell is that smell? I could've been at a barbecue! But I ain't mad.'Good points : these two scenes, action, fun, special effects, sound, story, characters, actors, style, Will Smith, beginning, directing.Bad points : sometimes the score, some goofs.All in all, I rate Independence Day 9.5/10. A few years ago it was my favorite film, but today it is just #24.",10,0,1,9 October 2001
Liar Liar," My number 168 movie
","Liar Liar is my number 168 movie. It is quite funny and Jim Carrey is hilarious once again.  The story : Jim Carrey lies allday. On his 8th birthday, his son wants him to say the truth the whole day. So Jim Carrey tells everyone what he really thinks, and that makes many funny moments. Liar Liar is a quite funny comedy movie. All in all, i rated it 8/10. I recommend it to Jim Carrey fans and to fans of the comedy genre.",7,0,0,24 January 2001
A Clockwork Orange," My number 177 movie
","Clockwork Orange is my number 177 movie. I have just seen the half of it and that has been about one year ago, but unfortunately I have to admit that I liked it. I recommend it to Stanley Kubrick Fans, but not to anyone else. All in all, I rated it 7/10, but I´d like to see the film once again to justify my rating, maybe it will be a bit worse.",9,0,0,24 January 2001
Pulp Fiction," Not good
","Pulp Fiction is not a good movie I think. It has some enjoyable moments, but it is actually too confusing, because of the time and place´( they ALWAYS change! ). That is not good for a movie, I think. I do not think that it is one of the best 25 films ever. I mean, what is the great thing about that movie? It is just another piece about drugs and killing each other. Come on?! I rated it a 4/10, because it is quite original and has some funny jokes. But it is definitely not that good.",6,6,16,8 January 2001
Die Hard," My number 119 movie
","Die Hard, part 1 is my number 119 movie. I think you know what it is about, so I do not have to tell you what it is about. I have to admit that I usually like action movies, and this one made no exception. I am not a hard Bruce Willis fan, but I do like him, especially because of his performance in The Sixth Sense. I think part 1 is the best Die Hard movie.  Part 3 is the second best, and part 2 the worst, but nevertheless that is a good movie. All in all, I rated this action milestone 8/10, part 2    7/10 and part 3 8/10. But part 1 is a bit better than part 3. I recommend all Die hard movies to action fans, whom else ? If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. CU; Rinho",8,0,1,13 February 2001
To Kill a Mockingbird," My number 145 movie
","To Kill a mockingbird is my number 145 movie. It is very original and the actors are great. I usually do not like black&white-movies, but this movie is an exception ( but it is not the only one ). The film is about Atticus ( Gregory Peck ) who is the lawyer of a black man, and that is why he loses his authority in the town. All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and I recommend it to fans of serious films. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",8,2,4,28 January 2001
Army of Darkness," DidnÂ´t like it
","Army of darkness was one of those horror movies who were good in the year they were made, but are bad today. For example, the exorcist is still great after about 30 years. I thought Army of Darkness is not a horror movie for everyone, not even for every horror fan. I liked some parts of it, but all in all it was bad.I rate Army of Darkness 3/10, because it was not interesting. I have watched it three times so far, but it never impressed me. CU; Rinho.",3,3,9,24 March 2001
Scream 2," My number 142 movie ( contains story + spoilers )
","Scream 2 is my number 142 movie. It is a good, but ridiculous, horror flick. I think that part 2 is the worst of the Scream-series, but nevertheless good. I can understand why someone dislikes this movie, because the characters sometimes act very stupid ( e.g. the car crash - if you have seen the film ). The story : While watching Stab' ( which deals with the incidents of Scream' ) two people are killed. The police has not any suspicion, because everyone wears those Stab'-dress. The next day Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is frightened because she gets a phone call by  the killer ( the killers ??? ). During the following days many people are killed by the murderer / murderers. In the end Sidney Prescott and the TV-correspondent Gale Weathers ( Courteney Cox ) meet the killer/s in the auditorium of the school. The final showdown begins....I have to admit that I usually like all horror films, and this one is no exception. Although it is one of the more ridiculous ones, it is nevertheless scary. The actors are quite bad. It exaggerates in the end. If you try to keep yourself a secret from everybody ( by wearing a mask ) , you do not take your mass off voluntarily, do you ?!? But that is the same as in Scream 1 and Scream 3. Question #1: Why did Sidney and her friend not take the mask of the guy in the car, who is unconsciously. Question #2 : How is it possible to sound one´s horn if you try to take the mask of the guy ?Question #3 : The killers kill everyone almost as fast as possible, right ? But why do they make a sensation with killing Sidney ? She is their main-victim, but they just do not want to kill her ? WHY ?????This is definitely not one of the best horror movies. But it is a good one.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of horror films or to fans of the Scream-series ( of course ). I am pretty lucky that a film ( Scary Movie' ) made fun of these horror movies. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",8,0,0,30 January 2001
Die Hard with a Vengeance," My number 141 movie ( contains story + spoilers )
","'Die Hard : with a vengeance' is my number 141 movie. ( outta 750 about )It is a good action film, and Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and especially Jeremy Irons do a well action job.The story : Simon ( Jeremy Irons ) is the brother of the guy , that John McClane ( Bruce Willis ) has killed in 'Die Hard 1' ( the one that felt down the skyscraper ). He wants to take revenge for the loss of his brother. He places a bomb in an underground station in Manhattan. This bomb explodes. Simon has a racist orders for John McClane ( you know what I mean if you have seen the film ). During the carrying out of the orders John McClane gets an accomplice named Zeus ( Samuel L. Jackson ). Simon has a lot of more orders for them, which they carry out. But they do not have that much time to think where Simon could be ( he seems to be everywhere ). But in the end they get Simon during a ceremony with his accomplices...I have to admit that I like 'big' action films, and 'Die Hard 3' is better than part 2, but a bit worse than part 1, I think. I consider it a good action film, but there are many action films that are ( much ) better.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and I recommend it to actions fans and to guys that do not expect a film that is almost as good ( or even better ) than part 1.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",9,0,0,7 February 2001
Trainspotting," My number 138 movie
","´Trainspotting´ is my number 138 movie. ( outta 750 about ) It is a good film about some maybe 20-year-old guys that are addicted to drugs. I think Ewan McGregor does a good job in this film, while the other actors are OK or bad. Some scenes are a bit disgusting, but who cares? All in all, I rated ´Trainspotting´ 8/10. If you want to compare this one to ´Kids´ ( 1995 ), Trainspotting is way better.",7,0,3,4 February 2001
Jurassic Park," The greatest film of all time
","I think that there is nothing else to say, Jurassic Park is just the greatest film of all time. Rating: 99/10For JP2: 11/10 and JP3: 9.9/10 ;-)",10,2,3,26 October 2002
Jurassic Park," My number 1 movie ( contains possible spoilers )
","Jurassic Park is my all time favorite movie. Great, sensationally, fascinating, astounding : This movie does not deserve those words, it is much better.This movie has just the greatest special effects ever. What I love about this movie ( unlike to Godzilla, King Kong, Terminator 2 or something ), is that the story is more important than the special effects, and not the other way round. Another thing is, that the guys do not say : oh, we are human beings, so we have to kill every single animal danger that there is ( see : in the whole movie, you cannot see even one shot ). Comparison : In Godzilla there were about 1647. I wonder how anyone can not like this movie at all. I am almost embarrassed to say that I have seen this movie just 18 times, but in the end of the year 2001 I will have watched it at least 50 times. I started to watch this movie at least one time a week. I could quote every part of this film, but I still cannot have enough of it. I never get tired of seeing this movie.Good points of Jurassic Park: Music, Steven Spielberg, character development, everything on the stylistic level, the camera work, audio/visual effects, the story and the way it is told, the T Rex, the velociraptor, every single scene with a dinosaur in it ( and the others, too ), actors  ((Alan Grant ( Sam Neill ), John Hammond ( Richard Attenborough ), Ellie Sattler ( Laura Dern ), Ray Arnold ( Samuel L. Jackson ), Tim Murphy ( Joseph Mazzelo ) , Lex Murphy ( Ariana Richards ), Dennis Nedry ( Wayne Knight ), Ian Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ), Robert Muldoon ( Bob Peck ), Lewis Dodgson ( Cameron Thor ) and Henry Wu ( B. D. Wong )), the first 60 minutes, and the last 60 minutes, the suspense, maybe even horror, if you are young, the action, the humor ( the bit that there is ), the way that the characters tell their arguments to do/do not approve the park, and every single shot that you can see.Bad points : the dilophosaur, there was a bit too much of Dennis Nedry ( just a little bit ), a few goofs.My favorite parts : the T Rex scenes, the kitchen scene, both scenes with the brachiosaur, the ending ( in the helicopter, with that GREAT music ). This movie maybe has my three all-time-favorite film parts : the Rex breaking out, the ending and the brachiosaur visiting Alan, Lex and Tim in the tree.This is a definite milestone in cinema history, and I hope it will still be remembered in 50 years. I still have to live about 70 years, and I promise, that this will ever be my favorite movie. There has never been, there is no, and there will never be a better movie than Jurassic Park.Steven Spielberg works his magic again, and he is by FAAAAR my favorite director, and this is one reason why I like him THAT much. OK, he made some bad films, but films like Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler´s List ( my Top 3 movies ) will stay masterpieces forever. I think that every other director would have made another King Kong or Godzilla from the script, but Steven knew what to do, and this is one reason why I love him. Don't listen to the negative reviews or claims that this movie was just a 'sell out'- because it's not. George Lucas has an army of advertising blitzes and action figures and countless other crap, for his overrated films, but he makes 'magic'.Jurassic Park is the reason that I am a film fan. Since I watched this film in 1996 on TV, I watched about 700 films, but there is no movie that came up to it. Till 1998 this was not my all-time favorite, but one day I decided that this is just the greatest thing on earth. This is better than The Lost World ( which is my number 6 movie ), because it is not that much concentrated on action ( I like action, but Jurassic Park shows exactly the same length of action scenes, and The Lost World was a bit too much concentrated on the action ). I hope that I will be able to watch this movie with JP2 and JP3 in a feature in summer, when Jurassic Park 3 enters the screen. I´d love to watch this movie on the big screen and I can't wait for the sequel. If there had not been Schindler´s List', this should have gotten the 7 awards that Schindler won.All in all, this movie is, on a scale from 1 to 10, a definite 1000. It could not have been better. For anyone who hasn't yet seen this classic film, what are you waiting for?Thanks to everyone that gave us such a great film. We can only be thankful that this movie was made.Can't wait for the sequel, although it is without the masters Steven Spielberg ( on the director's chair ) and John Williams. A definite 1000/10.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. Is there anyone out there who loves the film as much as I do ?Cu; Rinho.",10,2,3,18 February 2001
