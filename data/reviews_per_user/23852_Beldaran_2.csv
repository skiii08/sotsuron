Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Liked It--See it a few times
","I really liked this movie, although I agree with a previous writer that it gets better with repeated viewings.  There are details that can be missed the first time. Also, the opening scenes looked kind of stupid the first time, but they looked better the second and third times.I still think the first third of the film, however, is the weakest part. Once Qui-Gon and company land on Tatooine, the film just gets better and better. I thought Lloyd was best in his scenes with Neeson, August, and Portman, and in the Naboo fighter at the end.  I didn't think he was wooden. Jar Jar grew on me, I think, even though I do think he has a little too much screen time, and he doesn't have to be quite so bumbling. He has his moments, though.Overall, while I don't think it's quite as good as the first two Star Wars movies, it's about on par with Return of the Jedi (which I liked a lot more than most people seem to).  I'd probably give it three out of four stars if I had to give it a rating.My advice to moviegoers: if you didn't like it too much the first time, give it another chance.  It really does improve with repeated viewings.",8,5,7,31 May 1999
The Sound of Music," Truly Surprising--Every Time!
","Like most people my age (late twenties), I grew up watching this film year after year on television.  As I grew older, however, I became increasingly reluctant to see it again, since I always seemed to remember it as sentimental and sickenly sweet.  I suppose I was swayed by public opinion. Every time I knuckle down and actually see this movie again, however, I am struck by how honest and *truly* sweet it is--there is nothing sickening or overly sentimental about it (aside from the dreadful 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen', which I always fast-forward through on the tape).The acting is wonderful.  Julie Andrews actually seems to allow the audience to read her mind several times during the film, such as in the delightful 'Edelweiss' scene.  Christopher Plummer is also very good as a man who is extremely confident in his old love (for his country) while at the same time being insecure in his growing new one (for Maria).  The children are genuine and endearing without being cutesy, and the serious plot turn, involving the escape from the Nazis, is handled very well. Yes, I know this is not how it happened in real life, but it does play well on screen.  Most (if not all) 'true story' movies take dramatic liberties, and as long as the viewer realizes this fact, everything is fine.In conclusion, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this movie in a while is to see it again (on video, not TV--the network cuts too much out) and realize how genuine and non-syrupy it actually is.  It is well-filmed, well-acted, and it contains some of the best music Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (although I will admit I'm not too fond of Rodgers's addition, 'Something Good'). It also contains, as far as I have seen, the very best film performance of one of the greatest singer-actresses of all time, Julie Andrews.",Null,0,5,6 October 1999
