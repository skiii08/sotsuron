Sucker Punch," Didn't even meet our low expectations
","This movie is not as complex as some would like to make out and it's metaphors are not hugely deep and multi-layered. It's all fairly obvious and entirely tedious. Me and my friends were bored and fidgety throughout but we still didn't need to be fully focused to keep up with the plot - comparisons with Inception are totally overblown.If there were any points where I thought, 'oh, I should pay attention here and listen to what they're trying to say', I quickly remembered that I didn't actually care at all and wasn't interested in figuring out the meaning of their trite, ridiculous voice-over pronouncements of faux-wisdom. I didn't care about the characters, didn't care about the plot and so I couldn't bring myself to care about even the supposedly good bits in the form of the fighting. It was all tedium, all the time.Not wanting to spend hours thinking about the 'depth' and 'messages' of this movie is not a result of my laziness, it's because of the film- makers' laziness.",1,16,33,8 April 2011
