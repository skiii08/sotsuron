Casablanca," Wonderful
",What can I say? Everything about this movie is great. From the performances to the suspense to the dialogue to just the overall mood of it all. A classic romance that has stood the test of time. Must-see for any movie fan. 10/10.,9,0,0,11 October 2001
Citizen Kane," Great achievement, but overrated
","Citizen Kane is a great, influential film. One of the most influential films of all time, in fact. But I still believe that it is overrated. The main problem is the story. It really doesn't captivate me. The story drags on and I really don't find myself caring at all about it. To add to that, I found that the acting really wasn't as outstanding as I had heard it would be. Many great things have been said about this film, and most of them are right. It is quite obviously a great achievement, but I'll give it a 7/10 because in some areas, Citizen Kane just wasn't my cup of tea.",6,1,4,11 October 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Excellent, although a notch below the original
","The Godfather Part II was just as good as the original in almost every way. My only problem was that the 'prequel' part didn't achieve much and seemed not go anywhere. Other than that, an exceptional film. 9/10.",8,1,3,11 October 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of my personal least favorites of all time
","This is a terrible, terrible movie. Let's start with the script. It is lame and does not feature one great line. Next, the special effects. These are all good and fine but stuff blowing up does not a movie make. The 'emotion'. This movie is in no way touching or anything else like that as the back cover would make you believe. The plot. There is some kind of plot but mostly it's just there so that we can get to the special effects. And finally the acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS. The John O' Connor kid is so amazingly bad that I muted this movie every time he started talking. A high-pitched kid swearing and trying to act big and bad is the last thing I am entertained by. Arnold Schwarzzeneger and John O' Connor's mother put on performances not quite as bad as the kid but close. I do not see how anyone could like this movie, but apparently some people do. They can have their opinions, but I personally believe that there is not a single redeeming value about this 'film'.",1,19,115,1 September 2001
Schindler's List," Deeply moving
","Schindler's List is a must-see. It is depressing, yet uplifting. It has powerful scene after powerful scene. Schindler's character is done perfectly. The holocaust is portrayed in a way that is almost documentorial. I do not like most of Spielberg's movies. In fact, I think he has made some very terrible movies (Jaws comes to mind). But Schindler's List is a masterpiece. If only Spielberg would stick to films like this one. 10/10.",9,9,14,11 October 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Triumph of the human spirit
","The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best 'jail' movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me.",2,1,16,11 October 2001
The Godfather," A great film
","Although I would not consider it the greatest movie ever, I would still give the Godfather a 10/10 and am willing to say that it is quite an amazing film. It is emotional, involving, and the performances are top-notch. A film that is good in every category, The Godfather is definitely better than it's sequels and my second favorite Coppola film (I liked Apocalypse Now a bit more).",8,0,2,11 October 2001
