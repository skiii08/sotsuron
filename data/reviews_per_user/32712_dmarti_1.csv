Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Makes Volume #1 that much better
","Kung Fu, Anime, and a love story too.  Think of this movie this way.  Part 1 has most of the killing.  Part 2 has most of the background story.  After seeing Vol2, you'll appreciate the first movie that much more.  The only complaint I've heard about volume 2 is that one friend thinks the redneck alcoholic Bud made too good of a showing in his fight with Kiddo.  I think this just let you know that while the Black Mamba is a great fighter, she also isnt invincible.  I've talked to many people and if you liked Pulp Fiction, then Kill Bill is for you.  I'd say its one of Tarrantino's best. Volume2 lets you know that the 'Kill Bill' story is more than over-the-top anime' style killing.",9,0,1,20 April 2004
