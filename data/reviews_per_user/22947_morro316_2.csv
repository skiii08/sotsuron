The Rock," Absolutely Brilliant
","If you want to see a film that contains everything about what action should be, then this is the film to see. Everything about it rocks - the actors, the plot, the script, the score.Nicholas Cage is great in it as does Sean Connery who revels in his James Bond type role. Ed Harris is excellent and believable as the villain.If you have NOT seen this then why not?Buy the Criterion release of the DVD right now!",10,1,1,10 June 2001
Ghostbusters," An absolute classic
","Even now, nearly 20 years later this film is still as good as ever. Sure, the special FX world has moved on but they do not get in the way of a superb script and excellent direction from Ivan Reitman. How anyone can call this film 'boring' is totally beyond me.Bill Murray is absolutely superb in this - some of best work with the fantastic Groundhog Dog just beating his work in this. Some of his one liners are just hilarious and the cast's interaction with each other is a pleasure to watch (bar Ernie Hudson who just seems out of place and is the film's biggest weakness IMO). Sigourney Weaver does a decent job though her work as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series taxes herself a little more. Rick Moranis is fantastic though and its a shame he never seems to get more recognition than he does nowdays.If you've never seen Ghostbusters, then I implore you to go and grab it on DVD - its action packed, funny and even scary in some places. Just be wary of the Library scene in the early part of the film, scared the hell out of me when I saw it in my earlier years!!!9/10",10,4,4,6 December 2003
