The Young Victoria," My new favorite movie for the last six months!
","This is an absolutely stunning movie. It is visually beautiful - the scenery, the costumes and the sets. The music is wonderful, at times haunting, but memorable and perfectly suited to the movie. The story is very interesting and intriguing, it made me google Victoria and Albert on several occasions to learn more about them. Emily Blunt is terrific and the chemistry between her and Rupert Friend is palpable. The casting and acting are great.Every time it comes on, which is often, I feel compelled to watch it and am never disappointed. I just can't seem to get enough of this movie and the best part is that there is no profanity, no nudity, no real violence and it's suitable for all audiences.",10,2,2,13 November 2011
This Is the End," STARZ rating system is rigged 4 stars for this piece of trash?
","This is not a movie which would have appealed to me. In fact, I think the primary demographic must be people who get stoned before every activity. But, the STARZ cable guide gave it four stars so I thought it must be at least decent, I mean, they don't give four stars to just any movie. While I get what they were going for, they just didn't pull it off. I can handle crude movies, if they are funny, but this was just stupid and crude. I kept watching thinking it would improve, never happened. I think the recent bad reviews are typical of people like me, frustrated about being duped into seeing a terrible movie by a bad rating system.",1,13,28,24 February 2014
