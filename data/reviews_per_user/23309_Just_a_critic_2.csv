Mission: Impossible III," Much like an Episode of Alias***Spoilers Below****
","This movie felt like an episode of Alias with a much bigger budget. Its simply a popcorn action flick, with good action a somewhat suspenseful story and some comedy scenes thrown in. It wasn't as cranial as MI:1 and not as stylized as MI:2. I guess MI:3 has more emotion. Ethan seems to have more connection/caring to his woman in this one. Cruise neither makes or breaks the film as Ethan Hunt. But he does run in an odd way through Chinese streets.All in all it was JJ Abrams doing Alias with MI characters and a movie budget. Below are examples/spoilers.The movie's first scene shows you the torture of Ethan Hunt. Then the movie really starts to show you how it all got there. Very Alias,When Ethan infiltrates the building he is in communication with Luther who is in a control van, Might as well be Sydney and Dixon.There is a CIA Op Tech guy who reminds you very much of MarshallFishburne's Character is a reminder of Director KendallThere is a exchange scene.Big Spoiler***There is a convoy transporting a prisoner, anyone who's watched Alias knows what happens to convoys transporting prisoners.Friendships are betrayed,Personally its worth a movie ticket, because action flicks should be seen on the big screen. But its not one for the thinkers.",7,1,2,10 May 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Mow down Greengrass...
","The Director of this film Greengrass ought to be mowed down.... In this film he constantly used shaky camera work that annoyed the heck out of the me. The constant flashbacks and closeups/snap far away/snap close up shots were terrible. I can understand if this was done during action scenes because Damon isn't a professional Martial Artist(even though he did okay in Bourne Identity) and camera work that would add tension. But he did that for almost every scene. What was Greengrass smoking when he directed? There was also a scene that was sloppy, There was an extra standing near a kiosk waiting until Damon walks by and then 'action'. It seemed very out of place and the scene felt like an outtake. So Bad Directing Bad Cinematography And Bad EditingIf the Producers read this Please Fire Greengrass",2,3,12,24 July 2004
