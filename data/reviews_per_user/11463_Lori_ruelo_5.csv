The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk goes into the second round!
","The Hulk goes into the second round! This time, the broken scientist is played by Edward Norton. The successor of Eric Bana and Lou Ferrigno gives Bruce Banner a certain vulnerability and acts more human than its predecessors. It's just not a parade for Norton. Norton is coming for me completely under-challenged. With this reorientation of the comics Hulk, all the main characters were exchanged. Betty Ross is now played by Liv Tyler. Tyler doesn't really fit into the role. Her charisma comes more naively over and the prehistory with Bruce Banner, one does not look at her. Also General Ross was now taken over by William Hurt. Like his predecessor Sam Elliott, Hurt also has a good screen presence and costs it completely. The main opponent is Emil Blonsky this time and is played by Tim Roth. Although Roth is motivated by his role, and he also sees that he is buckling, he also seems a bit stunted. One could have afforded more freedom for Roth.
The director's post took over this time Louis Letterier. Letterier relies more on action and effects than on figure drawings. His predecessor Ang Lee had rather told it as a romantic comic book fairy tale. Although Lee was rather lengthy in his history, Letterier is rather superficial. My favorite scene is when Hulk hits Blunsky for the second time. Blunsky says dry: Is that all? And you can see that in this version a bit: Is that all? Was that all? Conclusion: Better a few effects less to work out the screenplay better!",7,2,3,16 October 2018
Bird Box," Just don't look!
","The idea that you can only pass an adventure with blindfolds, I still find original! Any unknown force, lets people drive mad. So they commit suicide. No one knows where it comes from and how to fight it. Pregnant Sandra Bullock can barricade herself into a house with a few other, few survivors. Interpersonal drama then plays out and you can't trust anyone anymore. For sure, it's a bit reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's work The Happening. The unknown force is not declared in great detail either. It's just there. The story is rather exciting, like the typical meeting of different people and how they have to come to terms. The only antidote is: Just don't look! Add to that the unique trip in a small boat with children who have all attracted the blindfolds. This is pure excitement and horror! I mean, how are we going to behave? The actors are heavily selected. Especially Bullock's counterpart part John Malkovich. Malkovich already has a tremendous screen presence.
The effects are simple and only targeted. Director Susanne Bier prefers to keep the focus on her performers rather than the strained disasters. Unfortunately, the conclusion remains open: You don't know how to contain the power. Are Bullock and the other survivors the only ones who had adopted the Blindekuh method? Why can the force affect people, even through the computer screen, but not through an open fireplace? Conclusion: An exciting and captivating story that has more interpersonal dimensions than on effects",7,1,3,7 January 2019
Thor," The first hammer throw of the Thunder God!
","The hammer-wielding and good-looking Thor in his first adventure in the MCU. Director Branagh passionately takes over the narrative style, from this comic book template. You can already see, however, that Branagh is a big Shakespeare fan. Almost monumental, he draws the figures of Thor, Odin or Loki. The city of Asgard is also more likely to come from Hamlet than Marvel. The story tells Branagh well and he also incorporates a lot of humour. For when Thor falls to earth, he has already lost the power of a God. It's not until the second half of the film that stands out. Therefore, it is amusing that the arrogant and beautiful Thor himself falls on the snout and remains equally entitled. Of course, Thor is the hero, so you have to disguise it that he is the same as a human being. He can still fight better and has more strength than three people combined.
In addition to Hemsworth as Thor, there are other confessed performers to his side. Natalie Portman gives the typical, chaotic scientist. While she's a bit cranky, she makes her likeable alongside the overpowering heroes. Stellan Skaarsgard is an old professor who is more than a father figure to Portman. And, of course, Anthony Hopkins as Konigsgott Odin, who still brings a bit of sparkle to this hero saga. Narratively and visually, Branagh has managed not to straddle the adventure on torture for long. You look at it to the performers, which was fun. But among the other Marvel heroes, Thor remains rather weak in content. Although Thor is like that, everything remains self-evident and remains superficial. Conclusion: A colorful adventure that is told briskly. Only character drawing is left behind!",7,0,0,6 January 2019
Iron Man," The Beginning of a Hero!
","This comic book adaptation really offers a lot of Entertainment! Robert Downey, Jr. is very well chosen to play the self-cherished Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges plays well, but his role should have been expanded. Paltrow is completely under. The film is cynical and ironic and built with a pinch of humor. Good action and with a wink explains that you should not take it too seriously. Well done!",7,0,0,21 September 2018
Annihilation," The Nature Calls!
","In and of itself, the history of Annihilation is not bad.
It has a lot of pictures and camera settings. The individual scenes are told leisurely and you take time for each individual setting. It is also noticeable that the figure drawings of every actress, carries a secret that is gradually revealed. This also makes it a bit more exciting for the narrative strand. Alex Garland also understands how to set the special effects to the perfect scene. The effects are very colorful and you can also notice how he is charging the tension. The creatures are very beautiful, although you know that in the next scene you can't trust the beauty. The meaning of life is also a message from Garland. Where we come from and where we go. Unfortunately, Garland sometimes delays the story too much and then waits in vain until Garland comes to the point. Also the actresses are very well selected and you notice that each of the women have a heavy backpack to wear.
Conclusion: A quiet and lengthy film about the existence and fate of different women bring mood, but a bit more action you would have already given the movie!",6,0,1,15 June 2018
