The Avengers," 8.5 seriously?
","don't misunderstand me I liked this movie but i just don't think it deserves to have 8.5So according to IMDb's top 250 this movie is better than: Fellini's 8. 1/2, Stalker, A Clockwork Orange, Raging Bull, Kill Bill, and most of Kurosawa movies?? The Avengers in my opinion is just an enjoyable movie, actually one of the best superhero movies ever made (after The Dark Knight trilogy of course)I think this movie is incredibly overrated, and I really hate that people think is one of the best films ever made. when its far away from that",7,3,7,29 August 2012
