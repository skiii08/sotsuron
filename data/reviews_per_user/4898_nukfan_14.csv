Moneyball," A Fantastic and Un-Clicheed Sports Film
","I just saw this movie, and I have to say, it's one of the better sports movies that I've seen. It starts off with a brief glimpse at the Oakland A's demise in the 2001 playoffs vs the Yankees, in which they coughed up a 2-0 series lead in the best-of-5 ALDS. Following this heartbreaking defeat, the team is essentially dismantled. They lose their top players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen), and are forced to rebuild.Like most sports movies, it at least partially focuses on every MLB player's main goal: to win a World Series. But it's also about more than that. In 'The Natural', it's about an old, injured coulda-been that strives to meet his former potential. In 'Field of Dreams', it's about the love of the game, and how it unites people. In 'Moneyball', it's about one man's apparent desire to change the game by looking at nothing but On-Base Percentage. It's also about Beane and Brand's new ideas going up against the purists of baseball.Brad Pitt can add yet another great performance to his resume with his portrayal of Billy Beane, the A's GM. And Jonah Hill proves (to me anyways) that he is an actor capable of much more than raunchy comedies. I didn't once think about his previous characters from Superbad and Knocked Up when I watched him. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds instant class as A's manager Art Howe, as well.The film is also completely devoid of sports clichés. It helps to know that it's all based on true events, I suppose. But you don't feel like you're watching a recycled film. I was captivated from beginning to end.I suppose my one complaint would be the small amount of real-live baseball footage. Most of the baseball is old footage of the actual events, with the actors integrated in for close-ups. But the film is seen from Beane's perspective, and he doesn't like to watch the games.Don't be surprised if it gets some Oscar nods. Possibly Best Adapted Screenplay (from the book), or maybe even Best Actor for Brad Pitt. See it now.",Null,1,3,24 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst of the saga, but not a bad film overall.
","This is perhaps one of the most publicly criticized films of all time. Lucas' first star wars film in almost 20 years- the most hyped of all of them- and most felt that he botched it.It's been on DVD for eleven years now, and I've seen it many times. Minus Jar Jar, this movie would be an 8 or a 9 in my opinion. Amazing special effects and spectacular action scenes make this movie great. The plot is more of a 'oh, that's how it started' thing, so it's not a best picture winner. But it's been hated for far too long. The acting is how it should be; Jake Lloyd was just a kid then (just like his character), so his corny lines can be forgiven.Exceeding absolutely EVERYONE'S expectations was the end lightsaber duel. Brilliantly choreographed, good use of special effects, and a tragic loss at the climax that is followed by a SICK killing move that ends the antagonist, Maul (a great bad guy, despite saying, like 13 words).",7,20,30,21 July 2010
It Follows," Exposes you through fear; the tension is key.
","For years, I've been waiting for a movie that properly exploits my nightmares. Horror movies in general are a tough sell for me. I find them to be fairly predictable, ridden with clichés and not remotely subtle. The threat never has any mystique, and the implications are underwhelming.'It Follows' manages, particularly for the first hour, to tap into some kind of primal fear that I had long forgotten or at least rarely dealt with. Something needs to be said for the cinematography; it's always ominous, and every scene is laced with a darkness that reminds you never to forget about the threat.Imagine you're being followed by something. Something capable of dealing tremendous pain and suffering through uncertain methods. It always moves at a walking pace, but it is always moving. When you're asleep, it gains ground on you. When you're standing still, its eyes are doing their best to bore into your very soul. It never loses focus. When you see it, it's unequivocally staring right back at you, slowing gaining ground. The eyes are technically human, but there is an uncanny nature to them. It wants to get you through physical means.It's really not enough to describe this kind of tension, but that's probably the best way for me to sum it up. The music during these scenes is flawless and it plays a kind of role of its own. There were times during the first hour when the tension was wholly unbearable. It made me feel vulnerable and cold.Unfortunately, the film loses steam in the final act. The horrific mystique of the first hour fades into a kind of peculiar mystery, and I think the ending contradicts the nature of the film as a whole; I didn't want to see a final showdown, I wanted to see how long the filmmakers could string out the tension.I recommend watching this alone and in the dark. This is a must-see film that corrupts your sense of security and brings back the nightmares you abandoned long ago.",7,3,10,24 October 2015
Hellboy," A Unique and Visually Impressive Film
","Hellboy is a very well-crafted visual treat. It makes fantastic use of both CGI and practical makeup to create its illusions. Ron Perlman as Hellboy (or 'Red') is particularly impressive, especially when you consider how much of a pain it would have been to prepare for that role with all of that makeup and prosthetic material every single day.The plot is 'save the world' type of stuff, but that's fine, because a movie as stylish as this has no time or need to dwell on complex subplots and dialogue; it's supposed to be fun.The movie has a lot of funny little quirks on top of the visual effects. Hellboy happens to be a very charming, funny character who lives up to his appearance with his personality.Despite the richness of its effects, I found the movie to be surprisingly restrained. Not significantly so, but we have Hellboy, we Abe Sapien (also cool) and we have some scary looking 'hounds' that have tentacles and long tongues. But it probably could have been more diverse. The movie is 130 minutes long, but it just doesn't feel like it makes the most of that running time.Regardless, it's a unique and very entertaining comic book movie.",8,0,0,7 March 2014
Amadeus," Lovingly crafted, musical, emotional drama
","F. Murray Abraham and Thomas Hulce star as Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, respectively, in this lavish period piece. I say 'lavish' because among the film's greatest strengths is its visual style, including the sets, the costumes and the cinematography.The film is a slow-burning drama that focuses on character emotion and its connection with the music of the composers in the film. We are always peering deep into the souls of Salieri and Mozart as they live with their passion for music. Salieri is particularly fascinating because of his deep admiration, hatred and jealousy of Mozart all at once; he speaks of his music with great reverence, yet bears a deep grudge against God for making the composer of such music a man as arrogant and childish as Mozart, though Salieri himself needs to look in the mirror.The music is integrated beautifully with the film, either as simply its score, or to correspond with a character reading or imagining certain musical pieces. It's a consistently beautiful film, but it can drag on when it takes its time with a scene; the drama isn't tense so much as it is in a constant state of rising and falling emotion, much like the music itself.It's a very good film, but if I had to, I'd say that watching it must be similar to going to the opera, an activity that I can only speculate upon, since I've never been; kind of boring, but beautiful and meaningful all the same.",8,0,1,26 November 2013
Black Hawk Down," Gritty, Raw, and Powerful
","Black Hawk Down may be one of the greatest war movies ever made. Without glorifying anything, it shows the stress, adrenaline, terror and loss of warfare. Ridley Scott has earned a reputation for making great war films (especially medieval) so there are no surprises when excellence is found here.As the viewer, you may not utter a single breath from beginning to end. But one thought may cross your mind: 'I'm glad I wasn't there'. That 'there' is Somalia in 1993. A violent, starving city run by a corrupt government. Militia flood the streets. And I'll tell you this right now: few things are more terrifying than the devotion of these militants. They want the American troops out of their city, and they'll stop at nothing to get that message across.All the actors are excellent. Josh Hartnett, Ewan MacGregor and Tom Sizemore earn great marks from me. The sound editing was also excellent, as every bullet ricochet and shell explosion pounds into your eardrums, allowing you to forget nothing.Watch it. It will put images in your mind for a long time.",10,1,2,14 February 2011
Elysium," A Great Summer Sci-Fi Movie
","Neil Blomkamp's directorial follow-up to District 9 only makes it more official that he is the future of Science Fiction films. Once again, he has created a gritty, violent, believable world to set the stage for a character's journey.It is evident that Blomkamp is totally committed to detail. 22nd century Earth is filthy and undesirable, it's inhabitants desperate, sick and constantly teased by the contrasting paradise in the planet's orbit. Matt Damon's Max reminds me a lot of Sharlto Copley in District 9. Max is more human than hero, and it shows for most of the film. He's willing to do whatever it takes to survive. And while he is a good person, he is not the typical Hollywood altruistic hero that we're all so used to.The special effects put on a display of just how much computers can do these days. High-tech gadgets and vehicles look sophisticated, yet worn and dirty. Good use is also made of live-action special effects, something that is criminally under-valued in the eyes of so many directors.Jodie Foster, not surprisingly, gives a seemingly effortless performance as one of two main antagonists. Sharlto Copley gets the golden star for his role as Agent Kruger; I'll let you see him for yourself.Hard to find anything to complain about with this movie. The script is action movie stuff, and it certainly isn't an all-time classic. I'd give it a purchase once it hit the shelves, though. It's great escapism for 2 hours.",8,0,4,12 August 2013
Whiplash," A grand statement against participation medals...
","I vowed to myself a while back to be a lot more conservative with my 10 scores... this film doesn't change that. I feel that it earned it.This was 100 minutes of white-knuckle tension and anxiety. That's probably the best way to describe the film without spoiling anything. JK Simmons, as fantastic as he is, is matched by Miles Teller. The only other film I had seen with Teller in it was Divergent, which I didn't care for. He wasn't poor in it, but his character was pretty one-dimensional. Here he has made a statement to the industry, demonstrating that he is already an actor of great class.This is how inspirational films are supposed to be made. It is what must be a true representation of how greatness is suffered for and earned. I believe this because for not one second did I want to be in Andrew's shoes.",10,1,3,19 June 2015
American Gangster," Immensely Satisfying Crime Film
","Movies like these can't work without the right cast. I mean, I shouldn't even have to say that. It's a rule. There are plenty of different kinds of movies that can get by on style, visuals, or action all on their own. But what separates a movie like 'Gangster Squad' from a movie like 'American Gangster' is the cast, and how the cast is used. It has to be both.There are lots of familiar faces in this film. On top of Washington and Crowe, you have Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba and Josh Brolin. The director is Ridley Scott, a man who knows how to helm ambitious projects, like 'Black Hawk Down', 'Gladiator' and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. The pieces are all there.One of 'American Gangster''s biggest strengths is that there is a rich cast of characters, but the viewer is never lost, because the focus is primarily on Denzel Washington's Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts. They carry the film, as they certainly should.The plot is centred around a lengthy crusade by Roberts and his team to get to the bottom of New York's biggest drug conspiracy, which is of course being controlled by Lucas. This is a major theme regarding Lucas; he likes to be in control, to be able to gun down a man he doesn't like in the middle of a crowded sidewalk without any consequences. As a result, this makes his character seem all the more vulnerable when he isn't in total control of his situation.At the same time, Roberts is fighting more than just drug crime. He isn't the most honest guy, but he just might be the most honest cop. He is repulsed by crooked cops, and as a result he estranges himself from most of his workplace kin. So, as he fights to nail down the source of the drugs, he is also fighting against everyone who considered him a 'boy scout' whenever he did what he felt was right.Everything comes together in a conclusion that rewards anyone who takes the time to savour every moment of the film's 160 minutes. I rank this among the finest crime dramas I've watched.",10,3,4,24 February 2014
Prometheus," Sci Fi Horror at its best
","Perhaps the trailers are a little bit misleading. This film is not dedicated to terrifying you from beginning to end. it is not a haunted house. It is dedicated to making you think, and ask questions, with or without the benefit of seeing the Alien series.But it will terrify you.The film develops its characters well. The acting is convincing, especially from the likes of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. Ridley Scott has once again devised a great female lead (the notable other being, of course, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) who you will respect, admire, and root for, whether or not you agree with her religious beliefs (I did not). Fassbender plays a great android. Doesn't sound like praise? Trust me, it is. Everyone else is more than satisfactory, as they all react realistically (I can assume) to what they deal with.I won't give anything specific away, but there are multiple genuinely horrific sequences in the film, and the ending... well, some of you might like it, some of you won't. That's for sure. I loved it. That is also for sure.Go in with an open, thoughtful mind, and you're in for a treat.",10,15,28,10 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A spectacular return to the Star Wars cinematic universe.
","Though I will freely admit that I saw this movie through rose-tinted glasses, I can safely say that The Force Awakens, after two viewings, met all of my expectations. This is a pure action-adventure science fiction film, and its 135 minutes run at an absolute tear from beginning to end, with little quarter given. In short: it is, technically speaking, exactly what the anti-prequel crowd was looking for.I, for one, do not count myself among that crowd. I grew up with Episodes I-III, so they will always have a place in my heart, even if their flaws have become more and more apparent to me over the years. These flaws (poor dialogue, questionable direction, uneven pacing, awkward romances) have been duly noted by J.J. Abrams. The dialogue in Episode VII isn't award-worthy, but it's efficient and well-spoken. The movie moves between characters and locations seamlessly, maintaining a focused, exciting, yet simple story throughout. In my opinion, all of the actors have really solid chemistry, and I especially look forward to seeing more of the newest characters.John Boyega fits the young, flawed hero role like a glove. Finn is a very easy guy to like very quickly. I forgot that this was Daisy Ridley's first major motion picture almost immediately; I enjoyed watching Rey learn what she's capable of. I've saved my highest praise for Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, however. He almost never falls short of intimidating, but his very emotional approach to the Dark Side gives him more depth than the screenwriters were obligated to give him. I appreciated this.I think my complaints primarily centre around certain elements of the film that felt too familiar. There has been widespread talk that the film emulates far too much of previous Star Wars films. I'd say this is perhaps objectively true, but how much it affects your experience really depends on what attitude you go into the movie with. There were a small number of moments where I felt like the production team should have gone for something more original, but it's hard to be too upset when you have a goofy grin on your face for more than two hours.In the great words of our lord: 'I laughed, I cried, I lost ten pounds'. I'd tell you to go see this movie, but you already have. I'm excited for what the future will bring for this franchise.",9,5,23,28 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The best of all the films
","Right off the bat, I'll tell you that if you haven't at least seen Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows Part 1, you will be lost without all hope for the whole film AND this review. Don't kid yourself.The movie starts exactly where Part 1 left off. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have buried the late Dobby, and Voldemort has obtained the Elder Wand from the cold, dead hands of Dumbledore. The three heroes then devise a plan with the aid of Griphook the goblin to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts to find one of Voldemort's horcruxes. They get in quite easily, but have a bit of a problem with leaving.I won't reveal anything else. If you could only call one of the 8 Potter films an 'action' film, this would be the one. After the first third of the movie or so, it's essentially hell at Hogwarts. The place is torn apart by spells, important characters are killed off, and the pace rarely lets up. This is what everyone (including me) should have expected of the final entry. It ties together all loose ends, everyone's true character is revealed, and the climax is spectacular.Any acting problems that there may have been at any point in the film series are extinguished. Everyone that has a part is perfect. Daniel Radcliffe shows more emotion than before while playing the series' hero. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione show the characters' affection for each other seamlessly, as their characters have gone from a bickering duo, to a convincing couple. Ralph Fiennes again proves that he was the perfect choice for Voldemort, a purely evil character with absolutely no redeeming qualities... then polar opposite to Harry Potter. But, in my opinion, Matthew Lewis' portrayal of Neville Longbottom might just stand out above all others. His character finally gets his true moment in the sun, becoming a great hero, and it is clear that Lewis has matured with the character.The plot, while as a movie standing on it's own is perhaps unspectacular, answers all questions that any non-readers may have been asking, and, like I said earlier, it's what was expected. And the epilogue is very satisfying, don't you worry.Combine this film with Part 1, and you may have a film that is the most loyal to the book of all the films, so die-hard fans shouldn't have any serious complaints. I know I didn't.So, does the movie deserve Oscar recognition? In the case of acting, I think that Daniel Radcliffe has earned at least a nomination. He makes you truly feel for the character, especially near the end. Unfortunately, nominating anyone else would shadow someone else's performance, and that wouldn't be fair. Radcliffe stands out. And I haven't seen Captain America yet, but I think that this film should definitely win Best Special Effects; everything is blended together so well. The spells, the castle, the dragon from Gringotts, Voldemorts face (it is not makeup, as many people know)... you don't even notice that it's all computer generated. And should it win Best Picture...? If it's even nominated, I doubt that it will win, but I suppose that stranger things have happened... just be sure to keep your eye on the Oscars next year...My one complaint? The 3-D. Totally unnecessary, and actually a bit distracting at times. And I usually like 3-D...Still, 10/10",Null,0,1,27 July 2011
The Matrix," Simply Awesome
","What if your world wasn't real? You are actually plugged into a computer world that you think is real, and evil robots will soon use you as an energy source for themselves.Just imagine waking up from a very long dream that felt like your life, only to realise that you were actually living in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are either still sleeping or fighting to wake others up. That is the world that Thomas Anderson (Neo) discovers. He is a thirty- something guy with a boring office job who works by day, and hacks computers by night. Then, he meets Morpheus, a mysterious man that seems to be on a mission... a mission that involves Neo. On top of all this, there's kung-fu, bullet dodgin' and ass-kickin'! The perfect action/sci-fi film.",10,0,1,4 August 2010
Princess Mononoke," A Beautiful, Thoughtful Fantasy
","This movie has effectively reinvigorated my love of Japanese animation. Up until I was 10 or 11, I found a lot of enjoyment in shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, like many other children my age. I also really enjoyed staying up late and watching some of the darker, more violent animes on TV like Inuyasha, Gundam and Bleach (despite not understanding the plots sometimes).For the next 7 years, I didn't watch any anime. I blame that on my peers in middle school who liked to make fun of people who watched it (and, as a result, I also blame my own self-consciousness). Though I've never returned to any of the shows I mentioned before since I have outgrown some of them (with the exception of the Pokemon video games), Princess Mononoke has kindled a new flame for me; I want to watch anime again.There isn't a single element of the film that Miyazaki and his animation team haven't poured their hearts and souls into. The characters and environments breathe on the screen, and the historical Japanese setting- especially the most significant forest in the film- is on par with any fantastical world that I've ever immersed myself in, including the likes of Middle-Earth and the Star Wars universe.The plot is fantasy, but it is laced with metaphors and philosophical themes, such as a rather vengeful form of environmental awareness... perhaps it's best to refer to it simply as 'environmental revenge'. Iron Town is particularly interesting, since its goals are fundamentally opposed to those of the forest spirits, yet its residents are not unkind, or driven by any form of manifest destiny (for the most part); in fact, it would be unreasonable to refer to any character in this film as an antagonist. Everyone's motives are justified one way or another.The voice acting is quite literally of Hollywood quality, unlike most English-dubbed anime productions. Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson and Minnie Driver sound much more fluid and natural than the sometimes stale offerings on an average anime TV show. There are hiccups on rare occasions, but they are swiftly forgotten and forgiven.Above all else, Princess Mononoke leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. It has inspired me to watch the rest of Miyazaki's work, and if you're wanting to introduce yourself to the anime genre, this is the way to do it.",10,0,1,12 January 2014
