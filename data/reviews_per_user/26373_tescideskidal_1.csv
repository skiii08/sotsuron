Ford v Ferrari," I LOVED IT
","A friend asked me to go see it and I hadn't heard of it or knew what is was but I watched the trailer and thought, 'sure' WOW what a movie. Bale and Damon were perfection in their roles. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I know nothing about racing. I had no idea anything like Le Mans existed.I hate how ken was treated but I loved what he did. He seemed like he was an amazing man, driver and engineer!! Ford owes him and Shelby everything!!",10,2,2,17 February 2020
