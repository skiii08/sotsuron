Black Swan," Reviews are only opinions, everybody has one
","Aronofski is batting .500, as far as I'm concerned, so I wanted to give him another chance. Loved 'The Wrestler', liked 'Requiem' didn't care for 'pi' hated 'The Fountain'. All four were psychological dramas in their own ways. After all of the Top 10 lists and reviews I was looking forward to this film. The review on IMDb said 'The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again.' Completely the opposite, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over and 3/4 of a nearly full theater left when it went to white before the credits started. I appreciate independent art films, I have seen many. Although Natalie Portman was exceptional and will probably win the Oscar my review would be 'this may be the worst movie I have ever seen'. 'Showgirls' is now a close second, at least it didn't try to pass itself off as art. I'm not comparing the two because of the lesbian overtones but because they were both possibly the worst films ever made. It isn't a comparison for the 'dancing' either.",2,19,62,1 January 2011
