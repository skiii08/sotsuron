Your Name.," Best Anime-Movie Ever!
","* SPOILER-FREE *Slowly but sure, the dynamics of the experience sharpened the sword- skills that be able to ruthlessly killing the starving hunters of perfect work. And Makoto Shinkai, at this point, has managed to slaughter millions of hunters who thrashed it.As one of the hunters who are hungry for perfect anime works, I died in peace after finished watching this latest masterpiece of Shinkai.Plots were served really wild rampage, breaking all models story line continues to guide the filmmaker. Characters are formed is extremely interesting. You never thought that this film has a very abstract antagonists. In addition, the value of Japanese culture and the uniqueness of Makoto Shinkai, a flavor that could not escape from view.In terms of story, you will never find a beautiful story line 'Your Name' (Kimi no Na Wa). When you follow a minimum of one work of Makoto Shinkai before 'Kimi no Na Wa' was created, as Byosoku (5 cm per second) or Kotonoha no Niwa (Garden of Words), then you will cry in silence because Makoto Shinkai managed to dribble the fans up to high point of suffering (if you know what I mean). It's like orgasm.In this film, you will be escorted into the recesses of nostalgia, even there are some scenes that explicitly have a template nostalgic with old work.Every second has a tremendous message payload in; served perfectly in its pictures, music, and soft-narration.Although the drama-animation genre became the main theme, science- fiction, even comedy to thriller was also embedded in this film. You can be out loud, tense, to tears.Shinkai-Sensei managed to ward off the stigma of anime that I would never be able to compete with classmates animated Pixar, Disney or Dreamworks. Even for me, this work surpasses them all!When this movie is over, my tears did not stop flowing. Life had stopped for a moment. My heart stopped right when the lights of auditorium was reached my face. Makoto Shinkai managed to tear my anxiety to rubble due to the work of the loveliest peace on earth.Well-played Makoto Shinkai. Hats-off. You are the best idea-creator in this world.",10,4,7,21 December 2016
