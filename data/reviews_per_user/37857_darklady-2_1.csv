Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace -- The movie to see if you want to see an excellent, fast moving movie.
","As a fan of Star Wars, I have to say that the movie was excellent. The graphics were simply amazing. The sound effects were mind boggling. It goes right along with the original trilogy. I can't wait until George Lucas releases Episode 2 in 2002. I would recommend this movie to you even if you were not a science fiction fan. The Phantom Menace is the movie to see if you just want to see an excellent movie. George Lucas and his entire crew did an excellent job. 'May the force be with you.'",10,5,7,26 July 1999
