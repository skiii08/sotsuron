The Benchwarmers," Terrible coordination skills, excellent movie!
","This movie has you constantly laughing throughout the whole film. It is unbelievably hilarious, and, honestly, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's full of incredibly funny suggestive jokes, bathroom humor, and slapstick sports violence. I could not stop myself from laughing for almost the entire movie. I'm finding it extremely hard to believe that this didn't turn out good. Even the bad language leaves you laughing out loud. You'll probably even spend a few scenes laughing at certain jokes. There isn't one guy I know who doesn't believe it's very successful. You've got to see this! Oh, and trust me, you definitely shouldn't count on being disappointed!",8,0,1,1 January 2007
Home Alone," Strangely disappointing
","I had expected this to be quite a decent film. However, it only turned out to be alright. This is because I found Kevin to be a huge weirdo. He screams louder than anyone in any movie or in real life that I've ever seen scream. He also appears to be very strange, like when he asks if the toothbrush he purchases is approved by the American Dental Asscosiation, or when he runs in fear extremely loudly away from Old Man Marley. However, the pranks he pulls on the idiodic burglars are what made this movie okay, as well as when he scares away the pizza man by playing the voice of the man in the R rated movie. Who knows? You might love it. Watch it if ya want. I can't do nothing' to stop ya.",6,0,3,1 January 2007
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Outrageously hilarious, beats the first one badly!
","In my review for the first movie, I made it clear that I had thought Kevin's personality sort of affected my rating of the movie. As he returns in this sequel, not many things have changed about him, but there's just something about this movie that made it so much better, and I'm sure that I probably won't ever figure out what. Whatever it was that made the improvement, I'm happy it is a part of the film. Plus, the pranks he pulls on the burglars are even better this time, and I found myself laughing pretty much the whole time the robbers were getting beaten. I'd count on this movie being quite a success if I were you.",7,0,1,1 January 2007
Bruce Almighty," Almighty Bruce, almighty movie
","Once again, Jim Carrey is a success in another hilarious comedy. While Carrey's character in this film is a little less goofy than most of his parts in other movies, he still has a great way of creating crazily funny humor. I'd have to say the potty jokes are the funniest of them, but they are only one of the many different types of great comedy that helped pull this movie off. Many people, for some reason, have been disappointed by this movie. Well, I find that very ridiculous, to tell ya the truth. It's yet another well done comedy by the one and only great Jim Carrey, whose comedy movies will always be a success to me. Nice job, Carrey!",7,0,2,1 January 2007
