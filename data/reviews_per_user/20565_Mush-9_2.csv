Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh dear, oh dear
","This film really deserved to do as badly as possible. Phantom Menace is style over substance, with a script as weak as over diluted tea.  The story is pathetic, the actors woefully miscast and the computer characters are annoying and a really bad idea -  a really bad idea.The film's idea is good, but in practise it just does not work. Sorry Mr Lucas, but you have made a cold turkey.",Null,0,1,24 May 1999
American History X," Its not right, but its okay
","On the very front of it, AMX is a typical American sloshy film about how even racists can suddenly become reformed characters. That idea stinks. Hollywood seems to always do this; the strongest storylines have to always end up with the bad guy reformed or the good guy winning.AMX is not that bad, it does hit chords.  But the overall feeling is that while the punch is hard, there is no wound.  And that's a problem.",Null,0,0,29 March 1999
