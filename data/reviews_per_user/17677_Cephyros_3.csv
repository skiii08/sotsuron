Minority Report," Ooo what a stinker! I want my money back.
","Honestly, I want my money back. The full 15Â€. Yes, I made the mistake of taking my date to this... film. The premise is old. Really old. A cop who lost his family and who is being framed. Been there, done that.Some parts of the movie are so illogical they make your brain hurt (see SPOILERS). The whole oracle thing is a poor idea (probably inspired by AKIRA). The Pre-cogs are living, thinking human beings kept in nutrient solution (why?), drugged all day (and this is not a human rights problem)?? And they can predict the future... wait, only murders. And seemingly they can forsee only murders to be committed in Washington DC (this is where the experiment is being conducted). Why the heck? Then again, apparently there is no other crime but murder- at least we see no normal police during the whole movie.The Precrime Police imprison people for crimes not yet comitted. This is really the best part (sarcasm alert): The would-be-criminals (read: still innocent people) are stored in some sort of stasis- indefinitely. And there is no chance of rehabilitation. Demolition Man, anyone?Somehow this movie feels like being based upon a cheap 1950s scifi short story written by a hack with the usual Hollywood-ending added later on. Reminds me of the Hollywood-ending which was added to Bladerunner...Final Verdict: Don't waste your money on it like I did.
SPOILERS (aka. plotholes)
John Anderton does not kill Leo Crow, Crow basically kills himself. So why do the Pre-cogs predict it?Lamar Burgess does not kill John Anderton. Why do the Pre-cogs predict it?Allow me two last questions: After having escaped, why doesn't John simply walk away (thus altering the future and making his arrest impossible)? And why does John confront Burgess even AFTER his name is cleared- does he want to be killed after all he went trough??",Null,0,0,15 November 2002
Blade II," This movie has no style.
","All the dark atmosphere and stylish music, the way Blade was portrayed, the cool villain- in short all that was cool and fun in the first movie is sadly missing from this one. The lack of character-development and story is substituted with lots of unnecessary gore and continuous action (but none of the fight-scenes are anywhere near as good as in first one!!). What a waste of time and money.All those positive reviews here can mean only two things: Either the makers of Blade II are abusing IMDB to promote this poor sequel, or after years of being fed mass-produced Hollywood-crap the majority of reviewers here have completely lost their sense of taste.",1,13,27,8 April 2004
Cast Away," This movie sux. It sux and sux and sux...
","It sux for 143 minutes. That is awfully long for a boring Robinson Crusoe rip-off minus Friday (who made a boring novel a little less boring) plus permanent Fed EX product-placement. Much too long. Precisely 142 minutes and 40 seconds too long. Yes, this movie is actually the longest commercial known to man.I wonder if Tom Hanks plans to star in tearjerkers for the rest of his career...But even more I wonder how much longer audiences are going to fall for this kind of mass produced crap.Hollywood, I loathe thee!",2,1,7,20 August 2002
