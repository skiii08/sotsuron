Black Swan," Beyond the metaphors
","Egocentric but amazing ballet teacher Thomas Leroy 'cursed' young and fragile ballerina Nina Sayers into secret depths of her own soul, to find her dark, sensuous and self destructive 'I', which is needed for dancing Odille, the Black Swan in Tschaikovsky's Swan Lake. Numerous personifications, symbols and metaphors in this movie (tuning into black or white colors, the mirrors, Nina's hallucinations, turning into a Swan...) are just telling the story about how fragile can be human's psyche in unstable world like ballet scene is.This is destructive journey into the soul of a young ballerina, who (I believe because she never known something more valuable than her work and her desire for perfection, and that's all she has now) decides to give up everything for perfection. And what is the price? You will see...Nina's character and her change throughout movie is perfectly plotted. For example: at the beginning of the movie she wears mostly white/rosy clothes, but more the movie's coming to the end - she is turning 'more black', it is a sign that her destructive 'I', her psychological disorder showed up and dominated her. Her neurotic mother literally tied her as the way SHE wanted, created from her, at first sight, the perfect, fragile, decent girl, who hides inside the hurricane of repressed sexual desires and feelings of insecurity (that's why Nina's scratches herself, that's why she needs to be perfect, that's why she is obsessed with it - because that's the only thing that she is good in, that she can feel passionate about - without any feeling of guilt), which are put in the light, while she embraces the Black Swan's character. Then - the mirrors creates almost active part of the movie - they don't only complements the scenes, but also tells the story - in every scene there is a mirror or reflecting surface - except one scene - when Nina dances Black Swan. It is not accident, it is intention - Nina is watching into the mirrors, into her soul, while her reflection is often doing something else she does. Her reflection is her dark alter ego, getting out of the hidden place, getting our of the mirror - to completely dominate her. Before the conclusion, everybody unconsciously knows, how it's going to end. Maybe you didn't like Nina's character, so you didn't feel sorry for her at all. But for me, the ending was really touching. What more to say about this movie? Well, it's beautifully shot, well directed, well played, the screenplay is brilliant, as is the music and the composition. This is not commercial movie, but it's also not one of those 'too artistic films' that's nobody really gets... I can call this real art (I mean real audiovisual, smart at storytelling art which are movies meant to be) for wide range of people. And, oh, it's Natalie Portman life's role, Darren Aronofsky's best film, best movie of 2010... and my second favorite. The last note - if you don't like heavy psychological thrillers with self - destructive main characters, better don't watch it. But if you like it - you definitely should watch Black Swan. It's, at least for me, perfect movie.",10,2,5,26 December 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," It really surprised me.
","First of all, I'm not a Twilight fan, and I'm not a Twilight hater. I'm just someone, who really likes movies, and enjoys the fantasy.This movie is not perfect, and it's not even original by its story, but I have to tell you - it is damn good shot, it has nice visuals, beautiful music, quite amazing screenplay's ideas, great actors in the minor roles and some surprise moments. Also, it is not so flat as the other Twilight movies, it's not even unintentionally funny, it has some kind of great action and amazing performance of some actors (espesially demonic, mad Michael Sheen as Aro, likable, sweet Lee Pace as Garett, evil Dakota Fanning as Jane, nice Raimi Malek as Benjamin and lovely Mackenzie Foy as young Renesmee). Now, let's talk about major trio of actors. At first, Kristen Stewart did a great job, while she is not human anymore, but fast, strong, self-confident vampire. She does not stutter, gasp etc. (I hated her Bella because of it), she looks really sexy and is very likable in the role of a mother. Robert Pattinson's Edward is like usual, but the role of a protective dad really fits him, too. (Especially I remember that moment, when SPOILER Aro snapped Carlisle's head and Edward started to run with mix of total anger and fear in his face. SPOILER) Taylor Lautner and the other werewolves (in their's human appearance) are irritating as usual, act so bad as always. But, all the average acting overshadows Michael Sheen's Aro. Long time ago I didn't see such a villain in the movie. OK, let's move to the story. It's actually very simple. Movie starts with Bella as a newborn vampire, seeing Edward. They go to hunt, Bella overcome her thirst for a human blood and drinks from a puma instead. Then she meets Jacob, all the family and finally her daughter, Renesmee. After that she is experiencing her new vampire life, have sex with Edward (I would say that this sexual scene is more bold than in the BD part 1), meets her dad Charlie, beats Emett in arm-wrestling, worries about Renesmee's fast growth, enjoys nice family moments. But, her happiness is not everlasting, when vampire Irina sees her and Renesmee, thinks that Renesmee is immortal child (small child turned into a vampire, needs to be destroyed by Volruti because of lack of self-control) and goes to tell about it to Volturi. After that the more interesting part of film begins. Cullen's try to gather vampire friends all over the world to witness, that Renesmee is not dangerous, we meet lots of new vampires, as they are preparing to fight, because it is more than clear, that Aro wants more, than a justice. So the 'good vampires' and 'bad vampires' meets on the ice field, ready to fight... And I have to tell you, that the final battle is really intense and it's nice to see that kind of action in Twilight movie. This part of Twilight saga is less romantic than the others. We have there some romantic scene with major couple, but the story is more oriented on the other things. Finally, it really says something about love, friendship, family and loyalty. Also, it has humor and fun, as intense fighting scenes and action, too.Music is another big positive, as is the costumes and BEAUTIFUL nature, in which is movie shot. And, I really mean it, the titles at the beginning of the movie are MAGNIFICENT and literally perfect. But, I have to say it - the tricks are in some scenes really poor, for example small Renesmee. The baby looks really creepy. I would also be more happy with longer fight scenes, but I'm not going to be that bad. It's Twilight. It is fantasy romance, and in this one is pretty nice action and FINALLY story about SOMETHING, with understandable, logical acts of characters. If you are Twilight fan, you would be pleased. If you are Twilight hater, you would dislike it, as usual. And if you are neutral as I'm, maybe, you would like it and enjoy this journey to the unrealistic vampire fantasy world about romantic love, strength of family, loyalty of friendship and power of old evil. Btw, I say it once again, Michael Sheen was PERFECT.",7,2,8,23 November 2012
