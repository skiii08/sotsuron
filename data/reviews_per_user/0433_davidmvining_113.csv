The Rock," San Francisco goes boom
","One of the reasons this movie works so well is the complete commitment to the reality of the film from the actors. From the main three actors to every marine, SEAL, and FBI agent, every actor is 100% committed to the story of a deranged marine general stealing chemical weapons and threatening San Francisco. The style is hyperactive, the music is pounding and propulsive, and the action moves at a high paced clip from beginning to end, almost never slowing down to breathe, but through it all, Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris sell their characters fully. It provides us with the emotional grounding that we can hang onto through all the insanity that surrounds it.Ed Harris' General Hummel is a really good antagonist. I mean, really good. He's driven by an injustice that he sells to the audience really well. Men under his command, doing illegal missions for the US government, were left to die in the field and their families told nothing while given no benefits. Men he was in charge of and forced to watch twist in the wind to no purpose. His rage, sold by Harris, is palpable, but Harris doesn't overplay it. It's the contained rage of a man who's been fighting battles for his whole life. It's the focused rage of a man who knows how to make a plan and follow through. It's the dedicated rage of a man with resolve. When he and his men storm into a naval base under the guise of an inspection and walk away with fifteen VX gas rockets, we see a man of honor taken to the extreme.On the other end is Stanley Goodspeed. He's a chemical weapons freak who leads a boring life. He drives a Volvo, a beige one. Our introduction to him is watching him use a toy gun to start a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with a hula statue consumed in flames. He's also thrown into a glass room where he has to deactivate a sarin gas bomb against a ticking clock showing how in control he is in a stressful situation involving his area of expertise. It was almost a lab experiment, though. The only people around him he ignored or shoved away in order to work. He was given the weapon to defuse, he didn't have to go out and find it.The third main character is James Patrick Mason, Sean Connery's character. He's a British Intelligence operative who's been in the American prison system for over thirty years, escaping from two maximum security prisons along the way, including Alcatraz where General Hummel has set up operations. I like the little theory that Mason is an alternate universe version of James Bond. It's amusing.Anyway, getting Goodspeed and Mason to the Rock involves a car chase through San Francisco (with plenty of destruction) and an underwater incursion into the bowels of the former prison. It's slick, frantic, and done with good humor to help balance out the destruction. The pair soon find themselves alone on the island against a bunch of marines when the SEALs providing them support walk into an ambush and all die.And that's when the movie distills down to a conflict between three people. General Hummel is trying to smoke out the two last members of the incursion team while Goodspeed is focused solely on the deadly chemical primed to shoot and Mason is more concerned with finding a way to escape everything at last. It's that dynamic that really drives the film up to its exciting, explosion filled conclusion, but the movie makes its one serious mistake in order to extend the movie to its final fight.Hummel has brought a cadre of marines with him. He knows most of them, but not all, represented by two captains, Frye and Darrow. Why a general with decades of combat experience couldn't find a full team that supports him (I'm think of Marco Ramius and his officers in The Hunt for Red October) escapes me, but on top of that, the second they show up on screen it's obvious that they are psychopaths with no interest in the point of the mission. They stick out sorely, and they are there because Hummel is a man of honor and a soldier and not a murderer, so once he flinches in the final act, the threat of deadly force on the city disappears. It has to be replaced with something outside of Hummel, and they chose cartoon characters. I can imagine other ways to extend the threat beyond Hummel (having one marine who believes in the mission, doesn't care about the money, and decides that the lives of the civilians of San Francisco are less worthy than the memory of his fallen comrades), but they didn't go with that. I really want this movie to be a solid fifteen minutes longer (on an already kind of long two hour and fifteen minute runtime) in order to build up this new character I've just made up in my head and sell the final turn better.The action is frantic but clear. The movie clips along breezily as it destroyed half of San Francisco. The actors are all shockingly good in characters that all feel surprisingly believable. All of it revolves around a bad guy with a strong motive. Really, aside from Captains Frye and Darrow, this is just propulsive action filmmaking at its finest.",8,0,0,12 May 2020
The Avengers," This is the most cohesive film version of a manchild playing with his action figures I've ever seen.
","It reminds me of Van Helsing, but better.The tesseract, the blue box MacGuffin from Captain America has awoken and called out to the cosmos. SHIELD, the organization tasked with protecting Earth and is experimenting with the tesseract, begins an evacuation as the little box becomes more active. Arrives Loki, slightly grungier and less interesting than we last saw him in Thor, is there to conquer. Telling Earthlings that we were made to be ruled and that freedom is a lie. It saddened me to see Loki, the made driven by a surprisingly complex combination of jealousy, anger, and ambition in his previous appearance relegated to generic bad guy, but oh well. The point of this movie isn't the conflict between antagonist and protagonist. The point is to get a bunch of protagonists together, struggle to work as a team, and then decide to work together as a team against a bigger threat.That team is, of course, all of the heroes we've met over the last few movies. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk are joined by some smaller players like Black Widow and Hawkeye. The movie begins in a place where almost none of them have any previous relationship to each other, and the most fun from the film is the different heroes figuring out who the others are. Most have heard of Captain America, but he's still finding his feet and has an impression of Iron Man that's pretty accurate if a bit incomplete (impulsive and reckless without noting the heart of gold). Thor shows up and knows no one, only there to grab Loki, so the two Earthlings Iron Man and Captain America have a mutual beat down with Thor over who gets ownership of the captured Loki, drawing a stalemate. Hulk is brought along in his Bruce Banner disguise to help track the tesseract because it has a gamma signature and Banner is the best at tracking gamma rays.Loki does his best Joker impression and intentionally gets captured so he can try to implode the team arraying against him from the inside. He knows of Hulk (supposedly because he started the movie by infiltrating SHIELD and gaining a few insiders through magical mind powers) and wants him to become the big green rage monster and cause destruction. It's not the worst plan in the world, but it's not great either. What it actually is is an excuse to get all of the Marvel heroes into a room and on one side of a larger conflict.What helps the movie most is its balance of tone. It never gets too serious, keeping things light with quippy dialogue, conflicts between the heroes that never really turn too sour, and a death that's used for its dramatic purpose before being forgotten quickly enough to not color the rest of the film.The action of the film is brightly lit and cleanly filmed. The fight between Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor in the forest at night (as Loki sits and watches) moves around dynamically but never becomes confusing. We understand geography easily and the introduction of Captain America later in the fight is handled with ease. The real bright spot in the film, action-wise, is the battle in New York.With six heroes, one main antagonist, and a disposable CGI army, the film keeps the separate lines of action incredibly clear. Distinctly different locations (from a street to the top of Stark Tower to the top of another, clearly different, building to flying through the air), the film is able to make the visuals immediately communicate where the action is happening and who is involved, creating a marvelous sense of geography in such a large place of chaos. There is a long take late in the fight that passes from one hero to the next, and the amazing thing isn't the special effects, but the fact that it's more of an underline of who is where and not a clarifying moment. The conflict ends with the annoying 'We're all done now, bye!' chestnut.Ultimately, though, while the experience is fun, I think the less interesting version of Loki as antagonist combined with the fact that the movie seems to have nothing to say beyond the facile idea of 'good guys need to work together' keeps it from being anything more than an entertaining rollercoaster. Of course, the real goal was to entertain, and I think it does largely succeed.",7,0,0,25 November 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A completely emotionally satisfying work
","Much like The Lord of the Rings and Manon des Sources, Kill Bill was a large movie shot at one time and released in separate parts.It is amazing that over the course of a single movie, Tarantino turned himself into one of the premier action directors of his generation. The most action-oriented scene he had ever shot before this was probably Mr. White hitting Mr. Pink to the floor in Reservoir Dogs. Then, he brings us Showdown at House of Blue Leaves which is one of the most inventive action tour de forces in modern movie making. One thing Tarantino is, certainly, is a student of film, and it is obvious that he did his homework before he conceived of, planned, executed, and edited together that masterpiece of action cinema.The movie around it is great too.This is Tarantino's epic. This is his most sprawling film with a depth of emotion he rarely ever reaches for. The core of the film is The Bride, Uma Thurman's ex-assassin left for dead by her former boss and lover out for bloody vengeance. She's believably tough, angry, scared, and vulnerable at different times. When she cuts through the Crazy 88 at the House of Blue Leaves, we're not only willing to believe that she can do it (complete with stylistic flourishes like wire-fu that enhances the action into some kind of super-reality), but we're also invested in her journey. The key to that investment is, like with most Tarantino films, the film's structure.The first half of the film is frontloaded with the outer veneer of the conflict that really touches on the most basic of emotions driving The Bride. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and when she decided to leave, their leader (and her lover), Bill, took it badly and had her killed. She doesn't quite die, wakes up four years later from a coma to find the baby she had yet to deliver gone, and her legs atrophied to nothing. She wills herself back to functional and begins her quest for revenge. We see her second target to start the film, Vernita Green, who functions as a small and darkly comic introduction to the nature of the conflict. The biggest first fight is the first chronologically, O-ren Ishii.We get O-ren's backstory, which functions not only to tell us the particulars of the young woman's meteoric rise to power within the Japanese underworld, but also as a proxy for the other members of the Squad. We hear very little backstory of the rest of the gang, but we hear O-ren's background in great detail (complete with a full animated sequence). I think that's to give us enough detail to understand O-ren and to also understand that the other members of the squad have similar backgrounds and are similarly deadly, by implication.We then get that fantastic action sequence. One of the few things I understand about building an extended action sequence is that you can't get boring by doing the same thing repeatedly. You have to have variations, complications, and a story within it. That's exactly what the Showdown delivers. We have different characters that feel distinct (especially the young madwoman, Gogo). We have a progression and escalation of the conflict, and we finally get to a full resolution as The Bride lords over her victims, demanding their lost body parts as her property. It's such a virtuoso demonstration of ability at the service of story. I even love the turn to black and white (which was done for the American version to receive an R-rating, it was released in color around the rest of the world). It gains a certain old-school feel that meshes well with the music choices over the visuals, though I imagine that if Tarantino had known he was going to have to release it like that, he might have made different film stock and lighting choices.The second part begins in much the same way as the first, with a prologue that essentially tells the audience that The Bride is going to survive until late in the coming action. With Tarantino, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and he's there to make the journey as entertaining as possible.The Bride, fresh from taking out O-ren and Vernita, heads to the American southwest and Budd, Bill's brother and number three on her list. The portrait of Budd that Tarantino draws is so wonderful. He was like the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, but he's fallen very far. He's hawked a priceless sword and works as a bouncer in a far from busy strip club, receiving nothing but disdain from his boss and doing the dirtiest jobs in the place. But, he has lost none of his ruthlessness, as The Bride discovers when she shows up at his trailer and tries to take him by surprise.I love the Showdown at House of Blue Leaves, but I think Budd burying The Bride alive might be the best sensationalistic scene of the film. It's claustrophobic (enhanced by Tarantino beginning the sequence in 1.33:1 instead of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio he had used through the whole film), tense, and Budd demonstrates an easy willingness to cause severe pain on The Bride. Budd's final words of the sequence ('This is for breaking my brother's heart.') is so pitch perfect, and then we have one long shot, mostly in complete darkness, as the heavy and jarring sound of dirt crashing against the wooden casket The Bride has been nailed into shoots through the soundtrack.Tarantino then jumps backwards in time to one of the earliest events in the film's chronology, The Bride's training with Pai-Mei, the ancient Chinese kung fu master. It's a highly entertaining sequence that shows The Bride's transition from girlish waif to hardened killer, and it's placed right here in order to provide the most emotionally satisfying conclusion to the burial. Watching The Bride get buried, we have no hope, but learning that part of her training could help (and obviously does help) her escape her prison is emotionally satisfying. Placing that training sequence far earlier would put it 3 hours before the burial, and I think it would have diminished the impact of the sequence's emotional delivery.Anyway, the fights of the film continue to get smaller. Budd gets killed by Elle, the final member of the squad and The Bride's replacement (both Elle and The Bride are blonde with blue eyes, and Elle has obviously become Bill's lover). The Bride, still covered in dirt from her escape, shows up at Budd's trailer and the two have a fight in the dirty confines of Budd's living space. Spittoons are thrown. TV antennae are used as makeshift swords. Walls are torn apart. An eye gets pulled from its socket and stepped on. The Bride makes off, ready to make her final confrontation with Bill.When she does arrive, she finds that her daughter is still alive and the movie's plot stops. The story doesn't stop, it keeps on headfirst, but the plot of killing Bill comes to a complete halt for about half an hour, and it's a great half an hour. Bill, obviously remorseful for what he had done to The Bride, has raised their daughter, B.B., as well as he could, and she's a cute little four-year-old. The Bride gets to know her daughter and puts her to bed before Bill and The Bride have their first scene together since the wedding (rehearsal) massacre. It's a raw scene of condemnation and hatred. It's such a great scene that reveals the depths of the hatred and love the two shared for each other.And once again, the fight gets smaller. I've read that the beach fight that Bill proposes was actually Tarantino's plan, and if he had filmed it, I'm sure it would have looked fantastic. However, I find something really satisfying about the final fight lasting roughly five seconds and done entirely while sitting in chairs across a table. It's intimate and about the characters, not the flashy choreography. Everything 'fun' about the genre has been stripped away by the time The Bride gets to Bill's hacienda. It probably shouldn't come back at that point.I love this film completely. It's probably Tarantino's most satisfying work emotionally. It has a breadth and depth that is kind of shocking. He became an excellent action director. His dialogue is as fun as ever. He pushed himself to become more, forcing himself to take on tasks that he had never done before, and he excelled at them. This is a triumph for Tarantino.",10,1,3,25 November 2019
First Man," Very good
","First Man's director, Damien Chazelle, thought that Neil Armstrong's story would fit in well into the thriller genre, and I don't think he was wrong at all. But, there's something else that Chazelle brings to the film that heightens the experience in an unexpected way. The tangible sense of absolute terror at the vastness of space infuses the action with such an enhanced sense of extreme and existential fear that takes the sensation onto another sensory level.It's the story of a man so wholly dedicated to his career and the task of getting to the moon, filmed entirely in a way that feels like the audience is along for the ride. Armstrong is quiet, though. He's driven and seems to have receded into himself in the face of his daughter's death. It's this death that really frames the film, and I feel like it's the only real flaw. The movie seems to imply that the girl's death was the incentive and source of Neil's drive to reach the moon, capping with him dropping the girl's bracelet onto the lunar surface. It feels so facile as a motive for such a monumental personal task. The little girl's ghost appears in flashes of Neil's vision here and there throughout the film, and it does seem to be the source of his laser-like focus on the task at hand. Perhaps it's based on reality (I wouldn't know), but it just seems so reductive and implausible.However, moving on from that, the movie's really well assembled both from a character point of view and from a visceral perspective. I've read that the movie is the story of the exciting Neil and his boring wife Janet, but I would argue that it's just the story of Neil with Janet used as a contrasting device (a well built, rounded, character nonetheless) who demonstrates what Neil is leaving behind by going to the stars. They contrast really well. Neil is reserved and quiet, hardly showing any emotion and personifying the professional, and Janet has big, expressive eyes and is ready to speak her mind to whomever needs to hear it.The sequence that contrasts them best dramatically is what is probably the best part of the film, Neil's Gemini mission. The mission goes well, hitting its main objectives (the first connect between two vessels in orbit), but something goes wrong. There's a mechanical failure that sends the linked vessels into an uncontrollable spin. We see the sequence from two points of view, Neil's and Janet's. Neil is trapped in his small capsule with only small views of the outside world spinning, and we share that perspective, feeling the terror as things go wrong against the empty void of outer space. Against that, we see Janet, listening to the little white box that pipes in the chatter from NASA as things go wrong. She's trying to balance life with her children while taking some small part in her husband's life, but when things go wrong and the audio gets cut by NASA, she's powerless and frantic. She needs to know what's happening to Neil, and no one will tell her. They're truly separated at that moment, Neil alone and near death in space while Janet can't find out anything below. It's a great sequence that contrasts the two halves of Neil's life.The capstone of the film is the landing of Apollo 11 on the moon, of course, and it's handled with the same sense of tension as the Gemini sequence. The landing is terrifying, as alarms blare and everything moves faster than one might expect from the grainy footage we've lived with for decades. It's exciting and the culmination of the film's promise, both personal and in terms of plot, creating a fantastic finale that, I feel, gets slightly undermined by the dropping of the bracelet. I know it provides an emotional framework for the large task Armstrong put himself through, but I just can't get past the feeling that it's facile and too easy.The movie, by capturing everything so tightly from Armstrong's perspective, creates an incredible sense of tension. Combined with the super-realistic take on space travel, it lends a sense of real terror to the dangers of traveling through the void. Contrasting that is the emotional reality that grounds the film most exemplified by the use of Neil's wife, Janet. It's a very good entertainment with intensely gripping passages.",8,1,1,17 January 2020
Alien 3," A perfect example of doing a sequel wrong
","Where Aliens was one of the great examples of how to do a sequel right, Alien 3 is one of the great examples of how to do a sequel wrong. It's an interesting case study in contrasts, thinking of the two films side by side, but even then, alone, Alien 3 is a broken film with several visions competing against each other, undermining everything, and producing a rather miserable experience overall.It seems trite, but the first two Alien films were about family. The first film was about the dissolution of a family, and the second was about the assembling of another. The second film left our new family in a prime position to face a new adventure, but the very first thing Alien 3 does is kill off three of the four surviving characters. That is a bad move and a great example of how to do a sequel wrong. The array of writers, producers, and directors had ended with a product that could see no attributes of the previous films other than the presence of a particular actress. Ignoring a strong foundation for future character developments, the movie settled with Sigourney Weaver.They even went the wrong direction in terms of the horror. The second movie upped the ante on the horror from the first. This third movie draws it way down. We get one alien again, so it feels small in comparison to the second. And, because the movie is thematically incoherent, there's no real sense of what kind of horror the movie is trying to establish other than some thin visceral action based horror, but that doesn't match with the smaller threat the single alien represents. We do get a repeated motif of an outside entity breaking up an established 'family' of sorts, but Ripley herself is outside of that family and never becomes part of it, but she's our main character. So is she the terror herself? This never gets brought up or sorted out, and we just end up with a creature feature and blood instead. It's just not nearly as interesting as the first two in terms of the nature of the horror at play.I will say this, though, the opening credit sequence is probably the best part of the whole movie. In between starfields with the credits we get quick cuts onboard the Sulako, catching the audience up to the incidents that lead to Ripley finding herself crashed and the only survivor on Fiorina 161, a prison planet. The music is just right. The quick cuts elicit a stark mood. Everything is really nicely lit. It's just too bad that it's in service to a terrible idea.Anyway, Ripley finds herself as the only female amongst twenty-five residents of this convict planet (landing so close to their little colony was quite lucky of her). The movie very slowly meanders from one scene to another for an hour as we learn about the colony, the weird mixture of criminals and religious zealots that inhabit it, and we watch a facehugger attack a dog. Now, this movie has some logistical problems that just help make it seem completely nonsensical. The facehugger is the first of them. Based on what we know, a facehugger will die after it implants its egg in a host. The opening sequence reveals only one egg, and we find out later that Ripley was impregnated while she slept. There's never another facehugger found, just the one that attacks the dog. So...are they able to impregnate twice now?Whatever. We also find out the backstory of Clemens, a non-convict/ex-convict/medical officer with a penchant for not telling his backstory until halfway through the movie and right before a xenomorph punctures his head. It's honestly not that interesting a backstory to begin with, and the long wait to actually get to it doesn't help things. It also doesn't help things that Ripley spends a solid hour finding out information that we've known since the first three minutes of the film, namely that a facehugger was on the Sulako and impregnated her (it was a safe assumption, that last part). So, the first hour is Ripley being depressed, Newt's autopsy, an alien growing, and a bunch of convicts, all but a couple of which won't matter later.The second half of the film, after Ripley finally figures out that a xenomorph is running around, is even more frustrating. We have two separate sequences of the convicts readying traps for the alien. The first ends almost hilariously when the alien bites someone's head off which leads to a flare dropping and lighting an entire tunnel system on fire. The second sequence is completely incomprehensible. It involves another tunnel system that's supposed to lead to a space that will force the alien into a large iron mold where they will douse it with liquid iron. This entire chase is completely unintelligible. There's absolutely no sense of geography, so we don't know where people are running from or where they are running towards. We don't know how many doors need to get shut, and, to top it all off, we're mostly following characters we don't know and don't care about. Yeah, the xenomorph's perspective shots are kind of neat and fluid as they spin around the small tunnels in pursuit, but that's not nearly enough to make up for the fact that there are so many rules about how to make this plan work and the movie never bothers to even try and explain any of them.Then, the company shows up, promising to save Ripley and kill the alien growing in her chest. She makes the first smart decision of the movie by anyone and refuses to believe them, throwing herself in the furnace, killing herself and her baby. This also raises another question. None of the other movies were ever that clear on the alien's gestational period in a host, but there are two aliens that grow within characters in this movie, the one in Ripley and the one in the dog. The one in the dog is implanted long after Ripley's was implanted and comes out long before Ripley's comes out. This is never explained (though I guess some kind of 'it's a queen' logic might fill in that gap). Still, it feels arbitrary rather than intentional.The movie's core problem really is, though, that it's a conflict of visions. The story behind the making of this film is far more interesting than the film itself, which is mostly just kind of boring and frustrating. Long story short: the studio had no idea how to follow up Aliens, and they could never hire either Cameron or Scott to come back. They went through a few creatives before settling on Vincent Ward, an Australian director, who had a wild idea of this wooden world populated by monks in space that Ripley lands on. The studio was excited by it for a while before they pulled away from the wooden world idea, and the monks, and replaced it with a prison colony and convicts. The problem is they never really rewrote the script completely, so the end result has all of this religious talk that never really fits and never goes anywhere. The ideas clash horribly, and David Fincher was caught in the middle. Hired as the kind of director the studio can push around, he was endlessly abused by 20th Century Fox until he completed his work on the movie and washed his hands clean of it.That's not to say that the movie is completely without worth. Weaver isn't great in this because Ripley doesn't have a whole lot to do, but I do like Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton as two of the residents of the convict planet. The aforementioned alien perspective shots are fun, and I really like how they recalled a little bit of the previous movies and made the alien impervious to adverse elemental conditions, manifested by it being able to survive the molten hot lead. Killing the alien covered with the hot lead by quickly cooling it with water is a fun idea and executed pretty well. The counter there is that this is the worst looking Alien movie, with early CGI that doesn't hold up well at all and some awful compositing, especially in that hallway chase.A handful of nice things, though, don't outweigh the movie's huge flaws. This movie is a disaster.",3,2,3,26 November 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Pretty much a complete disaster
","So, this is the  child of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, huh? I cannot say that I'm terribly surprised.This movie was a slog. It was a series of miscalculations, unsupported emotional moments, and poorly framed action, all while being arranged without anything really resembling dramatic structure. Let's take an early scene that works as a wonderful microcosm of the film's overall issues.Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil for some time. Through a series of very quick shots in the opening credits, we get the very basics of the story that Banner is the Hulk, he went nuts, nearly killed his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's father (General Ross) is a military man who almost died defending her life. Banner gets found out and tracked down by General Ross in the middle of the night.The way the scene plays out is that Bruce is alone in his little living space when he feels the presence of some soldiers just outside. He manages to escape down the side of the building and begins to run. As he twists and turns through the byzantine streets with the soldiers in hot pursuit, he accidentally runs into some guy he had a brief and unpleasant interaction with earlier. That guy brings his buddies along to then chase Banner. They end up at the factory that Banner works at where he finally becomes the Hulk, and fights off the locals and then the soldiers.What's wrong with that scene? The stakes of the action seesaw back and forth from Banner being pursued by trained killers to him being chased by some local thugs to Hulk taking out the thugs and then the soldiers. It's in the wrong order. 'This is how the movie is upping the stakes?' With just the slightest bit of consideration, that whole sequence should have been rearranged so that it begins with the local thugs, escalates to the soldiers, and then the Hulk comes out. As it is, it's confusing at best but mostly just frustrating.One of the things about franchise films is that they develop a certain shorthand about characters that allow for audiences to follow without requiring a lot of catchup from the previous movie. The problem with that approach regarding the characters in The Incredible Hulk is that this isn't a sequel. There had been Hulk by Ang Lee a few years before, but this is obviously not a follow up to that (aside from the character names, there's nothing that carries from the previous film to this one). So, when Betty Ross has a big emotional moment as she sees Bruce for the first time in years, it falls extremely flat. Yes, this is the man who was her boyfriend a few years ago, but aside from some very brief shots of her in the opening credits, we've never seen the two characters together before. We don't have a good feeling about their relationship, so as Betty immediately walks away from the man that's supposedly her current flame at the drop of a hat that audience isn't along with that decision. They don't understand the emotional particulars that would lead this specific woman to make this specific choice. It feels random instead of touching.That interaction happens when Banner begs his way up through Brazil and Central America into Virginia (in 17 whole days) and he heads for Culver University where Betty works. He shows up to find the data she should have stored in order to help him find a cure. They meet, she gives him the data in a flash drive, and then the military shows up again. We then get one of the most incomprehensible action scenes I've seen in modern movies. For being an action director Louis Leterrier is surprisingly bad at directing action. The basic geography of where people are never really gets established and it seems to change from shot to shot. Humvees appear out of nowhere, the Hulk moves all around the open field without any real explanation. Yeah, there are some cool shots here and there, but they're unmoored from anything relatable or intelligible.There are antagonists as well. The first is General Ross, but he's caught somewhere between a bad guy and a good guy. His stated objectives of wanting to essentially dissect Banner are bad, but the movie obviously doesn't want the audience to consider him that bad. His objectives get brushed under the rug and largely forgotten about because of the second antagonist, Emil Bronsky. Bronsky is a military man (with an unnecessarily complicated backstory that seems designed to justify the last name and Tim Roth's cockney accent). His pride gets wounded by the fact that a giant monster beat him in a fight, and he must take it out. Ross gives him some sort of super serum that turns him into a super soldier, and then he later gets...something else that turns him into another Hulk-like monster called Abomination. Then we get a giant CGI fight between two CGI monsters that is as uncompelling as Betty Ross's entire storyline.This film is poorly made, terribly written, and a bit of a complete disaster. The MCU really didn't start very well, did it?",3,0,1,25 November 2019
Mission: Impossible III," Don't lie to me
","For most of this movie's runtime, it's quite an enjoyable high tech spy thriller, but I absolutely hate its last twenty minutes.I've only seen this twice: once upon its initial theatrical run and just recently on Amazon Prime. I remember feeling largely the same reaction then as I did this time, and the epicenter of that visceral reaction is actually the opening few minutes of the film.You see, the opening sequence is actually a scene from late in the film, pushed forward, and it's a complete lie. It shows Ethan Hunt strapped to a chair as Owen Davian, the antagonist, counts to ten and shoots Ethan's wife in the head. On its own, it's a wonderful bit of tension filled filmmaking, but in the context of the rest of the movie it becomes obvious that it's actually a mistake narratively. You see, we spend the rest of the movie until we catch up with that opening scene with the knowledge that Julia, the wife, dies. This paints every interaction with her with a sense of inevitable sadness (which I like), but the character is thin. We excuse the thinness because of the tragic ending we know is coming.However, Julia isn't actually shot in the head. They used one of those awesome masks to hide the identity of Davian's assistant (who had failed him previously). So, we've spent about 90 minutes of the film believing that Julia had a certain fate in a deliberate editing trick meant to deceive the audience. Also, the movie doesn't really build up a character at all. She's just nice girl Ethan marries because she's not part of the spy game. It's all a lie intended to trick the audience into an emotional reaction only to immediately pull it away and say, 'Never mind!' Instead of earning an emotional reaction, the movie tricks the audience into one and then just pulls back the curtain immediately.To make things worse, the movie after that point is poorly written and ridiculous. Last minute rewrites are delivered flatly while nice little Julia ends up killing several trained assassins. It's such a terrible way to end a movie that actually has me for most of its running time.And it does have me for it. Brushing aside the first few minutes, Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force teammates run around Rome and China having a grand adventure with neat gadgets and pinpoint timing. Breaking into the Vatican is really fun. The insistence on getting into the nitty-gritty of building the mask for Ethan to wear and impersonate Davian is a wonderful source of tension that carries most of the sequence really well. The actors are charming and fun. The action sequence with Keri Russell, breaking her out of a large abandoned warehouse outside of Berlin is inventive, gritty, and really well executed.If not for the needless emotional fakeout, I would like this movie a good bit more, but, even with a second viewing under my belt, I cannot let that pass. It's dishonest and makes me want to throw things.",6,1,1,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A failed attempt at serious cinema from George Lucas
","With the advantage of having the whole trilogy, it becomes obvious what Lucas wanted to accomplish thematically across all three movies. This helps pull out individual elements of this film as more important than the others regarding the greater story, but they're minor elements in a story that shoots off in every direction, never really establishes much in the way of character, and just kind of meanders from one action setpiece to the next. It also doesn't make those individual elements any more compelling on their own. This movie is, at absolute best, a complete mess with a couple of very good special effects sequences.I think that this was George Lucas' attempt to become a serious filmmaker. There are two main things that drive me to this conclusion. The first is the attempt at a thematic core. If you look back at his previous creative work, theme is rarely a major factor. It's probably most prevalent in THX-1138, but hadn't been expressed since. The original Star Wars trilogy is mostly character and plot driven with thematic concerns popping up only occasionally. With the whole prequel trilogy in mind, it's obvious that he was going for a large thematic point. In Episode I, he pursues it poorly, but he does pursue it.The second factor is the fact that Lucas wrote Anakin Skywalker to be a child. Anyone with any proximity to Hollywood should know one of the ironclad rules of the industry is to never work with animals or children because both are impossible to control. Casting Jake Lloyd as Anakin when he was only nine years old is Lucas saying that he is a strong enough director to be able to get a good performance out of a child, but he's never been that kind of director and didn't become one through his experience here. Peter Bogdonavich directed Tatum O'Neil to a Best Supporting Actress Oscar when she was eleven, and he swore off working with children forever after that. He had to do 50 takes on literally everything to get the right performance out of her. Lucas, who is famous for directing people with 'Faster, more intense' for everything, was never the person to follow that pattern.So, Lucas seemed to go into the making of this movie with very grand ambitions, but he had cast off the people who were able to focus his creativity into something special (namely Gary Kurtz, the producer on the first two Star Wars films, and Marcia Lucas, his editor wife who divorced him during the post-production process of Return of the Jedi). Free from those chains and supported by his lapdog Rick McCallum, Lucas wrote and directed what feels like a first draft in desperate need of heavy revision with a real writing partner.I think it's a prime example of what happens when writers prioritize plotting over everything else. The movie has what looks like characters who move from one plot point to another purely because the story dictates. No one has any conceivable wants or desires that connect on any personal level except Anakin, and even he's inconsistently presented at best. The plot chugs along, but because there isn't a perceptible character with a believable motive to keep them going from one thing to the next, it feels plodding. There's no investment in the characters because they never even talk like real people. The dialogue is stilted and literally every performance is as flat as a board. Even Samuel L. Jackson delivers his lines like he's bored.The alluded to theme of the trilogy begins its appearance here, but it's muddled and hidden amidst all of the other stuff that's happening. The theme is about corruption. It's supposed to be mirrored between the fall of Anakin to the dark side of the Force and the descent of the Republic into the Empire, and there are touches of it here. However, it's presented in really boring terms. The inefficiency of the current bureaucracy of the Republic really feels like you're watching CSPAN with aliens. The detail around parliamentary procedure takes up large chunks of the middle of the film and are as exciting as learning the details of a foreign country's representative body could possibly be.There was a structural tic to the first Star Wars that I talked about in that review. It was that the actual story was complete with a beginning, middle, and end, but the movie felt like the universe of the story was spilling out on every side. The balance was perfectly kept in that film, and I feel like Lucas was trying something similar here as well, but he falls on his face. He doesn't understand the distinction between the core story and the larger story anymore. They bleed into each other so much that it's hard to tell what's what, or even what the core story is. There's no center to the film, and the thematic focus that becomes evident through the later films is shoved to the side for large stretches.Even in terms of action filmmaking structure, the movie is curious at best. In particular, I think of the journey through Naboo's core. The trio of characters are in their little water ship (apparently, Lucas not only doesn't know that a parsec is a measure of distance but also thinks that planet cores are made of water, but whatever, fantasy) and encounter a series of dangers including several large fish that try to eat them. However, they just get through and to the capitol city without issue. You could hard cut that entire sequence and the story wouldn't be affected at all.That being said, the only saving grace is the two major action sequences. The pod race has a clarity of storytelling absent from the rest of the film. There's a clear goal, antagonist, and established stakes. The effects still hold up fairly well as well. It's an exciting fifteen minutes. The final action sequence doesn't work as well and makes less sense, but it's still dynamic and fun in a superficial way.Overall, though, the movie's a mess. Yes, it has some ambition, but its author fails at achieving that ambition on a massively public scale.",3,1,2,12 December 2019
Skyfall," An expert desconstruction of the formula
","I hadn't seen Quantum of Solace since it was in theaters, and so I was actually rather shocked to discover that Skyfall is almost a reboot of the Craig Bond films. It feels like a least a decade has passed, maybe even two, since the last film. That Bond has gone from a new 00 agent on his first pair of missions in his early 30s to a well-worn veteran in his forties and maybe even early fifties. It almost feels like between Quantum and Skyfall, Bond went off and did all of the adventures we saw in the twenty films previously, giving him the grizzled look of a man who's been doing this spy thing for far too long. It's a bit subtle, but it's necessary based on the theme of the film.The film is chock full of ideas on history and the past, especially as it relates to our sins and the sins of our parents. In a way, Skyfall is actually more M's story than Bond's. The villain, Silva, is concerned with M's treatment of him years back, and Bond is really just the tool that M uses to try and prevent that meeting. That doesn't mean that Bond has nothing to do, he does, it's just that the focus is very much on M, her sins, and her relationship to Silva. Where Bond comes in is as a parallel (or, as the opening credits shows, Silva is Bond's shadow) and brother to Silva with M as their mother.You see, James Bond is old. He's a physical wreck and the opening sequence that sees him shot from the top of a moving train and falling into water hundreds of feet below made him lose a step. I mean, that would kill anyone else, but this is James Bond we're talking about. He has to deal with the fact that he left a fellow agent to die in the opening moments of the film, at the orders of M, in a chase that ultimately failed. M failed him, the agent, and Silva. He has every reason to be angry with M in the same way that Silva is, but he's not. He's not going to go rogue, he's going to go back to MI6 when England needs him. He'll be grumpy about it, but he's there because it's his duty. M is essentially his mother, and the British Secret Service is essentially his family.Silva, though, takes his own betrayal much harder. Disfigured from the cyanide capsule he took upon being captured and tortured, he holds a preternatural obsession regarding M and his need to destroy her. Everything he's built, including an implied criminal organization, a base on an abandoned industrial island, and a reputation was built for the purpose of getting to M. He's also that kind of movie brilliant where he can devise a plan of such intricacy involving so many moving parts that will get him from MI6's secret alternate hideout (which he would know about being a former agent) through the tube system to where M is giving testimony to members of Parliament.Bond's mission starts when Silva blows up MI6 and he comes back from hiding to report to M and receive orders in service of England. He needs to track down Silva and bring him in. What follows is a recognizable Bond globe-trotting adventure, but everything gets turned upside down. Instead of going further from home base, Bond ends up having to retreat all the way back to his ancestral home in Scotland. There is an attractive young woman, a henchwoman of Silva, who meets a typical henchwoman Bond girl end and dies, but the central Bond girl is actually M. The intricately built final lair doesn't belong to the antagonist, but to Bond himself. It's an inversion of the typical Bond adventure, and it's about Bond retreating into his past to find a way to fight for his future.Bond pulls the original Aston Martin from Goldfinger out of MI6's storage. He rigs the house with explosives and traps while starting the fight with a pair of double barrel shotguns in the face of helicopters and automatic weapons. He's the sinewy muscle of the past up against the less physical and more brainy manifestation of one version of the future in Silva. Even Q only gives Bond a small radio transmitter and a gun. The year of the exploding pen is behind them, it's up to Bond to get out of his situations on his own.The resolution of the plot that pits Silva against Bond with M as the target is probably the best a Bond movie has ever looked. The movie looks great from beginning to end, but the use of color and shadow by Roger Deakins is fantastic. I know it's kind of trendy to heap praise on Deakins, but the man deserves it. He can bring out color and contrast it with shadow like no one else. The confrontation between all three at the end is the resolution of the theme running through the film of how to deal with the sins of the past. Silva represents endless vengeance against the past while Bond represents moving on. There's nothing Bond can do about the sins M visited down upon him, so he has chosen to make the best of it by doing his duty. Silva couldn't accept that and Bond makes him pay.This movie is really smart, inverting so many of the Bond conventions on their heads while providing some of the most beautiful looking action the franchise has ever seen. Acting is top notch all around with a special mention to Javier Bardem who plays Silva really well. Mendes came to this project as an obvious fan of the franchise, and he applied every narrative and cinematic trick he had learned in his time as a filmmaker to the series he loved, making one of the best entries in the entire franchise.",10,0,3,10 March 2020
Iron Man 3," Disjointed, but fun
","This movie has large sections of it that work quite well in isolation, but the movie as a whole doesn't really come together like it should.I realized something was wrong pretty early. Tony has been tinkering ever since his close encounter with a nuclear weapon in New York, losing himself in his work and developing dozens of Iron Man suits. When confronted by the events of that day, he has anxiety attacks. Meanwhile, a terrorist called The Mandarin has been setting off explosions around the world and delivering messages to the American devil. One explosion occurs in Los Angeles and Tony's former bodyguard Happy gets grievously harmed because of it. This is where I realized something was off. Tony has an emotional reaction that is way too much for the situation, and his unveiled threat to The Mandarin in response is too angrily directed at The Mandarin himself.Wait, that doesn't make sense, does it? Happy has been at Tony's side since the beginning of the first movie. Of course an attack on him is going to piss Tony off. And here's where the difference between the intention of a movie and its actual execution becomes important. Happy is barely a character. He was largely a source of mild laughs in the middle of light sequences. He had never developed an emotional connection with Tony or with the audience, so to see Happy in danger and to have his injury drive Tony's next series of actions that are meant to be powered with high emotion feels unsupported by what's actually come before. Injuring Pepper, Tony's girlfriend, though, would have done it. For all the faults of the first two Iron Man movies, they did manage to sell the relationship between Tony and Pepper well enough so that if Pepper had been injured and Tony had delivered the exact same speech it would have landed emotionally.The reverse of that are ideas that seem curious but end up being executed fairly well all while feeling isolated from the rest of the story. Tony getting isolated in Tennessee with the plucky kid is an example of this. The plucky kid is a trope of movies, especially sequels, in order to artificially heighten stakes and create a new dynamic for the characters to explore. The kid here, though, gets treated like an adult by Tony. He doesn't soften at the kid's doe eyes, nor does he learn his lesson in abandonment through him, he's there to help Tony in a time of need, and I think it largely works. However, it's done in isolation and feels extraneous at best.The other major element that I really like on its own but doesn't seem to fit the rest of the movie is The Mandarin himself. Now, fans of the comic hate this interpretation of The Mandarin because it turns a terrifying and evil character into a joke, but I am not a fan of the comics, I think lack of adherence to source material is a junk criticism, and I quite like him. The subversion of the big bad being the main target, leaving the guy we've thought is the bad guy as the actual antagonist, is a fun one, and I think it's handled well. The Mandarin gets built up very well throughout the movie with his video messages to the world, and the sudden deflation of that image to find out that he's a drugged out cockney actor named Trevor is really funny. However, it feels like just extra stuff, like material you could cut without much trouble.So, yeah, I have some problems with how the movie's constructed. There doesn't seem to be a particularly strong throughline for the whole story, though by the end of it, it becomes obvious that Tony's supposed to be learning to say goodbye to the suit. I think the movie largely supports that, though. He doesn't have a full working suit in the whole movie. In fact, he spends most of the movie having to solve his problems without a suit. From the moment he lands in Tennessee to when his suit flies to him in Miami (which is about an hour or so), Tony is just Tony. He has to solve his problems without the high tech gear he encases himself in all the time. In fact, he has to go out and get analog in finding ways to beat down badguys by running into a hardware store and collecting a couple cartloads of stuff to make offensive weapons. He's learning that he can live without the suit.However, that core idea is hidden behind a bunch of other stuff (like Trevor, the kid, and some political talk that never goes anywhere). The movie looks fantastic, though. This is the first standalone Marvel movie that got seriously huge wads of cash thrown at it, and it shows. The attack on Tony's cliffside mansion is one of the most beautiful scenes of pure destruction I've seen. The final battle with the few dozen Iron Man suits flying around it detailed and inventive.There's great fun to be had in this movie, but the movie as a whole is disjointed and full of distractions. In terms of construction, I think a couple more drafts might have smoothed out the whole experience and created something more successful.",6,0,0,25 November 2019
Child 44," Obviously cut down heavily
","I was very unsurprised by the information that the first cut of this film was over five hours long. The final product of Child 44 is the exact right mix of overstuffed and underdeveloped that would come with shaving three hours out of a five hour movie while trying to keep as much in as possible. The big moments are still there, but so much of the connective tissue is gone.There are really two interrelated stories at play in this film. The first is what's on the posters and what was made into the television movie Citizen X, the story of a child murdered in the Soviet Union. Murders don't happen in the Soviet Union. Murder, according to Stalin, is a purely capitalistic disease and murders, as gets said several times, do not happen in paradise.This story gets sidelined for long stretches by the second story, which is a more expansive view of life in Soviet Russia as seen through the eyes of Leo Demidov, an MGB agent, and his wife Raisa. This tries to capture the horror of daily life in the Soviet police state, where every word could be reported to authorities and your entire life ended by mere suspicion. That's dramatized early when Leo himself tracks down a veterinarian who immediately starts running when he sees MGB agents on his tail. He's not guilty of anything, but he knows that if he gets caught then his life is over.The movie starts both of these stories pretty well, giving us time to appreciate the slow horror of both of them, but by about the halfway point, once Leo gets demoted to the militia and sent to the country, things begin to skip and speed up. Gary Oldman is prominently featured in the marketing, but he has about a scene and a half. We skip through the investigation of further child murders to suddenly get a complete list and Leo and Raisa have to go back to Moscow for unclear reasons. There they interact with one of Raisa's former fellow teachers who ends up being an MGB spy trying to entrap people at the school, and it gets revealing while Leo is killing the man with a phone cord. The two end up on the run, but it's unclear why. Is it because they killed the man without anyone witnessing the murder? Is it because they got into Moscow on faked papers?And why does Leo continue this investigation, especially after he's been released from the police. He ends up taking Raisa around to a manufacturing plant where they track down the killer before getting into a fistfight with a former fellow MGB agent who's tracked them down. The connective tissue between all of these scenes is gone.Mentioning Citizen X is instructive. It strives to tell only half the story that Child 44 does, and it does it much better because it has over 100 minutes to dedicate only to that. It's not a great film, but it's a solid procedural from another world. Looking at the similar story of Child 44, they only dedicated about sixty minutes to the crime and investigation itself, and it's lost in a bunch of other shortened stuff along with it.The action of the film ends when Leo and the antagonistic MGB agent get into a fistfight in the mud. Now, a second for an aesthetic comment. When you make your film aesthetically unpleasant, you build a handicap for yourself because your film is simply unpleasant to look at. You can still make a great film, but you're making the job harder for yourself. This may be appropriate considering the material at hand, but it doesn't change the reality that making a movie that is ugly to look at will not help you with most audiences. Child 44 is, from beginning to end, hard to simply look at. On top of that, it's about a child murderer and the oppressive life under Stalin. There are levels of ugly to this film that extend deep into the subtext, and it never lets up, culminating in the fistfight that ends with one man getting his head violently thrown against a rock. I'm not saying this movie is bad because it's ugly (I think I've listed the reasons clearly enough), but the ugliness simply put up a barrier between artist and audience that may not have been completely necessary. As a counterpoint, I think of Tarkovsky's Stalker, which was filmed in a Soviet state, in a region of industrial decline and nuclear radiation, but it's gorgeous to look at despite all that.It's ugly, about difficult material, and it shortchanges every aspect of its storytelling because they never found a way to write a screenplay condensed enough to tell the story they wanted to tell. They filmed it all and ended up having to shorten it significantly in editing to disastrous results. Perhaps the full five hour version is a better film, but we'll never see it because the movie ended up losing so much money that the studio will never touch it again.",2,2,4,4 February 2020
Spartacus," More Trumbo than Kubrick
","Kubrick dismissed several of his early films from his canon. Fear and Desire makes sense because of its amateurishness while Killer's Kiss has some similar problems (though I feel it's a successful movie overall). Spartacus, though, isn't about quality but more about authorship.Out of all the feature narrative films Stanley Kubrick, he produced most of and had writing credits on all of them except Spartacus. The history was that Kirk Douglas, as producer, had hired Anthony Mann to direct the film but fired him (for unclear reasons) after a week of filming. In desperate need of a director as quickly as possible, Douglas called up Kubrick, with whom he had made Paths of Glory, and Kubrick took the job. He hadn't written a word and had say in only one casting decision (that of Varinia, a character that hadn't begun filming yet, who was played by Jean Simmons). There is even a story of Douglas asking Kubrick what he thought of the famous 'I am Spartacus' scene just before filming it. Kubrick admitted that he thought it was stupid, and Douglas openly berated his director (and, as producer, employee) for the opinion. Notice that this scene was filmed and included in the final cut.So, I think it's easy to see why Kubrick, who had such complete control of literally every other movie he made, would feel a certain distance regarding Spartacus. It's more of a creative output for Dalton Trumbo and Kirk Douglas than Stanley Kubrick.So, Spartacus is a curio in the Kubrick filmography. It sticks out like a sore thumb. It's too bright, colorful, and optimistic, and yet it's still good.The slave Spartacus gets purchased from a salt mine to a gladiatorial school where he learns how to kill. When the Roman senator Crassus visits the Batiatus, the owner of the school, he pays for a pair of to the death combats. This is the spark that leads to the beginning of the slave revolt the next day. Spartacus leads the gladiators to form into an army and raid, pillage, and sweep across southern Italy to a port city where they will pay for ships to carry them away from the Roman Empire.The movie is at its best when either Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, Gracchus, played by Charles Laughton, or Batiatus, played by Peter Ustinov, are on screen. They are thankfully center stage for much of the film. Crassus is the personification of Rome at its most dangerous, affluent, and corrupt. A man of no morals, he revels in his power over the world. Gracchus is a man of appetites who revels in the fights of the Roman Senate, countering Crassus with intelligence and wit. Batiatus is a working man who built up his wealth through the creation of his gladiatorial school. He shares a special corpulent bond with Gracchus and the two have some of the most fun written scenes in the film.Spartacus, unfortunately, is just not that interesting. Once freed from slavery, his drive of necessity is replaced by a gauzy need for freeing slaves. He's purely an idealist of no fault. This is a direct result of Dalton Trumbo's communism. The way he painted Spartacus, as the faultless ideal, was in line with the then socialist artistic norm of portraying what was essentially the New Socialist Man. Douglas liked this because he got to play the hero, but Kubrick thought he was uninteresting and a wash of the more interesting history of the real Spartacus who unnecessarily turned from northern Italy towards Rome to continue raiding instead of escaping like he could. But, as we've already seen, Kubrick had little say on this movie's characters and story.There are hints of themes that Kubrick had been, and would continue to, dealing with. The first hour at the gladiatorial school is all about the dehumanization of man at the whim of a larger, impersonal, and inhuman system. This falls directly in line with the events of Paths of Glory. The ending of both movies echo each other to certain degrees. In Paths of Glory sees the system win, as it does in Spartacus. However, in the Roman epic, there are hints of optimism as Varinia holds up Spartacus' baby boy to him, pledging to carry on the boy's father's name and cause. That sort of optimism is missing from Paths of Glory, and, really, most of Kubrick's filmography until Eyes Wide Shut, I think.Where Kubrick was able to shine was in the movie's visual design. He had little say in set construction, costumes, and locations (though he apparently convinced the producers to shoot the famed battle in Spain instead of America), but he had full control of his camera. Compositions carry that intelligent and clear dynamism he was known for. The most striking imagery might be the gladiatorial fight between Spartacus and Draba. In the foreground we see the two in their small box as two others rise, pass through the narrow opening at the center of frame with Marcellus in the middle and Crassus at the top of frame. It's an elegant composition that shows a visualist making the most of the conditions he had.There are also several action scenes that are surprisingly well filmed. Not that I don't imagine Kubrick had the ability, but the most action he had filmed was the chase in Killer's Kiss and the long tracking shots over no man's land in Paths of Glory. They were nothing like the dynamic and violent action in the gladiatorial fight, the uprising, and, especially, the battle near the end of the film.In the end, the movie's certainly good, but it's got too many authorial hands moving it in different directions. Instead of William Wyler getting support from producers and star to make Ben-Hur in the best possible way, we had a screenwriter insisting on less interesting characterizations, a producer and star who seemed more interested in making himself look good than telling a story, and a director that couldn't pursue anything like his own vision. It's a compromised film that amazingly works as well as it does.",7,3,5,26 November 2019
Casablanca," One of the greatest studio films
","Out of all the movies in my top ten, this is probably the one that pops up most in others. It's been a staple of American cinema pretty much since its release and when it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1942. It's well loved by nearly everyone who sees it, and I think it's easy to see why.In my mind there are two major reasons why both I love this film and why it's so beloved 76 years after its release: dialogue and the expert mixture of cynicism with romanticism.First Things FirstThe movie nominally takes place in the city of Casablanca during World War II, but it's a version that seems fairly divorced from reality. The central plot device in the movie are a pair of letters of transit signed by Charles de Gaulle that will allow anyone carrying them to leave the city on the plane for Lisbon where they'll be able to find a way to America. The letters of transit were a complete fabrication of the writers of the original stage play that the movie was based off of.The movie's larger geopolitical picture is, quite simply, a fantasy. It makes a certain amount of sense that the wildly corrupt Free French prefect would allow almost anything to happen in the city as long as he got his cut, but the Nazi presence feels almost benign compared to what one might expect from what a Nazi would actually do with that kind of presence in a city and confronted with possibly losing a high priority target like Victor Laszlo.But, that's not the point. Casablanca isn't about World War II, the political realities of the war, or even the relationship Free France had with Nazi Germany. No, the movie is about two people, and those around them that affect their relationship.DialogueThat being said, I'm hoping we all know the story of Casablanca, so I'm going to skip a plot summary. Instead, I'm going to dive into the qualities that have helped the movie last so long.Apparently, the cast thought the dialogue was silly and unnatural as they filmed it. One thing's for sure, no one speaks with this much wit in real life.The script for Casablanca is the sort of high-octane, clever, dialogue driven script no one really writes anymore. Diablo Cody was in the same league with Juno a while ago, but audiences seem to want naturalistic dialogue in most circumstances. They'll allow some room for things like period pieces, but overall there's an insistence that everyone talk like they would in real life.Which is a shame, although if everyone had the kind of constant one-liners that Rick, Ilsa, and Renault life could be significantly more fun.The movie is well-known for its great exchanges, having six quotes in the AFI's list '100 Years...100 Quotes', more than any other movie in the list. There's the simple stuff like 'Here's looking at you, kid,' (an invention of Humphrey Bogart as he taught Ingrid Bergman English on set), but Claude Rains' Renault has all of my favorites. Out of context, the 'shocked' line is funny for the pure absurdity of it, but in context it's even funnier.I also love Renault's response to Rick threatening to shoot him in the heart as his least vulnerable spot. The movie is stuffed full of this fantastic sort of stuff that makes just listening to the dialogue a pleasure on its own outside of any other parts of the film.
Cynicism vs. RomanticismI think this is really why the movie endures through the decades. It portrays a rather complex portrait of balancing the cynicism brought upon by loss and melancholy with the need for Romanticism in the world.Rick starts the film as, what looks like, a pure cynic. He doesn't talk about his past and seems only concerned with keeping his bar open in such a tumultuous city with such a (poor) corrupt official in Renault. In the opening act, though, we see signs that there's more to him than that. Renault talks about some of Rick's past. He participated in two smaller wars by running guns, and in both the side he chose lost. The implication is that Rick was a romantic, but his behavior in the scene is designed to make it look like he's left it all behind. He says, 'I stick my neck out for nobody,' twice in the first twenty minutes.
All things considered, he probably would have continued on this path with the kind of behavior that leads him to idly stand by as a man he's friendly with is rounded up and taken away to surely be shot, but the source of his cynicism arrives. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) arrives in Rick's place and Rick immediately begins to change. He drinks with customers (which he never does), he helps a young Bulgarian couple win at his own roulette tables so the young woman won't have to sell her body to Renault for the help they need to leave Casablanca.Eventually, it all culminates in that side of Rick, that he has tried to suppress for years since Ilsa left him to return to her presumed dead husband Victor Laszlo, completely taking over. He removes himself from his shell and becomes completely selfless. Instead of using the letters of transit for himself, he gives them to Laszlo.This move could mean one of two things, both related. It could mean that Rick has become a patriot, as Renault calls him, and is now fighting for a cause much like he used to, but it could also mean that he simply knew that Ilsa would never be happy with Rick if she knew that Laszlo was dead. He'd have her, but he'd be the architect of her husband's death. There couldn't be any love there, so he does what's right and walks away. The yearning to be a better man amidst a hostile world is appealing to many people.Casablanca 2: Electric BugalooLet me take a moment to talk about the very end of the movie. Ilsa and Laszlo have flown away. Rick has shot the main  character. Renault has covered for Rick's actions, and the pair walk off into the fog, beginning a beautiful friendship. I don't want to be the 'get off my lawn' cynic, but if that got made today there'd be work on a sequel before the movie opened, just in case it was successful. That sequel would possibly put Renault as the main character because he'd test really well in screenings, and Rick and Ilsa would end up together.
It wouldn't destroy the original, but it'd spit on it.The beauty of that ending is that it allows us to imagine what could be, but also it ends that part of Rick's story at the exact right moment. He's completely changed from cynic to romantic, and we don't need to see anymore.
Warners wanted a sequel immediately after release (called Brazzaville), but they never made it. Also, can you believe that Madonna tried to remake it once? Ashton Kutcher would have been Rick. At least studio executives have one movie they refuse to try and remake, at least for now.The Studio SystemThe making of the movie, which seems to wonderfully designed and assembled, was apparently a mess. Aside from the aforementioned distaste the actors had for the dialogue, there is the famous story of Humphrey Bogart being called to set to stand in a place and nod, for a reason he had no idea. It ended up being Rick telling the band to play the Marseilles. There were also rumors of multiple endings for a while that are largely untrue (although this joke from The Simpsons always puts a smile on my face), but there was an attempt to extend the ending with shots of Rick and Renault on an Allied ship invading North Africa (ugh, just try to ruin everything why don't you). I'm glad Claude Rains was apparently unavailable.But, it was a studio picture and probably the best example of what the studio system did well. They had contract players they just pulled into pictures they thought would fit, hired directors who were technically competent and unflashy, and writers who could churn out quality work. When this system came together well, it ended up creating absolutely wonderful entertainments. It's not how every movie should be made, but it could work very, very well.",10,0,0,21 November 2019
The Death of Stalin," These people were really awful, weren't they?
","I was expecting a much more straight comedy based on the movie's marketing than what I got, but while the movie is often uproariously funny, it's still the story of a handful of awful people fighting to the death for control of the living corpse that was Soviet Russia. The comedy is there, not for no reason, but because it helps highlight the absolute absurdity of the overall situation but it also brings to the fore the strong personalities involved.Like most Russian literature, I have trouble keeping Russian names straight in The Death of Stalin. I remember that in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment that there are two main characters whose names start with R, but one has a k somewhere in the middle while the other looks flat from the second letter on. That's how I kept those characters straight while reading, and I kind of had a similar experience while watching this. Other than a handful of names (Stalin, Molotov, and Khrushchev) I was lost in a sea of syllables I couldn't recall, so the use of both well known and easily distinctive actors was a very good idea, helping me get used to names to place with easily identifiable faces rather quickly.We also spent a lot more time with Stalin than I was expecting. Based on the trailers, I estimated that Stalin died within the first five minutes and the rest of the movie was vulgar bickering between the Politburo with no clear path forward. Those trailers were incredibly deceptive, but in a way that I really appreciate. What the trailers hid was a rather intelligent synthesis of the events at the highest levels of Soviet power in the first moments of post-Stalin Russia. In order to sell that, though, the movie needed to sell the final days of Stalin ruled Russia, and it does that very well with a view of a Stalinist purge being carried out alongside the camaraderie between the main players in the upcoming drama (Molotov, Khrushchev, Beria, and Malenkov) where we can sense the hidden animosities buried just underneath the surface.The confusion and forced mourning over Comrade Stalin's death very quickly gives way to politicking and scheming, especially on the parts of Khrushchev and Beria, while Malenkov has the power of Stalin awkwardly placed upon him, a man unequal to the task of handling the Politburo full of schemers. It's a war of words and whispers that breaks out as both Khrushchev and Beria work to undermine the other, both assuming (rather rightly) that Malenkov is simply too weak for the position. In the middle is Molotov, whose wife Beria returns after several years of punishment for sedition (either very clear or unproven depending on who's listening) while he feels more inclined to support to more reform minded Khrushchev.The movie is at it's funniest when people are insulting each other. My favorite is when Stalin's son Vasily yells at one of the doctors brought in to examine his father that he is mostly made of hair, but, in terms of laugh per aggressive sneer, it's Jason Isaacs as General Zhukov that takes the cake. He's wonderfully entertaining as he Yorkshire growls through every insult in every direction while cheerily joining Khrushchev against Beria because Beria undermined Zhukov's authority as his first act after Stalin's death.As with all movies based on history, I assume this is about 90% ahistorical, but The Death of Stalin, seems to capture the truth of the moment really well. It's a complete power vacuum as the central authority dies. There are protocols in place to try and smooth over the transition of power, but it's obvious from the start that the protocol will mean nothing when faced with the reality of power in the Soviet Union. The only thing keeping the letter of the law remotely alive (as excerpted in title cards throughout the film) is the memory of the fallen leader. It's a pretext for civility that hardly masks the incivility that guides every player's actions.Another smaller thing that the film does really well is capture the absolute terror of simply living in the Soviet Union. Molotov (played wonderfully by Michael Palin) cheerfully denounces his wife as worthy of her punishment in front of her because saying otherwise could send him to the gulag. The director of the radio program that transmits the Moscow's philharmonic completely recreates a performance because Stalin called and asked for a recording (after the performance ended) and he hadn't recorded it. And, the most simple and elegant example, the guards outside of Stalin's room refuse to check on their dear leader after the obvious sound of a falling body because to disturb Stalin while sleeping meant death.This is some of the most entertaining history, especially history that is so cruel and hideous, I've seen in a long while. Wonderfully acted, consistently funny, and alternately terrifying, The Death of Stalin is a marvelous look into a pocket of history with world shaping results.",10,3,3,5 May 2020
Star Trek," A fun adventure.
","There's an interesting divide between Star Trek fans about J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise. I see it as those who view the franchise as science fiction and those that view it as techno-fantasy.In my mind, Star Trek has never been science fiction. It's a fantasy world with switches and starships instead of wizards and dragons. They've made up the 'science' from the beginning. Transporters? Fantasy. Warp speed? Fantasy. Phasers? Fantasy. Science has since gone to quasi-justify some of this, but none of the ideas were born of scientific rigor. Instead they were invented because Gene Roddenberry needed a cheaper way to get people to the planet surface in 'The Cage' than a shuttlecraft, which they didn't have the budget to build, so they used an optical effect to have people appear and called it the transporter.And yet, many Trekkies disagree with me. Mike Stoklasa, of Red Letter Media, is very much on the other side and gets really irritated with the movies from The Next Generation on about how they don't keep to the science of the show. Windows shattering in Generations led to a couple of minute long comment about how they're not glass but transparent aluminum and have gone through so much more stress than landing on a planet. My response is to feign surprise at inconsistency in a franchise that is almost a thousand hours long.So, when Abrams introduced red matter, seeing a planet destroyed while standing on another planet, and a super nova that will destroy the galaxy, I shrugged at the ridiculousness while others raged. No, none of it is scientific, but neither are transporters.So, with that out of the way, let's talk about the movie itself.Time travel brings a mining vessel back in time right in front of the USS Kelvin and commander George Kirk. The situation quickly devolves and the Kelvin is shot to hell. Commander Kirk orchestrates the evacuation but needs to stay behind to give them a chance, forcing his wife and very newborn son to flee without him. This first ten minutes is so successful in terms of short form storytelling, I kind of wish that this was everything. It's clear, emotional, and wonderful to look at as George Kirk sacrifices his own life to save his wife and son.The rest of the movie isn't as strong, but it's still fun. Abrams has a zippy style that he ends up fitting well to his take on the material. People running around ships as they try to explain things to each other while amusing things are happening (like James Kirk's enlarged hands). Abrams wants to entertain in a propulsive way, and he zips along fast enough that we're just along for the rollercoaster ride.But, getting into the details of how some of the plot works out reveals this fantasy/science fiction problem in greater detail. The one to point out (because it inexplicably comes back in Into Darkness) is the transwarp beaming concept. On a planet, Kirk finds Old Spock and Scotty. Old Spock inputs a formula from the future into Scotty's computer that suddenly makes it able to transport people in ways that no Star Trek show has even hinted at being possible, across light years and to a ship in warp. No hardware upgrades necessary, apparently. The franchise has always existed on this border between the two genres, but, to take a political term, this movie moved the Overton Window firmly towards fantasy, and that bugs people. It also bugs me, but not enough to kill the film. It bugs me because, within this version of the universe, transwarp beaming invalidates starships completely. It was a quick solution to a plot problem without any concern for how the technology would actually work. It's silly.Still, the movie zips right past that and the action continues with people running down corridors.The real strength of the film is the cast. Chris Pine is affable as Kirk. Zachary Quinto captures Spock's essence. Karl Urban is note perfect as McCoy. Even Anton Yelchin is delightful as the seventeen year old Chekov. The movie spends so much time with our crew of the Enterprise that it ends up failing a bit with its protagonist, Nero.Nero's entire backstory gets told in one data dump about halfway through the movie, which Eric Bana growls through while threatening Captain Christopher Pike. It carries no emotional weight because it comes so late and is delivered so quickly and (nearly) incomprehensibly. The motivation there should have been enough to make Nero an interesting bad guy (although another motivation other than revenge might have been nice), but the delivery is kind of terrible. Our antagonist is really just a scowling guy who shows up every once in a while who hates Spock.Still, the movie is silly with a conflict that could have been better defined on one side, but it's still a fun two hours. The protagonists are uniformly likable and have great chemistry while the action is well staged and the movie is paced at almost breakneck speeds. It's rather unlike any iteration of Star Trek before it. I overall prefer the ponderousness of The Motion Picture, but I can take this new tone and energy.",7,2,6,22 November 2019
Fury," Brutal tanks
","Tough, wounded men arguing with each other in a metal beast upon a scarred patch of earth. Their tank needs some electrical work before it will move again, and everyone's growing impatient with the increasing sense of danger around them. As we learn later, all four of these men have been fighting in that tank, named Fury, since the Allies first landed in Africa, but now it's 1945. The German war machine is broken but not gone, and Nazis are still trying to protect their homeland as America rolls across the German countryside towards Berlin.I loved how this movie looked. Dirty, grungy, and smoke-filled, it looks like a dirtier Ridley Scott movie. There's one scene where one of the characters gets clean, and the event occurs in the middle of the tense central section where cleanliness ends up feeling wrong somehow. Everyone is always covered in dirt and blood. You can almost smell the weeks of sweat and mud and grease clinging to them.The story is rather simple. The tank, having just lost its assistant driver, picks up a new guy to fill the post. He's been in the army for eight weeks while they've been in the war since Africa. They must go from town to town, engaging what little, but dangerous, German forces are left and ultimately defend a crossroads for the furtherance of the army as a whole. That simple story, though, is supported by a simple element. Its structure is centered around the new assistant driver, our eyes into this world. We are there as he goes from refusing to fire guns on possibly dead German bodies to mowing down lines of SS marching towards the tank. The execution on the journey (some might call it a character arc) is so well executed, and I knew it within the movie's first 20 minutes.At the center of that journey (the exact center of the movie, actually) is the scene where Brad Pitt's character cleans up. The tank has advanced into a German town, wiping out the handful of German soldiers and our main character has joined Pitt by invading a small apartment that houses a middle aged woman and her teenaged cousin. The entire point of the movie is to watch humanity strip away as people wade through war, and seeing these two women cower in fear at these two American soldiers creates a sense of unease and unpredictability. But the scene flows from one emotion to another. Tension gives to innocent love and breaks down into sheer terror. It's a fantastic little journey, as claustrophobic as life in the tank.Outside of that, though, are a handful of action scenes that are completely convincing in their brutality. The standout, of course, is the final battle at the crossroads. Heavily inspired by Audie Murphy's heroic action that bears some similarity to the action on screen, the battle is an extended descent into Hell as battle surrounds a broken down tank housing our heroes.Oh, David Ayer...what happened to you? Immediately after this you gave us Suicide Squad. What happened to the efficient and focused storyteller? I would blame Warner Brothers, but then Ayers gave us Bright.",8,1,3,22 November 2019
The Maze Runner," Interesting world building mixed with some rote storytelling make a mixed experience
","Oh, the early to mid 2010s, when men were men, women were women, and teenagers were constantly being pitted against an all-oppressive state with absurd contraptions and concepts that fostered some kind of twisted growth. They were more innocent times, really.So, the king of these films (really, the queen) was The Hunger Games a good series of 4 (should have been 3) films based on a young adult dystopian novel series. Soon, everyone in Hollywood was doing what they always do, mimicking the recent success. The Maze Runner came out of that time.A young man, Thomas, wakes up in a dingy elevator rising to the surface. He finds himself in a green space at the center of a square of walls hundreds of feet high with only a few dozen other boys already there. What surrounds the little idyll is the Maze, a series of shifting passageways that opens up at the beginning of the day, closes as night approaches, and contains nasty beasts at night. Well, being this kind of movie, of course Thomas is going to become the guy who leads them through the Maze somehow. It's not really a surprise.And therein lies the movies failing. Its utter predictability. Of course Thomas is the 'chosen one'. Of course he's going to do things that people who've been there for three years never tried or succeeded at. Of course he's going to cause a paradigm shift in the society. Of course he's going to lead them out.The other failing is the incredible shallowness of characters. They're little more than archetypes that exist to fill rolls. The largest problem is with the 'antagonist' Gally. He's angry and paranoid, and little else. I feel like he was placed there because the movie, without him, essentially has no antagonist except the Maze itself. He's there to stir things up and make life just a little more difficult for Thomas, but the situation around them is enough of an antagonist. Thomas' presence changes the rules of the situation in certain ways that the painfully expository dialogue makes very clear. Gally is just extra, and feels it.But still, the movie's slickly produced so it has some surface level appeal. The movie was obviously made on the cheap side of blockbusters, but it uses its limited budget well. The maze looks good. The monsters look good. The action scenes engage on a purely sensory level. The acting is also pretty good, even if it is split across too many characters.I didn't hate the experience. It was an okay way to spend 100 minutes of my evening. The promise of more of the world is intriguing enough to get me sort of interested. All around, meh.",5,0,3,25 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," The ending doesn't live up to the rest of the movie
","This movie is chock full of greatness, but it ends up being a bit less than the sum of its parts. I can easily see how someone would take those different great moments and get wrapped up in the whole movie while glossing over the fact that the ending doesn't tie up as well as it should, but that ending bugs me.The film starts with what may be Tarantino's single best scene, the chapter titled 'Once upon a time ... in Nazi Occupied France.' Hans Landa, an SS officer, arrives at a small dairy farm and begins to interview the middle-aged French owner of the land. Landa is investigating a handful of Jewish dairy farmers who had lived in the area before the Germans arrived. There's one family unaccounted for, the Dreyfuses.This scene is brilliant. From the moment it starts as the SS car drives up, we know that something's wrong. Christoph Waltz's performance as Landa is so ingratiating and the character written so intelligently that before the camera pans below the floorboards to reveal the Dreyfus children hiding, we know that there's more to the scene than we are seeing. Once that reveal happens, though, the tension simply ramps up steadily and almost unbearably. Landa starts talking about his admiration for the Jewish people's supposed similarity to the rat (as opposed to the German people's supposed similarity to the hawk). He says he knows how they hide, where they could go that other German soldiers wouldn't imagine. Before Landa tells the dairy farmer exactly where the Dreyfus children are hiding, we get the sense that he knows exactly what's going on.Another brilliant aspect of it is the use of language. Landa is German. The dairy farmer is French. Landa walks up speaking French, but being German, it's not a huge surprise that he might find the language uncomfortable, so they switch to English. It seems like something both realistic within the context and a cop to the audience so they don't have to read subtitles for the rest of the scene, but it's also part of the ruse to keep the hiding Jews from understanding what's going on. They don't speak English, so as Landa outlines what he's going to do, they have no idea. One of the three children ends up escaping, Shoshanna, and Landa lets her go. You can tell through the whole scene that what he loves most is the chase, and letting her go is just continuing that chase.After that, we have our introduction to the titular Basterds. A group of eight Jewish American soldiers, led by Aldo the Apache, they go into France before D-Day and wreck as much carnage as they can, claiming scalps of Nazi soldiers as they go. Their introduction is the genre meat of the film, the revenge porn aspect. It's an amusing way to introduce them, watching the Bear Jew beat an unrepentant Nazi to death with a baseball bat. Thankfully, there's more to the movie.Three years after Shoshanna escaped the Jew Hunter, she has become the proprietor of a movie theater in Paris. She inherited it from her aunt and uncle (assumedly, those non-Jewish French who took her in to help save her) and runs it with her African-French boyfriend. A young German officer, a war hero who killed dozens of Americans in Italy, tries to strike up a friendship, but Shoshanna has an understandable aversion to Nazis and resists. He insists to the point that he convinces Goebbels to hold the premiere for the soldier's movie at Shoshanna's theater. Shoshanna is passive through the whole experience, knowing that to fight back would be borderline suicide.It is at the lunch where Goebbels decides that Shoshanna comes face to face with Hans Landa again. We know how smart Landa is, based on his previous scene. He looks Shoshanna directly in the eye and seems to be hiding something. I think Landa's supposed to know exactly who Shoshanna actually is from this first interaction. It's the detail that he buys her a glass of milk. Why would the Jew Hunter do this, though? Well, three years have passed and the German situation has declined since. He's planning, but so is Shoshanna. She wants to embrace having Nazis in her theater in order to burn it to the ground and hurt those who hurt her and killed her family.It's about the fifty minute point in the movie when this plot actually begins to develop, which is fascinating on its own. That's a long time dedicated to simply developing characters. I love it!We next get Tarantino's second best scene where the Basterds have to meet with the German film star Bridget Von Hammersmark in a tavern in a basement. 'Well, you don't gotta be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't wanna fight in a basement.' The two German speaking Basterds and a British operative who also speaks German, descend and find that the movie star is not alone. She's entertaining five soldiers who are celebrating the birth of a son back home. The Basterds and actress try to disengage without arousing suspicion, but it's a tricky business. Eventually, the British officer speaks, telling off a soldier, but his accent isn't right. That accent attracts the attention of an unseen SS officer hiding in a corner. He injects himself into the conversation, forcing the group to tolerate his hostile questions and pseudo-friendly presence. We know that the group is just one wrong move away from giving themselves away, and when it does happen it takes a second to develop. The explosion of violence that follows is very bloody and very quick.The final chapter is where the movie comes together in part but never quite enough to satisfy me. Shoshanna preps for her revenge and the Basterds make it into the premiere. So, we end up with all of our characters in the same place doing the same thing, but it still feels like they are in separate movies. Shoshanna is in her mode of personal revenge that ends with her dying at the hands of the German soldier while the Basterds are simply there to wreck carnage. There's a similarity in motive, revenge, but it never really develops into anything more than that. It feels more coincidental that the two storylines end up in the same place rather than intentional.Still, everything up to that ending is great, and some of it is some of Tarantino's best work. Christoph Waltz plays a difficult role pitch perfectly. Brad Pitt is really good. Diana Kruger is very good. It's tense, funny, and great to look at. It feels like everything is going to wrap up really well in the end, but it fails at that insisting on little more than revenge porn. I think Inglourious Basterds could have been Tarantino's best movie if he had just found a better way to bring everything together.",8,1,3,25 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Men on a Mission
","It's a man on a mission story that focuses way too much time on one of the members of the gang to too little emotional impact, even though that's the obvious desire, to create an emotional impact. The movie ends up working despite the repeated emotional faceplants involving its main character because they're a relatively small part of the overall film, the rest being a pretty straight forward telling of a The Dirty Dozen type story...in SPACE!!!!The emotional problems with the film stem from the fact that Jyn Erso's character is caught between two father figures and neither one of them develops a relationship with her in the film itself. There's her father, the Imperial scientist with whom she, as a child and through a different actress than we see through the rest of the film, has a very brief scene where her father, Galen, tells her to run and hide from the Imperial officers coming to their remote farm in the first act. The other is Saw Gerrera, an extremist Rebel who takes in Jyn, but we never see them together in the first act. If the point of her journey, and the movie's emotional delivery, is supposed to be Jyn dealing with her absentee fathers, the movie never gives us a scene where Jyn is actually with them in any normal capacity. So, when she gets reunited with both of them at about the 30 minute mark of the film, the scenes are played with sweeping emotional music, but they fall flat. She's crying at reunions with people we've never seen her with, so it feels like it comes out of nowhere because it does. Everything feels incongruous to the situation because of the distinct lack of emotional connection.The majority of the film, though, isn't dedicate to Jyn's empty emotional connections but to the assembling of a team in a gritty warlike setting. The rest of the characters outside of Jyn have what feels like the correct amount of character. They're individualized enough visually to stand out with strong enough individual motivations to get them on board with the adventure believably. It's the sort of thing you would expect from a man on a mission type film.The mission itself is, of course, to locate the plans to the newest Imperial weapon, the Death Star. It all hinges on the lead engineer, Galen, having built a failure mechanism into the plans and getting that information to the nascent Rebel Alliance. As a side note, I've always preferred my pet theory that the fault was because the thermal exhaust port lead engineer couldn't get the funding he needed for all of the safety mechanisms, so he just finished at least one of them without the proper safety protocols. Anyway, this fault exists and the ragtag group of rebels end up going to the Imperial data storage facility on Scarif.The setup around Scarif is complicated, presenting the band with a series of obstacles that are clearly defined. The storytelling of the final large action sequence is some of the clearest in the movie, despite the visual chaos on screen. The rebels need to go from a landing pad into the tower of a facility, grab the plans, and then get to the top of the tower and the large satellite to transmit it to the Alliance. There arrives a space battle as well when the reticent Alliance comes to support the rebels on the ground who left without Alliance permission.This sequence is some of the brightest and prettiest of any action sequence in Star Wars, especially the stuff in space. There's also an inventiveness to the action, like the ramming of one Star Destroyer to hit another Star Destroyer, that feels fresh and fun at the same time.The antagonists of the film are a mixed bag to a certain degree. We have three, and only one was really necessary. The best of them, and possibly my favorite antagonist in all of Star Wars is Director Krennic. He's purely a bureaucrat who's driven by the fact that he feels like he's not getting enough credit for the completion of the Death Star and that he got passed over for a promotion. It's the sort of tangible motive that's missing from most characters in general in big genre films. His drive is really fun. Then we have Tarkin, the CGI recreation of Peter Cushing (that really isn't that bad, just still inside the Uncanny Valley), who functions more as Krennic's antagonist. He still fits the film, though I would call him as much a distraction as anything else. And then we have Darth Vader, who was obviously added greatly in reshoots. His contributions to the film don't move anything in the film, including his much ballyhooed fight in the hallway which looks cool but happens after the central conflict is over, providing just one more meaningless obstacle that wasn't previously established and is only there to give Vader, who doesn't matter to the film in any way, a moment to shine.So, the movie has some biggish flaws, like Jyn's emotional black hole and an overabundance of villains, but it also does a lot right. The men on a mission story is well handled. The central villain is great. The movie looks good, and it ends with a very good final sustained sequence. Not great, but a solid entertainment.",7,1,4,19 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Coherently bad
","This is a movie with some ideas that fail at their execution, but at least it has some ideas. I don't mean thematic ideas, but some basic structural ideas that place it above the worst of Marvel's films that were more hodgepodge collections of different things thrown together to hit feature length.Vers is a Kree military operative sent to fight the Skrulls on a planet. She gets captured and we see a montage that makes perfect sense to the audience instantly but Vers doesn't understand at all. That's a frustrating situation for an audience, watching your protagonist slowly catch up with what you've figured out already. Anyway, she ends up thrown to Earth where she promptly shoots off the head of an Arnold Schwarzenegger on a True Lies stand up in the middle of a Blockbuster Video (because she's the new badass action hero, I guess). She is chasing some Skrulls and gets involved with Agent Nick Fury of SHIELD. They buddy up and head to a secret Air Force base that Vers' fractured memories led them to. They discover that she was human and a pilot on Earth 6 years earlier (1989) right before she appeared with the Kree.The Kree continue to chase her as she gets to know the Skrulls and realize that they're not so bad, so she sides with them, finds a cloaked Kree base in orbit that's housed no one but a handful of Skrulls for six years. The Kree then show up and Vers embraces her human side (which was enhanced by techno babble gobbledygook energy stuff that gave her super powers) and single handedly destroys a Kree warship, sending the rest running.Alright, this movie is dumb, and bad. However, it's half a step up from Ant-Man and the Wasp because it's story is cohesive (even if dumb). The basic plot of the film mirrors Carol Danvers' (her real name) personal journey. As she personally gains knowledge of her past, her conflict with the Skrulls diminishes and her conflict with the Kree grows. It's held pretty consistently through the whole movie, and it makes the film a whole story.And then, the particulars of that story are pretty bad. Chunks of this movie make no sense, but the largest piece is probably the origin of Danvers' power and her inclusion in the Kree. So, reordering how it's delivered in the film, Danvers is a pilot for a Kree hiding out as a human and using our tech to test some new lightspeed drive (why Earth? Why not a more advanced planet? Why not anything else?), the plane gets attacked by a Kree ship and crashes. The scientist Kree (Mar Vell) dies and Danvers tries to take a stand, shoots the ship and gets slathered with the science fantasy goop that gives her powers. The Kree then, instead of killing her, take her with them, somehow wipe her memories, and add her to their military strike forces. However, instead of bringing her in order to use these powers, they're constantly trying to tamp them down. Why bring her along? If all they wanted was a human with flight experience, they could have grabbed someone not slathered in science fantasy goop who doesn't exhibit signs of super powers. How she got to the Kree military and how they handle her makes no sense in the least.There's a tonal problem as well, and it stems from the fact that Brie Larson has terrible comic timing. They want her to be a new Tony Stark, quippy and fun while kicking ass, but she doesn't have nearly the same level of charm. Her pauses between lines, the sort that make them funny, are too fast and they induce groans rather than smirks. The buddy cop quality of her time with Sam Jackson as Nick Fury is okay, but that's driven more by Jackson than her.On top of that, the movie is kind of ugly to look at. It seems to be trying to strike a balance between the cosmic colorfulness of Guardians of the Galaxy with the toned down Earthiness of Iron Man or the Earth stuff in Thor, but the scenes filmed outside of Earth are awful to look at. They use a dark green and black color scheme combined with an incessant need to dim the lights that produces images that are simply hard to see. Then, when the action gets to Earth, it goes in the exact opposite direction with flat imagery, bright lights, and little color design at all. It looks more like a television show than a big budget film.So, yeah, it's not as manically unfocused as some of the worst Marvel films, but that doesn't suddenly make it good. It's cohesively bad.",4,8,12,26 November 2019
Iron Man 2," What, exactly, is the story here?
","Tony dealing with death? Vanko exacting revenge for his father's death? Tony figuring out how to operate alongside the United States military? This film is just so jam packed full of stuff that nothing ever develops, everything fights with everything else for screen time, and all we really get is a jumbled experience.In the wake of Tony Stark revealing himself to the world to be Iron Man, Ivan Vanko is by his father's deathbed in Russia. Papa Vanko had once worked with Tony's father to develop the Arc Reactor (the big version of the shiny thing in Tony's chest) before being deported back to Russia. Driven by revenge, Vanko replicates the miniature arc reactor (that apparently only he and Tony can create) in his crappy Russian living space and disappears for half an hour. Meanwhile, Tony is dealing with mystery disease that's tied to his chest piece and poisoning his blood somehow. This will drive Tony and his motives for about half the movie when it will magically get cured and never mentioned again. He's running an Expo, or something, which allows him to be a rich eccentric and go to Monaco where he will drive a Formula 1 car in the Gran Prix. It is here that Vanko reveals his Iron Man inspired whips and nearly kills Tony before promptly getting captured by police.Justin Hammer, the CEO of a competitor to Stark Industries for defense contracts (does Stark still supply the military or not?), frees Vanko from prison because he is an idiot who thinks he can control a maniac who walked onto the tracks of a Formula 1 race and used electrified whips to try and kill Tony Stark. He tasks Vanko with creating Hammer version of the Iron Man suit. Vanko doesn't do this and instead creates drones. Hammer, who is an idiot, decides that this is cool after a quick freak out that means nothing.Tony, meanwhile, is suffering from his magical disease and breaking down emotionally. This is easily the best part of the movie. It's almost, at most, 30 minutes long in a 2-hour film. The reasons for his disease are ill-defined and the resolution is pure cheating, but Tony's descent into despair works. He's on top of the world on the outside, but he's hiding his decline from everyone. It's eating him up and he become increasingly self-destructive to the point that he dons his Iron Man suit at his birthday party and gets into a fight with his best friend Rhodey who stole another Iron Man suit for the conflict (why Tony keeps power supplies in the suits when they actually go in his chest I do not know). Nick Fury shows up, gives Tony a 'temporary' cure to his disease that wipes away the disease instantly before Tony creates an impossible new element in a scene even more ridiculous than the similar scene in the first film where he made an arc reactor in a cave. Welp! He's not dying anymore! That's story's done! And the movie goes on for another 40 minutes.This is all setup for the final confrontation at Tony's Expo where Hammer reveals the drones, they promptly go on the rampage Hammer couldn't predict (because he is an idiot), and both Tony and Rhodey work to fight them. The actions scenes in general are well filmed and executed well, but much like Tony's central story, they are unmoored from the rest of the film. They're unrelated to Tony's actual story and the rest of the film around them.Downey Jr. is just as winning as Tony Stark as before, but the movie around him is even more of a mess than the first. The rest of the cast is fine, with a special nod to Sam Rockwell as Hammer who plays an idiot really well. Overall, though, the film is a disaster. Too muddled and filled with unrelated stuff, it never figures out how to tell any of its stories well. It's a mess.",3,1,2,25 November 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Kinda works as a comedy, but only kinda
","This is the first movie in the Alien franchise that makes no attempt to be a horror film. Instead, it's a blackly comic action movie, and I think it sort of works. Sort of.There's a lot of handwaving away of certain practical elements like the source of DNA used to clone Ripley, or how her DNA includes the DNA of the alien, or how, if they had both, they couldn't just clone the alien and not Ripley. But, hey! If they don't do this, then there's no movie! So, handwaving is somewhat appropriate.What that creates is a character that looks like Ripley but is not actually her. There's talk about her inheriting the original Ripley's memories (through some handwaving), but there's never really an exploration of Ripley dealing with the fact that she's not really Ripley. She just kind of becomes a more badass version of Ripley because she's got some alien traits now. This could be an interesting place to start Ripley. She's new, not quite the same, not quite sure of who she is or what her new relationship with the aliens is. But, she's lost in the movie.The plot of the film is standard Alien stuff. A shady organization (the military this time) wants to capture the alien and use it for its own purposes, but the alien cannot be controlled and runs amok. At the center are a group of working class people who have to find a way to fight back and escape the enclosed space they are trapped in with the antagonistic aliens. All of the Alien movies have this basic plot, so it's hard to hold that against the fourth entry.The single largest problem with the movie is the fact that it tries to be an ensemble piece, but it's a grand 108 minutes long with extended action sequences. That's not a lot of time to spend with the array of characters that Joss Whedon wrote and Jean-Pierre Jeunet created as the writer and director. Ripley gets lost among the other characters like General Perez, Call, Dr. Gediman, and Vriess. You would expect the movie to cull the herd like the rest of the franchise does, but a shocking number of characters survive to the end, further muddying the waters. Cutting the cast down from the beginning, or killing off a lot more at the start of the mayhem, may have allowed a bit of narrative clarity that the movie as it stands currently lacks.Where this movie shines is in how it embraces weirdness and black humor. Reactions to deaths, odd designs, and Dan Hedaya's entire performance provide regular, if intermittent, comedic value to a movie that would otherwise be rather dreary. Ripley's own complete nihilism is a good source for some laughs as well, though her sudden scene of attempted pathos when she comes across the seven previous attempts at clones falls flat in comparison.Probably my favorite bit of weirdness, though, comes near the end. Long after the Queen taken from Ripley's chest has laid a series of eggs that have birthed facehuggers that have subsequently impregnated human subjects with xenomorphs (this life cycle is complex), we discover that the Queen isn't actually laying eggs anymore. There's no real explanation for the change, but we do get the magnificent image of an alien Queen laid back with her legs spread wide and a giant womb that births a weird alien human hybrid. I do not understand how that image could have ever been intended as something serious. It's just simply way too out there and bizarre for that. It has to be an attempt at absurdist humor, and I embrace it as such. The design of the hybrid seems like a reasonably logical extension of the idea, but it's still so thoroughly off-putting (especially that little upturned nose at the end of its snout) that it feels like poorly executed weirdness.The action scenes are reasonably well executed, but the only one that really stands out is the underwater chase. I suppose it stands out most because it's unlike anything in the franchise up to that point and it's the first one that includes a fully CGI (and rather well done) xenomorph that moves swiftly through the water. There's no real terror to the image, though. The movie embraces the visceral nature of the beast but never really tries to make it scary.Still, the movie's a mixed bag. I appreciate the humor and some of the design, but I find the story overall confused and the rest of the design uninspired or off-putting. It's not the complete disaster some people make it out to be. If it weren't funny, I'd agree, but those chuckles I get through the film carry it quite a bit.",5,1,2,26 November 2019
12 Monkeys," One of Gilliam's finest works
","Watching all of a film director's movies in a row provides a certain clarity around theme, especially regarding a director like Terry Gilliam who's movies always revolve around very similar themes, mostly dealing with the intersection of fantasy and reality. It's evolved from the hopeless disconnect of perpetual optimism of Denis in Jabberwocky to the fantastical escapes by Kevin, Sam, and the Baron in Time Bandits, Brazil, and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen to the broaching of mental illness and grief for both Parry and Jack in The Fisher King. Twelve Monkeys uses the ideas of time travel and mental illness to ask a lot of the similar questions Gilliam had been asking for over a decade. Namely, he was asking about where the line between fantasy and reality should be, whether we should cast off imaginative thought in our day to day lives.The movie is intentionally muddy about what is real and what is not, giving equal cinematic treatment to things in the past and the present (or present and the future, from the audience's point of view). Gilliam loves his Dutch angles and the exaggerated focus inherent in wide angle lenses in closeup on a characters' face, and it's always meant to imply a skewed reality. In that way, he films both everything in the future and everything in the psych wards using the same methods, saving the more traditional straight on framing for smaller scenes where Cole, the main character, feels some sense of calm, like when he's driving with his psychologist and listening to music. This sense of disorientation lends itself to the central path that Cole follows where he questions the nature of his reality.So, the reality that he starts in is a future where humanity has all been wiped out from a virus, relegated to a meager existence underground ruled by a scientist collective that's solely occupied with finding a cure. They have developed time travel technology and send back undesirables to gather information about the origin of the pandemic. The science is imprecise, so people get thrown about into all sorts of times like the middle ages, World War I, and 1990 when the target is 1996, a few months before the start of the outbreak in 1997. They know that the epidemic started in Philadelphia and focus on a terrorist faction called the Twelve Monkeys that plastered the city with graffiti about how they 'did it'.Cole first gets sent to 1990 where he's immediately picked up and placed in a mental institution. He's an unstable person to begin with, but time travel and his talk about the present being the past just tells the authorities that he's a loony and deserves to be there. Again, this section of the film is filmed in the same exaggerated style as the stuff from the future, implying that we should treat both of them with same level of fantastical skepticism. And therein lies the literal mystery of the story: Is the future we see a construct of Cole's mind or is the past he's trapped in equally real?There's a small moment that I think helps illuminate this. When Cole first appears in the mental hospital, he's cornered by a man, dressed in a suit, who talks about mental divergence and how he's actually on another planet at the same time getting ready to quell the barbarian hordes on Pluto. He provides this literal possibility for Cole's condition, and then we never see him again. Perhaps this man in the suit wasn't mentally divergent, but actually was in two places at once.As with any Gilliam film, that literal question isn't the point. Also, with any Gilliam film, the madman ends up being right. At the center of Cole's struggles with his grasp on reality is Dr. Kathryn Railly, his psychiatrist. She comes into the film as dead certain of her 'religion', as she calls it, of psychiatry's grasp on the real vs. the unreal. However, as Cole keeps disappearing and re-appearing, even appearing in a photo from World War I, her faith in the certainty of her convictions gets shaken.The framing device of the whole movie implies the cyclical nature of Cole's existence. He has dreams of a memory from his childhood, from before the outbreak, where he's in an airport and witnesses a shooting. As the movie moves along and he becomes familiar with more principles in the 90s, we start seeing more of their faces in the recurring dream. This is most evidence when we see Jeffrey Goines, a fellow mental patient and the leader of the Twelve Monkeys, in his vision only after Cole meets him. I think this raises some practical questions about the ability to change time as well as Cole's grasp on reality, but again, they're not really the point. The point is that this dream, this fantasy, grounds him and provides him direction, giving him purpose in the face of all the questions that assault him.There's a wonderful twistiness to the film that's more than just being clever. The movie is certainly that, but at the heart of it is Cole's journey. He's so wracked by doubt about the basic fabric of reality around him, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, while Kathryn Railly tries to use her view of the world to make sense of it all. The score is oddly French, probably a nod to La Jetee, the French short film that inspired the movie. Brad Pitt is a maniac as Goines. It's Gilliam's most polished looking film while also maintaining his very particular flair. It's a very good movie, produced well, and with a surprisingly smooth production history, that stands as one of Gilliam's finest works.",10,3,4,23 March 2020
Au Revoir les Enfants," One of the Great small movies.
","Louis Malle is an interesting director. He never gained a huge following, and his best known movie is probably My Dinner with Andre (which I actually have never seen), but everything he made is eminently watchable. The most recent movie of his that I was exposed to was Vanya on 42nd Street, a performance of Chekov's Uncle Vanya presented as a rehearsal in a dilapidated theater. That film did more to enhance my opinion about the importance of actors than any other movie I've ever seen.ChildhoodAu Revoir Les Enfants is deceptively simple. It's the story of two boys in a Catholic boarding school outside of Paris during World War II. The main character, Julien, like the rest of the boys at the school, is the son of wealthy parents. Like most eleven year old boys, he has little understanding of the world outside his childish concerns. At one point he asks his older brother, who also goes to the same school, what a Yid is.François Quentin: A jew.
Julien Quentin: I know, but what exactly is a Jew?
François Quentin: Someone who doesn't eat pork.
Julien Quentin: Are you kidding me?
François Quentin: Not at all.
Julien Quentin: What have people got against them?
François Quentin: The fact they're smarter than us, and they crucified Jesus.
Julien Quentin: That's not true. It was the Romans. Is that why they have to wear yellow stars?This lack of understanding of the greater world around him mostly seems to confuse little Julien. As far as he knows, he's never met a Jew, but he does see them from time to time. There's an old man in a restaurant who gets threatened by Vichy French militia. There's a younger Jew who walks out of the public bath (which Jews are barred from entering in the first place).This inability to grasp the implications of anti-Semitism is made all the more potent with the addition of a new boy to the school: Jean Bonnett. He's obviously not like the other kids. He doesn't pray the Hail Mary with everyone else. He doesn't take communion. He doesn't even take Greek (because of his knowledge of Latin). Jean doesn't really notice Julien, he's just another one of the boys that picks on him for his last name ('Easter Bonnet' they call him), but the two begin a relationship that steadily grows as the film progresses.Slice of LifeThe relationship that develops between Julien and Jean feels shockingly real to me. It doesn't have a linear path. Instead, it ebbs and flows between moments and events that they both enjoy and small fights that erupt between them. With each moment they share, the two grow closer in the way that boys who fight often do.Whenever I hear actors talk about finding truth in their performances, I tend to roll my eyes. I find it pretentious talk, but I'm going to engage in some of that very same stuff now.Everything about this movie feels so very true, starting with the two boys themselves. Acting very understatedly and believably by two young performers (Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto) who almost never acted again, everything the two do and say feels genuine. The reading at night, the insults they hurl at each other, the way they avoid hiding away during an air raid just to play on a piano without any real rhyme or reason. All of it feels completely natural and believable. That believability about every little thing in the actors' performances really sells the reality of the movie as a whole.That believability doesn't end with just the performances. The movie was made in a small boarding school called the Institution Sainte-Croix outside of Paris. It was filmed entirely in winter so that when the boys complain of cold, it very well could be because they were actually really cold.The Real WorldI talked before about Julien's inability to understand the world around him. That attitude is very much not reflected in Jean, for Jean's secret is that he's a Jew on the run.The priests and teachers of the school have taken in three Jewish boys in an effort to hide them from the authorities. Julien has trouble connecting with people easily partially because he's so terrified that an errant word on his part, or on the part of another boy, could give away not only himself but the two others.There's a great moment in the latter half of the movie that highlights the difference in how Julien and Jean approach the world. All of the boys in the school have been sent out as two separate team to find a treasure. Julien gets separated from his team but finds the treasure on his own. Alone with night approaching, he looks around and finds Jean nearby.Julien Quentin: I found the treasure. All by myself.
Jean Bonnett: Are there wolves in these woods?Julien's mind is on play. Jean's is on the danger that surrounds him at all times.How does Julien combine his innocence of the world with Jean's fear that never goes away ('You scared?' Julien asks, 'All the time,' Jean replies)? He can't quite do it. He's no mature enough to understand. Through circumstance, Julien discovers that Jean's real last name is not Bonnett but Kippelstein, and in a fit of momentary rage threatens to tell everyone Jean's real last name. He has no idea of the implications of what that would entail.One Winter MorningThere's a subplot in the film about a cook's assistant who trades with the boys for their foods that their parents send them from home. Julien's mother gives him jam, so Julien trades with the cook's assistant for little things here and there in exchange.When the head of the school finds out that the cook's assistant not only was trading with the boys, but was helping to supply the black market from the school's kitchens, he's furious and fires the assistant. The assistant (Joseph) finds the act unjust, especially since the cook herself, according to him, did it just as much as he did, if not more. With nowhere to turn, Joseph turns informant based on the obvious suspicions around the three new boys (who never ate pork).The Gestapo shows up, knowing the real names of the three boys and saying that they had been looking for them for some time. As the chief officer is busy angrily tearing small USSR and USA flags out of a map, Julien quickly looks back to Jean. The Gestapo officer noticed the action out of the corner of his eye and simply walks over the Jean until Jean packs up his things and follows the Gestapo officer out.Other things play out for some time involving the teachers and the other two boys until the final moments of the film:With some attention and familiarity with French, you can hear the title of the movie spoken by the priest as he leaves. But the key is the final voiceover spoken by the film's director, Louis Malle.Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at Auschwitz; Father Jean at Mauthausen. The school reopened its doors in October. More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.The impressive emotional impact of the film itself combined with the fact that it's autobiographical to the film's director.This film is so small in scope but affects me so intently that I treasure the fact that I saw it right around the period that I was originally developing my top ten years back.",10,0,0,21 November 2019
The 13th Warrior," Separation of main character and protagonist
","You can separate your main character and you protagonist, but it's hard to do well. The 13th Warrior attempts it, but I don't think it's really all that successful. There's a technical polish to the film, especially in isolated sequences, and obvious talent behind the camera, but the story is surprisingly disengaging.The problems are obvious from the beginning with an introduction that hops and skips from Baghdad through a long land journey northwards to Viking territory, an attack on the road, a brief introduction to the Vikings, the introduction of the foreign threat they must face, and the absorption of the main character, Ahmad, into the group as the titular thirteen warrior. It's most jarring when the old crone announces to the surrounding tribe that the thirteenth is foreign (Ahmad being the only foreign man of fighting age there) and then there's a hard cut to him packing up his horse to go along with them. He's never given a moment to question the request or even consider it. He's just automatically part of it.The next major emotional hurdle comes when the group of thirteen warriors makes it across the water to find Hrothgar and his hall. There's no attempt to get to know the villagers cowering in fear of the Wendol terrorizing them. Instead we get some vague palace intrigue that culminates in a fight between one minor character and another person who never rises to the state of character that ultimately makes no difference to the story. Ahmad does get some intimate time with a young, attractive woman of the village, but it couldn't possibly leave an impression because she's in and out with little introduction.The movie works best when the action moves towards the quiet inspection of the clues in pursuit of the Wendol, the mass of bear men that descend on the village, killing as they will and taking the bodies of the slain to eat (this was based on Eaters of the Dead, of course). There's a scene where Ahmad and the other twelve find a ransacked farm, and the camera quietly moves through the farm to follow Ahmad as he walks in and out. It's a quietly effective scene.Action in general is dark but assured, but there's a curious distance to most of it because so few of the thirteen warriors make an impression. There's Ahmad, his friend Herger, and the leader Buliwyf who make a real impression, the rest just feel like background noise, and as the action scenes play out more and more of the background warriors get chopped away, feeling like little is being lost.Now, to talk about the difference between the main character and the protagonist. Ahmad is the main character, but Buliwyf is the protagonist. It's Buliwyf who makes the decisions that drive the gang from one place to the next. It's him who makes the large strategic decisions. It's him that the final battle ends up revolving around emotionally, and yet, we don't really follow him. We're with Ahmad all the way, playing as follower to those around him. That moment early when he suddenly joins the other twelve is a prime example. He exhibits no agency on his own. The rest of the twelve affirm their desires to go on the journey, but Ahmad just appears in line. His efforts to fit in range from rather ingenious (John McTiernan has a thing for intelligently demonstrating the transition of languages) to amusing, but the amusing bits aren't what drives the film, they end up feeling like distractions.A final note: There are serious questions about the film's authorship. By everything I've read, John McTiernan, the director, and Michael Crichton, the writer/producer, clashed extensively on set. After a disastrous test screening, McTiernan did not come back to the project (apparently off working on The Thomas Crown Affair that ended up releasing before The 13th Warrior), instead Crichton directed the rather extensive reshoots. So, who's film is this? McTiernan is listed as director, but it's an obviously compromised production with two authorial hands at play.I'm rather mixed on this film. From a purely technical perspective, there's a good bit worthwhile, but there's also a problem in terms of emotional disconnect based on some narrative choices that don't really work. The adaptation of Eaters of the Dead (which is, in turn, a rather clever take on Beowulf) could have been more engaging and entertaining than it is. It's far from a disaster, but also far from a success.",5,0,1,25 May 2020
Star Trek Into Darkness," Poorly told
","I was willing to chalk up a lot of the faults in 2009's Star Trek to the writer's strike that prevented rewrites, but the even larger issues with the follow up are a glaring signal that none of those issues with the previous film would have been fixed without the strike.I haven't seen the movie since it came out in theaters, but I distinctly remember liking it, enjoying it, and defending it to a certain degree over the last few years. However, as the movie started for this rewatch, I began to get a sinking feeling. The opening scene is dizzying and thinly entertaining, but it jumps between breezy fun and super serious really quickly. The super serious stuff feels unsupported and a bit flat. The movie continues on and the further into the movie we get the less important that opening becomes. The planet gets mentioned once more. The moral issue about applying the Prime Directive is gone by the thirty-minute point. The central conflict between Kirk's skirting of the rules and Spock's blind adherence to them is beyond muddled by the halfway point.And the tone never lightens up. One of the great appeals of J.J. Abrams' first Star Trek is its light and breezy tone that jumps from one impossible situation to the other. It makes taking some of its ridiculousness easier because the film wasn't asking us to take it that seriously but as popcorn entertainment. Into Darkness, though, is asking us to take things seriously. Very seriously. It just can't decide what it wants us to take seriously.The Prime Directive? The question of how closely to rules must we operate in order to be a good person? Drone strikes? Executions without due process? The militarization of Starfleet? Ship manifest integrity? Kidnapping frozen men and forcing them to build weapons for you? False flag operations in order to start a war? Literally every idea is there and treated equally, which means that we never get a sense of what this movie wants to say when it so obviously wants to say something.There's a great lesson in this film about showing not telling, the old writing rule of thumb about involving an audience in the actions of the film. Early, Kirk goes to Admiral Marcus after the terrorist we all know is Khan but no one else does has killed a bunch in Starfleet command, and Marcus tells Kirk that a war with the Klingons is inevitable. It's almost a throwaway line, but as the movie enters its third act an hour later, we realize that its central to Marcus' actions. The problem is, in this universe of films, we haven't seen the Klingons yet. They were mentioned a few times in the first movie and this scene in Marcus' office is the first time we've heard of it. If this is a man's motivation to undermine everything he believes in by militarizing an exploratory organization, are we the audience supposed to believe it or not?That display in Marcus' office is largely the level of thought put into every major moral question the movie throws at its characters. It feels like something a fifteen year old would write late into the night and hopped up on Red Bull. 'And then this, and then this, oh! And then this!' It reminds me a bit of the movie Van Helsing, but that creature feature never thought it was anything other than dumb fun and sort of works because of it. Into Darkness seems to think that it is a very serious movie indeed, and because it can't figure out what to say, the movie ends up feeling really flat.And that flatness really drags the movie down. It could have been fun. I still really liked the cast. Alice Eve is a winning addition as Carol Marcus. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good at chewing the scenery in a big emotional way as Khan. The original cast is largely good, though Chris Pine seems to have some trouble with the more serious things he needs to do. Overall, it's a good cast.The movie also looks great. I genuinely enjoy a few of the action sequences, especially the bit where Kirk and Khan fly from the Enterprise to Marcus' ship through the debris field.I want to end with a quick note about marketing. I'm always surprised at the number of people who hold a movie's marketing against a movie. The King Arthur movie from the mid 00's was billed as the 'real story', but it's really just a late-Roman telling of Arthur. Maybe it's closer to the idea of who Arthur actually was, but it's still just as fictional as Camelot. The movie itself never mentions the idea, and yet people hold that against the film. Maybe it's an excuse because they have trouble explaining why they don't like movies for specific reasons, but I still find it odd.In this case, Into Darkness's marketing hid the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing Khan. For the first half of the movie he's called John Harrison, and the marketing never broke from that fiction in the first half. Still, hiding Khan's identity from the characters made a certain amount of sense in the film. Khan Noonian Singh was a famous figure from the late 20th century in this universe. Having him interact with people using his own name would have raised flags. It's a fig leaf towards an explanation, though. They really could have just called him Khan and saved us the unintentionally amusing scene where he reveals his true identity to Kirk who then just keeps talking like Khan has said nothing particularly interesting, even though there's a pregnant dramatic pause after the line. I don't think it was a great decision to keep Khan's identity secret (I think the character is actually decently used overall in the film), but it probably should have just been avoided.",3,3,4,22 November 2019
Knives Out," Entertaining Whodunnit
","This reminds me a lot of The Prestige. Not so much in storytelling (though there are some similarities), but in terms of how a director made a very financially successful film and followed it up with something much smaller as a way to recharge his batteries. It's clever, witty, and fun, but it's more of a way for Rian Johnson to stretch his creative legs than anything else. Still, it's a good time at the movies.A lot got made of the film's early reveal of the central death, and it does provide a certain level of uncertainty as the film moves beyond it. It feels like there's no more of the mystery to explore for a long stretch, and we're left with our main character, Marta, as she navigates the mess she suddenly finds herself in. It's gonna be hard to talk about this movie without spoilers, so I'll actually give a warning. Skip to the final paragraph to skip the spoilers.So, Marta is Harlan Thrombey's nurse. He is the patriarch of a screwed up family allowed to be screwed up because of his financial success bred from a long series of detective and mystery novels (one of which is titled around knives, hence the circle of knives that features prominently in the marketing). The night of his 85th birthday, when his whole family came to visit, Marta accidentally gives Harlan 100mg of morphine. Knowing what she's done and unable to find the drug to counteract the morphine, she explains to Harlan that he's going to die in the next ten minutes. Harlan, seeing his impending death, the guilt that will be placed on Marta, knowledge of what he's done with his will recently, and desirous of keeping his family away from their inheritance completely, decides that he's going to cut his own throat, making his death an obvious suicide.Marta helped stage the scene as well, breaking back into the house to help clean up, but she left a trail of evidence that she never noticed and only becomes aware of as she walks with private detective Benoit Blanc through the scene. She's guilty of killing Harlan, but it was an accident. It was also obvious that Harlan liked her better than he liked any of his children. We end up liking her because of her innocence and her inability to lie (leading her to vomit every time that she tries), and as a contrast to the hornet's nest that is Harlan's family.Everyone hates everyone else. There are affairs, thefts, lack of ambition, and general unpleasantness all around. Harlan had bred a group of ungrateful loafs when he had thought that he was raising men and women who would build their own legacies as he had. He wants to cut them off for their own good. However, he told his grandson Ransom too early. This is where the twists actually begin to pile up. Ransom switched the medication in Marta's bag, so Marta hadn't actually poisoned Harlan and he had just killed himself. Ransom gets tricked into admitting it in front of the police (complete with Marta lying and holding in the vomit just long enough).The movie is clever. It tries to convince you early that you know the twists and that you're just going to follow the main character through the investigation that just won't stop because of the doggedness of Benoit Blanc, but it leaves more twists to come while providing enough time between to focus on Marta and her troubles to act as a convincing red herring while also creating enough character work to make people that we can invest in. There's a whole host of activity going on including a coroner's report, the housemaid, and a security videotape. Marta's journey through the morass of the family out to get her after they discover that Harlan left her everything in the will and Blanc's tireless pursuit of the truth moves through the family, eventually settling on Ransom as an unlikely ally.Ultimately, I found it entertaining but a bit thin. There is an idea about heritage and inheritance that runs through the film, but it seems small compared to the movements back and forth with the plot. Marta's likeable while the rest of the family are different degrees of awful. It's twisty and turny, keeping you guessing, and leaves satisfyingly. It's a nice time at the movies. I just hope that Johnson doesn't become solely dedicated to more films in this nascent series. It was amusing, but he could be doing more.",7,1,2,17 January 2020
The Irishman," A great epic from one of our great filmmakers
","The canvas is very large, but the story is actually quite small. It's about three men navigating the American culture of the 50s and 60s as they slowly fall onto opposites sides of an impossible divide. It's about a man who chose wrong and ends up alone. It's also expertly and energetically told by one of the great filmmakers using advanced tools as effectively as possible.From the outset, it's clear that this story is filtered through one old man's memory. Frank Sheeran, in his 80s and living in a retirement community, speaks to us of his story that began in the 40s when he was a member of the Teamsters Union, driving a truck full of meat around Philadelphia. He figures out little ways to make those around him happy at the expense of those actually supplying the meat until he shows up at his destination with an empty truck. His loyalty to his friends catches the eye of Russell Buffalino, a mob boss who takes a shining to the Irishman, especially when he displays a propensity for the Italian language picked up while serving under General Patton. Through Russell, Frank meets Jimmy Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters Union. Younger than both, Frank looks at Russell and Jimmy as surrogate father figures who provide him with opportunities for advancement in life including the presidency of a local chapter of the Teamsters Union.However, nothing can always been happy in this world, and Russell and Jimmy end up in opposition around the direction of the Union after Jimmy gets thrown into prison on fraud charges. When Jimmy gets out, he hates how his chosen successor has become a doormat to mob interests, using the pension fund as an source of interest free loans to mobsters across the country. Jimmy wants to return the Union to its more idealistic and legal roots, but Russell has been one of those who has received greatly from the new order. Jimmy threatens everything, and Russell can't tolerate that.However, the great thing about this large section of the film (it's the middle two hours) is that the animosity that grows isn't explosive or angry, but quiet and almost sad. Russell likes Jimmy, and the idea that it falls on him to arrange and onto Frank to execute the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa brings him no joy. Frank becomes a tool, caught between his two mentors and unable to say no to either of them, so he follows through on Russell's orders, meets Jimmy in Detroit and shoots him in an empty house.This two hour section almost feels like someone else's movie, like Frank is a side-character in the film named after him, but it's the final forty-five minutes that really drives home whose story this is. It is 100% Frank's.Throughout the film, Scorsese will introduce certain minor characters with a freeze frame and a quick bit of text that describes how they'll die horrifically several decades later (such as, 'Shot six times in the back of the head in his own kitchen'). This prevents the audience from staying purely in the moment portrayed, always reminding us of the inevitable and tragic end that's surely to come, and considering that it's all told from Frank's unreliable narrator of a character decades after the rest of the characters have died, it provides a certain melancholic air that never really leaves the film. That melancholy really extends from Frank's own sense of isolation, which we get in great detail at the end of the film.Frank had four daughters, and the film has used one, Peggy, as a nearly silent observer of Frank's behavior. Peggy has relationships with both Russell and Jimmy as well. With Russell, she's cold and distant, only ever giving small one note responses to his efforts to win her affections. Jimmy, on the other hand, has a very easy rapport with her and buys her ice cream which she accepts gleefully. Peggy, much like Frank, is somehow caught between the two men, but she sees the two men far more clearly than Frank does. Peggy can sense the violence within Russell that Frank either can't see or excuses away, and she also sees Jimmy's innate goodness. Frank loves them both, but Peggy easily decides between them. She not only sees the difference in character between the two men, but Peggy also represents Frank's isolation from his own family. He doesn't take into account what his family would think when he chooses to follow Russell's order to kill Jimmy, and that act severs what little connection he had with his family up to that point.A good bit has been made of the great final shot of the film showing Frank alone in his room at the retirement home, only those paid to see him as errant company, but there's another shot a bit earlier that I think encapsulates the finality of Frank's isolation even better. Nearly crippled, hobbled on a pair of canes, Frank goes to the bank where Peggy works as a teller and tries to force a conversation with her. We only see her very briefly in a panning shot after Frank gets to the front of the line and Peggy very quickly sets up a sign saying that her position is empty and she walks right out of frame. It's very quick, maybe half a second long, but the swiftness of Peggy's disappearance is what gives the moment its power. Not only does Frank barely get a look at her, but we can barely see her either.The movie's huge and intimate all at once. The special effects to de-age our three main actors are largely very good. It leaves with such a complete sense of solemn loss and isolation that gets built up to exceedingly well over the course of its three and a half hours. I loved this film. It's not one of Scorsese's best, but with a filmography like his, it's hard to get into that very top tier reserved for The Last Temptation of Christ and Silence.",10,9,18,30 November 2019
Alexander," The Final Cut
","Yes, Oliver Stone's Final Cut of Alexander improves the film over both the theatrical and director's cuts. No, it's not suddenly some misunderstood masterpiece waiting for rediscovery. It's still a bad film, just not quite as bad as the other two previous cuts.There are changes throughout the movie, and the most obvious change is Stone's commitment to his idea that Alexander's youth and his conquest of Asia should be told concurrently. This execution is ultimately a very mixed bag with cuts that feel either really thin or completely unrelated alongside some others that highlight some interesting comparisons or contrasts here or there. The film is also more than thirty minutes longer than the previous cuts, but there is no single added sequence that sustains that. It's all a series of small additions here and there, mostly around the Persian boy slave that Alexander takes with him to India. He also rearranged one particular sequence that, in my opinion, made that sequence a whole lot better.As I said, it's a mixed bag.Like the Director's Cut, the movie goes from the death of Alexander to Ptolemy narrating, but it then breaks and jumps straight into the Battle of Gaugamela. This is a flabbergasting decision on my part, not because a story of Alexander's conquest of Asia can't begin at Gaugamela (I would have personally started it in Egypt as he's crowned Pharaoh), but because the movie wasn't filmed for it. Our first clear visual look of Alexander in the movie is kind of great, with him on a high rise looking out over the armies as a battle commander, but we then cut to him mid-explanation of the battle plans. It was fine in the Theatrical Cut when the segue worked from his youth to that point, well, it worked well enough, but this is the first time we hear him talk and he's halfway through an emotional explanation of his plans. It's jarring at best.It jumps back to Alexander's time with Olympias and Philip's drunken attempt to force her into sex that started the main story in the other cuts, but the jump feels weird at best. There is an ultimate point to it, mirroring Alexander's defeat of Darius with his victory in taming Bucephalus, which is kind of interesting, but I don't think it outweighs the awkwardness of the cut. However, how this sequence ends and what it feeds into is the best single cut in the new edition of the film. We watch the scene where Philip explains the myths to Alexander in the caves below Pella, with much talk of glory and myth, and cut right to Alexander marching into Babylon in glorious fashion. That edit might be the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, what follows is the same awkwardly filmed scene of Colin Farrell not quite fitting the role and extreme closeups that minimize the effect of the large sets as we saw in the previous two cuts of the film. See? There's only so much that can be improved by this cut.The other major additive this cut has is the rearrangement of the wedding between Alexander and Roxana. In the previous two versions, we watch the sequence and it feels random. There's Roxana's dance, an argument between Alexander and his generals, the wedding, and then the wedding night. It makes the decision feel like it's purely driven by sexual urges and there's no real build to the sequence. In this new cut, we see the wedding first, then the argument, then the dance, and then the wedding night. It's a much better sequence of events that gives everything a build towards a climax, so to speak.The movie underneath the structural changes is the same flawed, way too tightly filmed, and weirdly performed mess of a film. The changes make some interesting choices, but they can't save the film in the least. I've read a lot and watched a lot about the making of this movie, including a long interview with the director of photography, Rodrigo Prieto, and it's obvious that so much effort and love went into the film. Stone had a story he didn't know how to tell, but he was going to make his best effort to tell it.After three cuts, I think it's safe to say that Oliver Stone's ambition was simply too great for his talents. Yes, fortune favors the bold, but that doesn't mean the bold always succeed.Alexander is a bad film, and no amount of tinkering around the edges was going to fix that.",4,0,1,16 June 2020
Aquaman," Expensive Looking, for sure
","I'll have to write through the DCEU at some point, but I guess I'm starting here. I'm one of those weird people that really likes Zack Snyder's take on the Superman and Batman stories. There's real cinematic ambition at work there, and while its reach may exceed its grasp, it tries to be mythic in scope. James Wan's Aquaman is a very different animal. It's certainly big and obviously very expensive, but the film feels smaller, and its not the stakes at play. Also, it seems obvious that Wan's time making mediocre popcorn horror films have not taught him the ins and outs of how to build a story.Looking through some positive reviews of the film I see some common themes. There's a lot of praise for the visuals, the special effects, the action, and the humor. Well, the movie certainly very often looks quite expensive and it sometimes does look pretty good (especially the Trench attack late in the film), but this is mostly praise for a film's ability to hire hundreds of visual effects artists more than anything else. A lot of this is to do with the movie's poor world building.The story first, though. Arthur Curry is the son of the queen of Atlantis and some guy who lives in a house by the sea in New England. Being the son of the queen of Atlantis, he has special water powers like breathing underwater and swimming really fast and, apparently, being just this side of invincible. After his mother gets torn from him at a very young age, Nuidis, the vizier from Atlantis, comes and trains him for years in short little scenes that don't even amount to a training montage. After the events of Justice League, Arthur is somewhat responsible for the death of a pirate, leaving the pirate's son itching for murder. In the middle of the ocean, Orm, Arthur's half-brother from their mother and another Atlantian, is consolidating power to become the Ocean Master and wage war on the surface. This doesn't sit well with Nuidis or Mera, Orm's betrothed and daughter to another of the sea kings. They go off to recruit Arthur to challenge Orm and become King of Atlantis.So, when this movie isn't giving us really expensive special effects shots of submarines, giant seahorses, and vibrantly colored underwater cities, it's giving us really boring scenes where people with names we cannot remember explain things to other people with names we cannot remember. In most movies, these would be done in bland environments, but in Aquaman, they're done in, well, bland environments with some thin layers of water effects around them. Seriously, most of the world building in this film is Orm flatly explaining to people his plan to consolidate power without giving us a clear view of who in Earth he's talking about.Then, for really inexplicable reasons, the movie decides to become an Indiana Jones knockoff for about forty minutes where Arthur and Mera have to take a thing to a place where they get another thing which they have to take to another place which directs them to another place and finally directs them to the Trench, one of the seven kingdoms under the sea. This is where the funny is supposed to come in, but like pretty much every scene in the film, nothing here feels fleshed out enough to carry any amount of character beyond some quick quips (which, of course, means that Arthur and Mera are going to totally fall in love by the end). I would say it's an excuse to get them out of the way of Orm so that Orm can consolidate more power while they're away, but they end up trapped in the Trench with no escape at one point. Instead of having a forty minute and unsatisfying Indiana Jones knockoff, they could have given us twenty minutes of the pair trying to find a way out, getting to know each other, and then finding the surprise guest near the end.For a movie that's a hundred and sixty minutes long, it does feel shockingly short in some ways, and that's because it doesn't spend any time with any single scene beyond those that demand lots of special effects, like fights. It's paced very quickly, and that ends up being a bad thing because it makes the film very thin where character interactions feel perfunctory rather than meaningful.And, the special effects. Again, this movie very often looks expensive, but it only occasionally looks good. The approach to the Trench, when Arthur and Mera have to jump from their rinky dink boat and into the water (why two creatures that can swim much faster than a small boat can putter along actually take the boat, I do not know) actually looks really striking as Arthur holds out a series of flares that lights them and the swarm of creatures trying to get to them that surrounds them. However, the flight through Atlantis offers a good counterpoint. It's full of colors and it looks like a team of digital artists spent hundreds of hours each on every little detail to bring it out, but it ends up feeling flat because we don't get any sense of what anything we're seeing is. This is where some actual world building would have benefited the film, allowing us time to explore Atlantis a bit with Arthur as our eye and ears into this new world, learning about what's going on in this fantastic city. Instead, they quickly move to a sunken ship where they hide away from the special effects and then have a fight.I really did not like this movie. It's thin with little focus and an almost complete inability to tell a story. I imagine it's not going to age particularly well for those who were blown away by it on their first viewing.",3,0,0,7 July 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Colors! Funnies! A decent antagonist! Just enough story to tie it all together!
","Well, that's certainly nice to have.What makes this movie work is its sense of outlandish fun which seeps into every part of the filmmaking process. From the script to performances and even set design and special effects, the movie prioritizes being fun over anything else. I think it muddles some of the basic storytelling elements, but not enough to actually drag the movie down that much.Thor is away from Asgard trying to prevent a recurring dream he's been having of Ragnarok taking place and wiping out his home world, so he has come to find Surtur, the demon who will perform that apocalypse and defeats him in battle. Upon returning to Asgard, he discovers that Odin is not Odin but Loki in disguise. Taking Loki with him, they find Odin and discover that their never mentioned (honestly, for good reasons within the narrative) older sister, Hela the goddess of Death, has been waiting for the power within Odin to dissipate with his death to return and lay claim to Asgard. Thor and Loki get cast out and land on a trash covered planet where Thor gets roped into gladiatorial games that have been using the Hulk for the past two years. Thor teams up with Hulk, Loki, and a long drunk Valkyrie to escape the planet, go to Asgard, and eventually give the planet up to Surtur in an effort to save the people of Asgard over the place itself.That second to last sentence above? That's about an hour of the film, and it was the core of my reticence of the film's efficacy as a story. There's a thick layer of humor and fun over that hour, but I didn't quite understand the purpose of it narratively. Perhaps too much time is dedicated to the Hulk, who carries much of the humor and subplot within that hour, but ultimately the hour does serve a narrative purpose. Thor begins the film trying to prevent Ragnarok as heir to the throne of Asgard, and he ends the film as king of Asgard while triggering Raganarok. That's quite a journey, and it felt like most of that came in the final act when he faces Hela and realizes the scope of the danger she represents. However, the full hour in the middle does show the other part of Thor's journey, that of him becoming king. It's done with brightly colored sets, costumes, and lots of humor, but it's still there. Thor starts with nothing and ends that hour with a following. He starts the process of learning how to apply the lessons Odin had taught him about being king and developing relationships with people to create loyalty in a populace. It's not the focus of that section, the humor definitely is, but it raises the humor from being merely fun into actually serving the story to some degree (I still think this could be stronger).But the movie is really only trying to be fun, right? Its only purpose is to make you smile for two hours, right? Well, it's still trying to tell a narrative story, and it's valid to judge the film's merits on that level. It would be find if the movie only wanted to make us laugh, then it could be a sketch show of two hours and it could work quite well at that, however the film does have characters, a plot, and a theme at its core. To ignore that all in favor of just the giggles is a disservice to the film as a whole.From Korg, the rock monster, to Thor's new flippant attitude, to Skurge's pride in his stuff (like 'Des' and 'Troy'), the movie wishes primarily to provide light entertainment and it succeeds quite well at that. It also does that in a vividly visual design sensibility that uses color in set design unlike anything Marvel had done before. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies started the bright, cosmic, colorful trend in visual storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Thor: Ragnarok takes it in a direction with more straight lines and clear delineation between the colors. It creates a unique look both in and out of the MCU. The use of music is also similar to that in Guardians, but the influences are of a different era and style (a good helping of Led Zeppelin, for instance) that gives Ragnarok an entirely different energy.The acting is quite entertaining throughout, with no one quite taking their roles too seriously. Chris Hemsworth is having a blast as Thor, Tessa Thompson is happily drunk as Valkyrie, Mark Ruffalo is appropriately befuddled as Banner, and Cate Blanchett is sexy and appropriately hammy as Hela. Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable, but there was definite room for tightening the narrative a bit.",7,1,4,26 November 2019
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's best film
","A group of people are stuck in a small place in the middle of a blizzard that keeps them from escaping all while questions of who is actually who they say are abound, but enough about The Thing.Out of all of Tarantino's movies, this is the one that feels most like a novel. I know people equate it to a stage play, mostly because of the amount of dialogue and the limited location, but I feel like it has more in common with a literary creation than a theatrical one. Scenes play out at the kind of pace that you might expect from a book. They're steady and about building character more than anything else. I love luxuriating in these long passages as we figure out who the people in Minnie's Haberdashery are.The movie begins some miles away, though. On a mountain road, a black bounty hunter sits alone on a trio of corpses he's trying to bring into Red Rock, Wyoming. A stagecoach drives up carrying another bounty hunter and his live bounty, one Daisy Domergue, wanted for murder with a price of $10,000 on her head, dead or alive. The two bounty hunters come to an agreement to allow Marquis Warren onto the stagecoach as long as he helps protect John Ruth's bounty. The interactions between all three range from outright hostile (between Ruth and Domergue) to cautiously respectful (between Warren and Ruth). Warren eventually shares his Lincoln letter with Ruth, a letter written to Warren directly from Abraham Lincoln from when Warren was a cavalry officer during the Civil War.As they get closer to Red Rock, they pick up Chris Mannix who says that he's the new sheriff of Red Rock, but with the blizzard bearing down on them, they can't make it to Red Rock. They're going to make it to the only place between them and the town, a haberdashery run by Minnie and Sweet Dave, neither of whom are actually there when the three arrive to find the door broken and won't shut all the way without nailing in some boards to keep it in place. Something is obviously wrong.Tarantino, though, doesn't press that feeling just yet. He's got three hours to tell his story, and he's not in a huge rush to get to the end. The first half of the movie is really just scenes of getting to know the hateful eight characters. Aside from the four in the carriage, there's also the Confederate general, the cowboy, the Mexican, and the little man. There are connections between some of them that get dug out. Mannix's father was an officer in the Confederacy, and General Smithers had heard of him while Mannix had certainly heard of Smithers and revered him. Warren and Smithers had actually shared a battlefield at Baton Rouge, a battle noted by Warren for the savagery the Confederate army had exhibited towards the black Union soldiers, but Mannix, as the representative of the law, isn't going to allow Warren to cold-bloodedly murder Smithers no matter what Smithers ordered in the war, especially in the service of the Confederacy. So, Warren places a revolver next to Smithers in his chair and then proceeds to tell Smithers a tale about how Warren had met Smithers' son when he had come looking to collect on the bounty the Confederacy had placed on Warren's head. I'm fairly convinced that Warren lies extensively through the whole story (Tarantino offers it narrative credence by showing it occurring on screen instead of just allowing Warren to tell it), and it is enough to get Smithers to reach for the gun. Warren, though, is too fast and kills Smithers before Smithers can do the same to him.So begins the death at Minnie's Haberdashery, an act of vengeful murder masked as self-defense.That murder, though, is of a vastly different character as what comes next. It serves as a distraction for the poisoning of the coffee pot which ends up killing Ruth and their driver O.B. (not one of the hateful eight, apparently). These killings are done to weed out those not in on the rescue of Daisy, and suspicion, as well as tension, suddenly shoots up. We, as the audience, have known that something was wrong since they first arrived at the remote haberdashery, but we could never quite put our own fingers on it. Warren, though, has an inkling. He's been the Minnie's before, and he points out the inconsistencies, executing one of the three remaining of the four he had found upon first arriving (Mexican Bob). Gunplay ensues including shots fired from under the floorboards.Tarantino then does a signature jump backwards in time for a chapter dedicated to the events leading up to the beginning of the film. We see four men jump from a stagecoach earlier in the day. They settle in, we get to know the people already there including Minnie and Sweet Dave, before the four unleash hell and kill everyone except General Smithers whom they keep alive for character and to help sell the reality of the situation without Minnie around. One of these four is Jody, Daisy's brother, there to save his sister from the hangman.Jumping back to the present, we see how the rest plays out, and it's apocalyptic in feel. People die, blood gets splattered (especially in Daisy's face), and everyone's bleeding out. It seems like the movie has embraced nihilism completely, but I would disagree. Mannix and Warren are the last two alive, and they're both dying. Mannix asks to see this Lincoln letter that Warren has, and Warren hands it over. Reading it over, we recall an earlier scene where Mannix called the letter a complete fiction and Warren copped to it, but in their final moments, Mannix finds great solace in those invented words from Abraham Lincoln.Like in much of Tarantino's work, there's an element of the metanarrative at play, and here, in The Hateful Eight, it demonstrates the power of fiction to move us. Warren probably invents the story of Smithers' son's death, and it moves the old general enough to throw the rest of his life away. Daisy swears to a story of fifteen more members of her gang waiting to come and kill Mannix and Warren if they don't let Daisy go, and the story has an effect for a while. And finally the letter that Mannix has called a fake (which he crumples up and tosses aside after reading it) soothes him in his final moments after the worst day of his life.So, why do I love this movie so much? I remember off handedly mentioning the fact that I think that this is Tarantino's best movie to some people, thinking the comment was uncontroversial, and I was completely unprepared for the blowback. Some people hate this movie as much as the characters hate each other, and I honestly do not see why. Yes, the movie is slow, but it's slow in much the same way Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, and Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood are slow. All four movies take their time to build characters and set the scene before throwing their characters at each other to bloody result. The characters here are awful people, but so are most of the characters in all of Tarantino's movies. I love hearing them talk, egging each other on, and even beginning to respect each other. I love the 70mm cinematography, even if most of it is relegated to the haberdashery. I love the score from Morricone. The performances are great. The Hateful Eight creates a world that I simply love to luxuriate in. I simply love it as a film, and yes, I do think it's Tarantino's best work.",10,1,3,25 November 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Lower stakes combine with solid storytelling
","It's nice to peel back from world ending consequences and just deal with a bad guy who wants to steal stuff. It's the kind of job for a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. And it's not just the basic conflict that smaller in scale, the thematic and character driven ground of the film is smaller as well, but that's a good thing.Peter Parker, after his brush with the Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, hangs out in Queens, looking for little things to help with, in his new suit built by Tony Stark. It's high tech, and it's giving him an inflated view of his place in the world. He wants more than just helping little ladies with directions. He wants to be an Avenger. He wants to participate in the large scale world ending events that the rest of the team helps with, but no one will return his calls.His opportunity comes when he foils a bank robbery involving high tech weaponry. Through a bit of a coincidence, he figures out the next step in an investigation that leads to the Vulture, a former contractor with the city of New York who turned to crime after his contract to clean up the mess from Loki's attack fell through. With a heaping of class warfare in his veins, he's taken to stealing alien tech from whomever has it and selling it to whoever will buy it.Peter follows them to D.C. where he misses an academic competition getting trapped in a warehouse before he escapes and saves his classmates from a falling elevator in the Washington Memorial. Peter, inflated by his own sense of ability, pursues the arms dealers in New York until they get on the ferry, a situation that Peter makes significantly worse. Through his involvement, a weapon ends up splitting the ferry in half, Peter can't save it, and Tony Stark must come to his aid in his Iron Man suit. Highly displeased with Peter's immaturity and inability to measure his own ability against the situation, Tony takes the high tech suit from Peter, leaving him the homemade one he had fashioned before Tony had given him an upgrade.Peter, chastised and ready to accept his lowered position in the superhero chain, discovers that his nascent girlfriend is daughter to the Vulture, and the Vulture figures him out on a drive to the Homecoming dance. Unable to reach Tony, Peter does what he thinks is right and chases them, finding that he may be risking his life, but he does have it within him, without the high tech suit, to make the kind of difference he wants to make in the world.What makes this movie work is Peter himself. Tom Holland has fun in the role, but it's the writing that really makes it. Peter's journey is appropriate for a teenager suddenly given a large amount of power. His ego overtakes his common sense and he goes too far. His chastisement feels genuine, and his desire to prove himself even in the face of that punishment works quite well. The balance with his personal life isn't handled as well as his core journey. It's not bad at all, but I feel like it drags the movie a bit. I don't see a good reason why this movie should be a whole 130 minutes long. It's not that big of a story.Still, it's fun with a solid cast and a strong central story.",7,0,0,26 November 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Sane men reacting to an Insane World, hilariously
","Mutually assured destruction is inherently absurd because no sane person would trigger it. Only a crazy person would do that, and once that happened all the sane people would try to prevent it. That's the basic premise of Dr. Strangelove, and Kubrick takes the concept to its absurdist end with the kind of ironic humor that obviously tickled him (with a healthy smattering of Peter Sellers, of course).General Ripper sends his air wing to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union using Wing Attack Plan R, a plan that gives him authority to strike Russian targets without presidential authority in the event of an attack that incapacitates the president. Except nothing has happened save that the conspiracy in Ripper's head has reached a point where he feels it's necessary to begin a war to wipe out the Soviet Union and preserve the purity of his bodily fluids. He's obviously gone off his rocker and out of line because only a crazy person would start a nuclear war in a place of mutually assured destruction.These actions bring the president, his cabinet, and the top brass of the military to the war room in the Pentagon. They discuss the situation, any methods to recalling the bomb wing, and how to get to Ripper to force him to recall the attack. The president also invites the Russian ambassador who reveals that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday device that detects a nuclear explosion on Soviet soil and destroys the world (the premier was going to announce its presence to the world on Monday).They do manage to get the code after overrunning the base except for one plane that has damaged communications equipment and ends up going to a target not their own where they release the bomb and initial world destruction.I've never really appreciated how funny this movie is until this viewing. Yes, Peter Sellers does have his moments (I think he's best as the British officer Mandrake), but, in terms of performance, it's George C. Scott that gets me chuckling the most. His facial expressions are wonderful acts of cartoonish emoting that fit marvelously well with the absurdity of the situation in the movie. Slim Pickens' oversized personality meshes really well with his character Major Kong.Outside of performances, the movie really embraces absurdism and irony as modes of comedy in the face of world ending consequences. The scene around the Coca Cola machine is emblematic of that. Mandrake, freed from Ripper's office where he's been trapped for some time, needs to call the president and tell him the recall code. Only the regular telephones work, so he has to come up with the change to make the call. He runs through with the operator about connecting him to the president in the Pentagon and the different options to make the call (person to person, collect, and station to station). He doesn't have enough for person to person. The Pentagon refuses the collect call. And Mandrake doesn't have enough for the station to station call either. So, he convinces the American officer escorting him to shoot the lock off the nearby Coca Cola machine for a few more cents to make one of the most important calls in world history. There's an expectation around how that sort of call should happen, and it does not involve pay phones, haggling with an operator, and getting change from a nearby soda machine. The contrast is where the funny happens, and the contrast in that situation is purely absurd.One of the things that I only really appreciated on this viewing was the absurdism at the movie's core. I used to take the film far more literally and specifically as an attack on American policy and I would quibble with it. Once I got the reading I got, everything slid into place. The very idea of mutually assured destruction is absurd and only a madman would trigger it. Once done, the rest of the sane world would come together to make sure it didn't happen. That's one reason that the calls between the American president and the Russian premier are so funny. It's two adversaries suddenly thrown together to prevent what they had been actively building up to.The movie's slyly funny in several ways, great to look at, and with some wonderfully iconic imagery. That sight of Major Kong riding the bomb to the ground is just so fantastic. There are obvious sexual metaphors everywhere, implying a Freudian connection between war and sex, that heightens the comedic value as well. This movie is a classic for good reason.",10,4,5,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A muddled, but entertaining, trilogy capper
","I hadn't seen this movie in a very long time. In fact, as a kid, this was my favorite of the Star Wars movies. It wasn't the Ewoks, but, I think, the whole climax and every other action scene. It is the most actiony of the original trilogy. However, upon my revisit, I find myself with a far more muted reaction, and it kind of makes me sad.The movie has no real dramatic structure. It seems to start in a similar way to The Empire Strikes Back with an extended sequence that feels a bit removed in terms of what will eventually come regarding plot but feeds into it well. However, it doesn't do that much. It does re-introduce us to our characters who have gone through some changes since the last film (Luke, in particular, is a far more confident and adept Force user), and it undoes the ending of Empire by rescuing Han Solo. And yet, once off of Tattoine, the movie just continues as though they hadn't been separated for months, Han has just been through a traumatic experience, and they just killed a major and notorious gangster. There's a disconnect between the first major sequence and the rest of the film that I simply couldn't ignore.The emotional core of the movie, as far as I can tell because nothing else gets nearly this much attention, is the relationship between Luke and Darth Vader. However, it doesn't get mentioned until about forty minutes in, and then it only occasionally pops up through the rest of the film. Almost the entire time on Endor, Luke feels like he's just on the adventure in the same capacity as everyone else until he suddenly decides to break off. Really, the center of my problem is from the moment the heroes land on the forest moon of Endor until Luke hands himself over to Vader. It's a meandering excuse for relatively pointless action sequences and the introduction of the Ewoks, which feels both unnecessary and laborious. The lowest point is when Luke talks to Leia about leaving to meet Vader. The scene is way overly serious and Luke's reveal to Leia and Leia's 'I've always known' reaction feels like the writing of a pure amateur.The Ewoks get a bad rap because they were created to help George Lucas make more money from toy sales, and that's completely true. It wouldn't be hard at all to rewrite all of the Endor sequence, excluding the Ewoks entirely, and it still works mechanically. As it is, the rebels feel incompetent because they land somewhere and then seem to get immediately lost on their way to their target and need the help of the local teddy bears. And, yeah, the image of the teddy bears taking down an Imperial garrison never quite rises out of silliness. The most embarrassing bit, though, is what becomes of Han Solo. He's gone from rogue who shoots first to pining over a woman's kindness to another man, ready to simply step aside and not fight for the woman he loves. He's become pathetic.And yet, there is still quite a bit to like. When we are dealing with Luke's conflict between Vader and the Emperor, it's handled quite well. It's not perfect and could use a lot more screen time, but it works. The special effects are easily the best of the series. There are individual sequences that, when taken out of context, have appeal. The opening sequence around rescuing Han from Jabba makes a really good Star Wars short film with lower, but more emotionally meaningful, stakes and ends with a great action sequence. And the final battle (controlling for the Ewok silliness variable) is huge, complex, and really quite exciting.Suddenly looking back at the trilogy at this point in my life, I've begun to wonder if Lawrence Kasdan was the great creative force that I thought he was. Yes, he wrote Empire, but he also wrote this. Maybe it was Gary Kurtz, who quit the franchise after Empire, who was pulling it all together, and Marcia Lucas, who divorced Lucas during Return, who cut it into the right form. Losing those two gave us a purer George Lucas, unfiltered by people who had greater understandings of how storytelling actually works.Oh well, it's a bit of a downer to revisit a childhood favorite and discover it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, but it happens.",6,1,1,12 December 2019
Alien," One of the great movies
","The title to this movie is so utterly perfect, much like the rest of the film. In terms of straight entertainment, I find Alien to be a pinnacle of tension building terror in film. It's one of the most thoroughly entertaining horror movies ever made. I love Ridley Scott, I call myself a Ridley Scott fanboi, but he hasn't matched Alien in his career since though he's come pretty close.The Nostromo, a hauling vessel, is pulling tens of millions of tons of ore across the galaxy. It's crew is in suspended animation for the duration of the trip, but their onboard computer, Muthur, wakes them up early when she receives a signal of unknown original coming from a nearby planet. The crew goes down to the surface, investigates, gets an alien organism attached to one of their faces, and come back on board. Famous images happen after the creature on the face lets go and dies and another alien creature bursts forth from the crewmember's chest. The alien grows, killing the crew one by one, until there's only one who escapes.Okay...plot summary done. There's so much that makes this movie work as well as it does, but I think the best place to start is that title. 'Alien' implies something from the outside coming in. An alien, in terms of earthly immigration, isn't an alien if they stay in their own country. They become an alien by entering another country. 'Alien' also implies something strange and different from normal experiences. The alienness of Alien isn't just the fact that we have an extraterrestrial, but that it's coming from the outside and coming in, uninvited, I might add.The crew feels like a group of siblings. There's no hint of romance between anyone, and they all bicker like brothers and sisters with Dallas (the captain) acting like the eldest brother. Their mother (Muthur) guides them and directs them. It is into this family unit that the outside entity, the xenomorph, gets introduced, but to take the motif and theme further, it manifests in a literal invasion of the crewmember's (Kane's) body. The terror, much like that in The Shining, comes from an external force invading something that should be held free of invasion, a form of a family.There are a couple of additions to that external pressure to the family unit. Ash, the science officer, we learn later, was added to the crew only two days before their departure from earth. Ash is obviously not really part of the team. He's always just a bit apart and he acts less comfortably in the group than the rest. He's actually an android and he malfunctions in pursuit of his secret mission. Muthur herself is influenced by outside forces, turning her against the crew. She and Ash share the same secret mission, to retrieve the alien at all costs, leaving the crew as expendable. That outside influence perverts the warm cocoon of Muther's room (all soft white lights in the middle of the dark metal grays of the rest of the ship) into something sinister.The idea of invasion is so complete in the film's packaging of terror and fear. It's pervasive in every instance of how it works. The idea of danger hitting you at home is almost primal, and to see the home of the Nostromo attacked from the outside in so many ways, as well as the bodies of those crewing it, is the foundation of what gives the movie its visceral power.Those ideas would be nothing, though, if the movie built on them weren't well done, and Alien is a triumph of design. From the lived in and grimy feel of life on the Nostromo (at least partially influenced by the design of Star Wars) to the alien vessel that does a wonderful job of feeling otherworldly, and to the fantastic creature effects that are filmed perfectly to highlight them in just the right ways, Ridley Scott brings a level of sophistication to the visual world that heightens the experience, sells the reality, and deepens the terror. One of the more interesting subtle things Scott does is how he frames the characters. At the beginning, everyone's filmed rather flatly. Ash stands out a bit, but everyone else, especially in the first scene at the dinner table, shows the rest of the crew in the same clarity. No one really stands out, but as the movie goes on, the crew diminishes, and Ripley asserts herself more, she gains more of the frame. There's also the bit where she makes the final plan with three others in the room. For much of the scene, she's the only person in the foreground and everything and everyone behind her is completely out of focus.I also want to put special focus on the final sequence on the Nostromo from the point Ripley starts the auto-destruct sequence until she leaves on the lifeboat. It's purely an audio and visual assault on the senses, and it works perfectly. Tension is already super high and we get this regular beat of strobes and a loud alarm that just reaches out and grabs the audience. With the alien just around the corner as well, it's one of the greatest audio and visual tour de forces in popular cinema.Tone is handled pitch perfectly with unease seeping into every scene, and the lighter scenes never really getting that light. Acting is top notch (the Harry Dean Stanton rule definitely applies here). Everything about this movie works just so incredibly well, creating a complete package of terror based on familiar fears in an unfamiliar setting. I consider it one of the great movies.",10,1,2,26 November 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton and Sondheim
","I absolutely love this movie in all its macabre glory. I love Sondheim's music. I love the look of the film from costumes to set design to the special effects. I love the performances. I love the story. I love how everything weaves together in a complete package. And, on top of it, while the movie seems to wallow in nihilism, it actually ends up being a rebuke of nihilism as empty and self-destructive, which is a nice bit of irony to top it all off.Benjamin Barker was a naïve young barber with an attractive and virtuous wife and a young daughter. The evil Judge Turpin coveted Lucy Barker, threw Benjamin in prison and sent to Australia, and took on Johanna, the daughter as his ward when Lucy refused his advances. Fifteen years later, Barker arrives back in London with a new, darker look and a new name, Sweeney Todd, with a single objective: revenge.If I had to boil down the central point of this story to a single word, it would be corruption. Corruption of purpose, of the law, and, most importantly, the soul. There are very few innocents in this depiction of 19th century London, and those few left are attacked mercilessly until they break or are corrupted themselves. The central figure, Sweeney Todd himself, describes his former self as an innocent before the corrupt Judge Turpin threw him in jail, the experience of which corrupted him. Todd's singular purpose of vengeance blinds him to everything else around him. He barely sees the baker Mrs. Lovett, unless she's helping him in his quest. The only people he seems to have a clear eye towards are those who can help him or those who are impeding him. Turpin and his manservant Beadle Bamford are his main focus. The carnival barker of a barber Adolfo Pirelli goes from a way to attract attention to an impediment that must be dealt with. Even his daughter, the young woman he hasn't seen she was a babe, means nothing to him. She is just another tool in getting Judge Turpin to sit in Todd's chair for a very close shave.So, our main character wallows completely in vengeance with no view of anything else, but what does it bring him and does the movie itself approve? First of all, his thirst for blood is most completely described in the number 'Try a Little Priest' where, after being thwarted in his quest by Turpin leaving his shop, Todd commiserates with Mrs. Lovett and they both come up with a mutually beneficial solution. He can take his anger out on London and humanity by killing men left and right, and she'll have meat for her meat pies, pulling herself out of the situation of making the worst pies in London. They're both nearly giddy with the prospect of killing all types of people, no matter their station or vocation, but the very next number is of Todd slicing all of these throats and the music isn't nearly as joyful. It's actually a lament for his lost daughter where an interesting set of contrasts play out at the same time. The first is between Todd's actions and his words. He's bemoaning the loss of his little girl while killing people. The other is that it's actually a duet with Anthony, the young idealist who came off the boat with Todd who has fallen in love with Johanna after a single sighting and who is actually trolling the streets of London looking for her. What would make Todd happy at this time? The blood that spurts all over him does nothing to him, he barely feels it, but he says he yearns for this lost daughter. And yet, he never makes a single move himself to find her, free her, or reunite with her. He's so corrupted that he won't actually do anything to try and help her.The anti-Todd in the film is little Tobias, a young urchin that formerly worked for the Italian Pirelli. He's wide-eyed, naïve, and eager to help Mrs. Lovett who, after the mysterious disappearance of Pirelli, took him in and saved him from another stint in the workhouse. He's blind to the evil going on around him, but he begins to sense that something is wrong, mostly emanating from Todd, a feeling that he confides with Mrs. Lovett. The irony is, of course, that Mrs. Lovett did more to direct Todd's evil outward that Todd did himself, so Tobias is caught in a trap. The resolution of the film, where Todd bares his neck for the child he knows stands behind him, is the exact right ending for both characters. Todd, realizing how blind he had been as he holds his wife's dead body in his arms, gives up everything, and Tobias takes the razor across his former master's throat, ending and evil rein of terror.What really helps carry the movie all the way through is Steven Sondheim's music. From 'No Place Like London' to 'Final Scene' the music is literate, witty, and adept. It's all very good music, so to say. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter land somewhere between fine and subjects of nepotism in their renditions, but the rest are very good, mostly because most of the rest have been pulled from the actual musical world. The numbers are staged on a very small visual scale, usually a person or two in a small room and only occasionally breaking out of that paradigm (like when Todd moves around the streets unseen by anyone in 'Epiphany'). I think it helps the film that there's no dancing or large numbers, helping us focus more tightly on the characters as though the songs were just extensions of dialogue rather than excuses to show off musical skill.I do not think that Tim Burton has made a better film. The look of the film, the sound of it, the execution of every scene is damn near perfect. It's one of those movies where director and material matched up perfectly to bring out the best in both. I absolutely love this film.",10,0,1,22 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best MCU movie
","The first twenty minutes or so of this movie establish so much so well, it feels like the Marvel franchise has finally grown up.The opening scene takes place around the Mall in Washington D.C. as Captain Rogers takes in his morning run, lapping a young ex-soldier several times. When the two finally speak, there's a grounded sense of community between the two stemming from their dual tours of duty in wars separated by decades. It's the physical detail that Sam brings up about the over-softness of mattresses contrasted against the reality of their sleeping arrangements in the theaters of war that sells it so well. Rogers and Sam have this immediate connection because of that shared experience that makes Rogers showing up to a group therapy session for veterans instantly believable. He's not showing up because he's Captain America and it's what Captain America would do. He's showing up because he's got his own scars and wonders if spending time with others who have similar experiences could help.That's the kind of grounded reality that storytelling should reach for. It's not about being grounded in a recognizable physical reality but in a recognizable emotional and human reality. The movie around that emotional core is still ridiculous with a super soldier created by a magic blue serum, another soldier with a metal arm that's been repeatedly frozen over the decades, flying aircraft carriers, and a suit with jets and wings, but because it pays attention to the human element so well that crazy stuff gains a more entertaining dimension because it's at service to an actual story dealing with characters that feel real.What's most interesting about the film's construction is that it uses the human element so well in a paranoid thriller context. The presence of Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is no accident. His presence calls to mind Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men.Captain America is sent on a mission into the middle of the ocean to rescue some SHIELD operative on a boat that's been taken over by French-Algerian pirates. Cap succeeds, of course, and his partner Natasha (Black Widow) is there with a secondary purpose, to steal information from the ship. Rogers rankles at this undermining of his authority over the mission and confronts SHIELD director Nick Fury about it. Fury insists that secrets are necessary in order for him to effectively lead the organization and that Rogers is going to have to get used to compartmentalization in the modern world. After Fury brings some concerns to Pierce, a member of SHIELD's governing body the Council, Fury gets attacked on the streets of D.C. He escapes to Rogers' apartment, gets shot through a wall, and Rogers gives chase to the assailant, The Winter Soldier, who is actually Bucky Barnes, Rogers' best friend from childhood who had been brainwashed into being a killing machine.Rogers and Natasha begin to suspect that SHIELD has been compromised and after a couple of instances of SHIELD proving that beyond a reasonable doubt, the two go on the run. They essentially go back in time in finding the original bunker that SHIELD operated out of, inhabited by the computerized brain of Dr. Zola, the Swiss scientist who had helped Hydra in the first Captain America movie. Hydra, he reveals, had infiltrated SHIELD decades before, sowing chaos around the world and taking control of the organization as a whole.This is one of the only times Marvel dealt with geopolitical issues in any meaningful way. The idea that an intelligence apparatus that nominally represents the will of the people is actually deeply rooted in its own version of state interests feels almost ripped from the headlines. The idea of outsourcing killing decisions to a program and using drones feels just the same. And yet, the movie never gets bogged down with it. It takes a side against these things and plows forward, understanding that it is more action movie than political treatise. What this does is create an interesting canvas on which to tell this story, lending credence to the emotions that Rogers is going through as he sees an organization that had earned his trust fall before his eyes.Of course, Rogers decides to fight it out, and he recruits Sam, the Falcon, as well as Natasha. We get a great extended action sequence across three helicarriers as they rise against a ticking clock that the heroes are fighting to beat. It really comes to a head on the third ship when the Winter Soldier and Captain America face off. These aren't just two people on the opposite sides of good and bad at the dictates of a screenwriter, these are people with pasts and ideals that throw them in conflict. But, instead of wanting to see Rogers simply win against Bucky, Rogers needs to save Bucky from the fate he's found himself in. It's a non-traditional way to end a large action sequence, and it works really well because of the emotional work done early. It all fits as well because of the thematic underpinnings. Rogers is haunted by his past and worried about his future. Bucky is a physical manifestation of that worry and concern. He was the friend he lost in battle, but he also represents a more hopeful future if Rogers can reach him.Action scenes overall range from being filmed too close to coherent within that shaky-cam box. They're edited really well, but I just wish the Russo's has pulled the camera back a bit more and kept it a bit more still from time to time. There's a visual thing that feeds into everything as well. Captain America begins the movie in blue suit (as he's doing SHIELD's dirty work without realizing it), but when he decides to fight SHIELD in order to reclaim his own ideals, he grabs the World War II era suit in the Smithsonian, fighting his final battle in the good ole red, white, and blue.It's intelligently assembled, emotionally assured, and overall a very good time at the movies.",8,2,3,25 November 2019
Life of Pi," Beautiful and intelligent magical realism
","Let's get this out of the way: This movie is beautiful to look at. That's not nothing, but it's far from the movie's sole strength. Performances from human and animated creature alike are very good, but it's the interplay of the central story and the framing device that engages me the most.A novelist visits a middle-aged Indian-Canadian at the advice of the Indian's uncle. Pi, a nickname stemming from his full name of Piscine, the French word for swimming pool, lives a small and quiet life but lived an experience that, he says, will convince the novelist of the existence of God. That's no small feat.Pi's family owned and operated a zoo in India until it became financially untenable. Pi's father determined that they would move to India, transport the animals with them on the ship, and sell them in Canada. On the trip, the ship sinks for never explained reasons and Pi finds himself alone on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, and a zebra. The zebra dies due to a leg injury, the hyena kills the orangutan, and as the hyena is about to lunge at Pi, a tiger, Richard Parker, leaps out from the covered half of the boat and kills the hyena. Pi uses his wits to establish a raft roped to the end of the lifeboat where he can rest without fear of the tiger getting to him.Through adversity, the two learn how to live together. Pi figures out how to net fish large enough for Richard Parker to eat. They survive a large storm together. They find a mysterious island populated with roots that Pi can eat and meerkats that Richard Parker can feast on. This island is an oasis in the middle of the ocean. They can live forever on its fruits, but Pi discovers a human tooth in one of the island's flowers at the same time he sees the pool of fresh water fill with dead fish as it turns to acid. He sees this temporal haven as toxic. He packs up his supplies, gets Richard Parker back on the boat (who seemed to understand the island's dangers before Pi did), and they leave.I think one of the wonderful things about this narrative is how the novelist finds the metaphor in the story and spells it out. It's the sort of easy metaphor that audiences love because it doesn't require a whole lot of thought and can be easily discerned. The novelist saying, 'the hyena was the cook, the orangutan was your mother, the zebra was the sailor, and Richard Parker was you' is a great way to cut through the obviousness of the metaphor while also lifting the narrative to be about more than a simple series of symbols. The narrative at the core of the film, the time on the lifeboat, is all about survival. It's pretty straightforward, but Pi had promised a narrative that would convince his audience of the existence of God. A thin metaphor of a story about a boy who survives on the ocean isn't going to do it.What is meant to convince is the framing device itself. This comes out most forcefully in a scene after Pi gets rescued where he is interviewed by two representatives from the shipping company out of Japan. The rest of the story within the story had been bright and full of color. First there was India in all its visual splendor, then the bright blues of the ocean up against the bright orange of the tiger's fur. The interview is in a small white room with white sheets. It's a simple back and forth cut between Pi telling his story and a couple of reaction shots. It's so flat in comparison to the bright and colorful story we had gotten. It's also much more grounded as he tells was really happened. The sailor died of his wounds. The cook killed Pi's mother in a pique of rage. Pi killed the cook and then survived for 9 months on a lifeboat alone. There was no island, and he simply survived.'Which story do you like more?' Pi asks the novelist. 'The one with the tiger,' he replies.How is that supposed to make one believe in God? Well, Pi frames the belief in God as a choice. You can chose to believe in the mundane, or you can open yourself up to the grandeur of the unknowable. Life with a God in it is much more interesting and full of meaning than one without it. That concept is conveyed wonderfully by building on a simple story and imbuing it with real meaning.The movie is, of course, a wonder to behold, but it's also wonderful that it's got so much thematic and character driven depth.",10,1,1,26 November 2019
Doctor Strange," A remake of Iron Man
","A brilliant man of science gets injured and works with an individual from the east to rediscover his purpose, eventually fighting an enemy with similar powers in a city. But enough about Iron Man.I know I'm in a minority on this, but Doctor Strange tells a similar story to, but is superior to, Iron Man in just about every way.Doctor Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon with a photographic memory who gets into a car accident due to his own negligence that robs him the use of his hands in any effective way. He goes from performing some of the most intricate surgeries modern science is called upon to accomplish to being unable to shave himself because his hands won't stop shaking. Giving up on western medical solutions, he follows rumors to Tibet where he meets the Ancient One and a monastery of monks dedicated to magic. Opening his eyes to the world beyond the physical, Strange uses his mental strength to quickly become a star pupil, going beyond the proscribed limits of his training, and meeting an evil former student out to bring about the end of the order and the current state of the world in favor of a being from the Dark Dimension.What mainly makes this movie work is the strong and simple character journey Doctor Strange finds himself on. It's beyond an arrogant man learning a bit of humility. It's the story of a man with a limited view of the world learning to expand it, while also realizing his size in the face of such enormity. He may have been the best neurosurgeon (partially because he only chose savable patients), and he may have become one of the premier masters of the magical arts, but he has come to realize how small he is. Despite the great things he does to save the planet, he knows that there are more things out there that he won't be able to face down alone. It's a strongly written emotional arc for a main character that connects from piece to piece very well.Of course, the main positive of the film is the action and special effects. Marvel movies have a tendency towards a drab color palette and shaky cam action (which is sometimes appropriate like in the Captain America sequels that imply a sense of urgency and reality to the action). However, that approach isn't always appropriate like in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies and this one. The idea behind the film is a gobbledygook idea of a multiverse, bringing in the powers of other universes using magical spells, and then shattering reality in certain ways with that. That very idea lends itself to trippy visuals that the movie embraces fully.From the spectral form of Doctor Strange helping with a surgery on his own body to the show stopping chase through New York's mirror dimension, the movie embraces an inventive mode of special effects that lends itself well to the material. Watching New York's skyscrapers fold in on themselves, creating different axes of dimensionality, is just fun to take in, and the action that runs through it is inventive and fun.Another note needs to be given to the resolution to the film's climax. The giant cloud monster from the Dark Dimension has entered our realm through a portal in Hong Kong. Dr. Strange uses some time magic to draw things backwards and then launch himself directly into the Dark Dimension to face the monster. Instead of some special effects knock out, drag out fight, we get Dr. Strange attacking the problem with intelligence and wit. He can't beat this giant monster. In fact, we watch the monster kill Dr. Strange repeatedly as the good doctor puts time into a loop that neither he nor the monster can escape. Dr. Strange is happy to maintain this status quo as long as it keeps Earth safe, but the monster needs to escape, leaving an implied agreement that we see the end of.The movie's a strong entertainment and fun. A good, mid-cycle addition to the whole universe.",7,1,1,25 November 2019
Barry Lyndon," Gorgeous and involving, Kubrick's other masterpiece
","If I had to boil down the ideas of this 3-hour visually sumptuous experience to a single word it would be artifice, and it's highlighted by the very first shot of the film. Like many across the runtime, this first look at the world of Redmond Barry feels like an 18th century painting come to life. Kubrick starts with two figures filling opposite sides of the frame before he zooms the camera out to reveal a stone wall that occupies much of the lower third of the frame, a large tree that fills the left half, and a blue and cloudy sky occupying the upper third. It's so elegantly composed as to feel like it comes from another era, and it's showing the audience a duel. It's the duel between our main character's father and another man, leading very quickly to the elder Barry's death over, as the wonderfully realized and written voiceover explains, a matter concerning a horse. We learn no more about either Redmond's father or the matter that took his life, but the execution of the elder Barry's single scene is illuminating to the heart of the film as a whole.What we have is a highly ritualized form of violence being followed over concerns of something rather petty when compared to the life of a man. No matter the cause, the elder Barry consented to this ritual in order to do something positive for himself. Was it worth it? Was it any different from any other form of violence like a drunken brawl? Once caught in the ritual, did the elder Barry ever have a choice in the matter, or must the form be followed no matter what?There are two more duels in the film, and they highlight this question in ever more interesting ways. Jumping ahead a couple of decades, the film follows the younger Barry, Redmond, as he falls in love with his cousin Nora. Nora childishly plays along with this infatuation until she makes the acquaintance of a British officer named John Quin (almost ridiculously acted in a wonderful performance from Leonard Rossiter) whom she immediately falls in love with. Barry won't stand for this insult to his honor, so, after Nora and Quin announce their engagement in a manner Quin intends to insult Barry, the young Irishman challenges Quin to a duel.Quin, though, is an abject coward. It's obvious that he's the kind of man who can stand up to a boy without fear, but as soon as that boy is holding a loaded pistol, his firm looks quiver into fear. However, Quin is as much a part of the system of 18th century British society as Barry's father had been, so he follows through with being part of the duel. He cheats, though. He has Nora's brothers (who oversee the duel and have a vested interest in getting their sister to marry a member of the English gentry) load the guns with tow. Barry hits Quin square and Quin passes out from the shock and fear that had gripped him, despite knowing that his life was not in actual danger. Barry, not knowing Quin's health was unaffected by his shot, flees to Dublin, leaving his old life behind.The third duel comes much, much later in the film, so we'll get to it in due time. Redmond is robbed on his way to Dublin and ends up joining the army in an effort to make a living and start on his path towards becoming a gentleman, a journey that takes up the first half of the film. He's roped into the Seven Year's War (or, for us Americans, the French and Indian War as the American theater of that conflict is called) and quickly becomes miserable with his existence. There's a fight with another soldier, a boxing match, that acts as a very interesting counterpoint to the duels in the rest of the film. The duels are filmed very squarely with long takes, but this boxing match is all handheld cameras and quick cuts, implying the more grounded and 'real' nature of the type of conflict. Anyway, Redmond steals an officer's uniform to flee, heads into Prussian territory, and gets captured by a Prussian officer who sees through Redmond's lies and shanghaies him into the Prussian army where Redmond spends the rest of the war. Afterwards, he's forced to investigate an Irishman living in Prussia. Redmond and the Chevalier develop a close bond very quickly based on their shared heritage and distance from home, eventually finding a way to get Redmond out of the country and free from Prussian rule.Once the two begin making their living as traveling gamblers, Redmond sees the Countess Lyndon and falls in love with her, a type of love that is greatly different than what he felt for Nora. His time in the British and Prussian armies has left him completely jaded, perhaps even dehumanized, so all he sees in her is an income. They marry and their lives, based on nothing more than Redmond's quest for the status of a gentleman, is deeply unhappy. The Countess' son to her first husband, Lord Bullingdon, instantly dislikes Redmond, seeing right through the artifice of his appearance and manner to discover the rake he truly is. After some years, and the birth of a son, Lord Bullingdon can't take Redmond's profligacy, infidelity to his mother, and general mistreatment of himself and leaves only to return after the accidental death of his younger brother and the utter collapse of the Lyndon fortune at Barry's hands.And...we finally get our third duel. This one is an interesting third manifestation of the ritual. Redmond seems to harbor no further ill will towards Lord Bullingdon in the wake of his own child's death, but Lord Bullingdon is still consumed by hatred for Redmond. In his excitable state, Lord Bullingdon, who had been granted first shot, accidentally fires his pistol into the ground. Redmond, feeling none of the animosity towards Lord Bullingdon that the younger man feels for him, fires into the ground intentionally. Presented with an opportunity to walk away with his honor intact and satisfaction satisfied, having followed the ritual and artifice of violence to a natural conclusion, Bullingdon rejects the offer and elects to fire again. This time he doesn't miss, hitting Redmond in the leg (which he will eventually lose), and gaining what he really wanted, exiling Redmond from England and his life. Bullingdon submitted to the artifice to get the violent ends he wanted and he took it as far as he could. The artifice in this instance did nothing to protect anyone, and Bullingdon used it to get a very non-artificial result.The artifice of the film extends to other elements, such as performance. The characters most invested in the artifice of the world give the least naturalistic performances. In particular I think of Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt. Runt is the spiritual advisor to the Lyndon family and tutor to Lord Bullingdon. He wears the white powder on his face that marks most of the aristocracy we see in the film, and he speaks in extremely measured tones. His place in the world hinges entirely on him fitting in with the upper classes, so he's happy to strengthen their hold upon the world no matter what. When presiding over Barry's wedding to the Countess or reading over Redmond's dead child, he speaks in the exact same tone of voice. It is only when Redmond's mother dismisses him that Runt gains an element of emotion in his voice. She's stripped the need for any artifice from him and he can suddenly speak his mind fully.In contradistinction, there are some characters who speak extraordinarily naturally throughout. The first and most obvious of the first hour of the film is Captain Grogan, the man who tells Barry of Quin's plot to escape death at Redmond's first duel. He cuts right through the bull and simply tells Redmond what really happened. The ritual of the duel means nothing to him, so he's free to speak his own mind.So, that's all well and good, but why like the movie? I've spent almost 1500 words talking about meaning and theme and a bit on performance, but why like this film?Well, first of all, I find it both gorgeous to look at and completely hypnotic. In some ways, these are traits that it shares with 2001, but this one looks better, I suppose. Compositions are lush and deep and wonderfully built. Using mostly natural and candlelight, Kubrick was able to create a sumptuously beautiful world from beginning to end. I particularly love the candlelit scenes (using lenses developed by NASA, apparently). I also find it completely engaging. Redmond becomes almost as despicable a character as Alex from A Clockwork Orange, and the journey is so well realized. From his impetuous youth to his jading experiences in the army and as a gambler, to his ruinous exploitation of another person's fortune to unsuccessfully advance his own personal interests, I find Redmond Barry utterly fascinating and watchable.Another element I love is two-fold. The two act structure of the film and the movie's tendency to say what's going to happen through voice over and on title cards long before they happen. For instance, the very first title card of the film that preceded the very first shot tells us how the first act will end with Redmond Barry gaining the title of Barry Lyndon. The title card for the second act does the same thing, describing his fall, and there's voice over more than half an hour before the end of the film telling us that Barry will die childless, alone, and in poverty. The inevitability of his rise and fall is so well handled that it gains an element shared with Greek tragedy. He's destined to fall because his fall was always within him. As the voice over says, the qualities of gaining a fortune and maintaining a fortune are not the same thing.",10,4,4,26 November 2019
Full Metal Jacket," A strong work that I just can't quite wrap my brain around
","I can imagine myself in a few years wondering, 'What did I think of that one movie?' I would pull up the blog, do a quick search, find the review, and be refreshed with my attempts at insight. My opinion that day would be reinforced by the opinion I had years back. Full Metal Jacket, though, is a film that I am always certain will have changes of opinion over time. Out of all the films that I have reviewed so far, this is the one that I feel like I could review again in a year and come to very different conclusions.I've seen this film four times, and I'm still coming to terms with it. I've moved beyond the idea that the first forty-five minutes are a mini-movie and wholly superior to the final seventy minutes. I still think that the first section of the film on Parris Island is superior to the second long section that ends the film, but there's definitely a deeper relationship between the Private Joker character. There are themes and motifs at play in the first half that continue into the second. I just can't quite get past a few things that hamper the whole experience for me.The events on Parris Island are both hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. A group of marine recruits goes through basic training, and we latch onto two of the largely interchangeable maggots as main character, Private Joker and Private Pyle. These are, of course, not their real names, but the nicknames stick. They are robbed of who they were before walking onto the island. There's that dehumanization idea that keeps popping up in Kubrick's filmography. The process of training strips even the interior individuality so that they all become alike in behavior, marching perfectly in time, performing the same actions, and reacting the same way to their drill instructor.Our two main characters have different paths to this sameness. Joker is smart and thoughtful which allows him to navigate the minefield of the instructor's verbal jabs in ways that do him credit, eventually getting him the position of squad leader. Pyle, on the other hand, is stupid (not pejoratively, mind you, Pyle is obviously supposed to have an IQ of less than 90) and has incredible difficulty adapting to life in the corps. He has trouble telling his left from his right. He can't master the obstacle course. He hides jelly donuts in his footlocker. It is only after Joker is forced to take Pyle under his wing that Pyle begins to shape up, turning the corner in his training, and eventually going way too far in the other direction. He becomes the ultimate psychotic killing machine, putting a round into the drill instructor's chest after graduation before shooting himself in the head.Just from a cinematic experience point of view, this first forty-five minutes is a tour de force. It's nearly impressionistic and heavily reliant on editing to create the general sense of unease that pulls us in as we watch the humanity stripped so completely from Pyle to the point that he does only kill.The second section ends up feeling both more straight forward cinematically and more confused narratively, which can create a certain letdown from a movie going point of view. However, as I wrote earlier, there are stronger connections between the two sections that my first viewings of the film originally revealed to me.Animal Mother, for instance, seems like another version of Pyle. He seems pretty dim the first time we meet him, but he's also obviously a great killing machine. Knowing that the movie ends with Joker leading the survivors of the film in a rendition of the theme song to 'The Mickey Mouse Club House', I began considering what that could mean more than an hour before it came up, and the idea of infantilization creeped into my brain. I began to watch as a group of children lost every parental figure they had (starting with the drill instructor) until they were faced with a great life or death situation without any guidance from a higher authority. There are also signs of the breakdown of all civilization in the face of war, an idea so big I'm not sure it fits terribly well in only seventy-minutes of screentime.And that's where I end up. I feel like this second half is simply tackling too much. Breakdown, though, is a great lens to view it through. Joker starts this section negotiating with a hooker for her time, playfully joking with her. That attitude extends through his meetings with his CO as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. His life is easy hidden away in Saigon. He can talk big about his time in the  and no one can really challenge him. It's when the Tet Offensive begins that his veneer of bravery breaks down and he starts shooting maniacally at a small invading force. He then gets sent out into the field to document some of the counter action.It's about here that I feel the movie just begins to break down itself narratively. From the time Joker is reunited with his mate from Parris Island (Private Cowboy) to the time that their squad leader dies in the final city, the movie kind of just swirls around without a real direction. There's marching and everyone talks big about nothing in particular. It's more of a dick measuring contest than anything else, and it culminates in another scene about a hooker as the men negotiate with her pimp and then jockey for who gets her first. As a contrast to the first hooker scene, Joker has little to say or do here. He's no longer standing out, and he's been pushed more to the background. Much like in Parris Island, he's more of one of several than an individual again.From purely a filmmaking perspective, the final thirty minutes, as the squad gets pinned down by a hidden sniper in a building, might be as good as the movie's first forty-five minutes. This stuff is really well filmed with clear action, a great outdoor set, smoke, and fire. It's tense as the squad watches several of their comrades take repeated sniper fire, mortally wounding them but not killing them, and the rest find a way around the sniper's position. It's a great sustained sequence that ends with the reveal that the sniper is a young girl, a wonderful point of irony to cap off the movie that's pretty steeped in it.Some more technical notes real quick. It's screamingly obvious that this movie wasn't filmed in Vietnam. It was filmed in England, and there's no place in England that looks like a Vietnamese paddy field, so there are numerous shots of the countryside that looks like flat bits of England with palm trees. The giant set that ends the film is both a blessing and a curse. When the frame's edges are filled with parts of the set, I find it completely convincing. When the edges of the frame extend out beyond the set, it once again feels like an outdoor set in the middle of England. I was also assured by my high school history teacher (who was a marine who had done three tours of duty in Vietnam) that while the yelling of the drill instructor was spot on, drill instructors would never ever strike a recruit.So, that's kind of where I am overall with the film. I know that the first half informs the second half, but I still haven't quite figured out how. I think I can grasp the overall thematic thrust of the film, but I haven't really developed it in my own head. I believe that there's more to this movie than my first four viewings have left with me, and I'm more than willing to give the film another try in the future. But for now, I have to embrace the incongruity between the two major sections, the flaccidity of a large part of the second section, and an opaqueness that I can't quite get through, and relegate Full Metal Jacket to the second tier of Kubrick's filmography. Maybe when I revisit this again in a year or so, I'll read this and build on my original thoughts instead of just repeating them. We shall see.",7,2,3,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis
","'I think those are really valid ideas that Rian put forth, but any series of films, especially if you have three, is a conversation - which is, as I said early on when I was talking to J.J., thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. If Force Awakens asks the question of who is Rey and where did she come from, and then The Last Jedi answered it with a negative in a certain way, hopefully The Rise of Skywalker will take those two ideas and create a third thing.'-Chris Terrio, co-screenwriter on The Rise of SkywalkerI saw that quote above randomly last week, and it's stuck with me. I'm a vocal defender of Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi, thinking that it's the most thematically successful and intelligent Star Wars movie, but I also acknowledge that it doesn't seem to be that popular. Disney obviously heard that and brought back JJ Abrams to co-write and direct the third installment of the new trilogy, hoping for him to capture the magic of The Force Awakens when everyone loved Star Wars again (except for...er...some people).As a synthesis of the promises of The Force Awakens and the ideas of The Last Jedi, I feel like The Rise of Skywalker is actually quite successful. It's bulky and messy with a bit too much to do with explanations of getting people from place to place, but once it calms down, in a sense, and focuses on the story at hand, things slip together rather nicely.Continuing the basic structure of The Last Jedi, Rey and Kylo Ren are the thematic focuses of this film. Their conflict is actually a continuation of the conflict that really became defined in the previous film. He's still dedicated to wiping out the past and replacing it with himself, hoping to use the newly exposed Emperor Palpatine to further his goals, while Rey pours over the ancient Jedi texts and trains to be a Jedi, using the lessons of the past to inform her future. The synthesis that arises is the re-introduction of the idea that Rey's parentage means something. In The Last Jedi, Ren derided her parentage as meaningless, but here we discover that she is actually granddaughter to Palpatine. It's not an idea I would have pursued (her being strong with the Force randomly feels like a good enough explanation for Palpatine to want her), but we'll go with it.He's using her past to inform her future. He doesn't care about her past, only so far as to use it to get what he wants, a future where he rules. Every interaction they have (mostly using the Force projection technique introduced in the last movie to somewhat less elegant results) is centered around this conflict, with Ren pursuing Rey, trying to possess her and her power in service of his own ends.For about half the movie, Rey is accompanied by Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca as they go with the more laborious part of the film, the search for an ancient Sith wayfarer, a device that will take them to a hidden Sith world. They go from one planet to the next, finding an ancient Sith dagger, needing to get a code breaker to hack C-3PO so he can read it (the detail that the Republic forbade the translation of Sith in droids is neat, but quickly passed by), and then they need to find the Death Star, a special room in the Death Star where the wayfarer is hidden. Listing it out, it feels like a lot, and considering this large section of the movie's length and relative contribution to the narrative, could have been trimmed a bit, especially when the whole C-3PO losing his memory thing gets completely reversed. That does provide nice bits of comedy here and there, but just reversing a memory wipe is anti-climactic.Having our heroes all together for a bulk of the film allows for moments of fun interaction that we've been denied up to this point. The antagonism between Rey and Poe, in particular, is fun banter, but it ultimately doesn't mean anything because the antagonism disappears the second Poe volunteers to accompany Rey on her quest. It also provides some odd moments when we have six characters all tightly squeezed into a tight space that, cinematically, feels like it would have been better to have two or three.Still, the plot to find the wayfarer is fun and energetic, and that's what JJ is good for. He brings a child-like enthusiasm to everything that oftentimes works (with notable exceptions), and this laborious plot doesn't feel that laborious as it unfolds, which is definitely a mark in its favor.I really do like so much of this movie. I was really expecting a mess, and while there is a lot going on (I'm very happy I spoiled myself early so I could take in more of the narrative than just the plot) there's an interesting thematic core that functions as a continuation of what happened in The Last Jedi.There's some snippet of a review on Rotten Tomatoes that calls this a slap in the face to Rian Johnson, and I disagree completely. I think that the moment that drives that idea is when Force ghost Luke arrives and says that he was wrong for his outlook in The Last Jedi. That's his entire arc in The Last Jedi, taking him from sullen defeatist to active participant once again.The movie's good. It's big, spilling over the sides, but it's heart is clear. It intelligently synthesizes the previous two films into a rousing and interesting conclusion. Count me as a fan.",7,3,11,20 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Remarkably, it's worse
","It's amazing to think that Lucas could have addressed some of the largest issues with the first prequel head on, but still managed to somehow make a worse movie overall. Attack of the Clones has a clearer narrative with stronger characters, but the clear narrative is populated with idiotic characters who act more like robots with incomplete instructions on how to love like humans do. It's amazing to think that George Lucas ever got married, considering the romance in this film. It feels more like the rantings of an 11 year old boy who loves the girl in his class just so very much that he's going to write them together in a story. It's embarrassing.I will admit, though, that I was kind of with the movie for the first twenty to thirty minutes. Gone was the directionless storytelling of the first film. There's even a moment where Lucas seems to knowingly wink at the audience as Anakin and his master Obi-wan break into a political debate and the camera cuts away to a droid releasing monster worms into a bedroom as though to say, 'I'm not doing that stuff anymore. I got the good stuff now.' And then we get a rather well done action and chase scene that ultimately, while awkward at certain moments like when just about anyone speaks, comes to a conclusion where the plot advances tangibly.'This isn't as bad as I remember,' I said to myself. And then everything collapsed within minutes. Obi-wan was sent on a detective mission (a cool concept) except that he's a complete moron and needs the first five steps explained to him by other people. And then Anakin and Padme get scenes exclusively together where they are supposed to be falling in love, but Anakin is a psychopathic and awkward robot who doesn't understand human emotions while Padme should be running away from this creep who won't stop angsting over her. There's not an iota of chemistry between them, and the actual exchanges of dialogue between them betray a writer who's never said a romantic thing to a woman ever.The story's terribly built as well. Obi-wan is on a mission that's supposed to be a mystery that folds upwards into conspiracies and greater mysteries. It's the sort of stuff that 70s paranoid thrillers were doing in their sleep, but the storytelling is so incompetent that it feels like Obi-wan's just going in whatever direction he sees movement. He's not following a logical series of clues in search for specific answers that evolve over time. He's just getting led from one point to another without really questioning why, how, who, or anything. This should have been the fun half of the movie, but it ends up as a slow drag.Another major structural problem is Anakin and Padme's side trip to Tatooine. In the hands of a competent screenwriter and director, this small adventure would feel like it was part of the story around it, but it is literally just an extra thing Anakin and Padme do. It doesn't affect the story (not just the plot, mind you, but the entire story) at all. You would think that Anakin murdering men, women, and children might alter his relationship with Padme, especially in the face of their burgeoning romance, but she just embraces him, treating him the exact same way as she did before. He doesn't act any differently afterwards, being the same brash and arrogant young man he was before. A smarter screenwriter would have put Anakin's mother on Geonosis so that he and Obi-wan would have followed different trails of breadcrumbs for different reasons to the same spot. Hell, let's spin this just real quick: The Geonisians, fresh with a giant order from the Trade Federation for new battle droids, needs an increased workforce and goes around the Outer Rim of the galaxy buying up as many slaves as they can. In that process, they buy Shmi, Anakin's mother. He followed her trail there while Obi-wan follows the bounty hunter, Jango Fett, to the same place, where they meet and take down the new battle droid army for different personal reasons.I mean, seriously, this movie is awfully built. Yes, Lucas toned down on the politics and focused more on characters, but the characters are poorly written and boringly presented. Again, Lucas' 'faster, more intense' direction failed to elicit good performances from his actors. His dialogue is still way outside the realm of both believability and elegance, sitting firmly in the realm of the awkward. Even visually, the movie feels uninspired.There are designs here and there that are nice, but the movie continues the first prequel's odd insistence on the ultra clean look that flies in the face of the original trilogy. The only place that looks lived in is Geonosis, and that doesn't show up until the end of the film. And, I'm not quite sure I would have imagined a platoon of Jedi would look like facing down an impossibly large army when I was young, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been a few dozen people in rubber masks or nothing special all wearing the same outfit and carrying one of two lightsaber colors (save Mace Windu's purple, of course). And, another thing, the final fight between Yoda and Dooku is a huge letdown. They use the Force for 20 seconds to throw boulders at each other before devolving to a lightsaber fight? The fight itself is fine, but these are two masters of the Force facing off. It's a perfect opportunity to push the Force in a new direction, perhaps having the two fight on some elevated plane of existence suffused with the Force in some sort of psychedelic display. I don't know, anything but just another sword fight in a movie filled with sword fights.All that said, the action scenes can be pretty good, though I believe that Lucas had little to do with them. I remember one bit from the behind the scenes documentary of this film where we saw some early pre-viz of the big battle at the end of the film before anyone presented it to Lucas, and it was essentially what we got in the final movie. He seems to have had very little to do with the actual design and execution of the action scenes, is what I'm saying. Still, they're in there and have a certain superficial appeal that makes them amusing to watch in isolation.I'm still flabbergasted that this movie is actually worse than The Phantom Menace, though, and I haven't even talked about the theme! The overall theme of the trilogy is that of corruption, and it continues a bit in here, but like everything else in the film, it's handled poorly and intermittently to the point that it never gains any real focus. That's really why the Shmi stuff is in the film at all, to show Anakin's further corruption, as well as the endless talk about the Republic being unable to accomplish anything like putting the leader of the Trade Federation in prison. This is an interesting idea with an interesting balance between the larger and smaller conflicts in concept, but in execution it's boring and a small part of the film.I can still admire the attempt at seriousness from Lucas while pointing out that he failed miserably at it, though.",3,1,1,17 December 2019
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made, Still
","When a medium is only twenty years old, what does it mean to be called the best of that medium? When The Passion of Joan of Arc was released, narrative film was really only about 20 years old. It's seems like a paltry selection of films from which to pull the best ever. I suppose the closest corollary in my lifetime would be video games. Mass consumer video games seem to have a birth in the late 70s and early 80s. When a game came out in the late 90s and early 00s that was considered one of the best ever, at the time, how long will that opinion last? Will people who play games in 2080 still consider that game to be one of the greatest ever?
Such questions come to me when thinking about the reception The Passion of Joan of Arc received upon its release. I've read contemporaneous reviews that called it the greatest film ever made. Seems like a small feat when compared to a movie called greatest ever now, with 90 more years of films to deal with.
And yet, I don't think anything has changed about this film's place at the height of cinema.
Film as an Emotional Medium
To really begin, here's a link to the entire movie with the Voices of Light soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, especially if you've never seen this movie, and at least bookmark it to watch at some point.joan2Film is really primarily an emotional experience. Storytelling in general asks people to connect with fictional characters, to understand who they are and why they do what they do. That's particularly strong in film because we actually see people's faces as they go through events.
The use of faces in The Passion of Joan of Arc is particularly important. Whenever people talk about this movie, the one thing that comes up most is the central performance by Renee Folconetti. She was a stage actress who had never worked in film before. She would also never work in film again. Part of that is probably because of what we actually see in the movie. She's obviously emotionally distressed, and there are stories that the direct, Carl Theodore Dreyer, pretty much tortured her to get the performance, and it was wildly effective.
Joan's eyes are wide with innocence as she navigates her interrogators' questions, making them seem alternatively foolish and unserious. It's both Joan's strength and fragility, all told through Falconetti's performance, that sells the conflict. We are with her from the beginning to the end, and it's quite an emotional journey.
Experimentaljoan3I revisited the movie for this post and I had completely forgotten how much the camera moves. I don't know about you, but when I think of silent filmmaking, I imagine hand-cranked cameras on tripods. The cameras used in The Passion of Joan of Arc were hand-cranked, but it feels like they were never on tripods.
The camera swings around, back and forth, and is always pushed right into actors' faces. The production company actually spent a significant amount of money building an entire French medieval town for the film, and they were angry at Dreyer because the audience barely sees it. The movie has wider shots here and there, but the story is almost entirely told in close-up, and often at off angles.
For those who think that filmmakers never really got inventive until that one movie that speaks to them personally but was released in the late 90s and they watched at a formative time, it's interesting to see them take in the fast editing and fun camera work in a movie from the 20s.
Preservationjoan4I provided a link earlier to a free streaming version of the film. If you do just go over and watch the first few minutes, there's a bit (the copy is from the Criterion collection version) that includes a brief history of the film, including the fact that the original version was considered lost for decades.
I can't find any images of the comparison, but one difference between the cut Dreyer cobbled together after the original negative went up in flames and the one we have today is in a scene late in the movie where Joan gets blood-let. First of all, it's an actual arm, an actual knife, and actual blood. And they did it twice, to the same person (apparently not Falconetti), within minutes.
The first version is what's in the restored, original cut. The spray is strong and jumps out of her arm. In the cobbled together cut, the spray is much less powerful. (I know I've seen that alternate take, and I think it's on the Criterion DVD as an extra, but I'm not reorganizing my attic to find it. I have the ripped version of the movie on my hard drive, and that's going to be good enough for now.)
I don't place film preservation on the same level of importance as someone like Martin Scorsese (whose movie Hugo is a celebration of film preservation), but The Passion of Joan of Arc and the fact that it was completely lost for decades, and could have been lost forever, tells me of the effort's importance. I never want to see that cobbled cut with alternate takes for everything. It's not what Dreyer had decided was the best representation of the film he had made. It was a lesser version. I'd never want that.
Greatest Ever
I only order my Top Ten based on either time or alphabetically. I'm not interested in pitting movie 5 and 6 against each other. I just want to celebrate them both.
The one exception to that rule would probably be this. I think that if I were to ever actually order the list from best to least best, The Passion of Joan of Arc would be number 1.
It was the greatest movie ever made in 1928, and I think it very well may be the greatest movie ever made through 2019 still.",10,1,1,20 November 2019
Ant-Man," Obviously the product of a tortured production
","His movie is intentionally light in contrast to the large movies that precede it. I think it's a good idea overall to vary a franchise's output in tone, scale, and even genre, but Ant-Man specifically doesn't really work.The problem is the fact that the main character has no real stake in the central conflict of the story. Scott Lang is an ex-con just released from prison for burglary who wants to go straight in order to be a good father to his little girl. After getting fired from Baskin Robbins because of his criminal past, he joins up with some other ex-cons to pull a small heist. He breaks into an old man's house, gets past both high tech and low tech security and walks away with a suit that he finds out later makes him the size of an ant. After some back and forth in prison, the old man, Hank Pym, recruits Lang to steal some technology from the company that Pym founded by had been kicked out of some decades before.And that's the actual conflict at the heart of the movie. It's between Pym and Darren Cross, the current CEO of Pym's company. Cross is recreating the Pym Particle, the techno-babble nonsense that makes the shrinking possible, a technology that Pym had created many years prior and tried to bury because of its potential implications and uses. Pym doesn't want Cross to get the technology because he sees in Cross some unstable elements, and he's right of course.What does Lang have to do with this fight? He's essentially a mercenary and never has any stake in the central fight itself. He gets roped in because of his need for money and Pym's desire to use his thieving skills (as well as his desire to protect his daughter Hope, who is also in on the plan), but he doesn't have the right level of interest to be the protagonist in this specific story. That's entirely Hank Pym. Pym is the protagonist, but he's built into the story as a secondary character. It creates a weird dynamic within the fabric of the narrative.On top of that, the movie's structurally odd. The entire second act is essentially one long training montage, and it drags. It's entertaining in spots, but ultimately it barely moves the story forward in any significant way. It's Lang sort of amusingly learning his skills while we get massive amounts of exposition about rules of the world, especially rules around ants.And yet, the movie has some entertainment. Paul Rudd is winning as Lang, and his thieving cohorts (led by Michael Pena) are amusing. The two times that Pena tells stories (the first to introduce the heist and the second the end the film and set up a bit in Captain America: Civil War), the editing becomes almost frantic in order to keep up with Pena's quick mouth. They're easily the most enjoyable moments of the film. It makes you wish the rest of the film had been told with a similar energy. The special effects are amusing and different. The juxtaposition of things like a toy Thomas the Tank Engine feeling threatening is enjoyable.However, the story overall is so poorly assembled with a main character that's not actually the protagonist, a below average antagonist, and a dragging second act, that I simply cannot find the fun in the work as a whole.",5,1,1,25 November 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," The most evenly good film of Phase 1
","This is the most Joe Johnston movie that Joe Johnston has ever made. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it seems to make sense. I mean, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer have a distinct feel about them and Captain America: The First Avenger takes those aesthetic and narrative generalities and just ups them.Steve Rogers is just a skinny kid with a big head in Brooklyn who really wants to join the army and punch Hitler in the face after the outbreak of World War II, but he's just too small and too unhealthy for the army. They refuse to take him despite his repeated attempts with fake names just to join up. On his sixth try, he's noticed by a scientist, Dr. Erskine, who sees his good heartedness and signs him up for an experiment within the army. Steve turns out to be the most selfless of brave of the recruits, so he gets chosen to be pumped full of drugs to become a super soldier, with the added benefit of his head being the right size for his body now.After a spy wrecks the scene, kills Erskine, and almost gets away, Rogers gets relegated to PR duties for the army, selling war bonds while punching Hitler in the jaw on stage. It's not really what he had expected, so when he goes on a USO tour for the troops, he realizes the disparity between the public image of himself that he had begun to belief and the reality of war. Everything's dirtier and dingier than the bright reds whites and blues of the stage he had occupied for the last weeks and months. And, to make it all even worse, the real soldiers see him as little more than a joke.Being a super soldier and ready to do his real duty, Rogers strikes out on his own to rescue a group of captured Americans thirty miles behind enemy lines. He breaks in, breaks them out, and then comes face to face with the Red Skull, the leader of Hitler's R&D division Hydra (they talk about hydra and heads and the cutting and the thrice over replacing, but they don't really do anything with it in this film). Red Skull is the victim of an earlier version of the same serum that gave Rogers his super strength, but instead of turning Red Skull into a great man, it only made the bad man worse and drove him to a level of madness. Other than that, he's generic with a generic goal of world domination and destruction.Having proven himself worthy of trust, Rogers becomes a real captain and starts to lead a series of missions with a 21st century approved gang of diversity to destroy a series of factories run by Hydra. It's a grand two-minute montage that feels like a recap of another movie. I really feel like the second half of the film should have been streamlined by removing the extra bases, keeping it to one, and giving us a real men on a mission story. Instead, none of the gang creates an impression because they don't have enough screen time except Bucky, Rogers' friend from New York, who ends up falling to his death and will surely never ever ever come back in this series again. Ever.Then we have our big action finale with breaking into a bunker, energy weapons, flamethrowers, cars chasing airplanes, little airplanes running into a big airplane, and a fistfight with some special effects to end it all. It's all functional and executed with some modest level of distinction.If the movie were just its plot, I would like it a good bit less than I do. The plot feels truncated and typical, but what makes this movie work is Rogers and his nascent romance with Agent Carter. It is Agent Carter who functions first as Rogers' handler. She's pretty and British and the perfect kind of movie woman for Rogers: single. When they first meet, it's before Rogers gets his infusion of delicious blue drugs and Rogers is tiny. It's obvious that she sees him as little more than one part of her job. His transition into beefcake awakens the more primal part of Carter's psyche (I love the moment when she tries to touch his peck and then pulls away). He becomes the perfect combination of aw-shucks charm, good man, and hunk, and the romance feels earned. A big part of that is due to how little ground within the romance actually gets covered. They're nowhere near a marriage proposal or jumping into bed by the final moments in the movie. They're only at the point where Rogers wants to ask her for a dance. It's so sweet and innocent and the attraction between them feels so genuine that as Rogers is making his self-sacrifice to save the world at the end and they're talking about a date that both know they'll never have, it's heartbreaking.Oh, and then it becomes a commercial for The Avengers because corporate synergy.Overall, I think Captain America is the most evenly good of the Marvel movies up to this point. Iron Man's central character arc is jagged and disjointed. Thor is great is spurts but functional for the rest. Captain America, though, is nicely entertaining from beginning to end. It's not a great film, but it is a pretty good one.",7,2,2,25 November 2019
Predator," Genre mashup
","What I find most interesting about Predator from a narrative perspective is the fact that it changes genres after half an hour. It quickly runs through the conventions of a big budget 80s action movie with a huge action set piece led by the muscle bound lead Arnold Schwarzenegger, the plot essentially resolves, and then it becomes another movie for the next hour or so.The action movie of the first half hour is quick and dirty. We get a group of elite mercenaries who are given a mission by a CIA operative to go into another country and extract a foreign minister, and we have just enough time with each of them to differentiate them from each other. We know little of them beyond one is a sexual tyrannosaurus, another loves telling dirty jokes, and the rest look different. Along the way to the remote rebel base in the middle of the jungle, there are hints that there's something else out there, but they're largely pushed aside in favor of focusing on the mission. The attack on the base is a great example of excessive action filmmaking from the 80s with quippy one-liners from Arnold, big explosions, lots of gunfire, and a well placed knife to the abdomen from several yards away. The plot resolves when Arnold finds out that his old buddy, Dillon the CIA operative, was lying to them about there being a foreign minister in need. They were after a document stash instead. This doesn't really come up again. It does provide a bit of tension within the group as they head back to the pickup site where Dillon isn't viewed as trustworthy.It's at the tail end of the attack that we get our first real confirmation that there's something else in the jungle with them. I gotta say that I love the point of view look for the Predator, using faux heat maps to view the world. It's decidedly different from how we look, more than just a filter over an image but something almost alien that we have to interpret in a new way.And that's the point where the movie turns from an 80s action movie into something else. It's a claustrophobic monster movie that's set outside and where we barely see the monster. I find the first half hour of the film fine if not particularly special, but I find the rest of the film something else entirely. It's a survival horror film against a powerful and intelligent enemy that gets three, count 'em, three separate reveals, each one cooler than the last.As the hunt goes through our discernable mercenaries, ultimately leaving Arnold and the young woman they captured, the deaths become more elaborate and brutal. One of the joys of the film is the fact that both predator and prey are actually intelligent. The mercenaries set traps. The predator can work his way around them. It's a game of cat and mouse, and its only by chance that Arnold figures out a way to hide himself (though wouldn't the mud heat up to Arnold's body temperature after a time?) leading to the final large confrontation. The way Arnold almost gets the predator into a trap, the predator figures it out and sidesteps it is a really satisfying moment. It shows that both Arnold and the predator are smart and strong opponents.Of course, the creature design is great. As I said, the predator has three reveals. The first I the first time we see his light bending camouflage. The second is when he uncloaks and we see him with his mask. The final time is when he takes off his mask, revealing his fantastic set of elaborate and hideous jaws underneath. Each time we see the creature, he's revealing more and it's really satisfying, reminding me how the xenomorph keeps changing form in Alien.It's first act is rudimentary and functional, and the thinness of the characters doesn't help. However, the style and execution of the bulk of the film is what makes it special. It's a very fun creature feature that understands the basics of how to use its creature effectively in ways that Spielberg accidentally found in Jaws. It's a really fun balance that we get a lot of looks at the creature but it gets to keep changing, taking the design deeper several times. Arnold is himself, and the rest of the cast acts appropriately tough and scared. It's a good time at the movies.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
The Shining," It's not about the symbols
","Analysis of Kubrick's 1980 horror film tends to devolve into pure symbology, and I find that type of analysis dull at best. I've seen breakdowns of the film that range from it being a comment on alcoholism, family breakdown, American history regarding Native Americans, and even the gold standard. These are about sussing out patterns that require either very isolated readings of certain elements or the use of outside factors like Stephen King's novel in order to support. I prefer to view The Shining rather simply, as a horror film.The things that some other people latch onto in order to try and explain the film are definitely in the film, but, to take perhaps the most ridiculous example, the idea that Stanley Kubrick made a film about a man trying to murder his family that is actually about the end of the gold standard in America is, shall we say, absurd. People have fun with this kind of analysis, but I have more fun enjoying a great chill.It's obvious from the moment we see Jack Torrence for the first time that he's an unhappy man. His smile feels forced, his jokes feel unenthusiastic, and he seems to be hiding something. Through the first half hour, we get hints and stories of Jack's alcoholism that he is recovering from, some violence he visited upon his small child, and a distance from his wife. Three years before the events of the film, Jack came home drunk to find Danny, his boy, messing with his work papers. In a fit of rage he pulled at Danny's arm, dislocating it. Five months before the film, he swore off alcohol for good, refusing to take another drop. His wife, Wendy, implies that the sobriety stems from the violence against Danny, but it goes unremarked by anyone that there are two and a half years between that moment of violence and the moment Jack got on the wagon. The idea that the violence itself was what drove him to give up alcohol isn't true. There are hints that Jack lost his job as a school teacher in Vermont roughly five months before, so it seems like the loss of his livelihood is actually what drove him dry.Jack takes the job as the winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in a remote corner of the mountains in Colorado. He relishes the idea of taking five months away from the pressures of the real world to focus on writing. While he hasn't written anything yet, since he has no other job, he styles himself as one nonetheless. When they arrive to take possession of the Overlook, Danny meets with Mr. Hallorann who shares Danny's psychic power called 'shining' and giving explanation to the apocalyptic visions of the hotel Danny had seen earlier in the film.Life in the Overlook has a dual effect on Jack. He expresses great love for the hotel itself and the isolation it offers him, but it's obvious that something's eating away at him from the inside. He tries to write, but Wendy keeps distracting him. The rest of the family finds way to fill their days by running through the large hedge maze and Danny rides his plastic tricycle through the halls. It's here that the weirdness and supernatural begins to amp up with visions of dead girls and a naked woman who attack Danny, seduces Jack, and then repels him by becoming an old woman whose body is water decayed. Wendy doesn't know what to believe, first blaming Jack for the violence against Danny before running to Jack for protection.Jack's losing it though. He sees a bartender and has some Jack Daniels in the Gold Room, the giant ballroom. He talks to the previous caretaker, Mr. Grady, who is dead and had killed his own whole family in the hotel ten years before. He's also been writing nothing but 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,' on a typewriter over an entire ream of paper. He's primed for violence, and he takes an axe in pursuit of his family. Mr. Hollorann, though, is called to the Overlook by Danny's shining before getting quickly dispatched by Jack. Danny outsmarts Jack by luring him into the maze in the middle of the winter night, getting him lost, and then exiting out. Jack then freezes to death and appears in a photograph from a party that happened almost sixty years before.In terms of why this movie works so well in the terror department, I think it's best to start with the Steadicam. The way Kubrick uses the smooth movement of the new invention creates a sense of unease. There's something wrong about how the camera's clear focus and steady passage through an environment that feels unnatural. Shots seem to go on for too long. Everything is too easy to see. And the grace of the camera around the sets feels just too perfect. We don't see these kind of camera moves in the one major scene that's set outside the Outlook, that in the Torrence home in Boulder, so it's exclusive to the hotel, giving it an otherworldly feel.The music itself is atonal and metronomic at times, creating another source of unease that permeates the film. From the opening of the film, we can just feel that something isn't right with the place. We obviously can't put our finger on it, but the filmmaking is telling us implicitly. On top of that is Mr. Ullman telling Jack about Mr. Grady's murder and suicide from a decade before.Another great source of terror is, well, the source of terror. This is a ghost movie where the ghosts don't really do a whole lot. Lloyd, the bartender, gives Jack a drink of Tennessee whiskey (not bourbon, jeez, TOTALLY different). Whether that is actually liquor passes Jack's lips isn't something with a real explanation in the film, but it's Jack's belief that it is real that's important. He feels refreshed taking that drink in a way that he hasn't felt in five months. That effect on Jack is what drives him to become violent. He's the source of terror. In a family unit, the father turns on the mother and child. It's the destruction of what should be something naturally safe. The ghosts are dressings of terror. The source itself is the destruction of this family.And the destruction of the family really began before the movie. Jack is obviously unhappy in his marriage and Wendy seems to have no idea. Maybe it's the fact that Jack hasn't had a drop of liquor in almost half a year. Maybe it's because Wendy is both passive and kind of annoying in her need to appease her husband. Maybe it's that Jack's life is obviously not where he had planned it. Whatever it was that had driven Jack from his teaching job, it's pretty obvious that it wasn't something he wanted to happen (my guess is that he went to school drunk one too many times). His isolation with only his family heightened the contrast within him between his dreams, manifested in the idea of writing a book, and his reality, manifested in an endless stream of pages that all say the same thing in different arrangements. Unable to cope with his own failure, he takes it out on his family. Instead of seeing his family as support, he sees them purely as a burden.Looking back through Kubrick's other films up to this point, the breakdown of the family is a repeating motif. The Killing, Lolita, and Barry Lyndon all have strong examples of a family coming apart at the seams. For all three, there's the introduction of a new element (a lover in the first, and a new father figure in the other two) that causes the breakdown of the tender bonds that had existed before. The Shining, of course, also shows the breakdown of a family unit, but there's no literal manifestation of an outer element destroying the bonds in the form of something like a lover. It's the ghosts that are that manifestation here, ghosts that may be figments of Jack's imagination (though, then how does he get out of the food pantry, huh smart guy?). The ghosts are this destructive force that pulls the family apart. Perhaps the alcohol could be seen as the outer force as well (this fits with Jack's violent backstory regarding his harm of Danny). Does Kubrick see the family as something incredibly fragile that could fall apart with just the slightest of strains? He was a family man himself, marrying Christine a short time after meeting her on the set of Paths of Glory and having a darling daughter who appeared as Dr. Floyd's daughter in 2001. Was this perhaps a manifestation of his fear of losing his family? He was an intensely private man who guarded her personal life with great care. Did he fear losing his family if he introduced something new?The Shining is first and foremost an exquisitely crafted horror film. From the camera work, to the geography of the hotel that never quite makes sense, to the performances, and finally to the music, the film creates an otherworldly feel that unnerves the audience, creating the perfect environment to strike terror. That terror is firmly rooted in something very relatable to an audience, the fear of losing family, and it works marvelously. It also could be about the gold standard, I guess.",10,1,1,26 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Bright colors and a sense of fun really do help a movie, don't they?
","I don't have anything against dark and gritty comic book movies, but there is certainly plenty of room for colorful popcorn entertainment in the space (a space I'm largely over).Our central character, Miles Morales, is great. He's got a great mix of self-doubt, impulses towards heroism, and everyman awkwardness to make him both likeable and someone to root for when he gets bitten by his radioactive spider (from the multi-verse, I guess). He, combined with the fun and light tone that pushes the story forward, really makes the movie a good time, despite some flaws.The biggest flaw really is the character of his uncle. He's introduced early as one of two father figures Miles has (the uncle and his actual father). The uncle lives his own life by his own rules, taking Miles to graffiti different spots around New York. His one scene with Miles is actually quite nice, but, SPOILERS, he turns out to be one of about 5 bad guys in the movie. He then dies super quickly after that, at about the halfway point of the movie. The build up of the uncle as a character is too short, and the death happens too early to really be of any real emotional value, undermining the emotional turning point of the movie because it's simply not strong enough.This lends itself to the movie's other flaw, which is the overall busyness of it. There's a lot going on that acts as a distraction to the story. The multiple bad guys and the multiple versions of Spider-Man (who are mostly quite enjoyable in the small bits we get) combine to create chaos that distracts from Miles' actual story, which I really like overall.The core of Miles' story is his relationship with his father, though. The uncle is a sideshow, ultimately, a means to getting the deep emotional moment between father and son that Miles needs in order to go from bumbling amateur to the next real Spider-Man. It's fine as a narrative technique, but the uncle just simply isn't handled well enough.Gosh, I tend to complain about movies that I do actually enjoy, but the thing is I found this movie good, but not great, and I wanted it to be great. So, when I see the movie make, what I believe to be, rather simple missteps, my mind jumps into overdrive about what could have been done to fix it.And yet, I really do enjoy the whole package. The color schemes (the pinks, blues, and greens) are a refreshing change of pace. The light tone is fun. The ending has a lot of imagination going for it as multiple versions of New York begin to manifest in the same place. The central story (a modestly well done hero journey wrapped up in fancy clothes) is handled well, and Miles is a great central character. The other Spider-Men are pretty universally fun. Gosh...I largely just wished they had worked that uncle character into the movie better.",7,0,2,21 November 2019
Duck Soup," One of the Funniest Movies Ever Made
","I've seen this movie a few times, and I laugh consistently through the entire thing every time. And yet, I've never loved another Marx Brothers movie nearly as much as this one. I really do enjoy Monkey Business and the others, but none of them get nearly as much of a reaction from me as Duck Soup. I've often wondered why, and taken this post as an excuse to figure it out.JuxtapositionOne thing that makes comedy tic is juxtaposition when we expect one thing and get something else. This is the woman who looks crippled suddenly standing up and doing a silly dance. We wouldn't expect the woman to move, but less do something so out of character, and that difference between expectations and reality can be a source of laughter.Duck Soup has that in spades. Read the below summary:
In an imagined country called Freedonia (probably European), the government is dealing with a massive financial crisis and has been relying on a sole benefactor to prop up its government in such trying times. That benefactor will only give more money if they follow through on her desire to put a specific man in power as president. The country's elites agree and this man proceeds to get the country into a war with it neighbor Sylvania for petty reasons.That story seems to have the makings of a political thriller, or a grand sweeping drama.Instead, it's used to provide a setting for antics like this:The number itself is good, but I think it's really enhanced by the fact that it's about something so serious as war. This silly display has no place when talking about taking a nation to war, but here are the anarchic Marx Brothers doing just that. (Another great example of this sort of thing is 'Springtime for Hitler' in Mel Brooks' original The Producers and its treatment of Nazis).OutrageousnessIs the humor from the Marx Brothers' outrageous? Sure, Groucho's one liners can get a bit raunchy at times (the Motion Picture Production Code didn't start enforcing censorship until the next year, 1934), but nothing, out of context, should send people to fainting couches. However, I would say that considering the subject matter of the film's story, the humor itself is outrageous in the best of ways.This is being told by scolds what one might or might not say about what should and should not be respected or insulted, thumbing your nose at them, and doing it anyway with glee. 'You can't make fun while people are dying with horrible weapons of war!' one might say a decade and a half after the greatest and most destructive loss of human life the world had ever seen. 'Corruption in government is a serious matter and cannot be made light of!' scolds another.Groucho, Harpo, and Chico look at the speakers, stick out their tongues and just keep on with the anarchy (Zeppo is off to the side trying to start a romance no one cares about with one of the hecklers).It's the very fact that this humor is being done at the expense of serious subjects that it works so well, better than any of their other movies, I think.On the surface, it's just a silly musical number about very little as Groucho mugs about in his own fashion, but if you actually listen to what he's singing, it's borderline horrifying. Here are the opening lyrics:These are the laws of my administration
No one's allowed to smoke
Or tell a dirty joke
And whistling is forbiddenThat's the first thing Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho's character) says he's going to do: oppress speech and actions that he himself enjoys (much like Kim Jong Un). Here's the rest of the song:Rufus:
If chewing gum is chewed
The chewer is pursued
And in the hoosegow hiddenChorus:
If we choose to chew we'll be pursuedRufus:
If any form of pleasure is exhibited
Report to me and it will be prohibited
I'll put my foot down, so shall it be
This is the land of the freeThe last man nearly ruined this place
He didn't know what to do with it
If you think this country's bad off now,
Just wait 'til I get through with itThe country's taxes must be fixed
And I know what to do with it
If you think you're paying too much now
Just wait till I get through with it*Whistle*I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair
I'm strictly on the up-and-up, so everyone beware
If any man's caught taking graft, and I don't get my share
We stand him up against the wall and pop! Goes the weaselChorus:
So everyone beware, you're stricken or unfair
---unless he gets his shareRufus:
If any man should come between a husband and his bride
We'll find out which one she prefers by letting her decide
If she prefers the other man, the husband steps outside
We stand him up against the wall and pop! Goes the weaselChorus:
The husband steps outside, relinquishes his bride
They stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride.He's singing about oppression, murder, punishing the people of the country through heavy taxation, and that he's going to be the most corrupt person in the country. I don't think that the Marx Brothers were trying to 'say anything' with this movie, but if they were, then I think this number is the strongest example of what they might have been doing. Put a song and dance on terrible policy, and people will just sing and dance along.Take that out of context, and it's horrifying. Throw it into a literal song and dance number while everyone cheers on, and it becomes hilarious.War, Marx Brothers StyleOne final note before this lovefest is over. The final ten minutes or so of this 70 minute film (it really is that short) is the war between Freedonia and Sylvania.Again, you see the conflict between the seriousness of the surrounding action (an actual battle) with Groucho's priorities. He wants help, but if he can't get that, send women.The sequence goes on with further absurdity as Groucho ends up changing outfits (completely inexplicably) several times, showing off an impressive array of audacious military outfits, often with large feathers.Perhaps the movie works so well for me because of the limited run time of 70 minutes (apparently Zeppo did have a romantic subplot which got cut, thankfully as they always drag down Marx Brothers films). It doesn't overstay its welcome. It has its anarchic fun and bows off the stage like a good vaudevillian act should do. No matter what, though, I love this movie completely and love to revisit it pretty frequently.",10,0,1,20 November 2019
Apocalypse Now," One of the greatest of war films.
","The SeventiesIn terms of the 1970s of American cinema, in my opinion, the most imposing individual was Francis Ford Coppola. Beyond his own creative output, which was obviously significant, he helped foster some of the most prominent filmmakers of the generation with relationships from mentor to collaborator with people like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Schrader. He was at the center of the new movement of American cinema that we're still seeing the effects of today (most are still making movies, although generally just not at the same level of quality as when they first started).But back in the seventies, Coppola was king. From '72 to '79, he made four movies. All four were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. He won for two of them (The Conversation's loss was to his own The Godfather Part II). The second loss was to Apocalypse Now, which lost to Kramer vs. Kramer Now, I do really like Kramer vs. Kramer, but it's nothing compared to the mad odyssey into the depths of the jungle that is Apocalypse Now.A DifficultyWith the other movies on my list, I had little difficulty explaining to myself why I loved them individually. The disparate parts of each film assembled so easily together into something often beautiful that I found the experience of writing about them easy. Apocalypse Now is very different. I really see it as a work of genuine madness. Coppola went into the jungle and lost his mind on the way out, the perfect mirror of the main character's journey, and I really do feel like the movie captures that amazingly well.But then that leads to the question: How does madness lead to great art? How do you read an art born of madness?I think the only way to really approach it in an abstract sense. Its effect on the viewer as he watches it. There are arguments that all art should be approached that way, but I do personally feel that formal structural and character based approaches are important to both creating and taking in art, but Apocalypse Now largely forbears any formal approach. Long story short, this post is going to be messy. Let's roll!Apocalypse NowRewatching the movie for this post, I was struck by something that I've seemingly never really processed before. The movie is gorgeous to look at. The colors are vibrant with the wide range of greens of the jungle and the great palate of colors that fill in the gaps. The framing of every shot is beautiful, especially around the flight of the helicopters during the 'Ride of the Valkyrie' scene. Even during smaller moments, like when Kilgore walks out of frame, it's perfectly shot.Kilgore is crouching down, talking to Willard, ending on a melancholy note, and then proceeds to stand up and just walk to the right. We never see him again. He just disappears into the war. It's such a perfect end for him, and it's done through simple and effective framing.ThemesAs with my other favorite films, Apocalypse Now isn't terribly explicit about what the movie is actually about. The closest it gets, I think, is this line from General Corman near the beginning of the film:Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and irration, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.That quote outlines the idea at the heart of the film. The conflict between the rational and irrational and good and evil. What we end up seeing during Willard trek up the river into Cambodia is the increasing madness.Is that madness specific to the Vietnam War? The surface of the movie? Is that all there is?I don't think so. I think that the surface is part of the equation, but also the least interesting part. As with all great art, Coppola uses the subject of his film to talk to more immediate and relatable concerns. Not much of the audience lived through Vietnam in country, but most of the audience has seen madness. They've understood obsession. They've understood being lost. They've also understood making a choice to turn back from madness.The Journey's EndMany people consider the journey to Kurtz to be great, but once Willard actually gets there, for the movie to peter out. I disagree, the ending is my favorite part of the whole thing.I believe that part of the issue people have is with Marlon Brando. It's not that he plays the part badly, but that he's pretty obviously fat. He promised to show up lean and mean to the set, but he just loved eating too much to actually do what he promised. Coppola panicked. Kurtz wasn't going to be the highly mobile killing machine as he was in the script. Instead, Coppola had to find another solution, choosing to shoot Brando mostly in shadow and turning what was supposed to be a thin man of action in a bulking heavy threat. I actually think that the combination of shadows that the man's size, along with his insane ramblings makes him a rather terrifying figure.I consider the threat of madness infecting others to be a more imposing threat than a single man swinging through the jungle as some great killer, and by stripping Kurtz of the physicality of the character's original ideal and leaving him with only the madness makes the madness all that much stronger in my mind.And besides, the actual death scene is fantastic, using the sacrificial bull to imply that Kurtz himself is a sacrifice, but to what? Is Willard killing Kurtz out of orders? He says no in the voiceover. I think that it's a rejection of the madness in its entirety. What solidifies that in my mind is how Willard could obviously take Kurtz's place, but he simply grabs Lance, the last member of the boat crew, and walks away.In ConclusionThe movie is both a hard watch and an easy one. It's hard because of the inhumanity on display and the questions that it raises. It's easy to watch because of the magnificent cinematography on display and the great performances by everyone involved.In regards to the two versions of the film, I've only ever seen the original cut. I actually own the Redux version (the DVD I bought years ago came with both on the same pair of discs), but I've simply refused to watch it. I'll probably do it one day. I've heard both good things (people saying that it finally completes the package of the movie and makes it great) and bad things (those saying that, in particular, the French plantation isn't worth the price of admission and doesn't add to the movie in any significant way).In the end, though, this work of madness by a madman who lost himself in the jungle is one of the most significant and greatest films made. A great companion piece, by the way, is Hearts of Darkness, the movie that Coppola's wife made about the making of the movie.",10,3,3,21 November 2019
Van Helsing," A Guilty Pleasure
","This is not what I would call a good movie. It's characters are too thin, the romance too contrived, the structure too loose, and the theme too scattershot, but what it lacks in some of the basic building blocks of storytelling it partially makes up for in charm and a deep seeded desire to entertain no matter what. Those two aspects make Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing something of a guilty pleasure for me. No, it's not good, but I enjoy it every time I watch it.Delving into the story is an exercise not really worth the effort because it's too manically told with the passion of an adolescent hopped upon Red Bull and Mountain Dew, throwing his toys together with a shocking amount of energy at two in the morning. Essentially, Gabriel (not Abraham) Van Helsing is a monster hunter working for Rome, and he carries the burden of being called a murderer because everyone sees the results of his work but not the efforts. It's a question that the movie brings up from time to time but has little to not ability to expand upon beyond the initial ask. It's not concerned with Van Helsing as a man but as a vehicle through which to drive the audience through the plot and hang a couple of mysterious questions about his past that area supposed to add to the overall mystery.He gets sent to Transylvania along with Carl, a friar who ends up acting as Q to the James Bond that is Van Helsing, supplying him with weapons along the way. Carl is one of the biggest sources of fun in the film. He's the fish out of water, not a field man, and he's played really wittily by David Wenham. When he doesn't seem to be having a blast, he's amusingly out of his element with a creaky voice that barley conceals pure terror.In Transylvania, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, a Romanian princess descended from a long line of hunters out to kill Dracula. Her brother gets turned into a werewolf and she helps Van Helsing fight off an attack of three flying Brides of Dracula. The basic plot is that Dracula is trying to use the technology that brought Frankenstein's monster to life in order to bring his large cadre of dead-born children to life. There are chases, fights, explosions, and all manner of chaos.The movie's best sequence comes late at a masquerade ball where Dracula has captured Anna and is trying to trade her for Frankenstein's monster that Van Helsing has found. It's a visual delight with acrobatics, dancing, singing, and special effects. The movie's ultimate climax in Dracula's castle makes the mistake of having both the hero and the villain transform into CGI monsters, robbing the audience of investment in the conflict by hiding the faces of those we've spent time with, but since there's no real investment to be had, it's not as bad as it could have been.Really, it's not good. I went back and found Roger Ebert's three star review of the film, and I agree with everything he said. However, I just can't quite say that even though I have a good time with the film that it's actually good. That's all I need, right? To have a good time? Well, it's thin entertainment that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, the sort of thing I couldn't watch too frequently because the sloppy construction would get to me.It's a guilty pleasure, and I have no real problem admitting that.",5,0,0,7 July 2020
Aliens," The best example of Bigger is Better
","There are several ways to approach making a sequel to a successful genre film. One of them is 'bigger is better'. James Cameron's 1986 Aliens might be the textbook example of how to do that.The movie follows so many of the same basic plot points and character models as the first that it could almost be called a remake. A group of working class people land on LV-426 where they are attacked by aliens, killing everyone but a few. The few fight back, thinking they've succeeded before a final fight erupts on the escape ship. Having won, everyone goes to sleep in freezer pods for the long flight home.I detail that not as a criticism, but only observationally. Stories work because of execution not because of basic plot details, and Aliens is executed marvelously.Ripley, having survived her first experience with the xenomorph on the Nostromo, has drifted through space for 57 years while in cryo-sleep. She gets picked up and returned to the Company who nurse her back to health and debrief her about her experience. No one believes her experiences, though there's enough interest to get the colonists on LV-426 to check out the coordinates Ripley supplied. Of course, the Company loses contact with the colony immediately afterwards and they have to go in. Ripley gets roped in and tags along with a group of Colonial Marines. They find the colony deserted save Newt, a little girl hiding in ducts, before all hell breaks loose and the xenomorphs come calling, tearing apart the marines one by one.You can see the 'bigger is better' mentality running through that. The setting is bigger (a colony instead of a small ship). The group of people is bigger. The type of people are bigger than life (space marines versus space truckers). The weapons are bigger (rifles and grenades versus makeshift prods and flamethrowers). The number of aliens is bigger (one versus many). There's even the introduction of a new type of xenomorph, a much bigger Queen. The film embraces bigger in every way, and in doing so it fundamentally changes the nature of the horror that was present in the first film.Cameron was smart enough to understand that by changing the scope of the threat (from one alien to many) he was changing the type of horror present. The first film was essentially a claustrophobic survival horror film. Some of those elements are still present in the sequel, but they're far less prominent. The sequel is still a horror film, but it's changed subgenres from the haunted house to an action horror film. That change is perfectly cast for the change in scale of the threat.It also makes sense from a practical perspective. In the first, the xenomorph was untouchable, but that was an element of the crew's unpreparedness. Sending in marines with big guns changes the relationship between the characters and the threat. The aliens could have been made invincible, but that might have been too far in the suspension of disbelief department, so increasing their number was probably the most logical choice. Swarms of aliens that you can't see until it's too late replace a single entity that could be around every corner. That also requires another extension of the aliens in the form of a new type of creature, hopefully bigger, and the queen fits the bill exactly. She's huge and terrifying.Moving on to thematic material, Aliens actually continues Ripley's journey instead of just repeats it. If Alien was about the destruction of a family, Aliens is about recovering from trauma by forming a new family. Ripley can't sleep through the night because she's so consumed by nightmares of her past experience. It's the reason she goes on the mission to begin with. She thinks that by confronting what hurt her, she may free herself of her own fear. Finding Newt, the little girl, gives her a purpose beyond her own survival. Newt becomes Ripley's daughter (a connection made more potent through a deleted scene that's included in the Special Edition of Ripley's actual daughter cursing Ripley for leaving her alone her whole life), and Corporal Hicks takes on the mantle of father and husband to the pair.The final act of the film is entirely predicated on the newly formed family being threatened and torn apart. An alien grabs Newt and takes her to another part of the colony to be impregnated with another alien. Ripley has to go in herself, leaving Hicks behind in their escape ship because of his injuries. It becomes one mother (Ripley) against another mother (the Queen), a symmetry between the two characters that adds an extra thematic oomph to the final act. It plays with much more character that way instead of just bad assed woman going up against a large creature.The real final fight on the Sulaco where Ripley gets in her mech suit and has, essentially, a fist fight with the Queen is one of the most gratifying and visceral special effects driven fights in popular film. It's mother against mother after Ripley destroyed all of the Queen's children. The fight is perfectly filmed and completely believable, giving Ripley the kind of physical advantage that is both believable and satisfying.The movie's just pure action horror entertainment that's very smart about how it uses its characters to establish themes that feed into the terror. It's bigger, louder, and with many more explosions, and it's probably the best example of bigger is better filmmaking.",10,2,3,26 November 2019
Captain America: Civil War," The most thematically ambitious and mature of the Marvel films
","Out of all the Marvel movies, this is the one that I want to love the most, but I can't quite do it. There's so much going on that goes so well, that the fact that it doesn't land as well as it should and has a couple of large distractions undermines the affair enough to disappoint me, but not enough to take it from goodness.The Avengers are causing collateral damage. They're doing good work, but they're also hurting people along the way. The governments of the world appreciate the fact that the world isn't being run by Loki, but they feel like a line needs to be drawn and the Avengers need to be reined in. Some Avengers agree, and others do not. This provides the political reason for the split within the Avengers, but the movie doesn't turn it personal early enough, in my opinion. An esoteric fight about the relative limits on Avengers power is a great place to start the conflict of the film, but it hangs on that for too long before it gives us the gut punch change that turns the conflict personal and what drives the final twenty minutes of the film.The Winter Soldier is still on the loose after the events in The Winter Soldier, and it looks like he's bombed a UN complex in Vienna when the Sokovia Accords are being signed that will limit the Avengers' authority. This explosion also kills the King of Wakanda, who is there to sign the Accords. A chase ensues after Cap gets a heads up on where Bucky, the Winter Soldier, is, and he helps him escape temporarily until they end up captured and arrested. It is here that Zemo, the actual antagonist of the film, inserts himself, setting off an EMP that kills power in Berlin and gives the secret command codes to Bucky that turns him into the Winter Soldier. Cap gets Bucky away and finds out where Zemo is going next. In order to get to Siberia, Cap and Bucky need to get an aircraft.It is at the airport that the big battle between the heroes breaks out. It's big, inventive, fun, and ultimately pretty pointless (the physical stakes in these movies have gotten laughably low), leading Cap Bucky to getting an airplane, chased by Iron Man and the Black Panther. In Siberia, two hours into the movie, we finally learn Zemo's plan and have the movie move from an political argument to a personal one. Zemo wants to tear apart the Avengers from the inside, knowing he's not physically strong enough to take them on, so he uses the truth that Bucky, as the Winter Soldier, killed Tony Stark's parents to splinter them completely. It's such a great and brutal fight between three people in an enclosed space.Ultimately, as I said earlier, I wanted to love this movie. It's got strong themes of liberty versus regulation that echo through so much of what's going on. It eventually distills that beginning intellectual conflict into a personal one between two heroes we've grown attached to over the years. It looks really good and the action is better filmed than it was in The Winter Soldier. However, the big airport fight, while fun, is pretty pointless. We do get one injury, but that's it, keeping the stakes of these fights really low. There are too many characters that have their moments that don't feed into the larger narrative (Spider-Man being the most egregious example). And Zemo is underdeveloped. I love the idea of Zemo, but the execution is so relegated to the back end of the film that it ends up losing its impact.I'd love to see this movie with a smaller cast that allows for greater focus on the central conflict between Stark and Rogers. I'd love for Zemo to have a strong narrative presence early, and I'd love for the information on Bucky's involvement with Tony's parent's death to come out earlier and define Tony's motives well before the final act. I can imagine scenes where people confront Tony with his opposition ' to Rogers's side because he's driven by revenge, and he needs to balance his ideals with his personal emotions before ultimately giving in to his emotional side.Still, there's so much that's so good here. It has some of the same issues as Age of Ultron, but it does a better job of holding it all together. It also feels like it gets closer to something special, even if it still falls short. It coulda been great.",7,1,3,25 November 2019
Die Hard 2," McClane gets added into an Airport sequel
","This is a movie that is driven purely by plot needs with no room for anything else other than action scenes. No one feels like they have a life outside of the basic plot actions that they need to fulfill. The whole exercise then feels like a mechanical product with no life or soul to it. It feels dead because there doesn't feel like there's a single living person involved.It's pretty obvious that this movie was originally a script that had nothing to do with John McClane because McClane feels oddly out of place for most of it. He wanders in and out of rooms that he shouldn't even begin to have access to as a Los Angeles police officer in a Washington DC airport. His emotional connection to the terrorist attack on the airport is thin, almost tacked on. McClane has one very brief interaction with the main antagonist, Colonel Stuart, at the very beginning of the film, and the two don't meet until they're punching each other on the wing of a 747 at the end of the film. There's a deep disconnect between McClane and the rest of the movie that feels like a lost Airport sequel more than a sequel to Die Hard.Speaking of Colonel Stuart, he's a waste. William Sadler is one of those really interesting and intense character actors who popped up everywhere in the 80s and 90s, and all he really does in this is explain and dictate. He explains his plan and he dictates rules to the airport's control tower. He talks about his motive once, but most of his interactions with other characters are perfunctory and plot based. This is where the lack of interaction with the main character really begins to fray the film. Stuart interacts so much more with the air traffic flight director Trudeau than with McClane, like the original story was about them in a game of wits and the screenwriter simply added McClane running around the airport as filler to get him into the story.In the original Die Hard, John came to Los Angeles in an effort to make good with his wife, and a bunch of terrorists got in the way, taking Holly hostage. In the sequel, it's unclear how much danger Holly is ever actually in, and it seems arguable that all of McClane's actions actually put Holly in greater danger than if he had simply waited in the airport terminal for everything to resolve on its own. You see, Colonel Stuart's plan is to hold the airport hostage for an hour (58 minutes, actually, after the source story's title) so that a foreign dictator can safely land at Dulles and Stuart can steal him away for a, supposed, payment and a hit against communism somehow. At no point does Stuart seem willing to kill everyone in the sky if things go well. He does crash one airplane, but only after Trudeau and McClane (on his own) try to get to a communications tower in contradiction of Stuart's orders. Stuart never threatens to down any other plane in any other circumstance unless he doesn't get what he wants. I do not see how McClane reads this situation as one where he needs to make the terrorists' lives harder. If his objective is to save Holly, he should stand back and let things play out. If his objective is to simply do the right thing, he never seems to realize that he's putting his wife's life in danger. Either way, the smart everyman of the first film has become a psychopathic moron in the second.The structure of the film is also really weird, mostly around a US Special Forces team led by Major Grant. They're introduced about halfway through the film, do nothing for about half an hour until they have a staged shootout, and then they turn on the good guys with about twenty minutes left in the film. The late addition and lack of attention given to them makes their betrayal feel empty not surprising. I think they should have been introduced no later than half an hour in, taken a lead on the counterattack for an hour, working hand in hand with McClane for the whole time, and then, when things are looking like they're unraveling completely, they turn on McClane, pushing the nadir further. This would also require more time spent with Grant and his men than with another pigheaded idiotic cop (the airport police chief Lorenzo) in the disdainful tradition of Deputy Chief Robinson from the first film.In addition, the effort to bring a bunch of the pieces of the original Die Hard over and in Dulles Airport strains credulity. John McClane is there on the ground. Holly, his wife, is in a plane overhead. Okay, I can accept that, but then Roger Thornburg just happens to be in the same plane. And John calls Al for help.Oh, and the throwaway tagline from the first film that became super famous simply had to be included in this one even though it actually made sense in context of the first film and comes out of nowhere in the second.I simply do not like this film. It's poorly constructed, wastes a great character actor in a nothing part for its antagonist, feels randomly assembled from different ideas, and continues ideas in the flattest possible way from the first film. Renny Harlin is a hack.",3,0,1,18 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," A great first two hours and a meh final hour
","This is more built like a traditional movie with a recognizable three act structure than Avengers: Infinity War was. I quite like it overall, but that traditionalism requires an antagonist that isn't really needed, I don't think.The three acts are pretty distinct. The first is almost purely character driven. Our massive roster of heroes has been culled to almost exclusively the original six (Cap, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye) with a few others (Rocket, Nebula, Ant-Man). Considering the film's length, this gives each character enough time to stand out. I think the decision to jump ahead five years was very smart. The characters have all changed in those five years, and we have to spend time with each of them getting to know them again. We're essentially being introduced to new characters, and the movie takes its time with it. My favorite of these, not based on the introduction but based on what comes later, is Thor.Thor is consumed by his failure to aim just a bit higher when he threw his axe at Thanos. If he had hit Thanos in the head instead of the chest, Thanos would not have performed the snap, wiping out half of existence, so he sits in a small corner of Norway where the remnants of Asgard have established a new home. He plays video games, drinks copious amounts of beer, and yells at 12 year olds who make fun of the rock monster Korg online. He's a sad, fat, king who lords over the small domain he wishes to keep (his living room). We see the other characters in similarly different states. Tony has walked away from a life surrounded by technology and lives in a nice wooden cabin by a lake. Cap leads self-help meetings. Hulk has found equilibrium with Bruce Banner. Black Widow stays in her office, sending other people out to search for Hawkeye who's left home after his family disappeared, killing those he deems worthy of death.It's a surprisingly somber and solid hour of character based storytelling, introducing us to the new rules of a new world with familiar characters who've all changed. The one who hasn't changed is Ant-Man. Scott Lang was trapped in a gobbledygook science state that he thought only lasted five hours but actually lasted five years. He hasn't changed, and it is through his eyes that we mainly see how things have changed. He's also the impetus for the movement that leads to the second act: The Time Heist.I've seen the Time Heist described as fan service, and I can't entirely disagree but I do in part. There's so much more to this than just seeing things from the past that Marvel fans liked from slightly different angles. That's definitely part of it, and we get some standardly amusing quippy humor, especially from Ant-Man, Iron Man, and Cap ('America's ass' indeed). However, there's a lot more going on especially around Thor. Thor goes back in time (using gobbledygook science that Tony Stark pulls out of nowhere because movie) to Asgard during the events of Thor: The Dark World. The task of retrieving the Beauty Stone becomes completely secondary to Thor's time spent with his mother in a wonderfully touching scene between mother and son where she helps him find his purpose again. It's the sort of emotionally driven scene that believably takes a character from one place and gets them into another. I mean, a tender visit with your dead mom might do just that.Before going any further, you have to talk about this new (old) version of Thanos. Thanos gets his head chopped off in the first sustained sequence of the film, but with time jumping, the older version of the heavy gets introduced. I have to imagine that there's a very early draft of this film that doesn't include Thanos at all past the fifteenth page because Thanos has nothing to do with the central conflict of the story (jumping through time to collect the Infinity Stones). He's purely extra. He shows up after the task is done to fight the world's mightiest heroes and introduce a late, unrelated, obstacle.And that's what the last hour is, an unrelated fight that breaks out in epic style and is just packed full of fan service. The last hour is little beyond that. Every hero comes back when Hulk reverses the snap, and we get an even more concentrated and bigger version of the fight as in the last film. Don't get me wrong, this stuff is fun to a certain degree and well assembled, but the story's effectively over by that point and yet it just keeps going. I loved the movie up to this point, and then I just kind of got deflated. 'Oh, this is what we're doing now, huh?'So, yeah, I loved about two hours of this and tolerated the third. The first two hours aren't perfect (Tony thinking about time travel for five minutes and finding the perfect answer is just the kind of ludicrous that Marvel is permeated with and sort of just bugs me), but the strong stuff there is very strong. It's just kind of too bad that the movie 'needed' an antagonist shoe-horned in its final act in order to make fans happy.",7,0,4,26 November 2019
Quantum of Solace," A curious mix of Quality
","Apparently, the most interesting parts of this movie's story were come up with on set and the least interesting parts were the actual script. Paul Haggis delivered the film's final draft two hours before the writers' strike began and the production didn't wait for it to end. They went straight into production, but they wouldn't have been making up stuff on the fly if they had been confident of the draft they had in hand. From what I've read, everything about Bond's rage and emotional journey was stuff that Daniel Craig and director Marc Forster came up with while shooting, while the overwritten plot around a secretive criminal organization was in the Haggis draft.A lot of grief goes to the movie's embrace of Jason Bourne style action filmmaking, and I understand that. It's a visual aesthetic that a lot of people simply don't like, but I don't have an inherent problem with it. I think Forster actually handles the format rather well, within the box of that type of filmmaking. The pieces are small and frantic, but they do add up to a rather cohesive whole that I can discern. Ironically, it's clearer than the more traditionally filmed The World is Not Enough. It's not at the quality of Paul Greengrass's The Bourne Supremacy, but it's still good enough.The movie picks up moments after the end of Casino Royale with Bond speeding away with Mr. White in his trunk after having shot him in the leg at the end of the previous adventure. He takes his captive to M in Sienna, Italy, where Mr. White promptly escapes by declaring that they have people everywhere and a long-time aide to M turns on them instantly, killing all but Bond and M. Bond chases the double agent and kills him, but lets Mr. White escape.Bond then sort of goes rogue, but not really, in investigating the organization that Mr. White referred to, taking him to Haiti where he finds Camille Montes and Dominic Greene. Camille is Dominic's lover, and Dominic is the CEO of Greene Planet, a major corporation that does a lot of ecological and environmental work. It's obvious that there's more to him, of course, when he deals with a South American general in search of funding for a coup and Dominic is happy to provide it while also threatening Camille's life.The action scene that follows is confusing, though. Not in terms of literal action, but in terms of motive. I do not understand why Bond intervenes. I suppose he's trying to save Camille from the clutches of the general, but after he gets her away, he just dumps her off to the first porter he sees with a comment about how she's seasick. It's weirdly callous and he's placing her right back in danger. If it wasn't for her safety, was it for the general's safety since Camille was going to kill him? Why would Bond have any interest in that? Intervening in something tangential like that just ignites interest in his presence. It's a weird and seemingly pointless action scene.The action then moves to Austria where the secretive organization, now known as Quantum, meets at an opera. It's weird. While a production of Tosca plays, they talk to each other in the audience through earpieces. Bond steals one, hears enough information and ruins the party, taking pictures of some obvious members who get up and leave. I love the idea of giant secretive organizations, but the effort to make their meetings interesting often ends up feeling odd instead of intriguing. Instead of just using basic communications technology in the privacy of their homes, they go out into the open and talk to each other during an opera? Sure, it looks good in the film, but it makes no sense.We then follow Bond as he goes to Bolivia where Dominic has a big party announcing some big something or other in a fundraiser. Bond and Camille get clues to a remote hotel in the desert where the final confrontation takes place. There are many explosions and the good guys win.I think part of my problem with the movie's plot is that it tries very hard to hide what the bad guy's plan actually is. We spend about three-quarters of the film thinking that it has to do with oil (even going so far as to kill the second Bond girl, Gemma Arterton, by filling her lungs with and covering her with oil in a visual replay of the golden girl in Goldfinger). However, the plot isn't about oil, it's about cornering the water of Bolivia. There's an important point that comes very late in the film that Bolivia is in the middle of a water crisis. It's shoved very late in the film and would have been good framing information to have early if the movie was more interested in telling a story than tricking the audience.I am not a fan of this film's plot or antagonist. It's tricky instead of intriguing. The antagonist is dull and ends the film in an action beat that feels really out of place. However, there is some interesting stuff that Bond goes through. It begins the movie assuming he's filled with rage towards Versper from her actions in Casino Royale and towards the people who turned her against him. He works through that process as he learns that he doesn't need to kill everyone, maxing out his License to Kill, essentially in a mirror journey with Camille. She's also driven by rage against the general and kills him, while Bond sees how it drives her and actually ends up trying to pull her back. This is enhanced by Bond's interactions with Mathis, the MI6 agent he turned against in the previous film because of Le Chiffre's admission that Mathis worked for him (which turned out to be a lie). Holding Mathis as he dies, Bond sees a path forward out of rage. It culminates with the movie's final scene in Russia when Bond confronts Vesper's supposedly dead Algerian boyfriend who's actually a Quantum asset and he lets him live, turning him over to authorities instead of exacting revenge. It's a surprisingly well-made journey for Bond, and I think it works reasonably well.It's just stuck in a movie that doesn't deserve it.The action is fine, the character work is good, but the plot around it is needlessly confusing and the antagonist is a joke. It's a real mixed bag of a film that I want to like a whole lot more than I do. But, alas, I simply can't get past my issues with it.",5,1,2,10 March 2020
Toy Story 4," The best of the Toy Story movies
","There is no reason that a movie about toys should be this emotional affecting, but there's no denying it. Woody's journey in this movie feels as real to me as any in recent memory. It takes the fantastical situation of living toys and applies a recognizable metaphor that relates to the human experience, all done with possibly the most realistic visuals of any animated movie and in a lively idiom that can appeal to children at the same time. It's a delicate balancing act that the movie pulls of perfectly.Toy Story 3 seemingly left off at the perfect spot. The toys had said goodbye to Andy, their previous kid, and they were placed in the hands of a little girl named Bonnie. All seemed well with the world, and there should be nowhere else emotionally for them to go. Well, they found something really good for Woody, and that was uselessness. Bonnie just isn't interested in playing with Woody anymore. This is a very different dynamic than when Buzz showed up in Andy's room in the first film. Woody had his long life with one kid and is trying to start another, but it's just not taking. He doesn't feel indignation at a lost place, because he's never had it with Bonnie, but simply uselessness. He's spent his life giving joy to a kid, and now he's in a position where he can't help.When Bonnie goes to kindergarten orientation and isn't allowed any toys along, so Woody sees his chance and sneaks along, helping her to find solace in the creation of Forky, the new marketing opportunity for Disney. Forky, though, is a handful, and requires Woody's every attention as he tries to throw himself away, convinced that he's nothing more than trash. What makes this Forky bit really effective is that Forky is a mirror image of Woody in every way. Forky is thrown together from a spork and other simple materials while Woody was lovingly crafted decades before. Forky knows his purpose is to be trash and not help a kid, but Woody is effectively trash and knows that his purpose is to help a kid. Their bonding helps provide Woody with the beginning of clarity that maybe his time as a kid's toy is done.That doesn't come to complete fruition, however, until Woody meets Bo-Peep again. Lost for more than seven years and without a kid, Bo has lived her life of freedom to the fullest, getting played with by random kids but never tying herself down to a single kid. The two are at odds because Woody is desperate to get back to Bonnie after having been separated from her and Bo simply cannot understand why he would want to continue in that life having given so much already. Out of their past friendship, though, Bo helps Woody track down Forky after he's been taken by Gabby Gabby, the queen bee toy of the local antique shop.Gabby Gabby has a similar journey as Woody. She's useless, in her mind, because of a broken voice box and all she wants is to fix it so she can appeal to Harmony, the granddaughter of the woman who owns the shop. When she eventually gets the voice box, she gets as rejected as Woody has been by Bonnie, and she enters a deep depression.There are four characters in this film going through similar and related journeys, which is a lot, but the movie makes it work specifically because they're similar and related. They're all touching on the same idea of purpose and just approaching it from different directions. The other key is that three of them play as support to Woody's journey. They help inform Woody's emotional reality. Through Forky, he can see that his purpose isn't always to actually play with a kid. Through Bo, he can see the value of living without a kid. Through Gabby, he gives away a part of himself that makes him a toy in order to help another find a kid. When Woody eventually lets go of his life as a kid's toy, it's a decision that makes perfect sense for him, providing him with an enticing alternative life with Bo. It reflects, in a certain way, the empty nest of a parent who's seen their children off to college, looking for a new life to live not centered around another person dependent on them. It's a relatable feeling that bridges the emotional gap between living people and a rubber toy in a movie.In addition to the movie's strong emotional and narrative core, there are strengths abounding. The voice acting is great. There was a technical innovation that provided Pixar the ability to more accurately reflect light levels that gives the visuals a far more textured and realistic look, making the whole affair more sumptuous to simply look at. There's a wide array of side characters both old and new (from Buzz and Jesse to the new Duke Caboom) that fill out the edges of the frame to entertaining effect.From beginning to end, the film is thematically rich, entertaining, and a joy to watch. This is one of Pixar's best films.",10,5,8,17 January 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Much more than its opening sequence
","Steven Spielberg is the most effortlessly inventive technical director alive. He's placed shots in this film that move effortlessly from one subject to another, all the while each moment provides a new piece to the story. His inventiveness isn't showy or extraneous, but subtle and key to moving the story forward. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg uses his extreme technical proficiency to tell a very engaging story about the nature of war.The opening sequence of D-Day is the obvious standout in the film. As a dramatization of the landing in Normandy, it's terrifying in effect as it gives us perspective from the beginning of the action to its relative conclusion through Captain Miller. The physical reality of the movement from the landing craft to hiding behind the metal barriers to the beachhead up to the towers. Men get blown apart, and yet the mission has to continue. By the time a soldier deflects one bullet off his helmet miraculously and shot gets shot in the same spot again, but without his helmet, there's a certain desensitizing influence happening to the audience, and that is reflected in how Captain Miller just shrugs off that, and other, moments of extreme violence. There's no time to mourn the dead. There's a mission to accomplish and a beach to take.That effect is at the heart of the film, especially when Miller is given PR mission of marching dozens of miles into the fighting of France to find a single soldier who's lost all three of his brothers to the fighting. He doesn't understand why he should risk his own life and the lives of his men to save one. Their thoughts have turned inward, towards their own self-preservation, having lost sight of the war at large and the other men in uniform around them. This comes to its ironic height when Miller and his men find a downed plane and root through the dog tags of dead soldiers. It's a game to them, and it takes the outsider of their group, Upham, to reorient them real quick with a bit of shaming.Losing two of their number does not help Miller's troops in believing in the mission. Why should they have lost two guys to help the one? Ryan, though, hasn't lost sight of why he's there, and he refuses to go back home. He doesn't talk about the overall war, though. He talks about his fellow men and the bridge they've held for days. Even Miller has talked about how his primary goal in this war was to find a way to go home, and suddenly this kid he's supposed to escort away from danger and to his mother in Iowa is refusing to take even the first step back. He knows his place, and he's going to stay.That dedication reinvigorates Miller and his men, refocusing them. Gone is the antagonism towards Ryan. He couldn't help that his three brothers all died and that the military leadership wanted to help his mother over theirs by getting him home, but they can respect his insistence on staying and fighting.On top of all that, what sets this movie apart from most men on a mission stories is two things. The first is the small character moments. In a movie that has two fantastically large action sequences (D-Day and the Battle at Ramelle), its best moments are very small. The scene in the church at night, as the men talk to each other, each dealing with the loss of one of their men in different ways, is a marvelous look into the minds of men caught in the middle of Hell (my favorite being Wade's story about how he tried to stay awake for his mother), but there's also Ryan's story of home. He talks about how he can't remember the faces of his deceased brothers and moves to talking about the last time all four were together. It's happily nostalgic of what he's lost that ends on a melancholy note. It's a very nice way to really let us get to know this almost MacGuffin that we've heard about for nearly the whole movie.The second thing that sets it apart is the aforementioned technical acumen of Steven Spielberg. There's a shot late in the film that has stuck with me. It's not a dramatic shot in any way shape or form, but the way it evolves transfixed me from the moment I noticed it. We start with the shot of an M1-Garand clip that gets locked into the rifle. The camera pulls back slightly to look at the stern face of the soldier performing the action, and then it focuses out of the building to Upham who's running across the bridge out in front to hide in a crater. It's a shot that lasts about 5 seconds, but it's complex in a subtle way. It's all about showing different parts of the preparation for the upcoming fight, showing us tiny details that add up to a whole. It's also an almost throwaway moment that shows so much forethought and pitch perfect execution.The movie is a technical marvel matched with great performances and an interesting story about the numbing effects of war. It's a men on a mission story that rises above its genre to become truly affecting for the lost men. It is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest films.",10,1,1,17 January 2020
1941," Manic , anarchic, and entertaining
","Watching this almost back to back with Postal (completely coincidentally, by the way) is interesting. They're both rather structureless comedies that aim for constant funnies, but one succeeds rather well where the other fails utterly and miserably. They're both anarchic in spirit, but one is made by a witless idiot while the other is made by a technically expert creative. Anyway...just for the record, this review is based on the longer special edition, which is a full half hour longer than the original theatrical cutJapan has just bombed Pearl Harbor and the people of Southern California are besides themselves with worry. Some prepare for a land invasion by taking out old shotguns and cleaning them. Others sit atop Ferris Wheels to inspect the waters off the coast. Others concern themselves fully with a jitterbug contest that could get them a seven year deal from RKO. Wally couldn't care less about the war or the men signing up for the effort, because he's going to win his girl's heart and steal her away from her father by winning that contest. He's so committed, that he dances throughout his shift at a trashy little diner where he works, getting into a fight with Treat, an army captain, by getting a bit of egg on his jacket. Fired, without any money, and sans sweet zoot suit for the night, he goes into a department store and cranks up an air raid signal to inspire panic and get out with the suit he's trying on without paying.Meanwhile, Major General Stilwell is trying to use his post has head of the army in the area to calm the people down. His aide, Captain Loomis, is far more concerned with getting lucky with the general's new secretary, Donna. The only way she'll got that far with a guy, though, is by going in an airplane into the air. He got kicked out of the air corps after a couple of days, but that's not going to get between him and his time with the goddess (probably the best Nancy Allen ever looked, to be honest).There also is a Japanese submarine just off the coast, captained by Mitamura with the Nazi Captain Kleinschmidt along to observe. Mitamura's objective is to hit America right after Pearl Harbor and strike fear, so he chooses to land an attack on Hollywood, except their compass broke and they don't know where they are. They send a group of ninja trained sailors on shore to kidnap Slim Pickens who won't give up any information, going so far as to swallow a compass taken from a Cracker Jack box they found on his person.Through all of this is Captain Wild Bill Kelso, a pilot in the air corps that's intent on finding a group of Japanese Mitsubishi planes he knows are flying over American airspace (there aren't).There's a lot going on, following a lot of characters, and I find it all rather delirious in some of the best ways. I would have been happier with a cleaner movie overall, but then it would have lost its anarchic appeal. Would we have gotten the magnificent jitterbug dance competition that morphs into a fist fight and then into a giant riot between all three branches of the military and the zoot suiters? All while General Stilwell was sitting across the street in a theater tearfully and joyously enjoying Dumbo? Seriously, this is one of the most purely entertaining spectacles Spielberg ever made, and I don't think it would have happened if the movie was more straightforward.No, this movie is special. It's manic and chaotic, but I never felt overwhelmed or lost. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's really a Frankenstein's monster of four different visions (Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, and John Milius), but they gel rather well into one bulging at the seams whole. It spills out in every direction, cheerfully desperate to entertain. I really enjoyed this movie, and I look forward to revisiting it in years to come.",7,0,1,10 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," A miracle that it works at all
","With so many characters, the Russo brothers made an intelligent choice to center the emotional core of the film within a new character and the only one large enough within the narrative space to justify it: the antagonist. Outside of him, the movie's essentially the biggest episode of a serial ever. It does that quite well, but it ends up squeezing out Thanos a bit. He's good and enough to anchor a movie around, but everything else around him is pure spectacle and little else.I say little else because all of our heroes get their moments. Thor talking about everything he's lost. Vision and Scarlet Witch's little romance taking shape. Peter Quill's grief at the loss of a loved one. It's all there, but it almost all depends on things outside this movie to work. Not that anyone would ever come into this movie without having at least some knowledge of the myriad of franchises that precedes it, but I think it deadens the impact of the moments since the emotional workload isn't held within this movie itself. This isn't like the final moments of a three-part movie like The Lord of the Rings, this is the culmination of more than twenty films, each with their own adventures and main characters, that end up tying together here.So what you do have is a well-produced series of epic fights and events in the vein of a man on a mission type story, peppered with small character moments, revolving around the character of Thanos.Thanos is the biggest threat the Avengers have faced (other than Dormmamu who was going to wipe out the entire universe in Doctor Strange, I guess), and he's one of the better antagonists. I don't think he's miles better than Hela, Loki, or Vulture, but he's definitely in that league. He's a titan driven by an ideal, and he's pure psychopath. Some people put forward the idea that Thanos could use the power of the Infinity Stones to double the universe's resources, but that misses the point of the character. He's a Malthusian through and through. He sees intelligent life as a cancer, infecting the universe, and that's what must be wiped out. He's so psychotic that to even dream of reasoning with him is asinine. He's committed, and he demonstrate that commitment to his vision by sacrificing his beloved adopted daughter to gain one of the stones (the Soul Stone).Meanwhile, our heroes take on several different related goals. There's the attempt to remove and destroy the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead. There's Thor trying to replace Mjolnir. There's Iron Man leading Dr. Strange and Spider-Man (joined by most of the Guardians of the Galaxy) to fight Thanos before he gains full strength on the titan's destroyed home planet. The story is structured around these different tasks, each told with the Marvel brand of quippy humor, seasoned with just enough emotion borrowed from the franchise's history, and built to all crescendo at the same time.That crescendo, which really takes up the last hour or so of the film, is something to admire. There are so many pieces moving and so many parts flying in so many different locations that the fact that it's easy to understand who is involved in what and why on a consistent basis is kind of remarkable. The Russo Brothers have evolved a lot in terms of action cinematography since The Winter Soldier. They still have a preference for shallow depth of field, handheld camera, and close up photography, but they edit it a bit less frantically and pull back more than enough to firmly establish geography.One thing they haven't really grown on, though, is visuals in general. It's an interesting contrast to watch so many of these movies in a row. Just a few movies back was Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2. In it, everything with brightly colored with array of beautiful things. When Thor shows up in the Guardian's ship, the same location that was so easily bathed in color in the previous movie has been dialed back to almost complete darkness. The movie as a whole isn't dark (the fight in Wakanda is very brightly lit), but it's fascinating to see some of the same locations and costumes that had been so colorful drained of it all in this. I think it's an incorrect visual choice for the franchise, especially as it embraces its cosmic side. It needs to be crazier visually instead of dark and 'grounded'.Still, I find Thanos a good villain, the ride overall fun and engaging, and just wish that it didn't rely so much on the previous movies and looked brighter and more colorful. For a movie that I could not see as being anything other than an expensive mess, that's quite an accomplishment.",7,0,1,26 November 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Sumptuous aesthetics and an involving story
","I decided to rewatch this because I watched Patrick H. Willems' video about the film and why it's great. I also remembered Ang Lee's introduction to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring on the Criterion Collection's release where he talked about the movie's great influence on him. As I watched the film again, I had things both said and some of my own Bergman thoughts floating around in my head. Willems talked about how Ang Lee characters are usually repressed and refuse to say what they mean (it was clear the second he said it), and Lee talked about how much of an influence Bergman was on his work. I was particularly thinking of my own observation that Bergman's characters often lie to each other and to themselves, and it fit rather well. The characters in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are often masking what they want from themselves and from the world around them.Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are long time associates who both obviously love each other romantically, however they are separated by a societal convention that says that they cannot be together because Lien was engaged to Bai's brother who died decades before. Jen Yu is the daughter of a regional governor and betrothed to some bureaucrat, but she harbors memories of her weeks in the wilderness with an outlaw, Dark Cloud, and has kept secret her martial arts training with Jade Fox, a murderer hiding in Governor Yu's household as Jen's governess. Jen has another level to her deceptions in that her training with Jade Fox is based on a martial arts manual she stole from Li Mu Bai's order but couldn't read herself, which Jen did, only providing a cursory education to her own master.The element that ties all of these characters together is the Green Destiny, a magical sword that Li Mu Bai gives to Lien, assuring himself that he's leaving the life of a fighter behind after meditation took him to a place his master had not prepared him for. Jen, having grown up on stories of the fighters, in particular and specifically around both Bai and Lien themselves, is enamored with the sword and decided to simply steal it. That event ignites the adventure that follows.Now, to talk about the action. I adore the action in this film, and it's for several reasons. The first is how Lee films it. The action is largely filmed from afar, in wide shots, with more than enough room to see the performers going through the complex moves. Those shots are intercut with inserts of some closer action, but the action overall is driven by those long shots that allow the action to play out in clear terms for the audience, never trying to paper over poor performances with quick cuts. The other major reason is the use of wires. Now, I don't love wirework whenever it comes along, but I love it here. That has a lot to do with the overall tone of the film.Wirework in action implies something otherworldly. That can be explained through stuff like magic, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes it in a more interesting direction. There's an ethereal feeling to the whole affair that lends itself to the wirework in the action sequences. It's not like the movie ends up feeling like something else entirely when it switches from people talking to people swinging swords at each other. The talk around repressed emotions makes characters seem like they're never quite connected to the real world around them. They are inherently otherworldly in that way, so the flying fits how they interact with each other. These are people who are more concerned with larger ideals like the fathomless fear of reaching a place in meditation they hadn't expected, duty over passion, and questions of freedom against obligation.However, that's not to say that there are no baser concerns, they're just hidden below the surface. Bai wants to kill Jade Fox because she stole the martial arts manual but also for revenge. Lien and Bai keep coming together out of duty and because they love each other.Aside from the action, the movie is a sumptuous treat. From Bai and Jen standing on the top of bamboo trees to the simple, economical, and classic way scenes of people talking to each other to the beautiful colors of every scene, the movie is simply a joy to look at.Exciting, beautiful, touching, and intelligent, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great film told with tenderness and verve all at once.",10,0,0,21 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A marvelous collection of all of Tarantino's storytelling strengths
","With my movie watching habits, I'm more than used to long scenes that don't push the plot forward instead focusing on a character, and Tarantino's new film is full of them. There's one in particular that comes roughly halfway through the film as Leonardo Dicaprio's Rick Dalton has come out of his trailer on the western television show he's guest starring on. He sits down to a young actress reading a biography of Walt Disney. Dalton pulls out a pulp western novel and explains the plot to the girl. It's about an old cowboy, probably past his prime, who's having trouble in his day to day. The story obviously hits Dalton hard and he ends up in tears with the girl consoling him.This scene takes its time, and it's actually a fantastic moment in a couple of ways. First of all, there's the obvious subtext that Dalton nearly directly addresses about how the novel mirrors his own life and feelings of his own future. The other subtext is about the choice in reading material. The girl is reading something high and lofty, a biography of a famous (great?) man. The book is large, bound beautifully, and pristine. Dalton's book is small with red edges to the paper indicating its cheapness, and is about a nobody. This is Tarantino saying why he love the pulpy stuff he loves. It's all about the little man and their problems, not the lofty ideals of giants.The sophistication of the storytelling goes well beyond the structure of individual scenes, though. There's something really fascinating going on in what is essentially a triple narrative. First is Dalton, acting and trying to get his former success back one guest spot at a time. The second centers on Cliff Booth, Dalton's stunt man/gopher, as he takes a day off and gets dangerously close to the Manson gang. The third is about Sharon Tate as she touches on her incipient level of fame. All together, the movie really is a fairy tale of making it in Hollywood, and all three storylines feed it.The two storylines between Dalton and Booth are the meat of the film, taking up the most screen time. Dalton is off playing the heavy on television, but Booth is out acting as the heavy in a real life encounter with a murderous gang. Dalton is happily ensconced in his world of fantasy while his stunt man takes the car out to the Stahl Ranch and actually punches a Manson boy in the face while staring down the rest of the gang.It's a new movie, so I'm going to warn for spoilers now. Again, you're adults, no bolding.As the movie comes to an end and Dalton and Booth return from a six month sojourn in Italy making cheap Italian knockoffs of successful films (with Dalton's new Italian wife in tow), the Manson clan ends up at the Dalton house instead of the Tate house. Dalton is hiding out in his pool and the wife is asleep with jet lag. Booth is preparing his dog's meal of canned food when the three burst in. It's not the movie star who ends up fighting them off, it's his stunt double. Booth is the one who beats two of them to death and the third within an inch of her life after they start to make trouble. Dalton does get involved at the very end, but after Booth had done all the work. In addition, Dalton gets to contribute in the most showy, movie-star way possible, with a flamethrower. The stunt double does all the work, and the movie star gets the highlight and the credit.The third storyline plays through all of this as Sharon Tate goes to the movies to watch herself, she goes to the Playboy Mansion for a party, and generally seems superfluous, except she's vital. When the Manson clan decides to go after Dalton instead of her, she's obviously left alive and ends up inviting Dalton (but not Booth) up to join her little party already in progress.And here is where the fairy tale aspect really comes in. There's the obvious element of Sharon Tate surviving the night, but the underside of that is the implication that Dalton is going to now make it in Hollywood. He's gone to the right party for the first time in years. It didn't matter if he had a great guest spot on the western television show. No one outside of the set that day was ever going to notice him enough to give him the break he needed. It was by meeting Tate that he's going to become a movie actor again. It's an acknowledgment of how Hollywood actually works (contacts over talent) and a very nice way to wrap up Dalton's fairy tale story after he had vanquished the evil force (with some help, of course).The movie overall is very entertaining, looks as good as anything Tarantino has ever put out, and is filled with great writing and wonderful performances.",10,11,14,25 November 2019
Django Unchained," Such strong work
","Here's the more focused and emotionally satisfying take on revenge. Where Inglourious Basterds ultimately falters in its final moments, Django Unchained thrives. The former sees a certain disconnect between its disparate acts of vengeance while the latter integrates them really well.A group of slaves is being transported through the wilderness of the American South a few years before the outbreak of the American Civil War. A German dentist intercepts them and desires to purchase one of them from the traders transporting them. This is Dr. King Shultz, played spiritedly by Christoph Waltz, and he uses five words when one will do, but always at the service of making himself clearly understood. He rubs the traders the wrong way and gunplay gets involved. Shultz kills all but one, pays for the slave he wants, the eponymous Django, and leaves the rest of the slaves alone with the one trader who has become pinned under his horse.So begins the roaring rampage of revenge that is Django Unchained. Dr. Shultz is a bounty hunter and he's out to find the Brittle Brothers, former foremen on the plantation that Django had previously been held at. The mechanics of bounty hunting, the danger of it and the background of Django's separation from his wife are all played out in an extended sequence in a small Western town. Dr. Shultz kills the sheriff calmly and, just as calmly, demands to see the local marshal. Shultz then precisely explains that the sheriff was actually a known outlaw with a bounty of several hundred dollars on his head and that the marshal owes Shultz money for killing him. That's the movie's comedic streak in a nutshell. It's very dark and, if you're into that sort of thing, very funny.After the pair take care of the Brittle Brothers, the real plot of the film takes hold. Shultz is going to help Django get his wife back from her new plantation, a place called Candieland in Mississippi owned by the wealthy and cruel Calvin Candie. There's a small detail about Candie that I love. As Shultz walks into the Mandingo Club where Candie is watching a fight, Candie's lawyer explains that his client loves all things French. Shultz immediately breaks into French as a way to help ingratiate himself to his host, but the lawyer quickly puts a stop to it. No, he explains, Monsieur Candie doesn't actually speak French, and to do so in front of him would embarrass him.Django and Shultz are playing parts in trying to ingratiate themselves to Candie. Shultz is a wealthy man of leisure who is looking for something to add interest into his boring life while Django plays a Mandingo expert who's there to help guide Shultz's decisions. They want to entice Monsieur Candie into bringing them to Candieland where the German speaking Broomhilda, Django's wife, is being kept. They'll dangle the prospect of a large purchase of a Mandingo fighter in front of Candie, accidentally meet Broomhilda, fall in for her charms as a German speaking slave, and purchase her as a side element to the main deal for the fighter, which will never actually come to pass.The play their parts well, and the most interesting part is Django's ability to watch slaves beating each other to death with their bare hands so calmly. It's not that he's a nihilist or unmoved by the plights of these men, it's that he understands his role and his goal. If he wants Broomhilda, he's going to have to tolerate this and even approach the topic with some enthusiasm. His cruelty towards these slaves is what will help sell the ruse and get him his wife back.Calvin Candie is a great villain, but Stephen, the house slave played by Samuel L. Jackson, is even more insidious. He's so invested in the maintenance of his master's status quo that he's willing to be just as cruel to Broomhilda as Candie is. It's Stephen who pieces together the small inconsistencies in the story the new pair are telling to determine that they are never going to buy the Mandingo fighter and their only objective is the female slave. It doesn't matter to him if Broomhilda is going to find freedom or not. His master will be at the business end of a raw deal, and he wants nothing to do with that.He tells Candie, of course, and Candie allows for Broomhilda's purchase, but at the price promised for the Mandingo fighter. He won't let his victory stay though, and he proceeds to further humiliate and insult Shultz. Once Shultz has enough, he blows Candie away, dying quickly as a result himself.The stage gets set for Django's ultimate rescue of Broomhilda and his bloody revenge. And here's where Django succeeds. We've invested in Django's journey, his rescue. The final bloody rampage isn't just historical revisionism, it's the culmination of Django's labors. He's earned the narrative right to kill everyone on that plantation who's standing between him and Broomhilda. It makes the ending far more satisfying than Tarantino's previous effort.Again and again, Tarantino's movies look great, and Django is no different. Colors are lush. The sets are wonderfully realized. Acting is universally good, especially Jaime Foxx as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. It is one of Tarantino's most fully realized and satisfying films.",10,1,4,25 November 2019
Aladdin," Extra stuff bogs down a decent adaptation
","Do we need this movie? Well, we don't need any movies, so the answer is no. However, the movie being what it is, it's far from the worst time at the cinema.So, you know the early 90s animated movie, so you know the story of the live-action remake. Most of the film is beat for beat the same story. There are some small changes (one of which I quite liked, but the rest felt either extraneous or simply unimportant), but yeah, it's exactly the same.The movie's opening is surprisingly quick and a bit out of order, though. It zooms through the animated movie's first 20 minutes in about 10, leaving out a proper introduction for Jasmine and throwing her right into her moment disguised as a peasant in the market. We know who she is because we've seen the previous version, but the movie acts like we shouldn't know its Jasmine. It's an odd situation to the point where she calls herself Dahlia, the princess's handmaiden, one wonders if that's just for Aladdin or for the audience as well.Then we get to what is probably the best part of the whole remake affair, Jafar. His introduction and first few motions are far superior here than then were in the original. In the original, Jafar was bad man who did some unexplained magic with a large diamond to find the diamond in the rough. In the remake, he is throwing peasant after peasant into the Cave of Wonders before he watches Aladdin make fools of the palace guards in order to reach Jasmine. He decides, actively, that Aladdin must be the diamond in the rough. His guards end up capturing the street rat, and instead of tricking him as an old man, he reveals himself fully, takes Aladdin to the Cave under guard, and actually makes a small connection. Jafar started from nothing, much as Aladdin is then. Jafar can rise up, and so can Aladdin. Pretty much everything after that is the same with Jafar, but that introduction and how Jafar gets things moving is the one actual improvement.Will Smith is good as the genie, but he can't escape the shadow of Robin Williams, which is unfair. Smith is in a different movie, and we should judge him based purely on that context. In that context, he's pretty good. It's whenever they mimic Williams too closely (like the 3 rules of wishing scene) that it ends up feeling false. Smith doesn't have the same personality to make a series of off the cuff impressions, and whenever it does happen, it feels wrong.The music is largely the same (surprise!). A few lyric changes here and there to make lyrics from a kid's more more...er...kid friendly. The 'Friend Like Me' number is a strong combination of visual effects and (probably CGI enhanced) dancing set to a tune everyone already knows they love. The 'Prince Ali' song as Aladdin comes into Agrabah feels smaller and more confined than the animated version, but it's still colorful and energetic. Jasmine has a new number which feels out of step both stylistically and narratively (the movie stops dead so she can sing it). The actress sings it with passion, but the song 'Speechless' ends up feeling a bit pointless and out of place.Overall, on its own, the movie is okay. It's not quite good because of its opening, which is confusing and rushed, and the fact that it embraces complexity where it's not necessary (there's a lot of talk about invading a neighboring country that is oddly extraneous). I was actually along with it for a while, but the movie kind of got bogged down in its final act that ended up dragging the rest of the movie down with it.",6,1,1,22 November 2019
Schindler's List," A film of contrasts that hits the gut
","This movie is built on contrasts, and it includes one of the most devastating single cuts in movies. It's a dual narrative that almost feels separated for a while before the two become completely intertwined in the final hour. It's impeccably made, acted, scored, and assembled. It is one of, if not the, greatest single film by Steven Spielberg, and it's the best example of an 'important' film.The first sustained sequence to the film is our introduction to the main character of Oskar Schindler. It's largely wordless, showing him putting on his finest clothes, pocketing a large stack of cash, and zeroing in on some Nazi officials in a Polish nightclub. He means them no harm, he only wants to schmooze with them and gain the contact necessary to get a manufacturing contract with the Nazi military early in the Second World War. It's an intoxicating scene as Schindler works his magic, going from an empty table to hosting a dozen officers and their dates, all to get in with the high ranking officer who reserved the best table in the place.And then there's a hard cut to Nazis marching through Krakow.The music is gone, the levity is gone. We went from being seduced by the fun of hanging with Nazi officers to the cold hard reality of a Nazi occupation in a major Jewish population with one edit. It's hard, and it's very effective.That contrast is at the heart of everything in the film, including Schindler's character. Visually, we see things like Schindler in his office above the factory floor while the slave laborers remain separated from him below in much the same way that Goeth sits on the porch of his house above the labor camp. Schindler wants to use slave labors to make a fortune, which he does. Schindler and Goeth contrast really well as well. They both sit in positions of power, Schindler in the private sector and Goeth military, but they end up going in different directions. Schindler watches the liquidation of Krakow, focusing on that famous little girl in her red coat, and something clicks within him. He's never seen the Jewish people as anything more than tools for his own personal wealth, but there's something about that innocent little girl, weaving her way through the mass murder going on around her, that makes him reconsider his assumptions. Goeth, on the other hand, is a monster through and through (apparently toned a good bit down from reality), and, once he's given the opportunity to exercise what Schindler calls 'real power' (letting the guilty man go free), Goeth realizes it's simply not who he is and he snipes the boy who couldn't get the stain out of his bathtub.Through the events of the film is the quiet figure of Itzhak Stern. When Spielberg and Ben Kingsley were discussing the character, they both boiled the man down to a single word. Spielberg chose 'conscience' and Kingsley chose 'witness'. Both words perfectly capture, especially together, who Stern is in this story. He's largely our eyes into the world, playing a placid man in the face of constant threat, who does what he can to help his employer. On the other hand, he provides little nudges to Schindler to move him in the right direction, like getting Schindler to meet the one handed worker who credited him with saving his life. He's the one Schindler ends up confiding in and plotting with to create the list of 1100 Jews to save from the Nazi ovens.The parallel story is the story of the Holocaust as a whole. We watch the story unfold from persecution on the streets of Krakow to the ghetto to the labor camp and finally to the death camp. There are criticisms of the film that it doesn't go far enough on this end. I think, regarding the actual story at play, the creation of the list by Oskar Schindler, it doesn't necessarily fit, though I get the idea. We see the crackdown, liquidation, and oppression of the Jews in exact detail throughout the movie, but once we get to Auschwitz, the movie turns away. We don't see the piles of bodies or them being cooked in the ovens, though we do see the smokestacks belching out the ashes from it. It feels like the movie could have taken another step to really embrace the truth of the horror, but Spielberg was unwilling. I don't know...I think we might have seen enough and just the implication of the final solution was enough.It's a harrowing look that, perhaps, flinches in the final moments, but the central story of Schindler's exposure and reaction to the horrors of the Holocaust are magnificently capture and presented. Liam Neeson is great as Schindler. Kingsley is quiet and great as Stern. Ralph Fiennes is pure evil as the (toned-down) Goeth. John Williams' music is somber, touching, and distinctly Jewish by design, fitting the film perfectly. Spielberg made it because he felt like a Holocaust movie needed to be made, and he used every bit of his talent to pull it off. This is a great, great film.",10,1,2,13 January 2020
The Lion King," A bad adaptation of an overrated original
","I've never quite understood the appeal of Disney's mid-90s animated movie The Lion King. But, here comes Disney again with its latest money-making scheme to feast on nostalgia, their 'live action' remake.So, when we ended up going to the theater, I took this as an opportunity to re-evaluate the film that everyone else around me loves but I always find myself standing just off from.In a nutshell, The Lion King is the story of an entitled brat who nearly gets himself and his best friend killed, succeeds in getting his father killed, runs away for a few years where he loafs with some buds, suddenly decides to come back and murder his uncle because he wants his uncle's stuff.I hate Simba. It's not just that he's an entitled and lazy brat for the first three-quarters of the film, it's that he's a terribly written character without an arc in a movie where he's supposed to have an arc. He's the same from the beginning to the three-quarters mark where he suddenly becomes hero just because he decides to be. There's supposed to be parallels to Hamlet, but Hamlet actually worked his way up to killing Claudius over the course of the entire play while Simba decides with about fifteen minutes of the movie left that Scar needs to go.On top of Simba's lack of growth and arc is the movie's cheapness. I don't mean in terms of production (this new 'live action' one looks very expensive from beginning to end), but in terms of storytelling techniques to get the audience cheering for one side over the other. The Pride Lands, the lion kingdom, is a veritable paradise where, it seems, that no animal ever eats another. There's talk of it, but, oddly enough, in a movie about lions we never seen lions feed on anything save bugs when Simba is with his bros (Timon and Pumpa). Then, when Scar takes over, the place becomes a post-apocalyptic vision because the hyenas ate...all of the herbivores? Then, when Simba throws Scar into the fire, the Pride Lands become verdant and beautiful again (and all of the animals that Scar's army supposed ate all just came back again). It's cheap and designed to get the audience to hate Scar just that extra bit.The irony is that Scar, out of all of the characters, is the best. I wouldn't go so far as to call him well-written, but he's the best of a bad bunch. Scar has more to do with Richard III than Claudius, and the writers did what they could to imbue him with the same sneaky, scheming qualities. In the first act, as Scar works to get his brother, Mufasa, murdered, he's actually kind of fun. He's a pretty good bad guy.Now, you may notice that everything up to this point could be said about the animated version. That's because the two movies are virtually identical in terms of story. There are some small changes here and there (Scar has an extra line of dialogue early that makes him slightly more ideological, Timon and Pumpa are much more meta than before), but they're small changes. The biggest change is, of course, the use of realistic lions, and it does a disservice to the story. Simba's expressive eyes are gone. Instead of looking like he's crying, he looks like a cat. It deadens the limited emotional impact. I do wonder if Jon Favreau, the director, got to a certain point in production and realized that the lack of emoting was a problem. It obviously didn't matter because the movie has made, and will continue to make, oodles of money for the Mouse House.So, yeah, it's the same movie, but worse. Even the voice actors are, across the board, worse, even James Earl Jones who reprises his role of Mufasa. None of the new voices do as good a job this time as last time.But hey, Can You Feel the Love Tonight sure sounds good, doesn't it?",4,1,2,25 November 2019
Stardust," An energetic fantasy adventure
","There's something to be said for a movie that can keep up a sense of energy from beginning to end. Stardust keeps a light and playful tone and propels itself along with a special brand of ridiculous fantasy.It's the story of love, like many adventure tales. It shows our hero, Tristan Thorne, crossing large distances to collect a fallen star for the woman he loves (but who seems to view him with nothing but mild amusement). The star is a woman, since the wall that separates the small town of Wall with where the star fell is actually the border between realms, one real and the other fantasy. What ends up happening is a chase between three different people, all of whom want the star for their own purposes.First, there is Tristan, who wishes to prove his love to his beloved. Second there is the witch who wishes to cut out the star's heart, eat it, and extend her life by another few hundred years. Lastly, there are the final sons of the king of the realm (Stormhold) who are all trying to off each other in the process of succession that holds in the country. It is Septimus, the last of the princes, who wants the star's heart for similar purposes as the witch.Tristan and the star (Yvaine) have a very typical meet-cute falling in love, but the story is told charmingly with winning actors. The central story is also surrounded by wonderful details like Captain Shakespeare, the captain of a flying vessel that captures lighting to sell, and the ghosts of the fallen sons of the king, who are doomed to watch the progress of succession until it resolves, offering a macabre chorus to the scene.Through it all, there's great set design, a wonderful score, and everyone gives performances that fit very well with the overall tone and feel of the film. And, oh, again that tone. It's not merely light and airy. It does move to more dangerous territories at times when the action needs it (the showdown at the inn the witch conjured between her, Tristan, the star, and Primus is a stand out).It's not great cinema (it's perhaps a bit too effortless with the world-building to hold together as well as it should, and the resolution of everything at the end is rather pat), but it's still a great time at the movies.",8,1,1,21 November 2019
Amadeus," A Fantastic Entertainment
","Re-Introductions and IntroductionsWhen I first discovered Amadeus, I loved it, and I showed it to my father. We watched it together (one very nice thing about him was that he's willing to watch almost whatever I try to put in front of him), and his reaction was much more tempered than mine. He said, 'You'll like it less as you get older.' Not that he didn't like the film, but he just didn't love it like I did.
I didn't watch this movie for at least seven years until this week when I finally revisited it. I was a bit terrified. Was my dad right? Would I finally rewatch the film and decide that it's simply not as good as my younger self had determined?Thankfully, I loved the film as much as before, and that started with one particular moment about ten minutes into the film. Salieri, having attempted suicide, is sitting alone in a cell in a sanitarium playing some small tunes on a harpsicord. A priest comes to hear his confession. Salieri wants nothing to do with the priest until the priest insists that all men are equal in God's eyes. That attracts Salieri's attention.He starts by trying to draw the priest into his story by playing some of Salieri's old tunes, music that the priest should be familiar with because he studied music in Vienna in his youth. The first tune passes over the priest's head, much to Salieri's distaste.It's a simple cut to a tracking shot, and it completely pulls me into the film.
Salieri plays the first few bars of the music. He takes his fingers off the keys to revel in the sound in his head. We, of course, hear it, but the priest does not. The cut takes us to a live performance of the music sung by a woman, gaudily dressed, on stage. The camera pulls back to reveal a man conducting an orchestra. As this man turns, the camera changes focus from the woman to him, revealing Salieri, decades younger, and at the height of his influence and power.It's such a simple cut and dolly, and it sells two things. The first is the basic structure of the movie. We're going to see what he's talking about. The other is character based. His telling of his story really starts with Salieri at the height of his influence and popularity. He's adored by music lovers, and he's firm in his commitment to his art. That simple cut and dolly puts such a smile on my face every time.MozartAntonio Salieri is the protagonist of the film, and Mozart is the antagonist. Not to say good guy and bad guy, but Salieri is obviously the one driving the plot in the film. He hinders and helps Mozart, driving him from success to failure.Mozart, though, is a delight and played by Tom Hulce (who lost the Best Actor Oscar to F. Murray Abraham for his performance as Salieri). He's an effortless genius who's been spoiled to the point that he can usually get away with any manner of vulgarity. This is evident when he first approaches the Emperor Joseph II and admits that his idea for an opera (in German!) he will set in a harem. The courtiers around the emperor gasp at the mere thought, but the emperor hides a small smile. He's obviously entertained by Mozart's brashness, eventually giving in to every wish Mozart has in terms of his art.The scene that that plays out in is where Salieri begins to truly hate Mozart. Not only is Mozart vulgar, as opposed to Salieri's own reserved modesty (which he offers up to God, along with his chastity, in order to praise Him through music), but Mozart is also effortlessly gifted.The second scene that I want to highlight is this. Salieri worked hard on that little march of his. He played with the fortepiano for every note, trying to craft something as an appropriate welcome to the wunderkind. Then, presented with the music sheet, Mozart waves it off. He's already memorized it after one hearing. Not only does he then prove that he can recreate Salieri's simple tune perfectly, but he, on the fly, improves it tremendously (eventually turning it into something that actually comes from The Marriage of Figaro). Salieri had worked diligently and reverentially to produce the piece that this creature (as Salieri calls Mozart) instantly turns into something so much better.Salieri's dismissive attitude towards the priest's contention that all men are equal in God's eyes comes into full view in an instant. Salieri isn't equal to Mozart. God obviously prefers Mozart considering the difference in talent and perceived holiness between the two men.CompositionThe last scene I want to highlight is the writing of the requiem mass as Salieri assists Mozart after the production of The Magic Flute (quick aside, Ingmar Bergman made an absolutely marvelous production of The Magic Flute, and you should find a copy at your local library).Salieri, a lover of music who understands the stark contrast between his ability and Mozart's, wants Mozart to write his own Requiem mass and then to take credit for it. Left alone with him, Mozart's wife having left Vienna in disgust at Mozart's inability to focus on making money in favor of potentially empty promises, Salieri dictates Mozart's work. Together, they compose a few bars of music for every instrument in the piece. They build it layer by layer. Voices, horns of different types, strings. It all comes together, sometimes just sounding like noise, but once it all comes together the audience can hear the confluence of the different pieces to create the harmonious music in its entirety.The fact that Salieri is behind and can't understand until it's spelled out for him is marvelous. He knows enough to aid Mozart, but he's obviously completely out of his depth. Mozart seems to speak in a different language the deeper into the composition they get. Let's take a look!The Movie EntireThe movie itself is obviously much more than the three scenes I've highlighted, and what really carries it is Salieri himself. He's such a wonderfully complex character who balances his hatred of Mozart the person with his love of Mozart the artist.He often lies to Mozart. He lies about trying to help Mozart at court, only to be thwarted by circumstance. He lies about how he'll try to help him with an appointment. But he can never lie about how he feels regarding Mozart's music. Whenever Mozart asks Salieri what he thought of Mozart's newest work, all pretense falls from Salieri and he tells the honest truth, that it was magnificent.In addition to Salieri, Constanze, Mozart's wife, looks like someone who would be completely out of her depth in regards to anything serious, but the fact that she's the one who sees things clearly offers Mozart a firm base from which to operate. When she leaves, Mozart loses all of the support she offered and falls into the hands of Schikaneder and Salieri.The court is a joyful little comic delight. Most of them are as opposed to Mozart as Salieri. They use every ounce of their power to keep Mozart in check, but the Emperor Joseph will walk in and completely overturn anything with the smallest of suggestions ('Let me hear the scene with the music.') that put Mozart back on top.The movie really is not what one would expect from a three hour film about a classical composer (side note: The Director's Cut really is a Director's Cut and probably is the superior version of the film). It's light and joyful where it needs to be. It's got surprising contemporary touches like Mozart's pink wig which evokes mid-80s punk rock. The movie really does fly by, never feeling like three hours, and is one of the most fun times I ever have had at the movies, so to speak.A Small Note on Historical (In)AccuracyI don't insist much on historical accuracy from films. I don't expect history lessons from movies, but I do expect to be entertained.
Amadeus is bad history. Mozart had six kids, not one. Salieri didn't help Mozart write the Requiem. Salieri wasn't a celibate. There's so much in this film that's not historically accurate.And yet, the movie is filtered through Salieri the character. It's a telling of the events through an unreliable narrator. It really gives the film credence to be as historically inaccurate as it wants to be. And, probably because of its complete disregard for actual history, the movie is a fantastic entertainment and explores what it means to be an artist.",10,0,0,21 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Some of the best of Star Wars...and spinklings of some of the worst
","This is a direct rebuke to the rank nostalgia of The Force Awakens. There's even a moment when R2-D2 shows Luke the original Leia message, and Luke calls it a cheap trick. This is a movie about learning from the past and using it to help forge the future. The three main characters all explore this question in really interesting ways. And then there are the two worst characters in Star Wars and a side adventure that ultimately doesn't matter that much. The parts that work do so at such a marvelous level while the stuff that doesn't falls flat so fully that it's an interesting contrast.With the red herring mystery box game of The Force Awakens out of the way, we know that Rey is our central character and not Finn, and she's a far more interesting one this time out. Instead of just being able to do everything she comes across, she's wracked by self-doubt concerning her place in the larger world that she suddenly finds herself in, especially when considering her newfound powers.The Last Jedi, though, thrusts two other characters much more to the fore than just Rey. There's Kylo Ren, the antagonist from the previous film, and the mythical Luke Skywalker. Rey is torn between the two, and they're both consumed with how to deal with failures in their own pasts.Kylo Ren was defeated by a girl with no training in the Force or a lightsaber at the end of the last movie, and his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, berates him for that failure. In response, Ren destroys the helmet he crafted meant to evoke Dark Vader. He's rejected all of the past in that moment and dedicated to wiping out the past completely, to replace it with his own vision of the future.Luke is consumed by his failure to revive the Jedi, manifested so fully by his chief student and nephew, Ben Solo, turning to the Dark Side and destroying the entire new Jedi Temple. He also studied the fall of the Old Republic and discovered that the reason Darth Sidious rose to power and created the Empire was because of the failing of the Jedi. He sees little good coming from them as their history is rife with failures so monumental as to throw the entire galaxy into generations of darkness and tyranny. He wants to burn the past just as Kylo Ren does.That's the starting point of the three main characters, and they move on from there. Rey, caught between two people who want to burn the past to the ground for different reasons, knows that there's something behind her that will help inform her journey. Luke's brand of defeatist burning of the past without any sense of a future ends up not appealing to Rey and drives her away from him. Kylo Ren, on the other hand, seems to want to build something else in its place. Rey doesn't know what that is, but she does see that sort of pro-active movement towards something and is drawn to it.However, Kylo Ren's insistence on burning the past doesn't mean that things will change. In fact, he seems determined to not only burn the past but refuse to learn from it. His solution is to kill Snoke and become the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, essentially just repeating the past without learning from it. Rey can't abide by either solution, and uses what she can gather to try and build a new future. Luke, in turn, gets influenced by Rey and reaches out from beyond his secluded island and takes steps to help forge a new path forward.The key scene of Luke's turn is when Force Ghost Yoda shows up and burns the old tree shrine that housed the ancient Jedi texts. There is an implication in the scene that the texts burned with the tree, but that's what Luke needed to hear. Rey had actually saved the texts (seen in a pair of shots and never directly addressed by any character), meaning that the artifice of the past has been destroyed, but the actual content, the lessons, has been preserved in Rey. Luke has the past within him to draw from and make his next decision, the decision to rejoin the fight, and rejoin he does.The final confrontation between Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker is a confrontation between two ideologies. The two characters started in similar places, but they learned different things across the film. Kylo learned that he could exert control over the First Order by burning the past, but Luke learned that he had to embrace the lessons of the past in order to forge a better future. Luke does that by confronting Kylo and giving the future time to escape.I adore, not just love, adore this bulk of the film. It's fiercely intelligent and penetrative of the meaning of Star Wars. It's compellingly packaged in characters and drama. It's really well acted. It's some of my favorite Star Wars ever.The problem is that there's another side to the film, and that's what to do with Finn and Poe. There are some similarities in thematic content, especially towards the end, about learning from mistakes and the past, but the thematic connection is thin and actually ends up pursuing another theme entirely. Since this theme doesn't connect to the main theme very well and the literal action of the subplot ends up making little difference to anything, I can't help but be disappointed.With the First Order in a steady chase against the remnants of the Resistance, waiting for the Resistance to run out of fuel in 18 hours (a concept I love, by the way), Finn and Poe need to find a way to help the Resistance escape. The obstacle they have is that Leia gets sent into a coma and replaced by Vice Admiral Holdo, one of the worst characters ever written in Star Wars. She's arrogant and demanding of respect she doesn't earn. She develops a plan for escape and apparently tells the entire ship but refuses to allow Poe to find out. Because Poe doesn't know the plan because Holdo refuses to share it with him (despite the massive effort ship wide it takes to actually implement it), Poe thinks that nothing's happening and tries to find another solution.He sends Finn and Rose (a character who starts out pretty good and then ends up as the other worst character in Star Wars) to find a codebreaker so they can sneak onto the lead pursuing Star Destroyer, kill the tracking on the Resistance ships, and escape through hyperspace. This is a long adventure that ends up not mattering because they never accomplish their goal and the Resistance fleet continues on as though there had never been the attempt. You could quite literally hard cut Finn and Rose out of the film for about an hour and just have them suddenly appear in the background of a shot at the base at the end of the film and feel like you haven't missed anything. It's not that nothing happens, quite a bit happens, but it all feels out of place. There's something satisfying about seeing Finn rise up (both literally and figuratively) over a prominent figure from his own past (Captain Phasma) and beat her across the face with a weapon, for instance. There are touches of the central theme, but most of this adventure ends up being about releasing slaves and the meaning of the symbol of the Resistance.There's so much of this subplot that feels so out of line with the central conflict between Rey, Kylo, and Luke that I have to come to the conclusion that they are the results of notes from Kathleen Kennedy. And then Rose claims her spot as second worst character ever in Star Wars by preventing Finn from sacrificing himself to save people and then giving a speech about how wars are won with love while a giant explosion happens in the background. In the middle of a high quality ending, that bit is embarrassing.On top of story and character, the movie is gorgeous. There's a painterly quality to the images that only occasionally popped up in previous films (like the Binary sunset in Star Wars), and it's from beginning to end. Subjects in frame and placed wonderfully to imply relationships. There's a fantastic use of color (especially the use of reds and whites at the climax of the film). The special effects are the best that money can buy, and they're textured and detailed in fantastic ways. Snoke's throne room, Luke's island, the salt planet and its red crystal underground, it's all just gorgeous to look at.The movie does have some flaws, but I think they're so heavily outweighed by some of the smartest thematic and character driven storytelling Star Wars has ever seen.",8,6,19,19 December 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Visually resplendent and fun
","The story is pretty typical MacGuffin type stuff. There's an orb that drives the plot. Everyone wants it for different reasons. It has power that comes into play late in the film. It's an Infinity Stone and part of the larger mythology. That's not the joy of the movie. It's on that clothesline of a plot that James Gunn hung an array of entertaining characters who make the journey interesting, and it's all told with such an enthusiastic style and painterly brush.Peter Quill is our main hero, and he's the first to get his hands on the MacGuffin, I mean orb. He makes an enemy of Ronan the Accuser in the process, as well as his former colleague/savior from cannibalism Yondu. He ends up on the planet Xandar where Gamora, the angry daughter of the big bad Thanos and soldier for Ronan is trying to betray them both by stealing the orb and getting it to the Collector. While trying to get the orb from Quill, Rocket the Raccoon and his tree guardian Groot try to kidnap Quill for a bounty and they all end up captured by the police, sent to space prison.Up to this point, the movie is light and amusing, but it's in the prison, where the four heroes meet Drax and have to work together to escape, that the movie begins to get really fun. The prison escape is witty, inventive, and delightful to simply watch (the movie really does look good from beginning to end). Peter's insistence on reclaiming his Walkman, his most emotional connection to Earth and his deceased mother, is handled with the right tone of enjoyable romp mixed with attachment.It's in the second act that the movie falters just slightly. They meet the Collector and get an exposition dump that's really just there to establish things for the MCU at large and not for the movie itself. In terms of the movie, the scene does bear some narrative importance (it's here that we see what's in the orb, an Infinity Stone, and what happens when it's misused), but the majority of the sequence is really dedicated to world building for stuff outside of it. Rocket also has an emotional beat that feels a bit off to me. It makes sense that he might lash out while drunk and explain a bit of backstory, but it feels like it comes out of nowhere since it immediately follows a nice little scene where Peter and Gamora get to know each other a bit better.From then on, though, the movie is sure footed and clearly successful. Ronan gets his hands on the Infinity Stone and proceeds with his stock bad guy plot #3 of trying to destroy a planet. Quill recruits the Ravagers under Yondu onto his side (with promises of riches) and they start a big, entertaining battle where the characters all get their moments to shine with banter and explosions. We get our big explosions and a final confrontation, and it's all done with such a strong narrative hand that we can easily forgive the ending's generic overall nature because the moments are so enjoyable.Ronan, though, is probably the least interesting antagonist in all of Marvel. He's as stock as stock can be, and I remember Malekith from Thor: The Dark World. There are moments where it feels like Ronan is supposed to be more than just yelling bad guy who yells, but they don't develop anything. All we get is yelling bad guy who yells. I also wish there was more thematic depth to the film. For instance, the moment in the final seconds of the final battle where Gamora reaches out to Peter and Peter sees his mother feels thin. It's just that Gamora uses the same words as his mother rather than anything else in the situation calling back to it.One final note. I love the design of the film from beginning to end. The spaceships look great and unique enough against the typical spaceships we've seen in cinema before. My favorite of them all are the Xandar Nova defense ships. It seems like an odd choice, but the color pallete is perfect, and I ended up seeing this for the first time around the time that the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune got released, and it was screamingly obvious to me that there were similar influences. I looked it up, and yeah, the guy who did most of the designs for the aborted Dune adaptation designed the ships in Guardians of the Galaxy.Aside from a couple of hiccups in the second act and a less than mediocre bad guy, this is such a wonderfully entertaining film.",8,0,1,25 November 2019
The Last Emperor," Beautiful and intelligently constructed
","I didn't intend to review this film when I threw it on. I bought it because it's great, and I just wanted to watch it again, but then I read Roger Ebert's review and I felt like he completely and totally misinterpreted the ending. And then I read the essay that came with the Criterion Blu-Ray by David Thompson that seemed completely scattershot and talked more about the rest of Bertolucci's career rather than The Last Emperor itself. So, I just felt like I needed to get my own thoughts down.Much of the conversation around this movie is about how China allowed Bertolucci to film in The Forbidden City. Ooo...aaaa...amazing. Okay, that's done.Snark aside, the movie is a visual delight, and it is in no small part because of the expansive location that is the Forbidden City that that works. This story needs to feel big because it is the story of two things that are the intimately related. The first is the eponymous last emperor Puyi, and the second is China itself. The connection makes sense without even considering the details of the story, but the way the story plays out (which I assume, like I assume with all historical movies, is roughly 90% ahistorical). Puyi's brief childhood reign as emperor leads to time as an accepted figurehead in China, a puppet for Japan, prisoner of the Communist Chinese government, and then a modest gardener. As he progresses through this story, the country around him changes along with him.One of the things that bugged me about Roger Ebert's review was that he described Puyi as passive. That's only partially true. He was never able to directly affect any major events, but he tried. He tried a lot. From his time as a boy where he climbed off of his throne to wander and founds only his supplicants to his affirmative effort to become Japan's puppet emperor of Manchukuo throughout the Second World War, Puyi was trying to assert his will upon his household and China overall. The problem was that every time he tried, he received pushback of a proportional nature. His effort to bicycle out of the Forbidden City after his abdication is met by a closed gate, but his effort to assert China's independence alongside Japan is met by hostility from Japan, effectively ending his faux-reign before he's captured by the Russians (and then handed off to the Chinese).Ebert asserted that the re-education Puyi receives is successful because he never really had an education in the world, and I think it's one of the most wrong-headed things he ever wrote. Puyi received an intimate education about the workings of the world from his secluded spot away from things. It was a hard education, but he did receive it. The re-education he is forced in prison doesn't actually work, but over that time Puyi learns his smallness in his own life. His reflection on his contributions to his life and the history of China are minimal at best, represented best by his inability to function without a servant for the first time in his life. It's not that he became a good communist, it's that he spent 10 years thinking about his life with little else to do. It's only when he takes up gardening that he finds something he can influence. It's small, but he can make the world better in a very small little way.Puyi's journey is compelling in his continual efforts to make changes in his life, but it's brought to life visually and there's much more to talk about than the Forbidden City when it comes to The Last Emperor's visuals. Vittorio Storaro, the film's cinematographer is one of the greatest of his craft, and he used color intelligently and explosively in this film. The vibrant colors of the imperial period end up mirroring the bright colors of the period in Puyi's life where he's out of prison in Communist China (1967), implying a connection between the two eras with Puyi's drab, colorless prison period in between. I think he's saying that little has actually changed in China. The children's marching and singing in praise of Mao in the streets evokes the singing death chant of the Empress Dowager at the beginning of the film. It's still a highly centralized society with deep inclinations towards pomp and circumstance.The movie is sumptuous visually, compellingly acted, intimately involved in the history of the country, grand in scale, and intimate in scope. It's a triumph of cinema and one of the best movies of the 80s.",10,0,0,31 March 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Ensemble pieces are hard.
","You have several main characters revolving around one goal, but all of these characters should be unique and driven by their own wants and needs, but all of those wants and needs need to be connected to the core of the story. When you take half a dozen heroes who are (largely) off on their own adventures most of the time, it can take some doing, and I don't think that doing was done quite well enough here.The Avengers have been wiping out Hydra one base at a time for some months and have come across the final large stronghold. They quip their way to victory, discovering Loki's spear from the first Avengers as well as two 'enhanced' individuals (one who's fast and the other that's weird). With the spear, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner begin to analyze it in order to figure out how to take advantage of it. What they end up doing is creating Ultron, an advanced AI that takes a cryptic mission from Tony ('peace in our time') and twists it in a very Asimov sort of way to mean all of human life must end because there will be no peace with people. He overcomes Tony's personal digital assistant (Jarvis), inhabits a robotic body and uploads himself to the Internet so he can escape into anything he wishes.There's a fight, Ultron escapes, he finds some vibranium (helpfully expanding the MCU slightly in the process with references to Wakanda), and escapes again, this time with the help of the two enhanced. He escapes to South Korea where he uses a scientist to create a 'real' body for him (how this is appreciably better than his upgraded body he gets later isn't really explained). Through another action sequence, the Avengers steal this body and then bring it to life so that it becomes Vision. Everything converges in the invented Central European country Sokovia (where the movie opened) where Ultron, who's been talking positively of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs throughout the movie, has creating a system that will life the capitol city up in the air before dropping it to the ground with enough force to cause a global extinction event, which the Avengers avert. Because of course.So, there's the plot. A lot is going on. I think the stuff around the creation of the body that becomes Vision is really just there so we can get Vision. As part of Ultron's plan, it feels extraneous at best. His end goal is human extinction. Having some sort of humanish metal body feels just extra. But around this large, somewhat unfocused, plot we have our heroes, and as I implied earlier, not a lot of them seem to be there for any other reason than they are Avengers.First, let's talk about what this movie is supposed to be about. The first Avengers was really an excuse to get superheroes together to fight a heavy. The underlying idea was about team building. It was facile, but it worked and every character was functioning towards that goal. In this, the goal seems to be centered around Tony Stark's desire to create a replacement for the Avengers in the form of a highly intelligent AI that will protect Earth from threats originating from off world. It's an extension of where Tony was left at the end of Iron Man 3. He wants Iron Man to be unnecessary. The creation he ends up with fights back (using 'I've got no strings' from Pinocchio quite effectively in a creepy sort of way), and Captain America's assertion that humans should always be part of the decision making process ends up correct. In terms of characters who seem involved in this thematic idea you have Tony, Bruce Banner, Captain America, and Hawkeye. The rest feel extra, taking the movie in different directions.Thor is the one who seems the most out of place. He's there for a literal reason (Loki's scepter is supposed to go back to Asgard with him), but outside of that he doesn't really contribute to any of the movie's core idea. In fact, he famously goes off in the middle of the movie to help inform the audience about Infinity Stones. They sacrificed cohesion of the film itself in order to help sell later installments of the franchise, and the movie suffers for it. Black Widow also feels like she's in another movie. The exploration of her past is interesting, but I don't see how it feeds into the ideas at the movie's core. What this does overall is create a disjointed experience that keeps the movie from coming together as a single work.There's quite a few individual pieces of the film that I like quite a bit. The action scenes are fun (though, we get another big CGI army). I really like Ultron himself. He's not just a quippy form of Loki. He's driven by an ideology and a set of beliefs all while talking in a way that betrays the malfunction at his core. The relationship that begins to blossom between Natasha and Bruce is both sweet and tied to some interesting unique parts of their characters (Natasha's insistence that she's a monster and her ability to draw Bruce out of the Hulk). And I really like the central idea and how that manifests in Ultron. I just wish the movie came together a bit better.",6,0,0,25 November 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's greatest film and one of the greatest ever
","This is a terrible way to start this retrospective, but this is the first movie on the list where I would consider replacing with another. My top ten list is political in nature in that it's designed to drive those who are exposed to it to places in film that I consider important. Stanley Kubrick is a giant in the world of cinema, but I have two movies that he made that I love equally, the other being Barry Lyndon. That being said, let's talk about the movie at hand.I've never read a review of this movie that said it was poorly made. I've read negative reviews, for sure, but no one ever says that it's poorly photographed, or that the effects look fake. It's remarkable to me how uniform the opinion of the technical merits of the film are across the decades.Stanley Kubrick was a photographer before he became a filmmaker. He learned how to frame a shot with a combination of simplicity and meaning that is often never replicated in most movies. I think that manifests in a common visual feel to his films where I get the sensation that he didn't like movement in the frame. Kubrick didn't film purely from a stationary tripod like Ozu, but movement was always combined with a certain stillness. Look at the introduction to life aboard the Odyssey.On first glance, there's a lot of motion there. The camera moves left to right and back again. Frank is running in a circle. It seems like there's just a lot of motion going on, except that Frank is never anywhere but at the center of the frame. Despite all of the movement present, the focus of the shot never changes its position within the frame.This stillness at the center of motion transfixes me. 2001 is a movie that if I catch a glimpse of on TV, I end up losing the next hour or two of my life to it, almost simply at the power of the visual images. I think that the ability to calmly focus on that which is most important in the shot is one reason that I find all of Kubrick's movies, but 2001 in particular, to be so absorbing to watch.Big IdeasAnother point that no one seems to argue about is that the movie is big in both visual scale and in terms of ideas. Disagreement arises about whether the movie does anything interesting with the ideas it brings up, but I haven't read anyone calling it small. And the ideas at its core are very big.I think one way to figure out how to watch this movie and try to dissect what is there is to refer to the foreword to a book on Kristof Kieslowski, the Polish filmmaker who made The Decalogue and The Three Colors Trilogy. Here's the quote:I am always reluctant to single out some particular feature of the work of a major filmmaker because it tends inevitably to simplify and reduce the work. But in this book of screenplays by Krzysztof Kieslowski and his co-author, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, it should not be out of place to observe that they have the very rare ability to dramatize their ideas rather than just talking about them. By making their points through the dramatic action of the story they gain the added power of allowing the audience to discover what's really going on rather than being told. They do this with such dazzling skill, you never see the ideas coming and don't realize until much later how profoundly they have reached your heart.Stanley KubrickTo Kubrick, his ideal was to dramatize ideas, not to talk about them. For that, I'm sure he'd prefer a conversation instead of a visual based medium. So, taking that point of view in mind, how should one approach 2001: A Space Odyssey specifically?The key, in my mind, is the opening sequence, The Dawn of Man. From a traditional point of view, this extended dialogue free sequence that involves no named characters who appear later in the film seems superfluous at best. However, I would disagree, I think it's central. Man at this stage is little more than the beasts that it shares the barren landscape with. Man and beasts are picking at the ground next to each other, neither has an advantage over the other. When man comes into conflict with other man, there's little more than impotent demonstrations of size. Then, the monolith arrives without explanation.After this exposure, man begins to understand the world around him as more than a source for food and water. Man picks up a bone, pushes it back and forth, noticing the effect that pushing one object against another can have for the first time. Man goes further until he's slamming the bone against other parts of the remnant skeleton and destruction occurs. It is this lesson that gives man the leg up over other men and, by extension, the rest of the animals (for the other man is still no more than an animal in comparison).
The monolith gave man insight, and when the monolith appears again tens of thousands of years later, man has progressed very far. No longer scavengers on the ground, we have mastered the Earth and reached the moon, where the second monolith is buried ('intentionally'). The next push by the monolith is more complex, sending man to Jupiter.Without the Dawn of Man sequence, the monolith seems more opaque to me. We, as the audience, are not supposed to fully understand what the monolith wants, but that opening provides greater dramatic context about that idea. The monolith is pushing human evolution. First it took us on the first step to conquering the Earth, what will the next monolith teach us?QuestionsHere's something about 2001 that I think bothers a lot of people. If they get through the dramatic interpretation of what's on Kubrick's mind to find the ideas, all they end up finding are questions without any real answers.What is the monolith? Where did it come from? Where is it taking us?There are no explicit answers to those in the film itself (there's more explanation in the series of books by Arthur C. Clarke and in the movie sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact), but it does provide us with something a bit more interesting. This is where we get to the 'whoa' part of the film, Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.People tend to put up this sequence as a something of a joke. Upon the movie's first release, people would go to the film and get really high just to watch this part of the film, and it's easy to see why. It's trippy with weird colors and sights. It was also unlike anything anyone had ever really seen before. The visual effects supervisor, Douglas Trumbull, created a series of optical effects that felt futuristic and otherworldly (you can see the same fingerprints on his work through V'Ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture).But, dramatically, you need to go back to The Dawn of Man to see what's going on. In the first sequence, the monolith provided early man with the knowledge of tools, something mundane to us but which was world changing to them. What's the next step up from where we are now? I don't know, and I imagine that you don't either. The light show (especially in combination with the choice of music, Ligeti's Requiem) shows us the character, Dave Bowman, moving from that which we can understand to that which we cannot until he suddenly appears in that hotel room.It is here that we see Bowman live out the rest of his natural life in a comfortable and knowable environment (whether that actually plays out in real time or if he actually spends decades in that room is unclear as it should be) until he makes the next evolutionary jump. He must die before he's reborn, an implication that the human race, in order to evolve to our next stage of life, must die first.HALIt pains me whenever I see HAL 9000 on a list of movie villains.To me, HAL is the one sympathetic character in the film, and I think that was by design. The humans in this film are all played fairly flat by the actors. They're almost non-entities. Frank and Dave are largely interchangeable. They look a fair bit alike and there's no real indication that they do anything different on the ship. In fact, when it comes to mission actions, they each go out to the satellite dish and perform the same task (first Dave, then Frank) as though neither one has any advantage over the other.HAL, though, is different. He's engaging, shows emotion, and is central to the mission in ways that neither Frank nor Dave are.Looking at Frank, Dave, and Dr. Floyd from earlier in the film, we see bland people who represent the character of humanity in this vision of the future. They are mostly boring. HAL is humanity's attempt at the next step in evolution, and they created someone more interesting.But, the devil is interesting and it doesn't make him good. Why do I consider HAL to not be a villain?If you look at the sequence of events that leads HAL to murdering the entire crew, I think it's easy to see. HAL detects a fault in a unit on the satellite dish. Dave brings the unit back and they find no fault. They all agree to put the unit back. Frank and Dave then go into a pod to discuss without HAL overhearing them. In that discussion, they decide to effectively kill HAL. HAL can also read lips, by the way.HAL read their lips and figured out what they were going to do, so he kills Frank and attempts to kill Dave (unsuccessfully). And, in a fit of cold logic, kills the hibernating three scientists on board knowing that they would deactivate him after waking up to find that he had killed the other two crewmen.If you ignore literally everything leading up to HAL's decision to kill Frank, he's obviously a bad guy, but including everything before hand makes him a far more sympathetic character. He was acting in self-defense, and when Dave Bowman goes into his brain to begin to pull bits out, killing HAL slowly and regressively until he's no more than a baby, singing 'Daisy' like he did when he was first introduced to the world, it's tragic. Killing HAL is not a victory.",10,0,1,21 November 2019
Midsommar," Entertaining and intelligent, even if it meanders more than it should
","I don't like really comparing films, but I think it's unavoidable to do that between Midsommar and Ari Aster's first film, Hereditary. Not only are they stylistically very similar, but they deal with very similar subjects (cults) and end on very, very similar notes. I think Aster's first film is the better of the two, though. It's not because it came first, but it's because the first film is more focused and clear headed about its narrative.Dani and Christian are on the verge of breaking up when Dani's sister kills herself and their parents. Suddenly, the relationship that has been on autopilot for a while is going to keep going for a while longer. Neither is happy with the other, but they stay with it out of inertia's sake. When Christian gets invited to go to Sweden to accompany his classmate Josh on a research trip to see a unique midsummer festival, Christian halfheartedly invites Dani along, expecting her to decline. But, she doesn't. She goes out of the inertia and in order to get away from her depressing life, spent all day in bed and pondering the deaths of her family.This early part of the film is easily the best. The prologue, up to the deaths, is fantastic filmmaking and could almost stand alone as its own short film. The lead up to the trip is also quite good, with delicate balances in performances that tell clearly, in a very realistic way, the uncomfortableness around the relationship not just between the two directly involved but the friend circle as well.It's once they get to Sweden that things unravel a bit. You see, Aster has said that he didn't care about the cult aspects of the film, preferring to think of it as a metaphor for breaking up. I think the metaphor works, but he gets really lost in the weeds of the cult and the particulars of the ceremonies at the nine day festival. For a solid half hour or so, we get almost nothing but details of the cult, both visually and through dialogue. It's interesting, but not interesting enough to carry the film as a whole.And the cult is into some weird stuff. The two elders throw themselves off a cliff at the start. There's obvious drug consumption in the form of drinks and the inhaling of smoke. There's a deformed and inbred person of supposed clarity that writes their sacred books in a series of runes with very specific rules (that we get told). There's a ritualized sexual process where Christian gets hoped up on stuff and impregnates one of the Swedish girls (because of his astrological sign), surrounded by a dozen naked women who chant, sing, and push him a bit, physically that is. And people start going missing.The relationship between text and subtext can be a tricky one. In the pursuit of subtext, an artist could sacrifice some elements of the text in the process. The logic of the rest of the outsiders staying at the festival as people start disappearing in mysterious circumstances gets thin, perhaps a bit too thin at times, but they all need to stay so that Dani can go through her breakup process. In a way, she casts off first the strangers that arrived with them at the festival, then the friends she likes the least, then the ones she likes the most (which isn't very much) until finally she literally sends Christian to meet his end.I think the subtext of this film gets lost for a while, but when it comes back, it's at the movie's textual height of horror. As a quick side note: I say horror not because the film is actually scary (it's more disturbing than anything else) but because the characters are meeting horror. We may not share the emotion, but we can understand the emotion running through them.The plot resolution (fine...SPOILERS for both this and Hereditary since they're both so new) comes when Dani, having been crowned May Queen (in a process that may or may not have been rigged) decides that Christian is going to be the ninth of nine sacrifices to the heathen gods of the festival. He gets sewn up into a bear carcass, drugged out, placed in a sacred hut with the other eight, and set on fire. As Dani watches the flames go up, she smiles for the first time in at least half an hour of movie time. She's been through hell, the metaphor of her breakup, finding surprising support at the cult, and she embraces it as the flames take her crappy boyfriend up. It's pretty close to the ending of Hereditary when Peter finds the satanic cult in his treehouse and implicitly decides to lead them.Spoilers over.I actually quite liked the film, though it does feel like a step down from Aster's first film. The idea of the thirty minute longer director's cut, though, confuses me. Maybe it's filled with more relationship stuff that deepens the characters more, but I imagine that it's actually more cult stuff than anything else. I'll check it out some day and see for myself, but I just can't imagine that this movie (which is already overlong) would benefit from another thirty minutes.Still, I got into it for enough of the film, and I really like what Dani goes through, even if it does get lost a bit for a time.",7,4,7,29 January 2020
Alice in Wonderland," Self-serious and lazily built. Tim Burton's lowest point.
","This might be the most inept and lazy epic fantasy adventure attempt I've ever seen. It feels like the most generic script with Alice in Wonderland iconography tacked on as an afterthought. Everything about this movie is wrong. From the visuals to the storytelling to the acting, nothing fits.So, Alice has grown up and lost all memory of her adventures in Wonderland. She goes out to a rich estate where she is to be engaged to a boorish ginger with an awful mother. As he asks for her hand in about as public a way as possible, she runs off, chasing the white rabbit, where she falls down the rabbit hole and recreates the actions she went through on her first adventures that grow and shrink her to get through a door.She is then met by a heavily CG'd creation of a world that she never quite feels right in, surrounded by CGI creatures that never feel quite real. Those creatures, the white rabbit, Tweedledee, and Tweedledum show her the prophecy, a roll of parchment that has all of future history on it. I despise prophecies in storytelling. They're lazy when played straight, and they're usually played straight. And Alice in Wonderland plays the prophecy very straight. It feels like the characters are simply looking at the script and hoping that Alice decides to play along. The reveal of the scroll undermines any real tension because we know where the story's going and what's going to happen.As I rewatched this for the first time in years, I was reminded of Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky. Both films are essentially adaptations of Lewis Carrol's poem, but Gilliam's is a playful and loose take on the material while Burton's is a weirdly strict retelling of a nonsense poem. The Bandersnatch is a real creature that Alice rides around on. The vorpal blade is a special totem that Alice must claim. The Frabjous Day is the prophesized day that the Jabberwock will be defeated. It's all so literal and it doesn't jive with the nonsensical nature of the source material. Also, prophesies are lazy and I hate them.Alice moves through this dark and gritty version of Wonderland (that the locals call Underland for...reasons), seeing all the familiar sights but with darker, grittier undertones. There's the caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat. She makes it to the Red Queen (with an oversized and obviously CG enhanced head that is distracting every moment she's on screen) where she becomes a court favorite under the name Um because she shows up very large and the Queen likes large people. Now, for the little that I like this movie, I do like how the courtiers around the Queen are covered in prosthetics to make individual parts of their bodies larger. This ties in with a criticism that Alice lodged earlier about the ridiculousness of fashions (a codfish on one's head, she imagines). It feels like the single part of the film with any thought behind it. It's also about three minutes of the film.Alice ends up making her way to the White Queen, the Red Queen's sister, who's flighty. There, it's obvious that Alice will don the armor and take up the vorpal blade because, you know, the prophesy says so. When she makes the arduous decision that the movie told us she was going to make an hour before, there's no sense of elation because we already knew that it was going to happen. Also, what does it say about a movie that's supposedly about a woman becoming independent-minded that she ends up doing exactly what a piece of paper says she'll do? She's not acting on her own, making her own choices, she's falling into pre-determination.Anyway, the literalness of the storytelling extends to the final big fight that takes place on a checkered field meant to evoke a chess board. Ugh. Alice has this weird moment as she starts her fight with the Jabberwocky where she recalls six impossible things in her adventure up to that point (echoing something her father told her in the flashback that started the movie), but I'm not really sure what it's supposed to accomplish. It comes off very weird and inappropriately delivered for the moment.And that's the movie. It's weirdly CGI'd to death. Acting is one note all around. Alice's journey of self-discovery actually inverts itself. It's boringly predictable. And it takes itself way, way too seriously at times (like the Hatter's recitation of 'Jabberwocky'). This is easily Tim Burton's worst film.",2,0,1,31 March 2020
A Clockwork Orange," A great, but hard watch
","I've struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don't get it at all. I'm never quite sure.One thing's for sure, it's a hard watch at times. Kubrick, taking Anthony Burgess' novella and running with it, creates a main character so loathsome and charming all at once that it can create a certain dissonance in an audience (Roger Ebert's review of the original release is a fantastic example of a reviewer who simply could not see past Alex de Large as anything other than a celebration of antisocial behavior). The film jumps off the deep end from the very beginning, showing the audience Alex at his most primal and pure, an advocate of the good ultra-violence in charge of three droogs out to cause mayhem and pursue their own pleasures. So unburdened by any existing power structures at any level that Alex can simply get high, beat up other gangs, steal cars, break into houses, rob said houses, and rape women and just crawl back into the bed in his parents' apartment without so much as a serious question from an authority figure. He's not getting caught by the police, so he doesn't care and neither do his parents, so it seems.The introduction of Alex's violence is interesting in its structure. The first incident involves the beating of an old drunk man. It's filmed in shadow to help hide the particulars of the violent act, but it shouldn't endear Alex to the audience. The second, I believe, has an unexpected and subtle effect on its audience. Seemingly just bored, Alex seeks out a rival gang. When he finds them, the other gang is in the process of trying to rape a woman, and in comes Alex whose presence allows the woman to escape. No matter what Alex's intention, one of the direct results of his actions is that a woman is saved from rape. I think there's an unconscious acknowledgement by much of the audience at that which pushes many of them to side with Alex. That is undercut, though, by the next sequence where Alex breaks into the country home, beats an old man (crippling him), and cutting off his wife's clothes (while singing 'Singin' in the Rain' of course) and, implicitly, raping her. Alex is a monster, but in the middle of our long introduction to him where he intentionally does nothing good, he accidentally does something good. I suspect it has an effect on some people they don't really realize.Anyway, Alex, dealing with some internal strife from his gang led by Georgie, ends up killing a woman and turned on by his mates. He's thrown in prison where, two years later, he is the chaplain's devout assistant. In fact, our introduction to Alex's settled life in prison doesn't really focus on him. The scene is focusing on the chaplain giving a sermon and some rowdy prisoners. Alex is off to the side, manning the projector for when they are to sing. Alex, though, hasn't changed at all. He's modified his external appearance, dressing well in his uniform and studying the Bible, but he only really likes the bits about blood and sex. In his mind, he's still the same depraved monster he was at the beginning.He jumps at the idea of an experimental treatment that promises to get him out of prison early. The treatment is that famous bit where Alex is tied into a chair, his eyes pried open, and he watches horrible things on a cinema screen. Combined with an experimental drug, Alex grows sick at the ideas of three things: violence, sex, and Beethoven's 9th symphony. He's not happy with any of the three, but it's the loss of his beloved Beethoven that hits him the hardest. The very sound of the 9th makes Alex ill and unable to function. It's around these experimental treatments that the chaplain makes explicit (shockingly so in a Kubrick film) that what I consider to be the central idea, 'Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.'Alex can no longer chose to be bad. To a certain extent, he ceases to be human, and his return home after the successful demonstration of the treatment's effects help solidify this. His family want nothing to do with him. They've rented out his room and can't, for the sake of their boarder, let Alex move back in. Alex finds his former Droogs as police officers after the old man from the beginning of the film attacks Alex while he's incapacitated. The former Droogs nearly drown Alex as he's unable to fight. He's become so dehumanized that he can't even stand up for himself in any way. He ends up required to rely on the kindness of a stranger, the man whom he crippled and whose wife he raped. This man uses Alex's inability to take Beethoven's 9th symphony and drives him to a suicide attempt, casting himself out of the window.Recovering in a hospital, we discover that Alex has been cured of his cure. He's right back to being the antisocial loathsome creature he started the film. The fantasy sequence that ends the film, showing Alex romping with a naked woman to a cheering, Victorian dressed, audience solidifies that.So, is Kubrick saying that Alex's victory is being violent and psychopathic, as Ebert asserted nearly 50 years ago? No, I think Ebert missed the point. The point isn't that curing people of violence isn't a worthy goal, but that the cure needs to originate from within the person. Alex had to want to be changed, and he never wanted to change. He was always looking for ways out of his predicaments in order to get right on with the good ultra-violence. Forcing the change on him dehumanizes him. Better to do what the Chief Guard obviously thought best for Alex, locking him up forever, was probably a better fix.So, that's a thousand words on the film's thematic exploration. After having written it, I feel like I have a greater grasp on the ideas of the film than before, so that's quite nice. I still think that A Clockwork Orange is a second tier Kubrick film, though. I've read the film as a black comedy for a while, and it can be quite funny through that lens. The performances require a certain special mention. I don't think anyone in the film is doing a straight performance. Everything is mannered to such odd degrees, and I love them all. Patrick Magee as Mr. Alexander, in particular, tickles me. It's so off-kilter and perfect for the world yet still so utterly bizarre as to be eminently watchable.It's smart, but I don't think it looks as good as many of his other films. I feel like having the chaplain explicate the movie's central theme twice makes the ideas less interestingly presented. These are relatively minor complaints, but when comparing this to such films as 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, or Eyes Wide Shut, I have to just say that A Clockwork Orange isn't as successful. Perhaps it will grow on me more with time, but I cannot imagine ever quite loving this movie as much as the listed others with a first act that makes me cringe so much. Yes, it's intentional and successful, but still...that's a hard watch.",8,6,7,26 November 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A good first film
","The thing that makes this movie work at all is its structure. I can imagine this same movie arranged chronologically and it would be a slog. It doesn't help that it was obviously written with this structure in mind, but even taking that into account, the second half would be just too much.It really starts with the opening scene. In a 'normal' movie, this scene would be much shorter and much more perfunctory. It's the scene right before a heist begins, the final moments before the gang gets into the car and heads to the robbery. Here, we don't really know what they're gathered for. Instead, it's just eight guys sitting around a table talking. We start with something so off the wall (a discussion of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin') that it really feels like a bunch of guys just talking over breakfast. The scene overall does two things, though, it introduces us to the characters (with a focus on a handful instead of everyone) and it is filled with foreshadowing.The most famous example is Mr. Orange immediately calling out Mr. Pink for not contributing to the tip (meaning Mr. Orange is the undercover cop), but the more interesting bit is Mr. Pink's insistence on not tipping. It's a wonderful moment of character and foreshadowing at once. On first viewing, it seems extraneous and paints Mr. Pink in a terrible light. However, what it does is shows that Mr. Pink is willing to question everything about a situation. Why do we tip waitresses but not workers at McDonald's? he asks. Whatever the actual answer is to that specific question, it shows that he's willing to step back and question things, so when the survivors of the botched robbery gather at the abandoned warehouse, he's the one asking the right questions. It's a wonderful set up for Mr. Pink.Anyway, the structure does more than that one scene, obviously. The majority of the film takes place in one location, the abandoned warehouse. If the movie were to take place chronologically, the last 60% or so of the film would be in one place, only going outside for brief moments here and there. It would monotonize the visual look of the film as well as the tone. It's high strung yelling, pleading, and threatening from the moment Mr. White bursts into the place with Mr. Orange bleeding out over his arm. Roughly 55 minutes of that would become almost intolerable, but because that is told in order (limiting confusion about the events in the warehouse) and we cut from there to moments in the past for three characters (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Orange) that are significantly lighter in tone.Those flashbacks (and one flashback within the flashback for Mr. Orange) provide more than just a lighter tone, though, they further provide character information that helps flesh out most of the gang. Mr. White gives bits of his backstory and we understand his relationship to Joe and Eddie, the two running the operation. We see how Mr. Blonde kept his mouth shut in prison and how Joe and Eddie are grateful for it. We also see how Mr. Orange learned his part and ingratiated himself with the crew enough to become part of the job.The only real problems I have are the fact that Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown are largely afterthoughts and the lack of emotional connection with the rest of the characters. Mr. Blue seems to be a red herring for who could the rat be (since we don't find out Mr. Orange is the rat until more than halfway through the film), but he barely makes an impression when he's on screen and he's barely talked about when he's off screen. Mr. Brown seems to be little more than cannon fodder (and an excuse for Quentin Tarantino to say 'dicks' a whole lot on screen). The rest of the characters, though, while they do get time to differentiate and grow themselves, don't create strong attachments with the audience (at least this audience), so when they all die in the end, it doesn't hit that hard.Shot selection is carefully arranged with intelligent use of a combination of wide, medium, and close shots at the appropriate times. Entire scenes play out in wide shots except for the heightened emotional moments that go in close. Performances are good, though because so much of the film happens at the same tenor, it's hard to tell how good they are. Still, it's a striking debut from an obviously talented filmmaker.",7,0,0,25 November 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," An underrated exploration of dreams
","This might be the best approximation to the experience of a dream in film. Dreams are hard to realize because they don't follow a lot of the basic rules of logic and storytelling we're used to. The only other movie I can think of that works this successfully at building the illogic of a dream is Dario Argento's Suspiria.Bill Harford is a doctor in Manhattan whose clientele includes some very rich people. One of these millionaires, Victor, invites him and his wife Alice to a swanky Christmas party in Victor's large Manhattan mansion. There both husband and wife are presented with opportunities for infidelity. Bill is approached by two models who instantly try to seduce him, dragging him away from the party with implied promises of a threesome while Alice dances with a charming older Hungarian man who makes it very plain that he wants to sleep with her. Alice, despite her drunken state, turns him down, but Bill seems to be on the edge of saying yes (or possibly no) when he's pulled away by Victor's man to deal with a crisis. Victor had taken a prostitute upstairs who took a bad combination of heroin and cocaine before passing out. Bill coaxes her back to the land of the living in a very professional manner, taking seemingly no notice of the attractive body before him.The next night, Bill and Alice put their daughter to bed and get a little high. Alice goes on a tirade about Bill's view of women and sexuality, attacking his preconceived notions of the depths of her fidelity to him when she reveals a fantasy she had about an attractive naval officer the year before. He receives a call about a patient who just died and uses the excuse to leave the house. Consumed with images dancing in his head of Alice romping with the officer, Bill starts a journey that extends well into the night that puts him up against several different forms of temptation.First is the grieving daughter, engaged to another man, who throws herself at Bill in the midst of her sadness. He's there in his professional capacity and lets her down gently. Second is a streetwalker who gets Bill into her apartment with the understanding that he's going to pay her $150 for sex. A call from Alice on Bill's cell phone ends his desire for the romp, he pays the girl for her time, and leaves without more than a chaste kiss. Bill then runs into an old friend, Nick Nightingale, who is a jazz pianist and tells Bill about some crazy shindig he's got lined up in a couple of hours. Bill just has to follow, which he does after he procures a tuxedo, cloak, and mask from a closed costume shop.The shindig is the famous orgy in the house. What fascinates me most about this isn't the orgy itself, it's the fact that it comes in just about halfway through the movie and that the orgy itself is so cloaked in ritual as to border on the profane. Okay, it doesn't border on the profane, it reaches out and grabs the profane with both hands and squeezes as tightly as possible. The music is from a mass played backwards, even. The other part of the ritualistic nature of the orgy is the masks. They never come off and we often seen people kissing each other through the masks. The act of sex is an intimate act, but the masks strip the intimacy completely. Bill's journey has gone from his wife, to someone he knows, to a prostitute, to completely anonymous sex. It's a descent through sex in its different forms until it's nothing more than ritualized and animalistic. Bill gets found out, embarrassed, threatened, and let go after one of the women sacrifices herself to protect him. At home, Alice feeds Bill's sense of jealousy by detailing a dream he just woke her from where she was having sex with a multitude of other men in front of him, mirroring the orgy he just witnessed to a certain degree.The next day, Bill tries to reclaim the images from the night. It's like he's trying to reconstitute a dream after he's waken up. He tries to find Nick, but he's missing and the hotel clerk tells a strange story of Nick getting forcefully led away. He returns the cloak and tuxedo (having lost the mask) to find that the raucous scene he had interrupted the night before is now calm. He tries to find the prostitute only to discover that she's left and her roommate lets him know that she had just that morning received blood test results that showed her to be HIV+. He then goes back out to the mansion where the orgy took place and receives a written threat to stay away.That night, he reads of the death of a beauty queen and uses his status as a doctor to look at her corpse, the thought that she is the woman who saved him at the orgy dancing in his head. She was masked, so he can't quite identify her, but he obviously thinks it's her. He then gets called to Victor who lays out that he knows about Bill at the orgy, for he was there as well. He goes back and forth about whether the threats to Bill's life were real, offering different takes on Nick's disappearance and the woman's death than Bill had come up with. Nothing can be verified, so I don't know how much to trust him, but Bill leaves Victor's and his dream ultimately comes to an end. He finds his missing mask from the orgy resting on his pillow next to Alice and he breaks down. He tells her everything of his journey, she's obviously deeply wounded by it, and they decide to try and continue on with the memory of their near infidelities and temptations behind them instead of in front of them.The Odyssean journey that Bill goes through, as I wrote before, seems to wonderfully capture the logic of a dream. Every stage of a long dream has its own internal logic. The centerpiece for that kind of logic is the costume shop to me. It starts normally with Bill talking through an intercom to the owner of the shop only to find out that it's not whom he expects. The man is shaggy bearded with a long robe and lets him into the place that's darkly lit and filled with mannequins demonstrating certain costumes (this being a Kubrick film, the costumes are mostly of the Napoleonic era). Then the rules of the encounter change when a bump introduces a new element, two Japanese men romping with the costumer's underaged daughter. The costumer locks up the Japanese men and then proceeds with the transaction, getting Bill his tux, cloak, and mask. It's such a weird progression of events and it captures rather perfectly that effervescent feeling of the dream world.On top of that feel we have a fascinating exploration of the intersection of love and lust. Where does trust end within an established relationship. Bill and Alice have been married for nine years. Should they be comfortable with that fact or should they still worry about not only their spouse's fidelity but their own in the face of a sea of temptations? Bill walks through literal orgies and comes out without having succumbed to temptation, but was presenting himself with the temptation to begin with damaging to the relationship he has with Alice? She sure does seem broken up by it when he admits to it. It's a wonderful exploration that leaves with a sense of hope that things may just end up working out.The movie is as well really well filmed. Kubrick continues using his Steadicam in much the same way that he did in The Shining, implying an other world that doesn't conform to the rules of our own. A small side note, but there's a small bit in the movie Filmworker about Leon Vitali, Kubrick's personal assistant, where Vitali describes one of Kubrick's outbursts and he used the example of lens flares in Eyes Wide Shut. I think I saw all of them this time through after seeing Vitali mention it.But yeah, I find the movie completely enrapturing. It's a descent into dream logic and another world while also touching on themes that are extraordinarily grounded. I think it's an underrated work from one of the greatest of filmmakers.",10,2,2,26 November 2019
Beauty and the Beast," An ugly and wrong-headed adaptation
","It's fascinating when a remake of a very good movie comes along and utterly fails at almost everything that the original did so well. It doesn't look as good, sound as good, and it doesn't play as well. It's a curious artistic failure.The movie's problems begin right at the opening with an introductory sequence that falls somewhere between a dramatic scene and a voice over summary of events. It's filmed in exactly the same way as the rest of the film is. There are no filters applied to the visuals to set it apart from the rest of the film. No sepia tone, no old age feel. That would be fine, if the scene were played dramatically, but it's not. The same voiceover that's in the original (almost word for word with some additions) plays over the action. It looks like characters on screen should be talking to each other, but every word they say gets overwritten by the dreamy voiceover playing on top. It's an overall very odd experience that just feels wrong.The movie then moves immediately into the action of the story with our main character Belle's first musical number, and it's jarring. I don't know if Emma Watson can or cannot sing, but it's pretty obvious that Disney didn't think that she could. She's autotunned to such a ridiculous degree across almost every note of every song she sings that it's frustratingly distracting. And, her first number begins with her belting out some strong notes, but thoroughly overlaid with a digital alteration that's beyond obvious. That's how we begin our big special effects movie musical, with autotune from our star. Either let Watson's imperfect voice through or dub her, don't use autotune, especially not to this degree.And that stuff isn't really the extent of my problems with the film. There's a weird tendency in these films to extend 90 minute films into two hours. The original animated film is a grand 84 minutes long, and this remake runs 129. That's forty-five more minutes of screentime without really expanding the movie in any significant way. The extensions are a couple of new songs (neither of which are particularly good and don't hold up well to the original songs that surround them), some backstory about Belle's mother that really doesn't deepen her character or provide any further thematic depth, and LeFou.I'm gonna be honest, I don't think Josh Gad is particularly entertaining, but Disney seems to love him. Every added bit of screentime to his character LeFou feels wasted and, at absolute best, frivolous. In the original, he's support to a secondary character, but in this he now has an arc. He starts as Gaston's lackey, but he grows to reject Gaston and join with the heroes in the final moments of the final battle. In what way does this extend, support, or illuminate anything about the core story of Belle and the Beast? The only way, there is a single way, is to give LeFou a line that makes the irony around Gaston acting like a beast and the Beast acting like a gentleman explicit.But even with that out of sight and out of mind, the core story feels wrong here too. The scenes (lifted word for word from the original) that lead up to the big musical numbers feel truncated and small. The actors skip through them like the emotional reality that leads up to the music doesn't actually matter. Some of the music comes through fine ('Be Our Guest' in particular), but there are others that are so mishandled as to border on abuse. 'The Mob Song' is cut into three sections, ruining the flow of the number completely as the movie goes through half the song, jumps to other stuff, jumps back for another section, jumps away again, and then jumps back to finish it. The idea is to have crosscutting to enhance a feeling of mounting tension, but the movie breaks that tension every time the song abruptly comes to an end. In the hands of a talented creative team, they would have expanded the song into a medley that included the action in the castle, allowing the song to expand in a far more interesting way.And, honestly, I don't even like how the movie looks. It's extremely set bound and the designs feel overly complicated. I can't get out of my mind the simplicity of Lumiere's design in the original when looking at the over-designed monstrosity that the live action version presents. The CGI doesn't hold up particularly well either. This is a very expensive movie with a lot of money spent across a lot of special effects, and so much of it feels plastic and fake, especially the eponymous Beast.Overall, the movie feels like it was made by an amateur with too much money and no idea how to fill out the extra minutes. It's a wild disappointment, and a struggle to get through.",3,2,3,27 November 2019
Some Like It Hot," An expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance
","This movie is about as pure entertainment as movies can get. It's an expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance that creates such a complete package of good times that Hollywood has very rarely come close to matching. Working with I.A.L. Diamond for the second time after Love in the Afternoon, Billy Wilder crafted an essentially perfect film.Set during Prohibition, we follow two jazz musicians after they witness a gangland murder and try to run for their lives. They're broke and can't even pay to get to a regular job 100 miles from Chicago much less fund an escape from the mob, so they do the only logical thing. They dress up like women and join an all-female band headed to Florida for three weeks. The two have been so consumed with bare survival in the winter of Chicago where they could only ever find unsteady work, that romance has been a secondary objective for a long time. Suddenly thrown into a train car with a dozen beautiful women including Sugar Kane (played perfectly by Marilyn Monroe), the two don't need to worry about feeding themselves or the back rent on their apartment or the coats they lost in a bet at a dog race.Jerry, played by Jack Lemmon, embraces his femininity fully while also embracing the potential for sexual escapades. Joe, played by Tony Curtis, is a bit more forward thinking and knows that if they give away the game they'll be off the train and ready to freeze to death in the winter cold. Jerry sees their escape as an excuse to have fun, but since none of the other women on the train are suspicious of them, they treat the two like any other girl, ruining Jerry's attempt to have a surprise party with Sugar Kane by piling into his single berth in a display of absurdism that still feels completely natural in the film.Two romances develop in the film. The first is between Joe and Sugar. It was Jerry who originally tried to make a lustful move towards the innocently sensual Sugar, but it's Joe who makes a concerted effort to win her heart. He's a man in a disguise who takes up another disguise (as a millionaire) while she is a woman who professes a need for a millionaire but also admits that she can't help herself around saxophone players (which Joe is). They're both lying about who they are to the other. Sugar is lying to both herself and to Joe's alter ego, Junior, about what she wants while Joe is lying to Sugar about who he is. The mutual lies end up canceling each other out in a way.Jerry gets the second romance, this one with a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown). He's a serial husband looking for his next wife (either eighth or ninth, only his mother keeps an accurate count), and he's smitten by Daphne, Jerry's alter-ego. Joe ends up bullying Jerry into playacting for Fielding in order to help Joe woo Sugar. The dual scene of Joe's reversed seduction of Sugar and the night out that Fielding and Jerry share is a marvelous display of contrasts. Joe is playing an impotent (maybe homosexual) rich dandy who needs Sugar Kane's feminine wiles to bring him back to life, so to speak. She tries with all of her innocently sexual energy. At the same time, Jerry and Fielding are dancing in a Cuban nightclub, Jerry accidentally leading at times while they grow closer in synch to the point where they can perfectly transfer a rose stem from one mouth to the other. It's a perfect mesh of comedic visuals with narrative push, driving the absurd romances on both sides forward.The action of the film comes to a head when the gangsters from Chicago coincidentally have a get together with mobs from across the country in the same Florida hotel. The slapstick nature of two men dressed in drag running from gangsters reaches its peak here, embracing the absurdity with both arms fully. The resolution to the two romances is rather perfect as well. Joe and Sugar shedding their mutual deceit and falling into each other's arms in the back of Fielding's boat while Fielding dismisses all of Daphne's flaws as acceptable, even the fact that Daphne is actually Jerry.Never has Wilder's common motif of masks and deception been more explicit than in Some Like it Hot (though The Major and the Minor comes close). He uses it to great comedic effect, crafting one of Hollywood's great comedies that feels as fresh in 2019 as it surely did in 1959.",10,0,0,27 November 2019
Pulp Fiction," Not as fresh as some said, but just as great
","Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.It's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.In every story, from the dual framing devices (the café and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as 'the man in Amsterdam'. One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.Of course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.Taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.The second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.There's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.The third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the café that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.Thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.So, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.No wonder it made such a splash.",10,1,2,25 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Peter Quill meets his dad, the planet Exposition
","James Gunn loved his characters too much. That's the only way I can process this movie's failures. He loves them so much he's going to give them great big emotional moments whether the movie needs them or not. Mostly not.As with several of Marvel's less successful movies, I have to ask, what's the story? Is it Peter reuniting with his dad? Is it Rocket coming to terms with his unpleasant nature? Is it Gamora and Nebula accepting their shared horrible past and becoming real sisters? Is it Yondu examining his past and confronting his failures in life?All of these happen, take up significant screen time, and most of them don't mesh particularly well together. And, on top of that, the structure throws some of these moments side by side so we're getting unrelated moments of high emotion that have never been significantly established or built up to.I know that a lot of people love Yondu in this movie, but I think his story is a complete mess. When we first see him, it's about twenty minutes into the movie, and he looks out the window of a robot brothel to see someone he recognizes. He gets dressed, runs down outside, and we learn several things in quick succession. The first is that there are more Ravagers than just Yondu's group, totaling one hundred in all. The second is that Yondu had been expelled from the Ravagers as a whole some years ago for breaking a code. Oh, and they have a code, that's new too. The fourth is that Yondu stole kids (so, more than just Peter at the beginning of the first film). The fifth is that the Ravagers have funeral ceremonies and that Yondu isn't ever going to get one. The sixth is that Yondu is really broken up about this. That amount of information is relayed in about ten seconds, and at the end of that exposition dump, we've got Yondu, accompanied by mournful music, yelling that he is sad about the situation. It's such a clunky dump of information followed very swiftly by an emotional moment that gets only that exposition dump as support, I cannot imagine how anyone in the audience can feel anything in that moment.Yondu, essentially, spends this movie sad. His crew mutinies, and he sits in a chair as they toss out his loyal crew into the iciness of space. He tells a sad story about his growing up in a Kree slave camp. Most importantly, the most intimate relationship he has with any other character in the film is with Peter, and the two don't share a scene until about one hundred minutes into the film, and their relationship is supposed to act as the counterbalance to Peter's relationship with his real father, Ego.Ego, on the other hand, is almost nothing but exposition. Twice, he walks through the same room with dioramas depicting his life, and he just recites what went on, the first time in as happy terms as possible, the second in terms more conforming to what he actually did. Kurt Russell is game as Ego, explaining things for minutes on end, but it doesn't get past the fact that twice, Ego stops the movie to simply explain stuff. It's dramatically inert and akin to reading a Wikipedia article instead of watching a movie.Gosh, I haven't even gotten to the plot of the thing, yet. And yet, the plot is of little importance. Peter and the Guardians save some expensive batteries for a planet of gold people. Rocket steals some batteries because it's what he does and the gold people chase after them. Ego, Peter's previously unknown father, rescues them and brings some of them back to his planet. The rest stay behind and get captured by the Ravagers, who go through the aforementioned mutiny which ends with Yondu killing literally everyone on the ship save one crewmember. They then go to Ego's planet where Peter has learned that he's immortal and that his father gave his human mother brain cancer. That information set him off and he fights his father, who is the planet itself. The gold people, Yondu, and all of the Guardians converge on Ego's planet to fight Ego, Peter turns himself into Pacman, and the good guys win. Yondu dies saving Peter from the final explosion.Now, Yondu's death is another moment that I read people getting all teary-eyed up about, but I just feel like it falls flat. Take that scene in isolation and it feels like the kind of moment that will tug at heart strings, but Yondu's story has been so poorly handled and his time with Peter so limited that it feels like much ado about nothing. His high emotional moments have come out of nowhere and been unconnected to anything else in the narrative. His sacrifice for Peter is undermined by the fact that they barely share any screen time throughout the entire film.I'm spent over 800 words complaining, and yet I don't dislike this movie. My problem is that I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and I wanted to love this one. The problems I have with the movie wouldn't have been too terribly difficult to fix at the script stage, and so I see wasted opportunities everywhere. However, I actually find the movie okay overall. I moderately enjoy the experience. Just like the first film, the movie is beautiful to look at. There's such an embrace of color and design that just makes every image pop off the screen. Character interactions are generally quite fun (save when people just explain things). Dialogue is light and witty, and the tone (aside from some moments here and there) is one of an enjoyable romp through the stars. The use of music meshes well with the action on screen, often producing entertaining juxtapositions between sound and visual that brings a smile to my face.I just wish the script had gone through another draft. Someone needed to look at this and ask, 'Why don't Yondu and Peter have a scene until page 100?'",5,0,0,25 November 2019
In Time," An embarrassment
","There are two major things to think about when trying to parse In Time. The first is the basic building blocks of story, the plot, characters, and structure. The second is the metaphor. Normally something like a metaphor wouldn't take a huge spot in analysis because it's usually not that prominent, but with In Time, there's just so much attention given to the metaphor that there's little space left for any of the other elements of storytelling.This movie is really, really stupid. It's a surprise to me to write that even ten years after the movie's release and its reputation of a dumb, thin action movie metaphor has been solidified by time, but Andre Niccol is still the man who wrote and directed Gattaca, one of the great science fiction films that maturely approached the idea of genetic engineering in humans as a vehicle through which to look at prejudice. In Time feels like it was written by a guy who watched Gattaca once, felt like it needed a more obvious message and a lot more out of nowhere action heroics.I will say, the early conception of how the world works is kind of neat. Time has replaced all currency after genetic engineering has won and everyone is kept at the age of twenty-five for the rest of their lives. It's the sort of concept that can support a short film pretty easily, but by stretching the idea out to feature length, Niccol took it past the breaking point. It simply stops making literal sense after a certain point, really once he tries to expand the world. A lot of what makes the concept stop gelling is the metaphor.You see, Andrew Niccol doesn't like capitalism, but he doesn't seem to understand what it is. Instead of a creating a science fiction society where the economic system is one where free trade between willing individuals is the norm, he created one where an elite control a top down economy with extreme regulations around the basic transfer of wealth including simply moving from one area to another. You know...not capitalism. It doesn't help that the main bad guy, Phillipe Weis, says that the game of poker he plays with Justin Timberlake's Will is pure capitalism, the world of dog eat dog. A game of poker.Fine, let's just give it its poorly thought out metaphor that doesn't mean what it think it means, and let's talk about the rest of the film. First things, first, the world makes no sense. It reminded me of Panem in The Hunger Games, but it felt significantly smaller, like the entire map shown in the office of the police was about the size of Los Angeles. That's an entire command economy ruled by an elite in a few hundred square miles. It's the sort of size that makes sense, again, in a short film format but makes less sense once pulled out to feature length. It makes the world feel small. The other thing is that, apparently, there's no industry in the world other than the creation of the little metal things people carry around to store extra time. Late in the film, all work stops when everyone gets a bunch of time, but what are people doing with that time? What are they spending it on because suddenly no one's making anything. Also, banks are shockingly poorly defended to the point that over the course of a week, Will and Phillipe's daughter Sylvia can ram vans through all of their glass fronts to steal all the time and hand them out to anyone gathering around. This world makes no sense.Did you know there's a story in this movie? I mean, it's hard to tell with all the piss poor world building and thin and stupid metaphor, but it's there. Well, sort of. It's also stupid especially in its moments of 'high drama'. Will gets a hundred years from a rich guy tired of living, and as he goes to meet with his mother, she runs out of time as she's flying through the air to grab hold of her son in her final seconds. The sight is kind of hilarious. From there, Will decides to take his anger out on the system, so he goes into the rich part of town and...immediately goes to a casino. Where he wins a few centuries from a rich guy (Phillipe). It almost feels like this guy with a dead set purpose is just wandering around in an effort to accommodate world building, because that's exactly what's going on. He gets found out on suspicion of the rich guy's death (with police who are entirely uninterested in investigating a death) and immediately becomes an action hero, pulling guns from police holsters and firing perfect shots to escape, kidnapping Sylvia along the way. They become a Bonnie and Clyde type pair and Sylvia instantly falls in love with him (because they are both the leads, you know). It's all thin and stops constantly so that people can make the metaphor clear just one more time in case you missed the thirteen other times it's been made clear in the last fifteen minutes.The movie looks pretty good, though. Props to Roger Deakins for keeping things in focus while probably wondering why he had accepted the job at all for weeks.The more I think about the movie, the less I think of it. I'm happy to accept metaphor in film, but it'd be nice if it made sense and wasn't constantly repeated again and again and again. There are a lot of storytellers who have one good film in them. Niccol managed two: Gattaca and Lord of War. This movie is an embarrassment and Niccol should be ashamed of it.",2,0,2,1 June 2020
Thor," Best at the bookends when it embraces opera
","Finally, a good movie from Marvel, and most people don't seem to like it very much.I love about 50 minutes of this movie, the first thirty minutes and the last twenty. Everything in between those bookmarks of operatic emotion and design is somewhere between functional and pretty good.The film opens with three people in a van in the middle of the desert looking to the sky at night. Some strange formation of clouds and light forms in the sky, they race towards it, and they find a man who shouldn't be there. I'm not a huge fan of this tendency to start a movie after the story has started as some sort of teaser, but I think it works quite well here based on what follows. The opening couple of minutes is designed to ease the audience into the film and inform them that things are about to get weird.And weird do they get, and it is glorious. We fly across the cosmos to Asgard, a realm full of giant ostentation and seems to be built on a dual plane instead of a spherical celestial body. Sets are huge and covered in gold. The emotions the characters subscribe to are bold and large. The acting fits so appropriately, and we are in this cosmic opera, wallowing in its luscious details for a solid half hour and I love it. Odin, king of Asgard, tells us of Asgard's place in the cosmos as protector and their chief antagonist, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, another planet. He tells of Asgard's subjugation of Jotunheim, and we see him with his two sons Thor and Loki. At the ceremony to mark Thor's ascendance to the Asgardian throne to replace Odin, the Frost Giants sneak into the Asgardian weapons vault and are promptly killed by the defenses.Thor is furious and demands that they travel to Jotunheim to punish the Frost Giants for their act of war. Odin bites back with fervor. I swear, Anthony Hopkins as Odin is one of my favorite things about these movies so far. He balances the large delivery of big emotions so well, creating an atmosphere that allows for others to operate at the same level of emotion. His two major rebukes of Thor are absolutely wonderful. Thor, of course, goes to Jotunheim with Loki and some pals, cause some havoc, and need to be rescued by Odin. Odin, as punishment for Thor's senseless actions that threaten to ignite war between the two worlds, casts Thor out of Asgard and to Earth. This scene between father and son as Odin calls his oldest a 'vain, greedy, cruel boy' is probably my favorite scene in Marvel.Then the movie loses a bit of its step as its action comes to Earth. Jane Foster and her two pals guide Thor through a cute (but not too cute) fish out of water tale. Thor throws a coffee mug violently on the ground to express his approval of the drink. He walks into a pet shop to demand a horse or at least a dog large enough to ride. It's cute. The plot turns when Thor learns that his hammer, the mythical Mjolnir, is just a few miles down the road, and he needs to get it back in order to return to Asgard. The organization SHIELD has set up a perimeter and Thor easily cuts through their defenses to reach Mjolnir but he can't lift it from the ground because he is not worthy. He cries and gives up before Jane's older professor colleague, Dr. Erik Selvig, gives a story that SHIELD doesn't believe. They let Thor go in order to follow and potentially learn.Back in Asgard, Odin has fallen into the Odinsleep (which, I assume, is some sort of hibernation that he must go through in order to extend his long life) and Loki has consolidated power through default. He works to keep out Thor from coming back. I don't think Loki was ever as good again as he was in this movie. He learns that he's actually a Frost Giant, and he's deeply wounded by the fact that Odin hid that from him. On top of that, he sees Thor for the brash man who would be a disaster as king and works to undermine him in the eyes of their father. His motives are strong, Tom Hiddleston plays him really well, especially in his big moments with Odin in that first glorious half hour, and he's smart. He's the first antagonist in this series worthy of the name. No wonder they can't let him go through the rest of the series.Anyway, Loki sends the giant terminator like machine to kill Thor back on Earth. Thor sacrifices himself to save his friends, and at that moment, Mjolnir comes alive at Thor's worthiness, flying into his hand and giving him his old clothes back because, sure why not? The Asgardians make it back to Asgard and the movie turns kind of great again. It's all operatic all the time again. Brother against brother. Giant light bridge of rainbow light. Huge emotions as Thor crushes it and prevents him from ever going back to Earth to see Jane Foster again (yeah, right). When Odin awakes and Loki sees the disappointment in his father's eyes for his actions, Loki just gives up, and it's shockingly sad. Loki's just so great.So, yeah, I glossed over Jane Foster and her little gang of misfits. They kind of don't matter. They're entertaining to a degree (Selvig is the best of them), but they don't really affect Thor's core arc very much. Thor is humbled by his brother, and redeemed by his own sacrifice against the Terminator machine. The puny humans provide some room for Thor to demonstrate his lowered ego, but they don't drive it. They tend to drive lighter comedy bits, but they simply don't work as well as the big operatic beginning and end of the film.Visually, the movie is really good beyond the design of Asgard. Kenneth Branaugh is a quality director who gets good performances from his actors (I want to see him direct Anthony Hopkins as King Lear), and he uses the visual language of the medium intelligently. His use of Dutch angles is either done to achieve interesting compositions or to imply that reality has been skewed. So we see these tilted camera angles when Jane Foster gets introduced to the world of magic through Thor but also when we just want a good shot of the warriors three standing in a line up some steps. The color pallete is alternatively vivid like in Asgard and with the rainbow bridge, dark and blue like at Jotunheim, or light brown and dry like in New Mexico.Overall, it's a solid film that looks great and works best at the bookends.",7,0,0,25 November 2019
Die Hard," The everyman as action hero again
","I've always wondered why I've liked this movie than what seems like the rest of the population, so going into this watching, I was determined to figure out why. I definitely figured it out, and it's a solid thirty-minute chunk in the middle of the film. Everything around it is top notch entertainment, but that block of the movie's runtime is kind of painful.The main reason the movie works so well beyond that chunk is really Bruce Willis as John McClane. He's the everyman (but also a cop). He gets roughed up but defiantly maintains a certain humor about his situation. He strikes a balance between taking the situation seriously and maintaining his sanity through the insanity that erupts around him. He's a rather instantly likeable lead to guide the audience through. Across the way is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, and he's just a fantastic bad guy. He's smart, in control, and he has a plan. He only ever really breaks down once, when someone calls him a petty thief. He is an exceptional thief.And when the movie is about these two antagonists working against each other, the movie works like gangbusters. McClane shows up at the Nakatomi Tower to try and reconnect with his wife at her company's Christmas party, but Gruber shows up with a dozen men, intent on breaking into the company's vault, killing whomever they need along the way. The game of cat and mouse that develops between Gruber and McClane is fun, until it stops for thirty minutes. It's the second that Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson shows up that I begin to turn against the movie.Robinson is aggressively pig headed and stupid. I'm sure there are many police administrators out there who are just the same in real life, but that doesn't necessarily translate to compelling drama. He's got Sergeant Powell standing next to him telling him how to do everything right (something that begins to grate after a while, to be honest) and Robinson is completely dismissive. He doesn't seem to follow any known procedure, just throwing police bodies at a fortress without any concern. And, to make matters worse, John McClane can do almost nothing about it. He does end up saving the police after a while with a well timed application of C4 and a computer monitor, but watching our hero shout pointlessly at a window because everyone else is stupid is really frustrating. And then there's Ellis.I think if Robinson hadn't been in the movie and Ellis had been exactly as he is, he wouldn't bother me so much. But, right after Robinson is done being a complete idiot and derailing the central conflict, here comes Ellis to do the exact same thing, but smarmier and more 80s businessman. So, we get a full thirty minutes of two secondary characters dominating the movie by being idiots. Don't get me wrong, the action of the failed police incursion is done well and the tension around Ellis' failed negotiation works in isolation, but they push McClane to the sidelines.Once that's done, though, and the FBI shows up, the movie is right back on track. Now, the interesting thing about the FBI agents (Johnson and Johnson, no relation) is that they have a plan and fail at it as opposed to Robinson who had no discernable plan and just did stuff. Also, the FBI plan ends up successfully setting up the movie's action climax and gives us tense action beats that actually directly involve McClane.And that feeds into what, again, makes Gruber such a great villain. The FBI does what it should do. It follows a rule book, but Gruber knows the rule book and uses it against them. It's a competent plan by the FBI being outsmarted by an intelligent bad guy in Hans Gruber. As opposed to the police incursion which is pretty much just Robinson hitting his head against the wall for no reason.So, I've complained enough. My problems with the movie are really that thirty-minute segment in the middle of the film. Outside of that, I love the movie. Willis and Rickman are great. The supporting cast is really good. Action is great. Tension is palpable. The character of McClane strikes a delicate balance between indestructible and vulnerable while Gruber is really smart and very good at what he does, creating a great foil between protagonist and antagonist. I really like this film, I just kind of wish I liked it a bit more like everyone else.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Joker," The first half is pretty much unwatchable, but the second half is kind of great
","Out of all the comic book movie's I've seen, this is probably the one that wants to be taken seriously the most. So, let's return the favor and take it seriously.There's a lot of noise in this film that distracts from the core of the film, and I think it really detracts from what would otherwise be a rather good character study. The noise confused things to a point that I had to consider the movie for a while just to piece through everything to determine what that core was, though. A lot of that is due to some, shall we say, curious filmmaking that intentionally causes confusion but is also unintentionally confused itself.So, the core is about a man with mental health problems who has all of his support mechanisms pulled out from under him until he lashes out violently. This man is Arthur Fleck and part of his problems are the fact that he is a man driven by delusion. They extend from rather modest fantasies, such as his ability to make the world around him laugh through comedy, to those that are a bit more outlandish. There are three, though, that manifest in similar visual ways, and I think they highlight some of the problems with the film.The first fantasy revolves around the late night talk show host Murray Franklin. Much like how Robert de Niro's character Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy is obsessed with Jerry Lewis's Jerry Langford, Arthur is obsessed with Franklin. It manifests in an obvious fantasy sequence where Arthur appears in Franklin's audience, gets highlighted by Franklin, and even invited down to the stage where Franklin admits that he wishes he had a son just like Arthur. So, my issues with this are twofold. The first is the on-the-nose aspect of Franklin's son admission. It's Arthur imagining himself a daddy, and I just feel like it's a bit too obvious in delivery, the rest of it is quite good. The other issue is that this largely disappears from the movie, even when Franklin comes back later. This fantasy gets replaced by two others.The second fantasy involves an attractive single mother who lives down the hall in Arthur's rundown apartment building. They share a single moment in an elevator and Arthur develops a friendship that blooms into something more. It's only much later in the film that Arthur walks into her apartment and she reacts with horror at his presence that we realize he's fantasized everything about their relationship since the elevator. Out of all three of the fantasies, this is the one that works best. It's very good and rather subtly done until the reveal. The reveal is as obvious as Franklin's son line and undermines the moment.The third fantasy is actually a fantasy by proxy. Arthur lives with his mother who writes to the billionaire Thomas Wayne on a regular basis without ever getting a response. Arthur opens her letter one day to see that his mother flatly describes Arthur as Wayne's son. Arthur instantly believes this and goes out to Wayne Manor where he has an improbable interaction with 10 year old Bruce Wayne before sneaking into a tuxedo affair in a movie theater (where everyone is watching Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times) and confronting Wayne in a bathroom alone. Wayne unloads on this stranger accosting him in a bathroom, telling Arthur that Arthur's mother was a literal crazy person, he never slept with her, and Arthur was adopted. I really don't think this third fantasy works at all. It's the fact that it's not really Arthur's fantasy and yet it drives him for a solid block of the film. If the daddy issues had been made more of earlier, if Penny, Arthur's mother, had actually made the connection to him much earlier, it might have worked. Maybe. I don't really think so, though. This feels like extra stuff to make DC happy that they were including Batman stuff, although it may not be that at all.Along all of this is the plot driven by Arthur's job as a party clown, his mishandling of a handgun that gets him fired, and his self-defense against three investment bankers on a subway that kills all three. The bankers worked for Thomas Wayne, and Wayne's reaction on television is the sort of thing you have a supervillain say unironically, about how poor people are clowns. This ignites a protest movement with people donning clown masks, shouting slogans about eating the rich, and handling several RESIST signs. I also feel like this is extra and just weighs the movie down. Arthur largely ignores the movement as it sprouts up and grows, occasionally wandering through protests and smiling through them. He's uninvolved until the very end when the protestors save him.So, let's get into some real spoiler territory.Arthur gets on Franklin's show. A video of him bombing at an open mic night gets to Franklin who puts it on the air where he makes fun of Arthur. The bit creates enough buzz that the producers of the show find Arthur and invite him on. Arthur's reached the end of his rope at this point, dresses up in his clown getup, and appears on the show where he admits to the murder of the three bankers. He justifies himself with a speech about how he finds things funny that other people don't before drawing his pistol from his back pocket and shooting Franklin in the head.First, let me say that the height of Arthur's criminality being shooting a popular person in the head is a certain kind of refreshing. It's not world-ending consequences, or about the robbing of some precious gemstone. No, it's about a tangible piece of real violence. I love that.And then the movie keeps going. Those protestors that Arthur's been largely ignoring have decided to save Arthur by somehow knowing which police car he is, hitting hit as hard as they can with an ambulance, hoping that he's still alive, and then dragging his body out through the window. Arthur slowly gets up and then dances on the hood of the car. Okay,...I can deal with this. Bringing Arthur and the protestors together in the end, providing some kind of grounds for a Crown Prince of Crime Army. Yeah, sure. It went too far for what I would have done, but I can accept it.And then the movie keeps going. We suddenly see Arthur in a pristine white room and a pristine white shirt where he's talking to a social worker about what he finds funny and his lack of remorse. He then leaves the room, leaving a bloody footprints as he goes with the implication that he murdered the social worker. So, is the movie really happening or not? That insistence on ambiguity in basic mechanical facts of the film frustrates me, but it's not really what takes me onto the other side of the recommendation line.What keeps me there is really the first half of the film. I like the second half a whole lot more than the first, but the first is poorly made and written. I really wish Thomas Wayne had been cut from the movie completely along with the protest movement. I find them both huge distractions to Arthur's smaller story, and focusing on making this a more violent version of The King of Comedy would have worked better, I think. On top of that, scenes feel out of place and out of order. The prime example is the first two scenes. I think the movie originally began with Arthur talking to his original social worker, showcasing his mental state before giving us the scene where Arthur looks sad in a mirror before being jumped by some hoodlums and beaten. It just feels wrong with the order reversed, as it currently is in the film.I wanted to like this film more, but it's first half is just too messy with too much obfuscating the actual story at hand. The second half goes a good way making up for it, but not quite enough.",6,1,9,26 November 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," McTiernan rights the ship
","Well, that's significantly better. Where Die Hard 2 felt like the laziest kind of sequel, Die Hard with a Vengeance feels really fresh in comparison. It's still following a lot of the basic formula from the first film (in particular an antagonist with outwardly terroristic ends but privately greedy ones, McClane operating alone, and English actors pretending to be Germans pretending to be Americans), but there's more to the motions than simply repeating what came before. It's actually a really clever packaging of the formula that makes it feel like it's something different while still delivering a lot of the same beats. That's not to say that it's just a well dressed remake, there's a lot of other fun stuff going on as well. Aside from a few nitpicks, this is really the best of the Die Hard franchise up to this point.One of the things that sets this film apart is simply how clever it is. It starts as one movie for almost an hour and then completely morphs into another, and the change is seamless. John McClane, back to being a New York cop, is on suspension when a bomb blows up a department store in the city. The police receive a call from someone calling himself Simon playing 'Simon Says' and demanding that John McClane perform a series of tasks or more bombs go off around the city, the first of which is to wear a vulgar sign through Harlem that will surely get him killed. In comes Samuel L. Jackson's Zeus, a small business owner who simply doesn't want to see a white man (especially a white cop) get murdered on the streets of Harlem in broad daylight, knowing that it would only invite more white cops into his neighborhood. Attached at the hip because of Simon's insistence, the two spend the rest of the first hour racing across the city to Wall Street in order to get to a payphone, answer it, and prevent another bomb going off, but the timeline is literally impossible. Through some creative driving straight through Central Park, they barely make it but the bomb still goes off.That first hour is really, really well done. We are right there with McClane, navigating the streets of New York as a very credible threat builds up around him. He and Zeus develop a 48 Hrs. type relationship where Bruce Willis and Jackson play really well off of each other's antagonism. It's taut, tight filmmaking.And then, after the bomb in the subway under Wall Street goes off and Simon places a new threat on an unnamed elementary school in the city, New York's finest very believably dedicate as many of their resources as possible to addressing this very credible threat, leaving open Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, and the movie to take a step back and show us Simon for the first time, managing a team to break into the Federal Reserve and its gold to haul away in dump trucks. The movie plays catchup, allowing the audience time to get a feel for Simon as he works his team and occasionally breaks away to taunt the police or McClane again. Hans Gruber from the first film is still a better villain, but Simon Gruber is good on his own, a definite step up from the non-entity that was Colonel Stuart in Die Hard 2.One of the things about movies like this in general is that you need to find excuses for the hero to act alone without simply calling the police or for backup. If he could just do that to help relieve the threat, why doesn't he do that? Well, Die Hard with a Vengeance answered that easily with the elementary school bomb threat, selling the reality of the bombs to both the police and the audience really well, and providing a couple of other extra explanations for why John can't simply call things in. It's a stretch of reality, but the movie sells it well enough so that it never really comes up as a question.All of the pieces propel towards the conclusion filled with great stunts and fun action. My only real problem with the film is some moments of convenience that pop up from time to time to help keep the story moving, like when McClane launches out of an underground aqueduct being flooded, flying fifteen feet up in the air, right next to Zeus who's driving along a road at the same time. The odds of that happening are not good, but hey, the movie needs to keep moving at this point and not slow down for McClane to catch a ride. I'll accept it without too much complaint.It's intelligent and preposterous in equal measure. It takes the time to sell its own reality. It gives space for all three principle characters to play off of each other. Die Hard with a Vengeance feels open and alive and better constructed than any other film in the franchise up to this point. And, hey! They got rid of the idiotic police character who only gets in John's way! I'm quite appreciative of that.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The bulk of the story plays out
","George Lucas has said that when he had asserted that the entire prequel trilogy was planned in the era of the original trilogy, he actually only meant the story captured in Revenge of the Sith. Everything before that was less clear to him, and it feels very obvious in retrospect. The first two prequels were searching for a story with certain thematic elements taking center stage for moments at a time. The third one allows the viewer to look back over the first two films with a new lens to see what Lucas was trying to do far more clearly. The concepts of some of the things he dropped into the first two prequels were intelligently done, but the execution was always faulty. Here, everything comes together (mostly well) to deliver a story built on an idea but also functions as an actual story.There's a very clear destination for the narrative of this third prequel film, the fall of Anakin Skywalker into the identity of Darth Vader. We start at a clear point where Anakin is still a good man of great ability who feels he's being held back while maintaining a secret marriage to Padme. The holding of his own secrets as well as his frustration with his growth as a jedi, which the Council seems to be intentionally holding back, places him in a rather ripe position for temptation. In Chancellor Palpatine, Lucas has created an intelligent voice of seduction that knows just how to prod Anakin in exactly the right way while knowing how to recover from moments where Anakin plays surprisingly strongly to his jedi teachings.Alongside Anakin is Obi-wan, and their relationship is what really drives the emotional arc of the film. At the start, we finally see them as a bickering pair of good friends (only hinted at in Episode II) who respect each other's abilities. Anakin is an inventive pilot while Obi-wan's wisdom gets them out of certain sticky situations. They have a banter that feels quite natural, and to watch Ob-wan powerlessly observe the effects of Palpatine's influence on his young apprentice, the tragedy feels quite real.Structurally, the movie felt a bit random at first, but in retrospect it's actually quite well done. At the start, Anakin and Ob-wan work together to weave their way through a large space battle and rescue Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of the new antagonist General Grievous. After this, the story branches off in three main directions, each led by Anakin, Ob-wan, and Yoda, exploring different aspects of the final stages of the Clone War, but this is all done deliberately in order for Palpatine to get Anakin alone. When the stories begin to snap back together in the final act of the film, it's because everyone is trying to get back to Anakin and prevent the fall. It's actually almost elegant and feels like the result of a lot of thought beforehand (unlike the other prequels which felt quickly cobbled together).The acting is a step above as well. It's not perfect, though. Lucas still isn't an actor's director so he can't get Hayden Christensen to give a consistent performance, but even Christensen gives small moments some power with solid quiet performances. For instance, the scene with Yoda and Anakin talking about Anakin's fears and dreams has Christensen balancing his emotions quite well. Ewan McGregor finally feels comfortable in the role, especially in his interplay with Anakin. Natalie Portman has largely been relegated to supporting player which feels appropriate. Padme is a driver for Anakin's fall, but I think the emotional punch was always going to be Obi-wan's as he watched his apprentice turn to evil. Ian McDiarmid alternates between wonderfully subtle and over-the-top hammy when appropriate. Even Samuel L. Jackson has some life to him this time.The film also simply looks better than the other two. There's moody lighting (like the venetian blind aesthetic in the aforementioned scene between Yoda and Anakin), dynamic camera motions, and it feels like the movie settles far less into the mode of storytelling Lucas had established in the previous prequels where people arrive in rooms to talk. People do arrive in rooms to talk in Episode III, but it's far less prevalent and obvious because there's actual drama unfolding.The way Lucas had envisioned the prequel trilogy to Star Wars didn't have enough story for three movies. He really needed a writing partner to help him through the whole exercise. He gained one on Episode II (a staff writer for The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles), but he really needed a strong creative mind to flesh out his spare plot points into compelling drama for the first two films. The details for Episode III, though, seem to have been germinating in the back of his mind for a very long time. It's much clearer.The thematic thrust of the whole trilogy becomes really clean in the third film. The parallel between the fall of Anakin and the fall of the Republic actually feels natural and prominent in the story as it unfolds. It's explored well as the temptation of the Dark Side and the temptation of totalitarianism becomes tangibly seductive to both Anakin and the Republic. Anakin in order to save his wife of a death he knows will come and the Republic to save itself from perpetual war, the irony being that neither actually happens. Padme still dies and the wars never end. It's actually a rather intelligent approach to the idea.Episode III is easily the strongest of the prequels and the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It doesn't come too close to the artistic heights of the first two of the whole franchise, though, through the continued awkwardness that Lucas can't entirely escape from in terms of dialogue and performance. Smoothing those out would have elevated the picture just a bit more.",8,1,1,17 December 2019
Stalag 17," Clean, classical filmmaking at some of its best
","It's an interesting thing how filmmakers seem to be reacting from one movie to the next. A movie with a certain outlook is followed by another that seems to have another outlook entirely, but because they're both coming from the same filmmaker, they still carry many of the same hallmarks and even core conception of the world. In Billy Wilder's previous film, Ace in the Hole, a cynic destroys several lives in the pursuit of his self-interest. In his next film, the cynical self-interested party ends up the hero because of his cynical self-interest.It's late 1944, the German army is fighting its last great offensive in The Battle of the Bulge, and Stalag 17 is filled with Allied POWs. A barracks of a few dozen American sergeants does what good military men should do and plan on escape. The movie opens with an attempt by two of them. As they're preparing to leave, the ones staying behind start betting about how far they'll get. Some say all the way to Switzerland, other's to at least the lake that borders Germany and the neutral state, but JJ Sefton cynically says that they won't get out of the forest that surrounds the prison camp. Sefton's right, unfortunately, and he takes his winnings of cigarettes and adds them to his large collection of contraband he keeps in a chest.He's set apart from everyone from the opening of the movie, creating a palpable sense of suspicion between him and the rest of the barracks. All of their plans are getting foiled. The two men died, but the Germans also know exactly how it happened, how the two got out of the barracks, and where the tunnel outside the compound started and ended. That feeds into the suspicion against Sefton that he's a mole, giving information to the German guards in exchange for the goodies he's keeping in his chest. But Sefton knows he's not the mole. He tries to fly above the concerns of his fellow prisoners, continuing his rackets (like a telescope that looks into the neighboring Russian female prison, and mouse races) like normal, but he can't tamp down the suspicion and his actions are just making it worse.The movie doesn't completely hinge on the identity of the true mole. We find out the method of the mole's communication at about the half hour point and the mole's real identity at the hour mark. The mystery of the film isn't what drives it's second half, but the tension of how Sefton is going to convince the rest of the barracks that one of the most trusted members of the barracks' leadership is actually the mole. Sefton plays his hand perfectly, and his motive is always selfish. His selfishness accidentally put him into the crosshairs of his bunkmates, and his selfishness is what gets him out of his predicament and out of the camp as a whole.Now, Sefton dominates the plot of the film, but the film as a whole really is an ensemble piece. Sefton's a much smaller part of the overall picture than a plot summary would imply. There's a large cast of characters that provide different types of entertainment, the most prominent being Animal and Shapiro who provide most of the comedic elements in the film, largely centered on Animal's infatuation with Betty Grable. This feeds into the movie's masterful command of tone.It's deceptively hard to move from one tone to another in a film. Going from a comedic scene to a dramatic one too suddenly can create a jarring effect that takes an audience out of the film, but Stalag 17 knows exactly how to glide between them. Lighter moments feed into dangerous moments feed right back into lighter ones like a juggler easily moving from one ball to another.Wilder's command of visual storytelling is on display as well. He has many of the trademarks of some of the great studio directors who knew how to shoot entire scenes exactly the way they were going to end up in the final product (a protective measure he learned very early in his career), so long single shot scenes play out without ever feeling like there needs to be a cut. The reveal of the messaging system to Sefton (which we already know at this point) is so easily and elegantly executed wordlessly.The film as a whole is a great accomplishment by Wilder. It's funny, scary, and tense in equal measure while feeling like a cohesive whole the entire time. It's filled with great performances, looks fantastic, and is such a great entertainment from beginning to end.",10,0,0,26 November 2019
Parasite," Tragedy
","Who is the antagonist? This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself. He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy, and, as I wondered who the antagonist was, I remembered that in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves. Then the answer clicked. The antagonists are the Kims.So, the Kims are a poor family of four, struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life's niceties. In the opening scene, we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom (where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room) to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs. The son, Dong Ik, gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family. Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher/therapist for the younger child, a position driving the patriarch for his father, and the position of housekeeper for his mother. The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot, but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper. And that is where the con takes another level.Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home, creating the impression, when the patriarch finds them, that the driver was having sex with women in his car. He gets let go, replaced by Ki Taek, Dong Ik's father. To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning, since she had been with the house from the house's previous owner. They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper's life-threatening allergy to peach fuzz. The Kims are not good people. They're deceptive, cruel, and dishonest.The Parks, on the other hand, are a mixture of detached, thoughtless, and unfeeling. They're not really good people either. They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear, fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him. They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis.The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces. It's hard to get into how that manifests late in the film (essentially past the halfway point) without digging into spoilers, so I'll speak in generalities. It's the Kim's duplicitousness that gets them into the situation that undoes them. It's their lies that keep them from finding solutions that will actually work. On the other side is the Parks whose thoughtlessness and lack of feeling brought in the destructive force into their homes to begin with. There are no heroes or villains in this story, only flawed people who can't grow.The movie is filled with imagery as well. From the scholar's rock that Dong Ik carries around, meant as a symbol for wealth, to the constant vertical motion of the characters. There's a large sequence where a torrential downpour hits the city and the Kims, after having been trapped in the Park's house because of their presumption that the richer family would be out of town all night, run down the hills of Seoul to their half-underground dwelling that's been filled with water, the toilet spewing a black substance because of the messed up pressure. The Kims left their window open that allowed the water in. Would they have left it open if they hadn't spent the night at the Parks' residence? The rain isn't the fault of either the Parks or the Kims, but it affects both families very differently. Atop their hill in their mansion, the Parks simply watch it from their window, appreciating the aesthetics. The Kims get wiped out and end up abandoning their home to sleep on the floor of a local gym along with the others who were displaced.It's an interesting and highly entertaining look into the class differences present in South Korea. It's alternatively extremely funny, horrifying, and even touching. It can be all three in seconds, and it ends up working because the tone never really jumps. It's evenly and expertly filmed with an eye towards black comedy and tragedy mixed into one package.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Prometheus," I don't care what you say, this movie is great.
","Out of all the opinions I've expressed about film, my love of Ridley Scott's Prometheus is probably the one that I receive the most grief over, and I do not care. I've seen this movie seven times now, and I love it as much after the seventh viewing as I do after the first. This movie is great.It's about searching for truth and the nature of faith. I think it meshes well with the ideas behind Close Encounters of the Third Kind, though they would make an odd double feature being so different in style and tone. Any actual answers that the movie offers (which are few) are beside the point. The point isn't the answers themselves, but the searching for them is what is important.The crew of the eponymous Prometheus is travelling trillions of miles into deep space chasing a series of cave drawings that seem to be an invitation to the home of the Engineers, giant beings who may have had a hand in the creation of human life. Funded by Peter Weyland, a man who speaks to the crew in the form of a hologram message, the ship is out with the mission to find the answers to our existence. Why do we exist? To what purpose were we created? These existential questions are woven into the fabric of the whole movie. Elizabeth Shaw, the main character, is looking for the same answers to the same questions but from a different point of view. She comes at it from a point of faith. Her boyfriend, Charlie, is a man of the moment with little concern for the metaphysical. Vickers, the company woman in charge of the mission, has no concern for the questions at hand.What drives the movie and the characters within it is the question of what do you do when you receive an answer? At the sight of the Engineers' fate under mysterious circumstances, Charlie instantly gives up. He keeps hoping for something, but he sees the Engineers' end as an end to the question. Vickers is simply relieved and hopes to go back home, her immediate question answered. Shaw, though, is invigorated. She doesn't see the Engineers' dead bodies as an end, but as just the next step in her journey. She's invigorated by the search itself. Even much later, after everything has broken down, Shaw's been through massive trauma and an improvised surgery, she's still demanding further answers.It's the contrast between Shaw and Weyland that really works for me. Weyland (hidden away on the ship in his own separate cryo-tube) comes out and demands answers not for his own edification, but in an attempt to extend his own life. Shaw wants answers from the same source, but it's more in line with a scientific inquiry. That she is the most religious of the scientists there provides an interesting juxtaposition that one might not expect. Taking the actions of the film on a moralistic vein, everyone is punished for how they approach the search for truth, but only Elizabeth Shaw is spared. Everyone else thinks the answer is the point, but only Shaw realizes the journey itself is the point.This movie, though, isn't a drama, it's a horror film, and I feel that the horror ties into the central ideas rather well. The literal source of horror is the weapons the Engineers created, but the weapon seems to follow no logic, only producing destruction and aggression in its wake. I think that's the point, though. The Engineers created a weapon they couldn't control (with an implication that they created humanity and they couldn't control us either) and it wiped them out. The characters' search for answers will never get answered in the same way that the weapon will never provide an easy answer to its methods. The purpose is the aggression and unpredictability, not its final form. The audience and the characters never know what's going to come next just like the answers to the questions are never going to come, only leading to more questions.Visually, I think this might be Ridley Scott's best looking film. I love the look of Alien, the recreation of ancient Rome in Gladiator, and the general gorgeousness of Exodus: Gods and Kings, but it's the alien landscape, the green/blue color scheme, the overall gritty feel, and the huge sets that sell this movie so completely for me on a visual level. I think Scott's one of the premiere visualists currently working, but everything gels here in one package that I just adore.The movie overall is visceral and thematically weighty. It's a thrilling ride into interesting questions that are designed to have no answers with a horror element that ties in with the ideas at play. I love this movie.",10,6,9,26 November 2019
Paths of Glory," Okay,...This kid from New York has real talent.
","This is Stanley Kubrick's first great film, and it has the kind of emotional punch that many find sorely missing from his overall oeuvre. Dealing with themes that Kubrick would explore for the rest of his career, Paths of Glory is one of the great anti-war movies.It seems like there's an unwritten rule that if you want to make a movie about war as a necessary and even noble thing you make it about World War II, and if you want to make a movie about how war is a waste of life without any redeeming value you make a movie about World War I. Hell, even The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles had an episode about the awfulness of war set in the trenches. And the setting is a perfect place for a testament to war's complete wastefulness. It was a conflict marked by trench warfare, exchanging thousands of lives in pitched but completely meaningless battles that decided nothing while completely destroying the verdant countryside of France and Germany.In an undefined sector of the front, General Broulard visits his subordinate General Mireau and tells him that Mireau must attack the fortified German position the Anthill in two days. Mireau scoffs at the idea, noting the recent action his sector had just been involved in and the strength of the German position. Broulard, though, dangles a promotion out in front of him and Mireau immediately changes tune. Yes, attacking and holding the Anthill is not only possible, it's obviously something that his 7,000 men can accomplish.The attack goes out under the direct command of Colonel Dax who does his best to make the insane orders he's received work. In the middle of the attack, he even retreats to the trenches to try and coax the right flank to emerge from the trenches, which they have failed to do up to that point, right as the attack falls apart completely. At the height of his frustration Mireau even orders his artillery commander to attack the French right flank but the artillery commander won't do it without a written order from Mireau, which he never receives.In the face of such a complete farce of a defeat, Mireau wants blood from his own men. Broulard, understanding and conciliatory, talks Mireau down from 100 men to face the firing squad to three. Dax is horrified at the news and becomes the three men's counsel at their court martial. He gives a vigorous defense, but it's obvious that the fix is in and there's nothing he can do to prevent the executions. In a last gasp effort, Dax learns of Mireau's order to attack the French troops hiding in the trenches and tries to use that knowledge to convince Broulard to drop the whole matter. It doesn't work, the executions go forward, but Mireau is put up at a board of inquiry and Broulard offers Dax Mireau's command. Dax is horrified at the prospect and tells Broulard off. He wasn't trying to defend the men and undermine Mireau for his career. He was trying to save three men he considered innocent victims of a military bureaucracy that had become blind to his mission and responsibility to the men it served.This move is just fantastic. Dax is a great protagonist, played commandingly by Kirk Douglas. He's smart, understanding, and willing to stick a knife in when he needs to. Mireau is the perfect kind of antagonist with a purely bureaucratic mindset looking no further than the advancement of his own career. The three men are strong, and Lieutenant Roget, who volunteered one of the three and whom Dax orders to carry out the executions, is a marvelously realized weasel of a man.The movie looks amazing as well. Filmed in black and white, the trenches feel wonderfully grungy and filthy which contrast beautifully with the gorgeous German mansion that operates at the French military command's headquarters. The juxtaposition between the men at the front and their commanders is so stark that it cannot be missed. The failed attack on the Anthill (a name I love as it implies the target's immense unimportance in the grand scheme of life and the war) is gorgeously filmed. Largely made of steady tracking shots that follow the advance along with the troops, no man's land is all filth, mud, craters, and barbed wire. It feels like we're in the advance with them and only breaks when Dax himself stops advancing.The film is so rich and yet only 88-minutes long. The final scene where the young German girl sings to the French soldiers, quieting their rowdiness with her tearful old song, shows the friends and fellow soldiers to the three sacrificed men in their most disarmed and innocent states. It's a temporary reprieve for them before they are sent back to the meat grinder where they will once again become subject to the whims of the French military command. It's perhaps their final moment of humanity.One final note: I love how no one speaks with an affected French accent in this film. Everyone speaks plainly with their American (or, in one case, British) accents. I'm not one to nitpick about bad accents, but I think this approach is the most correct to take. If we're going to follow French soldiers speaking English, then they should sound like English speakers not French speakers speaking English. I've imagined a movie where the main characters are French played by Americans who then encounter American characters who speak French. I've found the idea amusing, at least.",10,0,0,26 November 2019
Marriage Story," Inspired by Bergman, but very much it's own success
","Even before Noah Baumbach showed us the article with Nicole and Charlie titled 'Scenes from a Marriage', the movie screamed of influences to Bergman to me. The main characters are a theater director and an actress (like in After the Rehearsal). There are shots that evoke Persona. And the basic story feels like stuff that happens between episode 3 and 4 of the Swedish television series. The actual divorce in Bergman's film is largely glossed over, skipping from the admission of infidelity to the final fight that leads to signing of the divorce papers, but it's the sole focus of Baumbach's film. Aside from all the Bergman influences, though, this is a very good film.The movie uses a framing device that works incredibly well. The first ten minutes of the movie are two letters written by each of the main characters that details how they love the other, however they were written at the behest of a mediator for their divorce, trying to establish a ground floor of emotional contrast from their current situation. The problem is that the letters never get read. Nicole hates what she wrote, but Charlie is open to reading it. Yet Nicole barges out of the office before anything can be read, her rage at the very exercise.She has good reason to be angry, having discovered that Charlie had a brief affair recently while he was also unhelpful in moving them from New York to Los Angeles where she wanted to get into television work. He, though, almost single-handedly made her a serious actress after bringing her onto his theater troupe after her one big credit of 'girl who takes her top off' in a teen sex comedy, while she also hasn't had sex with him in a year. Let's just say, the situation is really messy.The mediator was their effort to settle the divorce without lawyers, but everything goes sideways when Nicole moves her and their son to Los Angeles and she hires a high-priced divorce attorney. Suddenly even the question of whether the family is based on New York or Los Angeles comes into question, a turn of events that Charlie simply can't believe. He's behind the ball, trying to play catchup on California divorce law and get a lawyer while suddenly needing to establish a residence in Los Angeles.The process is the punishment in this film, and both Nicole and Charlie get punished (with heavy implications that this is the fault of the lawyers). They end up dragging each other through the mud with the central point being custody of their son. Charlie is shocked at how easily Henry adapts to his new life in Los Angeles while expressing nothing but disdain for his former life in New York. Charlie does everything he can to try and reconnect with the child he suddenly finds that he's on the verge of losing, all to little avail.The movie is at its absolute height, though, when Nicole and Charlie fight. There's so much hidden anger within the relationship that comes out in that famous fight where Charlie beats a hole in the wall. The scene really hinges on the acting talents of Black Widow and Kylo Ren, and both Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver rise to the occasion, delivering blistering performances of pure unadulterated rage. It's a marvel to behold.The messiness of life ends up sorting itself out and a truce of a sort ends up falling into place. It's a messy end to a messy story, but the journey is harrowing and sad. The ending of the framework comes when Charlie finds Nicole's letter from the beginning of the film. These were two people who did love each other, who got a lot from each other in their relationship, and who not only decided to split but who also let their acrimony against the other determine the course of the divorce, damaging both of them in the process. The portrait is incredibly compelling and a wonderful look into an ugly process that never seems to have a winner.",9,8,11,17 January 2020
Black Panther," Frustrating
","Expository dialogue from beginning to end, coincidence to make James Fennimore Cooper blush, an incoherent structure, a laughably small timeframe for the story, really dodgy special effects, incoherent world building, and a pretty decent bad guy make for a bad film overall.Ryan Coogler took the situation the Russos made in Civil War, T'challa being the Black Panther, and added so much unnecessary complexity to the situation. For some reason, he tied being the Black Panther to being King of Wakanda, even though it's obviously not necessary. Throwing in a requirement that T'challa lose his Panther powers for a fight to the death with anyone who wants to challenge him to take the throne made sense in the wake of that decision overall (because of how the second one plays out), but it creates massive structural and logic problems on top of it. Is this really how the country's next leader is decided? Whomever can kill the other in ritualized combat? And, there's a drug that can give you super powers and another that can immediately take them away? It's the kind of stupid you might expect from a comic book movie, but the powers are given and taken so easily and frequently within this individual film as to make the meaning of them smaller than intended.So, T'Challa comes back from Europe after Civil War and has to become king and the Black Panther for real. He fights off a challenge from the fifth tribe in Wakanda who hasn't been seen in hundreds of years and secures his throne. Meanwhile, they've received notice of Klauwe, a South African arms dealer who stole a bunch of their precious metal vibranium from them decades ago and killed a bunch of people in the process, including the father of __, who leads one of the five tribes of Wakanda and leads the military. T'Challa goes to South Korea to intercept Klauwe, fails when the antagonist Killmonger gets him first and kills him in a way that leads to everyone else dying. Killmonger than takes Klauwe's body into Wakanda and immediately and coincidentally finds the one person in the whole country with both the inclination to listen to Killmonger at the sight of Klauwe's body and the authority to back him if he should decide to challenge T'Challa.Killmonger challenges T'Challa to the throne, wins by throwing T'Challa over the waterfall without ensuring that the one guy who could prevent him from keeping the crown is actually dead, and starts an imperialistic program that will see Wakanda forcefully take over other countries because they don't align with his values. T'Challa is, of course, not dead, gets resuscitated and re-powered with the magic plant that gives him Black Panther powers before challenging Killmonger to a second fight which blows the whole country into its own civil war. Oh, and Killmonger had shown up less than twenty-four hours before.This movie is a complete mess. The biggest issue is that the story itself really doesn't start until an hour in when Killmonger shows up in Wakanda. Everything up to that point are subplots that don't really matter. The first half hour deals with world building around a utopia with incomprehensible customs around government and an action scene that doesn't really matter because T'Challa was effectively king before and is king afterwards. Hell, based on Civil War, I assumed that T'Challa was already king because he said so in that movie. Klauwe is an excuse to get an action scene in Seoul. Since Killmonger just shows up with Klauwe's body, the whole action scene didn't actually affect the story in any meaningful way. Once Killmonger gets there, we get a sense of a central conflict, but the conflict of visions isn't built dramatically. It's just people explaining their believes to each other in expository dialogue. Killmonger, while a pretty good villain considering his competition of antagonists in the Marvel Universe, is more of a hodgepodge of motives that never really get straightened out. He's out for revenge and to make Wakanda an imperialistic power imposing its views on the world. Fine, but his motives for his actual actions seem more driven by the mere revenge and the stuff about imperialism is a coating on his motives. It doesn't feel like the motives were ironed out particularly well.In the end, I find this a confusing slog of a film. The final fight gets ridiculous, not because it has war rhinos (which are kinda cool in a superficial way), but because of the short timeframe that the whole story has taken place. This great jewel of the world, hidden away because of its awesomeness, was thrown into complete chaos within a twenty-four hour period and only resolved because one guy got stabbed in the heart. I mean, there's disruptive and then there's a utopia that's never had its power structure challenged in the least way, undermining its status as a utopia. It also looks rather bland. There are bright colors in terms of costumes, but outside of that the movie leans much more heavily towards the visual aesthetic of Captain America than Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok. Things look kind of blandly typical in Wakanda with science that has a visual texture that feels a whole lot like Tony Stark's tech that undermines the idea that Wakanda's science is all that advanced. It could have done better with a bigger embrace of the outlandish, though the waterfalls and costumes do provide some visual flair in an otherwise bland soup.",4,2,4,26 November 2019
Iron Man," A charming lead helps to overcome some pretty large narrative deficiencies
","I know what Tony Stark's character arc is supposed to be in this movie. I do not know what it actually is, though.Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer who works on contracts from the United States government. He starts the movie finishing a large sale for a new missile called the Jericho. It produces its large explosions, the military is happy, and Tony makes his sale. His convoy is quickly beset by terrorist forces, Stark is captured, and the terrorists force him to produce a Jericho missile for them in a cave with some leftover Stark weapons they have sitting around. The idea that they have the right materials for a new weapon system from older weapons is a bit ridiculous, but it's probably not quite as ridiculous as the idea that these same weapons have the parts to create a state of the art, miniature, perpetual source of energy that fits into a slot in Tony's chest. But hey, it's a techno-fantasy. Let's just roll with it.Tony produces a suit of armor instead because his captors are idiots who can't tell the difference between a chest plate and a missile casing. With the help of a kindly local doctor who speaks every language the plot requires of him, Tony escapes. It helps that the doctor has the perfect mix of wanting to live long enough to help Tony and wanting to die to join his family in death so he throws his life away to help Tony escape.Tony returns home where he immediately holds a press conference and declares that Stark Industries will never produce weapons again. Everyone freaks out, but then everyone forgets about it about twenty minutes later when Tony just never shows up to work in order to ensure that his radical orders get carried out. Instead, he stays in his mansion over a cliff looking out at the ocean and plays with his toys. That is, he upgrades his cave suit for the 21st century and gives himself a new miraculous source of eternal energy for his chest (ordering the old one, which could conceivably power a house for some time, to be thrown out).Okay, so let's take a step back and try to figure out what Tony's arc is. He starts the movie as a playboy arms dealer. He gets captured and realizes that his weapons are being sold to terrorists. He gets home and starts the process (without ever following up) to end all weapons manufacture in his company. He then proceeds to build his own weapon in the form of a high-tech suit which he then uses to kill a bunch of people, protecting some family we've never met before. So, what's the arc? He almost grows and then doesn't? He starts as a playboy and ends as a...murderous playboy? Yeah, he protects people, so I guess that's it, using his tools for good instead of just not paying attention to who uses them. It's confused and thin.Oh, and let's get to the antagonist of the film, Obadiah Stane. Stane makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are really two parts to his villainy, so let's take it one at a time. The first part occurs before the action of the movie. He arranges for Tony to be kidnapped and murdered by the terrorists before Tony ever leaves. Why? The closest we get is that Tony doesn't take the business side of things seriously. He doesn't show up to an awards ceremony. I mean, I guess that's good enough reason to murder the CEO and lifelong friend. The second part of the characters villainy occurs after Tony returns from the caves. Obviously, Stane isn't going to like the idea of Stark shutting down a major division of the company, but he actually ends up ensuring that the steps Tony wants to happen never happen. There's a shock to the system (highlighted by talk of the company's stock price dropping), but once Tony's in his little lab working (for supposedly weeks), things seem to be going on as normal at Stark Industries. So, of course Stane recreates Tony's original suit in a larger form and goes on a kill crazy rampage which only Tony can stop.Stane has bugged me since I first saw this movie in 2008, and I just can't shake the fact that there must be at least ten minutes of deleted scenes explaining a lot of this. But whether they're on a home video release as extras or not, all that matters is what's in the movie itself, and the movie chose to make Stane completely nonsensical (probably for 'pacing' reasons).Alright, I've ragged on this movie enough. I'm far from hating it. The action is good. Robert Downey Jr. is fun as Stark and carries most of the movie despite my problems with Tony's arc. It looks good in a clean and straightforward sort of way. The music is functionally complimentary to the action on screen. If you ignore the fact that none of the characters do anything that makes a lick of sense, it's actually fairly entertaining when it's not being overly serious. I remember liking this movie a whole lot more in 2008 than now, though I never loved it like many people do. Eleven years later, rewatching it for the first time in about a decade, I have to say that I was actually really disappointed in it overall.",6,2,3,25 November 2019
Mother!," Thin tripe that's not nearly as smart as it thinks it is.
","'Do you get it?!'
-American treasure, the well-groomed Jay BaumanI despise this movie, and it's not because it's vehemently anti-Catholic and misanthropic.No, I hate this movie because it's terrible.Finishing the movie, I perused the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, reading positive and negative alike. The common themes from the positive were: 'bold', 'thought provoking', and 'engrossing'. The common themes from the negative were: 'poor plot', 'ugly', and 'misogynistic'.I think the positive reviews are hilariously wrong, and the negative reviews are a bit misguided.In storytelling there is always a battle between the subtext and the text itself, that is, between the 'meaning', 'point', or theme against the story itself. The fun of a movie with rich subtext is digging through the text to uncover meaning. mother! is nothing but subtext. There is no text on top. It's just a series of images and symbols to interpret. Even the characters are mere symbols (God, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, etc.). That's probably the primary reason the movie received an F Cinemascore. There's no story for normal audiences to latch onto. Instead, they get a steady stream of metaphors and a final thirty minutes of blood and guts untied to anything an audience will care about.Watching this at the tail end of my Bergman quest (at this writing, having seen 37 of the 39 on the Criterion set) is interesting. Bergman's movies are often full of symbols and imagery, but they are tied to characters that feel exceedingly real in stories that make literal sense.Darren Aronofsky, instead, decided to make a movie where nothing made any literal sense. And the movie just seems to create holes all over the place. Abel dies, and a couple of hours later there's a wake in the house. Mother gets pregnant, and it feels like she reaches full term in an afternoon ('It moved!' she cries in the ninth month as though she's missed the past four to five months of pregnancy). God finishes the New Testament right then. Mother reads it, but publisher has already read it?I often say that it's the audience's responsibility to have a second side of a conversation with filmmakers. To figure out what the filmmakers are trying to do and say and engage with them on the filmmaker's chosen level, not the audience's preferred level.So, okay. Aronofsky doesn't want to tell a literal story. He wants to make some kind of metaphorical and experimental film. Does it work?Nope. Not in the least. So, we don't have characters. We just have a series of symbols that walk and talk. Is it difficult to discern what they mean? No. It's incredibly simple. It's obvious from the moment they walk onto the screen. Does the audience need to try at all to figure out what Aronofsky is saying? No, it's there on screen without any effort. Hey! It's Adam and Eve! Hey! It's Cain and Abel! Hey! It's the flood! Hey! It's the Bible! Hey! It's religion! Hey! It's humanity polluting the planet!I've never been the biggest fan of Aronofsky. I once called him a crazy person who can barely shoot a scene. However, he does have a certain verve and daring which is nice. People seem to confuse daring with talent, though. Just because a movie is daring doesn't mean that it succeeds. I don't even think performances are any good.Jennifer Lawrence spends half the movie as a passive naif and the other half screaming. Javier Bardem is so disassociated from the action at hand that he never actually builds a character (not like Aronofsky wrote him a character to begin with). None of the other characters are around enough to actually form a feeling at all. The closest is Ed Harris as Adam...I mean Man, but he's one-note.The movie's also really dark. Not tonally (well, I guess it is), but visually. It gets really hard to see what's actually happening on screen.I found literally nothing to recommend about the film. There's no story because the movie's all metaphor. The metaphor is thin, obvious, and uninteresting. The final act is unmoored from any emotion so the shock is threadbare. It's poorly acted. It's ugly to look at. It's aggressive in its simplistic nature.",1,3,5,25 November 2019
Casino Royale," The Reboot the Franchise sorely needed
","I don't think the Bond franchise needed a reboot after Licence to Kill with Goldeneye, but it definitely needed one after Die Another Day with Casino Royale. The franchise had devolved into silly setups with mishmashed storytelling while contrasting horribly with the central take on the character. It needed to step back and re-evaluate how to tell Bond stories. The Bond franchise has almost always been a follower of fashions rather than a leader, so it followed the Batman Begins formula, providing audiences with a down to earth re-appraisal of the beginnings of the central character after an outlandish take that had lost complete sight of that character. It pulls it off really well.In my eyes, Bond really stopped being a character with Diamonds are Forever. Connery's last outing and Moore's entire run were built around Bond as an archetype through which to have an adventure rather than a character with motives. Dalton brought us closer, and Brosnan further from that ideal, but with Daniel Craig's first Bond adventure, we have the first Bond film that treats 007 as a real person in more than 30 years. Using his first foray into the spy world as a 00 agent is a smart move, and using Ian Fleming's first published story about the character helped as well.The opening pre-credits sequence announces to the world that this is a very different take on Bond. The black and white photography (that doesn't really look like it was filmed that way, but converted later) and the gritty hand to hand combat in a bathroom are a different universe from space lasers and invisible cars. With his 00 status firmly in hand, Bond sets out on his (now color) first mission to investigate a terrorist money operation, starting in Madagascar and a bomb maker. The action scene that follows is great, but it left me with a thought.I sometimes talk about sequences that could be hard cut out of films without really noticing, and the part of the action scene in the construction site is one of those. It'd be easy to simply cut it out without noticing it from a story perspective, but I'd never recommend it. Why not? Well, it's actually fun, and it also demonstrates this Bond's approach to his job. The bomb maker he's chasing is an expert in Parkour, jumping around and over things while flying through others almost balletically while Bond crashes through (once time literally through a wall), keeping up his momentum by making his own straight lines in contrast to the bomb maker's more elegant paths. It's a fun scene that adds little in terms of plot, highlights our central character's approach to his job, and is exciting to boot.Anyway, the money operation is run by a man named Le Chiffre who has a dead, and occasionally bleeding, left eye. He bets all of his terrorist money on the shorting of the stock of an airline, planning on blowing up their new prototype airliner and sinking their stock, but Bond follows the trail from the bombmaker he takes care of in Madagascar to foil the plan (in another really well executed action scene at Miami's airport), wiping out Le Chiffre's holdings. In an effort to rebuild the fortune he lost (the money held by some of the world's worst terrorists), he sets up a high stakes card game in Montenegro at the eponymous Casino Royale. Being the agency's best poker player, M sends Bond to play in the game.Getting to Montenegro, we get introduced to the other great triumph of this film, Vesper Lynd, the money and Bond's love interest in the film. There have been several times in the franchise that they've tried to replicate the success of Bond's relationship to the Countess Tracy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, from Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me to the inversion Elektra in The World is Not Enough, but none of them have succeeded for different reasons. Vesper is the first to do so, and it's because the movie is actually taking its characters seriously. Bond feels like a real man, and Vesper feels like a real woman. They have chemistry. They bicker in playful ways. Their relationship feels natural, and the movie actually dedicates time to it.There's a moment, about halfway through the adventure in Montenegro, where Bond kills some African terrorists in front of Lynd, and she's completely shaken up by the sight. She's an accountant, not a secret agent, and she'd never had to see anything like that. That the movie actually treats her seriously like that is a testament, but that Bond actually reaches out to her, sitting down next to her fully clothed in the shower just to hold her, is a testament to how good the work on the characters is in this movie. Bond's self-imposed armor against attachment and women is coming down as he watches this frail, attractive woman undone by the world that he lives in.I will say this, though, I hate that they used Texas Hold 'Em as the card game. I understand why they did it. It's much more popular and more people understand the rules than Baccarat, but Texas Hold 'Em is far too American for a Euro-centric spy story about James Bond. The final hand where everyone has some great combination of cards is ridiculous and outside the realm of the grounded realism of the film. But what would a poker tournament in a movie be if the final hand was won by a low pair on a bluff, I guess.Anyway, Bond wins, Le Chiffre loses, and Bond gets captured. It's the point in the film where Moore would have been placed in an easily escapable death trap. Instead, Bond gets tied to a chair and Le Chiffre pulverizes his testicles, only saved by the men that Le Chiffre answers to exacting their revenge on him. This is another moment to talk about Diamonds are Forever. I criticized that film because Bond got saved from a certain death situation, but the problem there was that it felt completely random. The world around Le Chiffre, the shadowy Mr. White, the constant threats of violence from his creditors, and the later revelations, make this escape where Bond does nothing feels much more interesting and satisfying. It's not that Bond didn't do anything to escape, it's that the situation of his escape makes more sense and feels natural.The movie then fakes out the audience with an unexpected ending where Bond and Vesper run off to Venice where they promise to leave their lives behind and find honest jobs just so long as they are together, but this adventure isn't done. There are double crosses and foot chases and Vesper drowns, leaving Bond cold and angry in response. His defense is back up, and it will never come down.As the Batman Begins style re-evaluation of the creation of an iconic character, it's smartly done. As a Bond adventure, it's exciting. As a grounded spy tale, it's fun. This is a very good Bond film, and exactly what the franchise needed.",8,1,4,10 March 2020
Beowulf," A compelling dramatization of a thesis paper, not a poem
","In the original epic poem, why does Beowulf come back from defeating Grendel's mother carrying Grendel's head? It's an interesting question that has fired literary critics imaginations for a while, and when Robert Zemeckis set out to make his big screen adaptation of the poem, he went beyond merely adapting the text itself. Instead, he took those questions that critics had considered and ran with them dramatically.So, what we end up having isn't so much an adaptation of Beowulf, but an adaptation of a master's thesis on Beowulf.The movie received mixed to positive reviews when it came out. A lot of the negativity seemed connected to the movie's visual style. Expanding what he had done on The Polar Express, Zemeckis used motion capture and computer animation to get realistic-ish looking characters. The problem is that the characters exact right in the middle of the Uncanny Valley. They are too real to treat as cartoons, but not real enough to convince the mind that they are real, so there's a natural barrier that's created because the brain knows it's not real despite a somewhat realistic looking appearance. I was more okay with the look of the film upon its initial release, but less so now.I understand, though, why Zemeckis was enamored with the technique. The freedom as a filmmaker to build the environments he wanted and place the camera wherever he wanted must have been quite enticing. The problem was the effort at getting photo-realistic effects, which end up falling short. A more cartoonish look might have been less jarring for the audience.Moving on, though, the movie's approach to the material, as implied, is really smart. It's not just a monster movie, but an exploration of bravery, heroism, and the costs of power. It takes a different approach than the original poem, but that's fine by me. The seduction of power, and the literal seduction of Grendel's mother, is an interesting approach to take, and I think it works really well. Beowulf must sell his soul to achieve power, but when the bill comes due he doesn't lay down like Hrothgar did. He fights. He reclaims his honor and sense of bravery by having a spectacle infused fight with a dragon. It's a sop to modern movie convention, but it's still fun on its own while refusing to undermine the basic point of the story.Performances, which you mainly need to judge by voices since the faces do have a plastic-like feel that they movie can't escape, are very good. I can see why Zemeckis wanted to cast Ray Winstone as Beowulf because he carries a gravelly voice that matches the vision of the character perfectly, but Winstone is, at the same time, not a body builder with 8 pack abs. Brendan Gleeson is wonderful as Wiglaf, the sad advisor, Anthony Hopkins is wise, sad, and guilt-ridden as Hrothgar, and Angelina Jolie is pure seduction as Grendel's mother. Special nod to Crispin Glover as Grendel, speaking Old English and evoking quite a bit of emotion as a monstrous creature with inside out ears.",7,0,0,22 November 2019
Son of Saul," One of the great Holocaust movies
","Well, that was cheery.Alright, it's hard to imagine many Holocaust movies being fun, but this one so effectively creates the subjective reality of one man's need to do one thing right in the middle of a near literal Hell on Earth. Every piece of the film is designed to enhance the audience's immersion into this world, and it's almost entirely done in closeup without seeing much of the horrors of the death camp directly.In Nazi death camps there were a group of prisoners called the Sonderkommando who helped guide the new prisoners in, disrobed them, piled up their possessions, cleaned the gas chambers, and helped feed the fires of the crematoriums. Saul, our main character, is one of the Sonderkommando, and the way the director, László Nemes, the first time Hungarian director, choses to follow him is kind of brilliant. As I wrote, nearly the whole film is done in close up with a very shallow depth of focus. We follow Saul, often from the back, only barely able to discern the bodies, mud, and death that surrounds him, but it implies how Saul survives in his day to day life. He can't focus on the people he's helping to marshal into the gas chambers. He's inward facing, just doing what he has to do in order to avoid the gas chamber himself. The film sells that to the audience through that shallow depth of field so that we know what's going on, but we're not focusing on it. It's such a great way to film the particular story.Saul, as he says late in the film, doesn't consider him or any of the other Sonderkommando to be alive. They're already dead, but something changes within him when he sees a small boy survive the gas chamber only to be suffocated by the Nazi doctor. Saul clings to this boy's body, begging the prisoner doctor to help him preserve the body from the furnace so that he can bury it properly. The movie is Saul's day and a half long quest to find a rabbi to say the Kaddish and give this boy a proper burial (which is apparently not necessary for a proper Jewish burial, but what matters is Saul's quest to make it happen, not the specifics of the ritual). He goes from rabbi to rabbi in the camp among the Sonderkommando, all of whom are hiding their status as rabbi out of fear of the Nazis. When Saul approaches one he doesn't know, the rabbi, realizing that others know he's a rabbi, immediately tries to drown himself.And why go through all of this? As Saul does this, the other Sonderkommando are planning an insurrection against the Nazi prison guards, a plan that Saul gets forced into contributing to when he retrieves gunpowder from one of the women sorting through the possessions of the victims of the gas chambers. Should he be concerned with the burial of a boy already dead or more concerned with helping his fellow living Jews find a way to survive? As he says, he thinks they're all already dead, so he wants to do one thing right. I don't think the movie has a real answer for which way he should have gone because Saul isn't following the correct procedure for the burial on the one hand and the insurrection has little to no chance of any sort of success on the other. He's in the middle of Hell with no good choices, and he chooses to do one small thing he can do.One thread that runs through the film is that Saul calls the boy his son. I didn't think that the boy was his son at all, but reading up on the film afterwards I saw that early drafts of the film (which don't count, only the final product counts) made it explicit that it actually was his son. I prefer the reading that the boy is just some boy and that Saul desperately needs to do something good before the Nazis liquidate the current crop of Sonderkommando and he loses all chance of doing anything right again. So, while Saul insists to his fellow Sonderkommando that the boy is his son, no one believes him and the movie never gives a solid answer. I chose my interpretation there.This movie is harsh and ugly in all the best ways. It puts the audience right in the middle of the reality of the death camps without ever breaking from its method for aesthetic or plot reasons. The central performance by Géza Röhrig is understated, haunting, and perfect for the part of Saul. I loved this film. It is one of the great Holocaust films.",10,0,1,18 May 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," Unpopular movie opinion: Live Free or Die Hard is the best Die Hard movie.
","It's the only one that makes a series attempt at a thematic point. It's not about some deep relationship between the viewer and the world, or even the viewer and movies, but about the change in the nature of action in action movies over the decades since the original Die Hard. It also has the best villain since Hans Gruber going for it.Some hackers have delivered code to a shadowy organization and then started getting killed off one by one. John McClane, for slightly unclear reasons, is sent to New Jersey to pick up Matt Farrell, one of the hackers on the FBI's list, for questioning. So begins John McClane's next foray into combatting terrorism and thievery, and I think it's the smartest of his adventures. It really begins with the introduction to Farrell for McClane. It's pretty typical generational stuff with the old man who doesn't get all the young person stuff that Farrell spouts out of his smart mouth. That's not the interesting part. What quickly manifests is the fight that breaks out between the terrorists out to kill Farrell and McClane.As Thomas Gabriel says later in the film, McLane is a 'Timex watch in a digital age.' He's outmoded, and that extends into a meta commentary about the nature of action movies. McClane is a punch and shoot type of action hero. He doesn't do acrobatics, but in the 2000s, that's the sort of thing that was dominating action movies thanks to things like The Matrix, parkour, and some French imports. This wasn't the age for John McClane's brand of action, and yet here he is in a film in that time period. Do the filmmakers treat it as a throwback to another time? No, they bring the creaky old McClane into that era and have him fight that era itself. The French unit sent by Gabriel has a freerunner who uses motion to get where he needs to go, and McClane needs to figure out how to deal with it.The visual nature of the conflict is at its height, though, during the chase through D.C. McClane has taken Farrell to the FBI who then redirect them to the NSA for questioning. As they progress through the city, Gabriel sends his helicopter of French mercenaries after John and Farrell in the car below. So, it's McClane, using tools he can only access from the ground, fighting the representation of the new style of action movies that use a helicopter and never come to the ground. McClane uses the car to overturn a fire hydrant that shoots water into the sky, knocking one of the mercenaries out of the helicopter. At the end of the chase, McClane uses the actual car to take the helicopter out of the sky. He's using the tools on the ground to take out the new antagonists in the sky. I love that.The other major thing that I love about this movie is Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel. Gabriel is a really good bad guy. He's got a strong motive. He warned the Joint Cheifs of America's openness to attack on the digital front, they destroyed him for it when he tried to go around their backs. So, he's there to make his point (with promises that he could fix everything that he broke), but also to enrich himself, all stemming from his sense of bruised ego, actual harm, and sense of righteous anger. On top of that, the way Olyphant plays him is great. Gabriel is completely in control, reminiscent of Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, and alternatively sardonic and threatening when those around him screw up.I really like the rest of the cast. Bruce Willis is somewhere between trying and giving up, but he still manages to make the role work. Justin Long is fine as Farrell. It's Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane that stands out for me. She's strong and pig headed, just like her father, and when she gets re-introduced late in the movie, the way she fights back against Gabriel instead of playing the helpless victim is great.The action is well filmed and actually carries a point beyond the mayhem. The acting is quite good, especially from Winstead and Olyphant. The antagonist has very solid motivations and his plan is both large scale and understandable (if, like most movies about computers, it overstates what computers can do). This really is the most complete package of a Die Hard film.",8,0,1,2 June 2020
Thor: The Dark World," There's no color left, nor fun
","They took all that was good of Thor, sapped all of the color out of it, clothed it in darkness, and grounded it in a more recognizable reality. That process made it so much more boring.Gone are the operatic tones and performances. Gone are scenes of father and son yelling at each other over big things in large sets with bright colors. Instead we get father and son arguing under their breaths about things in dark rooms with 'realistic' performances. It's such a drab drag of a film.First we get a prologue about the Dark Elves who fought Asgardians five thousand years before when the Dark Elves tried to put the entire universe into darkness. They, of course, failed, and will surely never be mentioned again. Just ahead 5,000 years, and it's two years after Thor had visited Earth, and some undetermined amount of time after Thor had his little adventure in New York, the nine realms have been thrown into chaos and Thor helps to tamp down on rebellions and plunderings. Thor has succeeded enough that now there is talk of him returning to Earth for the first time since the last time he went to Earth and didn't see his sort of girlfriend Jane Foster.Jane Foster, in order to justify her mere presence in the movie, falls into a random hole that takes her directly to where the aether is, the mystical substance that was going to darken the universe at the hands of the Dark Elves five thousand years prior. The aether inhabits her and sends her back to Earth. It is unclear if this was a random occurrence or if the aether is somehow intelligent with agency (I'm leaning towards random since the aether does nothing else on its own in the film). Thor takes her back to Asgard where the Asgardians are amazed by the aether's presence but have no idea what to do. The only one who knows what to do are the Dark Elves (Surprise! They're back!), who have been in hibernation for the past five thousand years and wake up that very day. Probably because they have some sort of aether detecting peace of fantasy tech that can detect the substance across vast distances instantaneously. Or, they came out of hibernation a couple of days before the event from five thousand years before is going to repeat. Or something. The Dark Elves and their motives are really unclear.I'm sorry. This movie was tough to sit through. It's garbage from beginning to end. The plot doesn't matter because it makes no sense. Much like Iron Man 2, I was left constantly asking myself as I watched, 'What is the story of this movie?' I mean, what's Thor's emotional journey in this? It seems like it's actually about his relationship with Loki, but Loki disappears for more than an hour, having nothing to do with the movie at all for almost two-thirds of the film's runtime. The Dark Elf plot feels like a serial adventure while the stuff with Loki (which was added late in the process after people loved him in The Avengers) is the actual meat of the emotional journey. It's a rather stark juxtaposition. But even then, the 'meat' is given almost no real time to develop before Loki 'dies' again and we're off to the film's climax.Now, I'm not one to nitpick things not conforming to reality, or even to a film's own established rules on smaller things. My focus is on character and theme. If those things are going well, I tend to be more forgiving of stupid nonsense. However, when the basic tenets of storytelling are being shredded through sheer incompetence, these bits of idiocy bug me more and more. For instance, the portals that seem to follow no rules whatsoever and become so important late in the movie. Well, they don't follow any discernable logic. I think that's the point, but when fights to the death turn based on this randomness, it doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like a screenwriter trying to be clever while also giving his characters easy outs of tough situations.This makes me kind of sad. Thor was one of the bright spots of Phase 1, and Thor: The Dark World is probably the worst movie of the franchise.",2,2,2,25 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Messy and cluttered, but mostly comes together
","This shares a lot of the same structural problems as Episode I, but it's better made, more energetically assembled, and with stronger dialogue which helps make up for it. There are a lot of stories floating around in this thing which obfuscates the emotional core of the film, which does float to the surface by the end, though it's not quite as well built as it could be.The movie pretty much doesn't have a main character. It's seemingly Rey, but she doesn't really get an outsized amount of screentime for her character motivations and actions as opposed to Finn. So, it's really a dual journey, but they have very different motivations driving them. Finn's is pretty clear. He wants to escape the First Order after his first taste of battle (which is really a massacre) and he'll do anything, including freeing a captured Resistance pilot, to do it.Rey has an interesting dichotomy at her core. She has a yearning for escape and adventure sitting in front of her makeshift home on the desert planet of Jakku, but she also refuses to leave. When given the opportunity to go, she initially takes it and then tries to go back. She's waiting for her family. What that actually means is unclear, but she has a motive to stay. That's interesting, however it gets lost by about the halfway point. Landing on the planet with Maz Kanata, she mentions a desire to go back home and it never comes up again. That core conflict of her character just kind of stops as she gets swept up in the adventure. Even at the end, she makes no mention of going back to Jakku, even to note how she doesn't want it anymore, instead just acceding to go and take the final leg to Luke Skywalker's hidden location.Rey's antagonist ends up being Kylo Ren, and he is the single best part of this movie. The contrast between who he wants to be and who he is, manifested physically through the mask he wears that echoes Darth Vader's mask but serves none of the practical functions, is great. He wants to be the Dark Lord that everyone fears, but without his mask he looks like a brooding kid. He's obviously powerful, but he also just doesn't have the control or inspire the same level of menace without aid. His desire for more is what drives him, and it's great.On top of our two nominal main characters, we also have Han Solo, who's concerned with his relationship with his son and former wife. Once he's introduced in the film, his issues tend to overshadow those of everyone else around him because you just can't have Han Solo in a revamped Star Wars movie and have him play a supporting role, apparently.The split personality of the film is really magnified, though, by the fact that it has two plots and the second one doesn't appear until about 80 minutes into the film. The first is the more interesting one. Luke Skywalker has gone missing and everyone's looking for a map that will lead to him. It's small, focused, and different from what we've had before. And then, about 45 minutes into the movie, we see Starkiller Base, a bigger Death Star, and we know what's going to happen. Mention of attacking Starkiller Base doesn't actually happen until about the 80 minute point when it completely takes over the film for the rest of the runtime until the very end. The Starkiller Base stuff and the end to Alien: Covenant remind me of each other. They're both compressed versions of the original films, and they both stick out from the rest of the film.That being said, the climax of the film, particularly the final lightsaber duel is what almost saves the film for me. Aside from being slickly produced and just simply looking great with the darkness, the bright lightsabers, and the snowy forest setting, are a great place to have your two main characters face off. And it is here that it becomes obvious that Rey is supposed to be the main character. Kylo easily dispatches Finn, and the movie long red herring is out of the way, clearing the path for the real protagonist to finally step forward. That game the movie plays up to this point frustrates the whole experience (especially considering its irrelevance), but once there we get something interesting. Kylo is trying to attract the unmolded Rey to the Dark Side, attempting to further his own ambition by adding an apprentice, something he's pretty obviously not ready for. And, on the other side of the duel, Rey is confronted with her newfound power and actual adventure, and she has to make a choice.Final thoughts about Rey:Rey would be a really interesting character if she weren't so damn good at everything she does. She can fly the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo ever could without ever having touched its controls and with the admission that she's not actually that good of a pilot (The Force, apparently helped her). She figures out the Jedi Mind Trick without knowing she could do it. She speaks or understands whatever language gets thrown at her (droid and Wookie, for instance). And then she bests a man trained in lightsaber combat. Now, out of all of what she does here, the only thing she does that's important to her character is defeating Kylo Ren at the end, and that's actually explainable because Kylo wasn't taking the fight seriously (it's so obvious even I can tell he's playing with both Finn and Rey) and was opening himself up to a sudden fierce attack. Without all of the other conveniences, that sudden turn around wouldn't feel like just another in a long line of things that this character was great at. I get the suspicion that Rey's flight of the Falcon was originally Poe's flight but got rewritten to her. It makes a whole lot more sense if the greatest Resistance pilot does that stuff instead of just the scavenger girl on the desert planet.Overall though, the movie is a victim of its structure designed to hide who its main character is as well as provide a quick remake of Star Wars and the need to prominently feature Han Solo. It almost overcomes its issues, but not quite.",6,1,1,17 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still great after all these years
","It's amazing how this movie still works as well as it does. I think there are two main components to the original Star Wars's success as a film. The first is Lucas' embrace of Joseph Campbell's model of mythic storytelling. He utilizes the archetypes Campbell built so cleanly and the narrative structure so clearly that the core story of the film resonates easily with audiences. The second is how the story gets integrated into the largely implied larger universe of Star Wars.The core story of Luke Skywalker leaving his out of the way farm to follow a space wizard on an adventure with a clear villain and large stakes is complete in this one film. If there had never been another Star Wars movie, it would still work as a rip-roaring space opera, but there's such detail in the edges of the frame. We sees dozens of aliens speaking completely unintelligible alien languages and the characters pass through them without batting an eye. There's talk of an Empire (established well as an antagonistic force), but also of a Senate, the Old Republic, gangsters like Jabba, and more. They never overtake the story, instead they function as window dressing that allows for the audience's imagination to run wild and try to fill in gaps. They're not narrative gaps, so the story flows well, they're universe gaps that don't negatively affect the storytelling but invite audience participation in lesser details.That's something that's been lost recently. Instead of focusing on the one story and telling it with detailing the edges to excite, the core stories get sacrificed in order to try and establish new storylines that could continue in future sequels.The key to this in Star Wars is the famed cantina scene. Up until that point, we've seen mostly humans with androids. There have been Jawas and Sandpeople, but they were localized to this one alien planet, Tatooine. What we see in the cantina is a cross section of aliens from across the galaxy. They all look different and sound different. It's opening up the universe of the movie in one single scene that sparks the imagination. We've felt like we were in a rather typical techno fantasy up to that point, but the cantina just bursts open the possibilities.Not to imply that these are the only two reasons for Star Wars's artistic success. There are other factors. The movie is pretty much perfectly cast. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher, and Alec Guinness all embody their archetypical roles snugly. Hamill feels very much like the wide-eyed farm boy. Ford is the scoundrel. Cushing is the evil general. Fisher is the smart and tough princess. Guinness is the wizened old man. They play off each other really well, creating a sense of comradery that's hard to deny.John Williams' score also deserves a strong mention. It's one of the great scores with themes like the Binary Sunset that embody both melancholy desire and hope at the same time. His action beats are more than mere percussion, they still utilize themes in exciting ways that help compliment the action on screen perfectly.There needs to be mention of the editing as well. By all accounts, Lucas's then wife Marcia saved the final battle. The original script and first edit by another editor fell flat in the original rough cut. Marcia was brought in and spent eight weeks retooling tens of thousands of feet of film to create the danger, excitement, tension, and explosion of relief at the resolution. It's a special effects showcase for sure, but it's more of a triumph of superior editing skills more than anything else. The battle over the Death Star is one of the great action special effects sequences ever made (even more than 40 years later) because we've invested in our archetypal characters and the craft of how the scene is put together draws in the audience.While the movie may be about space wizards and magic, it contains enough universal human touches (as a proxy from Campbell's narrative theories) while utilizing the filmic craft to its fullest potential. Star Wars is a triumph of popular entertainment. It's a simple story, well told, with enough on the edges to further excite the imagination.",10,1,2,12 December 2019
The Thin Red Line," A Beautiful tone poem and meditation on the nature of conflict and man's place in an uncaring world
","What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself? The land contend with the sea? Is there an avenging power in nature? Not one power, but two?
-Private Edward P. Train (John Dee Smith)That's the first line of the movie, and it provides the baseline thesis of the film. Not that war is Hell, but that war is a natural state (reflective of the Nature vs. Grace thesis at the heart of The Tree of Life). I've read reviews of this film that dismiss it as just another film that has nothing to say beyond, 'War is Hell,' but that obviously misses the entire point of the movie. It starts from 'War is a part of nature' and moves on from there. What we end up seeing are portraits of how mankind can break under different types of war.Out of a cast as large as what's here (including poor Adrien Brody who was hired as the star of the film but effectively cut out of the film), it can be hard to distill individuals as central to the telling of the story, but I do believe that there are three that most effectively show the range of reactions Malick was trying to show. There is a fourth that highlights something else that I will get to in a bit. The three are Lieutenant Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte), Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), and Captain Staros (Elias Koteas). Tall and Witt represent two opposing sides of the human experience, and Staros is somewhere in the middle.Lieutenant Colonel TallTall is a career military man who's dedicated to his job. He has a scene early with his commanding officer where the general talks about how colonels become politicians as soon as they gain their eagles. Tall is one rank removed from that, so the implication is that he's still a soldier first. Later, he explodes a bit saying that he's been in the service for so long but never had a war. This is his war, and he's going to prove himself. He studied Homer, in the original Greek, at the Point, and he's waited long enough to prove himself.He relishes this conflict. He's there to demonstrate his prowess and ability in the face of a determined and entrenched enemy. He understands that in order to win, he'll have to sacrifice human lives under his command, and he's come to terms with that reality. He thrives under these conditions, in this natural state.Private WittIn order to understand Malick in general, you need to understand his most frequent motif: Eden and the search for it once it has been lost. The movie begins with Witt in Eden, an idyllic paradise populated by native aboriginals full of joy and innocence. Witt is then picked up by an American patrol and brought back to the world.Welsh: In this world, a man himself is nothing. And there ain't no world, but this one.
Witt: You're wrong, there, Top: I've seen another world. Sometimes I think it was just my imagination.
Welsh: Well, then you've seen things I never will.Witt wants to get back to that which he so briefly experienced, and he spends the entire battle looking for it. He's almost ethereal in how he approaches the conflict. It's as though he considers himself outside of what's going on around him, untouched by death that surrounds him.The unfortunate reality is that it does. Witt ends up finding himself surrounded by Japanese troops, unable to understand what they are saying to him, and shot dead by a single round.Captain StarosStaros exists between Tall and Witt. He understands the reality of war, but is terrified of having it touch his men. His most important moment is when he refuses a direct order from Tall to initiate a charge against an entrenched position, begging to take his men around on a flanking maneuver instead. He won't sacrifice his men for what he considers a suicide mission.When Tall comes to inspect the line, it has gone quiet, and Tall allows for Staros to maintain command for the moment.Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign? How many? One? Two? Twenty? Lives will be lost in your company, Captain. And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.Staros isn't above the fray like Witt or immersed in it like Tall. In the end, Tall sends Staros home to work in the JAG office. Staros just isn't tough fibered enough for this. In the face of war, he doesn't have the stomach for what's required.Three TogetherSo, what is Malick trying to explore with these three characters (the three that I find the most prominent in the narrative)? I think it's that we are all bound for war, but not all of us are built for it. It's an exploration of how different types of men face the state that nature is always in. Do we embrace it? Do we act like it's not real? Do we fold under the weight of it? The individual portraits I find to be involving and moving and one of the reasons that I love the movie.One More ExampleThe conflict at the heart of nature as outlined in the opening narration quoted earlier doesn't solely manifest as the conflict between the United States and the Japanese Empire on Guadalcanal. It also shows itself as a conflict between two people. In this instance, it's between man and wife.Private Bell (played by Ben Chaplin) is akin to Private Witt in that he seems somewhat disengaged from the conflict itself. And, much like Witt, he has his own Eden over which he pines. That Eden for Bell is the time he spent with his wife (played by Miranda Otto in flashback) before the war. When we first meet Bell, he's reclining in his bunk on the ship transporting the infantry to the island where he explains a bit of his past.Fife: How'd you end up a private?
Bell: Cos of my wife. I was in the corps of engineers. We'd never been separated before, not even for a night. I took it for four months and then I quit. Just resigned. They sent me back to the States. They told me I'd never get another commission. They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.He was willing to sacrifice his career to stay with her, but the military threw him back into the fight. Despite the distance, the two continue to write to each other, and Bell is consumed with the memories of that time with her.The first time we hear her voice is when he receives a letter from her about two-thirds of the way through the film. In it, she asks for a divorce because she has met and fallen in love with another officer. Bell is crushed by this, and we view another example of how violence is not the provenance of man, but a natural state. Their time apart allowed the wife to drift away from him and cause him great pain by that fact.Thesis be Damned, Why Do I Like It?Alright, so I've tried to walk you through the ideas behind the film. And, I can easily imagine someone saying, 'That's all well and good, but could Malick keep his camera on a tripod once? Could he have fewer shots of random birds? Could he not have provided some typical narrative structure for me to hang onto?'And you know what I would say to that? A shrug.Malick makes films in a very dreamlike manner that seem to float over their subjects more than approach them head on. To me, that doesn't mean that they are disengaged with their subjects, far from it, but that it engages in non-traditional ways. The emphasis of theme and emotion over anything literal (including plot) is just a form of storytelling that many people can't get into.
Does that make them lesser filmgoers? Not at all. I find my love of Terrence Malick's work to be incredibly hard to explain. This is the fourth separate time I've tried to write a post about him, and I've abandoned completely every attempt that has come before. I tend to float from one subject to the next without any real focus.Some of the reasons that I do love his work is his emphasis of theme, his fluid camera work, his strength with actors (although they tend to end up hating him, just ask Christopher Plummer), and the lyrical cadence of the work in general. I took a few classes with film scholar Stephen Prince in college, and I asked him about Malick. The way he put it was, 'Saving Private Ryan is prose. The Thin Red line is poetry.'And that's the thing. Malick is akin to filmmaking poetry. I know that, personally, I don't like regular poetry, but I love to read prose up and down. I can easily see how the language of Malick's narrative poetry doesn't appeal to people in the same way.But, it does to me. I love how Malick makes films. They are emotional and involving experiences to me.My recommendation to those uninitiated in Malick but are intrigued would be to start at the beginning. Watch Badlands before anything else. Then go to Days of Heaven, if either of those appeal to you, then dive in, because you will be opening up something wonderful.",10,3,5,21 November 2019
Jackie Brown," A steady burn
","My first viewing of Jackie Brown, years ago, confused me. I was expecting time jumps, and I kept asking myself when things were happening. I was trying to rearrange a movie that needed to rearranging.I mention that uninteresting anecdote because it speaks to the interesting, slightly out of step, place Jackie Brown holds in Quentin Tarantino's whole filmography. People threw the word 'mature' a lot at Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood as though Tarantino had never calmed down before, but Jackie Brown is the work of a filmmaker in complete control of his craft and coolly telling a story. It's a very mature work, and it's only his third film.A small-time gunrunner living in Los Angeles named Ordell Robbie is suddenly having a bit of a problem with his business. One of his employees, Beaumont, has been picked up for a gun charge which, combined with his parole, could lead to ten years in jail. Ordell understands Beaumont's character, uses Max Cherry, a bail bondsman to get Beaumont out of jail, and then proceeds to kill him. Ordell's instinct about Beaumont's character was completely correct, though, for Beaumont had given up a slice of Ordell's business by naming Jackie Brown as Ordell's gopher.Jackie is a middle-aged black woman who works for one of the worst airlines in America as a stewardess. She supplements her income by sneaking things in from Mexico for Ordell, mostly money. Because Beaumont gave her name, the ATF is ready to meet her when she lands in Los Angeles. Ordell gets her out of prison using Max Cherry again, and Max picks Jackie up from prison and is immediately smitten by her.Jackie knows that Ordell will view her the same way that he viewing Beaumont, and she's terrified, but she's also smart. She knows that he's going to come to kill her, but she also figures out a way to get herself out of the situation. She proposes a plan to him to get his stash of cash out of Mexico. He has limited options around this, so he accepts. She then plays both Ordell and the ATF against each other while she plans on keeping the money for herself.What follows is a delightfully twisty game of cat and mouse as Jackie ropes in Max to help her deceive both the ATF and Ordell. The whole game is played with Tarantino's classic ability to spin dialogue and his actors' abilities to sell it. Chris Tucker, apparently, told Tarantino that he would usually just say whatever he wanted in place of scripted lines, but he was going to say Tarantino's dialogue verbatim because he liked it so much. There are scenes, as in every Tarantino movie, of people just sitting around talking. This isn't merely indulgence on Tarantino's part, it's important character work that gets the audience in deeper into the world. Melanie isn't just some beach bimbo, she's a well defined beach bimbo so that when she starts egging on Louis after the big trade off (for real this time), it makes perfect sense. We know the entirety of her relationship with Louis, so we understand that she's the kind of person to egg him on and that Louis is also the kind of guy who's got bottle up rage that could come out at any moment. It makes the moment that Louis shoots Melanie both more shocking and more expected and inevitable than it otherwise would have been.The movie as a whole is that kind of low-key fun. The action of the film is around moving shopping bags under changing room doors. The handful of gunshots are shown with little blood and seem incidental to the action at hand. The characters are intelligent and talk to each other in ways that are both believable and move things forward at the same time.It's a steady burn of a movie, and a wonderful addition to Tarantino's body of work.",10,1,1,25 November 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Hilarious and perfectly constructed
","Watching this for the first time in at least ten years, it became screamingly obvious to me which sections were directed by Terry Gilliam and which were directed by Terry Jones. Jones tends to set up his camera from afar, capturing all of the actors in a single shot and letting them perform. Gilliam pieces his parts together from many smaller parts, individually gathered with more interesting angles and compositions. They both have their charms, and they end up working really well as a whole because while the visual aesthetic may be different between the two directors, there's a common comedic approach that crosses that visual barrier and comes together as a whole and hilarious experience.While the experience is a whole, it's obviously built from smaller parts that stem from a group of comedians more in tune with the formula of sketch comedy. The intelligent approach was to use a story (the quest for the Holy Grail) which lent itself to branching off in a few different directions for a time, allowing isolated bits of comedy, before bringing it all back to one conclusion.The movie is largely broken into three sections. The first is Arthur building his team (which really only accounts for his finding of Bedivere, everyone else gets summarized). The second is the knights going off in different directions to look for the grail. The third brings them all back to finish out the adventure (with the group getting smaller by the second for different reasons).What makes the movie work, though, is the comedy. The comedy stems from the funny dialogue but also from the contrast between the serious look of the material against the inherent silliness of the comedy. Terry Gilliam called it 'laughing at castles'. They had to film very cheaply, and one of the cheapest ways to film is to simply go outside. Living in a country as verdant and richly foliaged as England, while also populated with castles that have stood there for hundreds of years. Just going there gave the film instant production values that they could never get close to replicated on sets. It's the contrast there that's the source of much of the comedy.Graham Chapman plays Arthur very seriously for most of the film, offering only scattered moments of befuddlement at the most ridiculous of circumstances. He's the straight man, and his reactions are mostly the source of his own comedy. Terry Jones plays Bedivere as a nebbish knight who should probably not be in armor while being very sure of his grasp of the most advanced scientific knowledge. John Cleese is Lancelot, a mindlessly brave hero who runs into every situation ready to deal with it using his sword. Michael Palin is Galahad, the purest of the pure. Eric Idle plays Sir Robin, the most cowardly of the cowards. The characters aren't deep. They're meant as personifications of specific types that the Pythons use to direct jokes at, and it works exceedingly well.I think it's most obvious in the middle section, when the knights split up, to see where the humor comes from. Robin the coward is faced with certain death. Galahad the pure is faced with certain temptation. Lancelot the brave is put in a situation where his bravery is wildly out of place. They're the sorts of adventures heroes defined by singular traits go on in straight adventure tales, but here everything's turned on their heads. Robin doesn't become brave, he remains cowardly, running away. Galahad decides that a little bit of temptation will be fine (only to be bravely saved by the brave Sir Lancelot at the last second). Lancelot is so blinded by his need for adventure that he murders half a wedding party to get to a waifish young prince who doesn't really need the rescuing he desires.It's the contrasts and the inherent silliness that makes the film. That extends even further to the presence of the French, everything animated, the knights who say Ni, and the movie's ending.Oh, the ending. I think it's perfect. In a movie built on setting expectations of a retelling of the Arthurian legend upside down, setting up a giant battle (with an army that appears out of nowhere) only to have it end with Arthur and Bedivere carried away in a modern police paddy wagon is great. It's the exact sort of undermining of expectations that the movie has embraced from beginning to that very end.So, it's a patchwork that is designed to work as a patchwork. It's tightly crafted humor at the hands of two surprisingly firm directorial hands (each in their first attempts) with varying styles that merge together really well. It's beautiful to look at, using the most out of their location shooting. It's fast at a quick 90 minutes, and it's consistently funny throughout. You don't need me to tell you, but this is a greatly crafted comedy.",10,2,2,10 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A proposed alternate subtitle: The Humiliation of Luke Skywalker.
","There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the 'bigger is better' school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from 'Faster, more intense' George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments.",10,0,0,12 December 2019
Spectre," A step down, but still entertaining
","How do you follow up one of the best Bond films that deconstructed the formula completely? Make a much more straight forward Bond adventure, I guess. I like what's here. Bond continues his personal journey, the theme expands to look at the past vs future idea from a larger context, and we get a reintroduction to Bond's most iconic antagonist. It's a solid adventure made by a more independent filmmaker than the franchise is used to, but it doesn't quite connect as well as Skyfall.The story begins with a bit of retconning for Skyfall, having Judi Dench M deliver a message to Bond about the extent of Silva's attachment to the web of criminality that's been hounding MI6 and Bond personally since Craig's first appearance as the character in Casino Royale. Bond sets out to follow a series of clues that reunite him with Mr. White, lead him to Mr. White's daughter in Switzerland, and gets Bond face to face with the titular organization (not in that order).Of course, that's not how the movie itself starts. The movie starts with a long tracking shot through Mexico City that sees Bond trailing an Italian assassin through the Day of the Dead celebration. It's a technical marvel that moves from over the crowd to through it to up an elevator to out onto a ledge. It's a virtuoso moment, and a good way to begin a Bond film with a bang. Of course, the rest involved explosions, toppling buildings, and a fight in a helicopter over the crows. It's thinly exciting stuff, the sort of opening we expect from a Bond film.The mystery moves him to Italy where he has carnal relations with Monica Bellucci and gets his next clue taking him to a shadowy meeting of Spectre. Now, coming a couple of movies after the insane meeting of nefarious powerful people at the opera in Quantum of Solace, just having the rich people meet like they did in Eyes Wide Shut is refreshing. The meeting turns on two points: the introduction of the heavy, Hinx, and Blofeld showing up and identifying Bond without effort.Now, this is the point of the film that loses a shocking number of people. I don't really like the point, but I consider it relatively minor. Blofeld, in this version of Bond, is Bond's long lost, presumed dead, foster brother. Because of the attention Bond received from their father, Blofeld has nursed a simmering hatred towards Bond his whole life. It's thin and kinda stupid. It's a way to connect all the antagonists in the previous films to Blofeld and provide him with a tangible reason to target Bond through it all. It's thin, and I don't think it really works.However, everything around Blofeld's personal reasons for his plan (called his plan) works great. The theme of modernity versus the past gets fleshed out in a brand new direction in this film. It's no longer personal to Bond, it's about the presumed obsolescence of MI6 and the 00 program (which got touched on in Skyfall). Instead, the new head of the Joint Security Service, C, wants to drive all foreign intelligence into a surveillance dragnet that connects with eight other nations in what is called Nine Eyes (there is a real, very similar, thing called Five Eyes in the real world, by the way). 00 agents aren't necessary in a world of total surveillance and drones, he argues, but the moral argument in the film is on M's side (since Bond spends most of the movie in the field), and the conflict plays out. In a tighter film, some of this might have gotten sacrificed to get the movie to a shorter run time, but I think it adds a very interesting subtext to everything that's happening.The mystery Bond is tracking is centered around the effort to stand Nine Eyes up. It's the ultimate effort on Spectre's part to control the information of the most powerful countries in the world, and Blofeld is at the center of it. In order to get there, Bond has to go through Mr. White, White's daughter Madeleine Swann, and to Blofeld himself at his lair in the desert. It's there that we get our typical bond finale with the exploding base, but the movie continues beyond it. Because Blofeld is out to hurt Bond, and not just take control of information, he escapes and aims to do exactly that, hurt Bond. With the old MI6 building set to be destroyed, Bond must race in and save Madeleine from certain death, followed by shooting down Blofeld's helicopter with a Walther PPK and capturing the criminal mastermind. It's a well crafted sequence and a good one to end the film on.Ultimately, the movie has something on its mind, which is better than most of the Bond films, and is well executed. The personal connection between Bond and Blofeld, and the movie's lackadaisical pace (something that perhaps should have been addressed in an action spectacular film) drag it down a bit though. In the end, though, I think it's a quality adventure and a fun ride, if not Bond's best.",7,1,4,10 March 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Grandpa makes a great action movie
","The success of an action movie really depends on the execution of the action itself. This is generally why it's a bad idea to make a no-budget action movie unless you know how to produce good action without any money. A lot of money makes a lot of moviemaking easier, but, in particular, it helps with action scenes.Mad Max Fury Road was an expensive movie, and it shows gloriously. The story is super simple, and reminds me of Dredd. There's no complex plot to tangle with, just the personalities and the journey, a there and back again structure that lends itself really well to the type of action on display. Women try to escape a prison, drive across the desert, find their destination, and then head back. There's plenty of room for absolutely bonkers action sequences and a surprising amount of character work.Our central and titular character Max grunts his way through the movie. He's far less verbose than he had been in previous movies (lending some textual credence that he's actually the feral kid from The Road Warrior rather than Max himself), but even though he doesn't talk he still has a well-defined arc. It's pretty much the same arc he has in both The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome where he's just out to help himself but finds himself helping a group of the weaker against a strong enemy. In The Road Warrior, it was the people mining the oil pump. In Beyond Thunderdome, it was the kids. In Fury Road, it's the breeders and their leader Furiosa.Furiosa is great. She's headstrong but more impulsive than she thinks she is. She's prepared her escape well, but she didn't realize the scope of the troubles that would fall on her for her action. Without the happy coincidence of Max, she'd have either lost everything on the way out, or reached her destination and just driven out into the desert with 160 days worth of gasoline, hoping to find something.Immortan Joe, the antagonist of the film, is such a fantastic looking character. With shades of Darth Vader in his breathing apparatus, a massive frame, and a terrifying voice, Joe has an incredible presence. It's easy to see how he would incite both great fear in his enemies and awe in his supporters. How he could use both his presence and position over a necessary resource (water) to create a slave state.On top of all of this is some of the most incredibly impressive action I've ever seen. The key to elongated action sequences is finding ways to change the action around while keeping the pace going. You'd think that with a car chase, there'd only be so many combinations one could come up with, but this is where the weirdness of the Max universe really turns into an asset. It's not two cars in pursuit. It's a war rig followed by a variety of different vehicles with different weapons, speeds, and abilities. My favorite of them all is the pole cats, which the movie saves for the ending and uses to great effect. Those metronomic motions create great opportunities for visuals, including what might be my favorite single shot from a modern action movie.It's amazing how George Miller, the grandpa of a director, maintains the pace and energy through all two hours. It's a magnificent thrill ride.",10,1,3,21 November 2019
Alien: Covenant," Two movies in one. One works a good deal better than the other, though.
","This feels like two movies in one. One is fine, technically proficient, and somewhat effective. The other I love.Ridley Scott was caught in a bit of a bind after Prometheus. A lot of people weren't happy with what he had done, how it was only tenuously connected to the Alien universe, but he was far more drawn by the ideas of AI as antagonists rather than the xenomorphs of the given universe. What was he to do with a sequel to the reasonably financially successful Prometheus? Well, he seems to have found some kind of middle ground. I think the two sides clash a bit, and one is obviously better than the other. Still, as a whole, I feel like it comes out as reasonably good.Ten years after the Prometheus disappeared, the colonization ship Covenant is traveling to a distant system. While opening solar sails for a power charge (the science...let's just go with it), they're hit by a solar flare causing damage and requiring the waking of the crew. As they address the ship's damage, they discover a message with human origins coming from a nearby system. They investigate and find human vegetation. Two of the landing crew are infected with a virus that gestates an alien creature inside them that expels an early form of the xenomorph (called the neomorph according to the credits) from different parts of their bodies (the back for one and the mouth for the other). The rest of the crew gets stranded when their lander explodes, kill one of the neomorphs, and get rescued by David, the android from the previous film.It's here that the movie picks up on something that was touched on in the previous film. David himself talked about children all wanting to kill their parents. He was concerned with his role as creation, and here he is as the go between in terms of creator and creation. He's been alone for ten years, experimenting with the weapon the Engineers had created after having wiped out the entire civilization of Engineers on the planet with that very same weapon. He's reached a point where he can't go any further because his experiments have wiped out all of the meat on the planet. And here come a group of humans. David, the mad scientist, finally has his final piece to complete his work, the perfect lifeform, the xenomorph.One reason David's so great in this is his counterpart, Walter, a more up to date model of the David android with certain advances. David is creative and uses that creativity to find perfection. Walter is more like a robot and a servant to humanity. David is rebelling against his creator, and Walter is content to follow his creator's designs. David rebels by creating the perfect organism designed to destroy David's creator while Walter stands as an impediment to David's designs. This all get revealed over the course of a few wonderful scenes between Walter and David. It's Michael Fassbender playing off of himself and it works so incredibly well.David's revelation of madness is great to behold overall. His isolation and murder of Elizabeth Shaw (along with a cover story that includes a grave marker for when any human found him) created a psychopath of incredible intellect, vision, and ruthlessness. He's such a fantastic antagonist, and the inclusion of the xenomorph in his plans overall is great.The problem, though, is that after a certain point the xenomorph stops being an extension of David's plan and instead becomes its own, lesser thrilling source of antagonism. David unleashing the facehugger on Oram, the captain of the Covenant, is great. The xenomorph rising from the captain's body is great. The chase scene that follows is very good (though the alien works better in shadows like the first Alien than in the light like here). Then, the movie comes to a stop before restarting again with another xenomorph after the survivors have made it back to the Covenant and we get a quick and dirty 20 minute short version of the original Alien. It's fine from a technical standpoint. The geography is clear and the big scene in the terraforming hangar is great to look at, but it's after the fact, expendable, and just kind of extra to the whole thing. It could be cut completely and it would be hard to notice the few remaining crew members that had died in that scene missing from the rest of the film.And that encapsulates my overall feeling of the movie. David's fantastic and carries a large chunk of the film, but a lot of the horror stuff feels almost pasted on. None of it is bad, which helps things overall, but if just feels like another movie comes in and takes over for minutes at a time. It's an uneven experience that, I think, works well enough overall.",7,2,3,26 November 2019
The Wizard of Oz," Brings out the wonder in us all
","This is an interesting combination of escapism and a message of staying home that it feels like it could only be made during the Depression. Yes, there are wondrous things out there, but really, you need to stay home and work the farm and every moment you're away you should be yearning to return. It's a delightful journey we follow Dorothy on, but that message is so unlike anything in pop culture since.It really does hinge on two conflicting desires common in the human heart: escape and finding home. Dorothy grows up on a destitute farm in Kansas in the middle of the Great Depression and, by the looks of things, alongside the effects of the Dust Bowl. It makes perfect sense for her to want to leave and find somewhere better, and when a country had 25% unemployment, it was a feeling shared by many people in the real world. Finding Oz, a weird, dangerous, and magical place, Dorothy realizes that she's missing that which she holds most dear, her aunt and uncle, her family. I do wonder how the adventure would have changed if Aunt Em had joined Dorothy on the trip up and down the twister to land of Oz.This is one of those movies that seems to work so well in no small part because of its more technical aspects The use of sepia at the beginning to break into Technicolor once Dorothy reaches Oz is a wonderful gateway into a new world, very clearly delineating the 'real' world from the 'fantasy'. The sets are huge and filled with color. The costumes are theatrical and fit right in with the un-reality of the setting. These technical elements work together really well to sell the fantasy land in all its fantastic glory of bright yellows and greens, populated with witches, Munchkins, and even a man who calls himself a wizard.But the movie obviously straddles the line between the reality and fantasy of Oz. We want to believe that it's a real place, like Dorothy insists at the end of the film, but we also know that houses don't fly up twisters to be transplanted safely (save for those inhabiting the house's landing spot) to fantastical worlds, and yet we're still like Dorothy at the end. We want to believe Oz is real because of its imagination grabbing unreality. We'd rather live in a world where Oz exists than in one where it doesn't. It's a childlike impulse to grab onto things we know can't be real, and it manifests perfectly in Dorothy with a great matching effect on the audience.Yellow brick roads and Emerald Cities aren't enough to really capture the imagination, though. In a vacuum, those things become boring rather quickly, which is why the Wicked Witch of the West is so important. Margaret Hamilton brings a very real and fantastic sense of menace to every scene she's in, even while she hams up the entire performance. The overindulgent performance matches the tall evil tower she resides in and the giant glass ball she sees the world through. She's an antagonist that wholly overmatches the innocent Dorothy, making her eventual nearly accidental defeat all the more satisfying.Being a fantasy movie for children, everything gets wrapped up quite nicely, except for actually getting Dorothy home. The idea that she's always had the power to go home matches really well with the fact that her three companions all had the internal qualities they were searching for from the wizard to begin with. The scarecrow comes up with every plan. The tin man cries at every defeat. Even the cowardly lion leads the charge into the witch's castle. It's a nice message that you don't need external markers to have great internal qualities, but you must be the source yourself.It's a wonderful childlike adventure that brings out innocent wonder from its audience, using timeless songs, fantastic set design, and marvelous casting to tell the tale.",10,0,0,17 January 2020
