Ford v Ferrari," Amazing movie but too long for a Hollywood movie
","Starting with the story which is crisp and thrilling, Christian Bale what an artist he is, always setting up the standards of his movie high and his Co actor Matt Damon always came up with the expectations very well. Only one bad thing about the movie that it was too long and stretchy at one point so that's why I reduced half rating. It's a must watch movie ðŸŽ¥",8,2,3,24 November 2019
Knives Out," A perfect movie to end an amazing year of movies
","Starting with the cast, everyone fits perfectly for their role especially Steve Rogers. Coming to the story line it was kind of suspense and comedy at times, which didn't bore me at all through out the movie. It is a must watch.",9,0,2,20 December 2019
