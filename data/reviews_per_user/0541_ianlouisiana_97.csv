The King's Speech," King meets Speech therapist..King loses speech therapist.King finds speech therapist again
","'The King's Speech' is a small,low - budget British film with showy performances by its two principals that have swept it from being a success d'estime to a success de cash in very short order.It is not a great film.It is cinematically uninteresting but competently made.Apart from the larger than life acting of its principals, most of the other cast members resort to mere mimcry.Mr Spall is particularly guilty in this respect,offering a Churchill that would have been rejected by BGT judges as being OTT. Much like the earlier 'The Queen' which was similarly over rated,the story involves Britain's favourite dysfunctional family,the Windsors - or the Saxe - Coburg - Gothas as they were known until the Great War made a change of name propitious. Bullied by his father King George the Fifth,treated with amused disdain by his older brother the Prince of Wales,shy and diffident and afflicted with a shattering stammer,the Duke of York seems destined to perform the usual role of the Sovereign's second son (the 'Spare' of the heir and a spare)and live relatively quietly in the shadow of the more senior Royals.However,destiny in the shape of an American divorc√©e of doubtful reputation was to change his future,his brother's future and indeed the future of his country. The Prince of Wales obsession with Mrs Wallis Simpson as we all know led him to forsake the throne,embrace Fascism and happily leave Britain in its worst constitutional crisis for centuries. 'Bertie' as he was known to his family,never expected to be King nor ever wanted to be King;certainly not until he saw the awful mess his brother was making of the job. And then there was the little matter of his stammer which he had been battling against for years,sometimes taking a step forwards then two steps backwards,latterly under the care of Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue. Logue had fallen out of favour but the new King finally recalled him as first the Coronation approached and then war clouds began to gather. Ultimately Logue was able to see the King through his first speech to the country as a war leader. Mr P.Firth has been rightly lauded for his respectful and affectionate portrait of a stubborn and courageous monarch.Without resorting to impersonation he brings a good man to life recognisably to someone like myself who remembers the latter years of his reign. Mr G.Rush is equally good as Lionel Logue,gentle,sly,compassionate and equally as stubborn as his famous patient.The film is poorly paced and,frankly,has only reached its present eminence due to a noisy and persisting lobbying by its supporters.",6,4,9,27 January 2011
Walk the Line," 'Your mum and dad,they f---- you up'.Philip Larkin.
","Mr Larkin's best - known line proves its painful accuracy as his parents' reaction to the tragic death of Johnny Cash's older brother echoes down the years.He was killed in his teens in a sawmill accident that pushed the boys' father over the edge.'The wrong son died',he shouts fraught with anguish as the young Johnny flees the house. Unsurprisingly this has a negative effect on their relationship,leaving Johnny spending much of his adulthood desperately seeking paternal approval. An admirer of Gospel music at an early age,he turns to rock n' roll apparently after hearing a young Elvis Presley at Sam Phillips' studio. Touring with pioneers like Jerry Lee Lewis and the King himself,he is happy to embrace the rock n' roll lifestyle. Meeting June Carter marks a turning - point in his life and the main thrust of 'Walk the line' is the story of their time together. As a Brit I am not au fait with the 'Johnny Cash - Country Legend' culture,I suspect most of the potential audience for this movie are far more knowledgeable about the man and his music than I and thus more qualified to talk about it. From a purely cinematic point of view I found it to be a little overlong but redeemed by the star performances,that of Reese Witherspoon in particular.Joaquim Pheonix I felt was a little monolithic,whereas Miss Witherspoon had light and shade.She appeared a fully - rounded person. The sound recording was excellent,the concerts - perhaps one or two too many - well staged. I left the cinema more concerned with the fate of Miss Carter than that of Mr Cash,proof - to me - that 'Walk the line' is Miss Witherspoon's movie.",7,1,2,14 March 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Is it 'cos I's old?' Sacha Cohen cons the chattering classes.......
","Because I'm 68 years old I wasn't fooled for a minute by 'Borat' any more than my father was fooled by 'Triumph of the will'.It is yet another movie purporting to be one thing whilst in fact being the exact opposite.Mr Baron Cohen fooled many of his Cambridge peers by making racism,sexism and pig-ignorance perfectly acceptable forms of humour under the guise of 'satirising' them.His character Ali('Is it cos I's black?') G crudely mocked black stereotypes whilst our Sacha winked knowingly and said he was in fact mocking white people who behaved like black people...........yeah,right. Amazingly the media fell for it - or pretended to fall for it - and sat back to count the money. Some within the University were not happy with his explanation,but rather than be seen as having no sense of post - modern humour,held their peace.Thus encouraged,Mr Cohen,rich,sophisticated, middle-class Jewish Cantabrigian looked round for more easy targets and found that East Europeans - dirt - poor,Muslims,uneducated,unsophisticated and cut off from mainstream Western Society and values were absolutely hilarious.He could make them seem like inbred 'untermenschen' and people would laugh because anything goes in post - modern irony baby... Even better,he could get his East European character - Borat - to go to America and rely on the Americans inborn good - nature and generosity to make themselves objects of derision as Borat/Cohen(the line between the two blurs somewhat)subjects them to his sophisticated scatological racist,sexist,xenophobic,anti - semitic misogynist rants and films their reaction.Brilliant.It's a wonder no one had ever thought of it before..........but of course they had and it was called 'Candid Camera'. So 'Borat' is just the movie for you if you like to see ordinary decent people humiliated by an 'Intellectual'who clearly considers himself vastly their superior. Don't be fooled for a moment - this isn't a smart satire on what's wrong with America,its an exploitative,crude,cruel and ultimately pointless exercise in sucking up to Guardianistas everywhere. If only they weren't too dazzled by their own cleverness to see it. I understand Cohen's next character is to be 'Bruno',a camp European fashionista.Cutting edge stuff eh Sacha?...........",1,3,6,14 April 2009
Skyfall," The medium is the message.Mr Mendes plays with 007...
","Mr Sam Mendes has had the nerve to take one of the cinema's biggest money - spinners and,well,spin it. In doing so he has made the first James Bond film that can stand on its merits and not merely drape itself round a carefully staged star performance. Certainly Mr D.Craig is more than adequate as OO7,albeit a slightly diminished 007,a bit worn round the edges,but he is not meant to dominate 'Skyfall',neither does he.Instead Mr Mendes uses an ageing Bond as a discourse on acknowledging the past and accepting that actions have consequences. In addition to this new reading of a very familiar character he has brought joined - up film - making to the franchise,during the course of which there are many joyous references from 'The lady from Shanghai' to Indiana Jones that had me laughing with delight;not a reaction one has come to expect a Bond film,however slick,to produce. Miss J.Dench - a bruised and vulnerable 'M'- gives her best film performance for some time. 'Skyfall' gives force to the argument that film is a directors' medium.",8,5,8,20 March 2013
The Young Victoria," Victoria's other secret.A proto - feminist in a patriarchal society.
","It is Queen Victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men.Shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to the extent that she became known as 'Mrs Melbourne'.After the death of her beloved husband,Albert,she was referred to as 'The Widow at Windsor',and years later,a long friendship with her Scottish ghillie John Brown earned her the nickname 'Mrs Brown'.Such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society. The reality is somewhat different and 'Young Victoria' goes some way towards putting the record straight,depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court. Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy,plotting and counter-plotting,naked ambition and sometimes,outright murder. As an 18 year old innocent,Victoria ascended to her uncle's throne,thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power-struggle between Prime minister Lord Melbourne and his rival Sir Robert Peel. Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely-honed cynicism and his well-polished gems of advice. Hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him,and even perhaps a little in love,an awe that he ruthlessly exploits,drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against Victoria's better judgement. Into the arena rides Prince Albert,on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium,keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe. At first a reluctant suitor,he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. 'The Young Victoria' is a beautifully photographed,brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown the Empress of India and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse........I don't think so. I must single out the remarkable Miss Emily Blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young Princess Margaret's.Hers is obviously the pivotal role, and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from Mr Jim Broadbent,Miss Miranda Richardson and Miss Harriet Walter,all immeasurably more experienced. The music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive. The fact that Britan flourished more under its two great queens,Elizabeth the First and Victoria,than at any other time is a matter Feminists might like to make more of,but,I suspect,like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable.If you can work out why there might be a Ph.D . in it.",9,5,9,12 March 2009
Lifeboat," A direct line from'Stagecoach' to 'Lifeboat' to 'Big Brother'...
","Shove a disparate group of people together in a small space and sit back and watch.It still works today as it did when Ford and Hitchcock made their earlier films. 'Lifeboat' is a microcosm of the free world's struggle against Nazism and during its course the twisted allure of that philosophy is displayed. We also see the morally corrupting aspect of war as the survivors turn on the Nazi U - Boat captain who has in fact very cleverly ( a bit like Capt Bligh) guided them through treacherous and uncharted seas to a German supply ship where he expects to be rescued and they expect to be put in a Concentraion Camp.They beat him to death with any implement that comes to hand. However,civilised behaviour is restored when they rescue a German crewman from the ship and spare his life after disarming him. A special word about Miss Tallulah Bankhead.Regarded as a dilettante at best,more often as a free - spirited maverick who dished the dirt in Harlem's jazz joints - as they used to say,and lived on controversial publicity,she was.when given the chance,a fine performer.Here she is splendidly disdainful,cynical but brave and the strongest character in the film. Not for another 13 years did another actress - Miss Rita Hayworth - have so effective a femme fatale mystery woman role (in 'Fire down below). This is a taut,tight piece of work which stands up with the director's best.Unhesitatingly recommended.",9,0,1,2 May 2012
Monty Python's Life of Brian," 'And now for something completely indifferent'
","The daring of it!How cutting edge!Those remarkable Python boys do it again with something to offend everybody!.............Give me a break will ya? Christianity is a soft target.And this movie does lampoon Christianity despite the clever - clever Oxbridge sophistry employed by Cleese and Co. to the contrary.I don't have a problem with that per se,my problem is that the makers lacked the courage to admit it.Surely a group as daring and innovative as the Pythons should have the balls to say 'yes,this is a movie that takes the pxss out of Christianity - and we don't care'. I went to see 'The Life of Brian' in the West End with a group of middle - aged schoolteachers and social workers all of whom were determined to demonstrate how unoffended they were by guffawing heartily at the drop of a hat.There was no one under 30 in the audience,perhaps an indication that the Pythons' appeal was to a demographic that found their humour familiar from years of being subjected to it from the original sources i.e. The Goon Show,Round the Horne,Marty Feldman and of course the great Spike Milligan who surely must have felt just a little rueful at accepting a small part in the movie that would never have existed had he not more or less single - handedly invented surreal radio thirty years earlier. Yes it is a funny movie,and I did laugh a lot,but daring and original it most certainly isn't.'Carry on Cleo' was funnier without the pretension and the faux daring. It is probably becoming clear that I am not a particular admirer of Pythonesque (the very word sends a shudder up my spine) humour. To me the whole group seem like smug,sniggering,cocky overgrown schoolboys who have been told how clever they are for so long that they have - for years -believed in their own publicity.Occasionally,one - like Michael Palin - will make a genuine effort to do something completely different(to coin a phrase) but even he cannot resist referring to his time with The Organisation on a regular basis. Terry Gilliam,perhaps the most talented of them all,broke free to make 'The Twelve Monkeys',one of the most dazzling of all 1990s movies,a creation of real daring and panache. If the boys really want to be brave and outrageous perhaps they should consider making 'The Life of Mohamed' but I really don't think they will,do you?",5,5,28,28 July 2007
Star Trek," 'Star Trek' guilty of not enchanting me...........Review no 1379..........
","It's noisy,it's long,it's flashy,it's for the computer game generation who need their whizz - bang quotient to stop their hands shaking.The body count is way above all the other Star Trek films put together,the special effects are stunning,the in - jokes are just on the right side of smug,but.................for me the film lacks heart - sentiment if you want to put it another way. Back in the day of Mr Roddenberry,the series had heart.Yes it was clunky,hokey and sometimes a bit portentous,but it was never mechanical. The 2009 version has no warmth,no characters even remotely vulnerable. Kirk and co have been turned into standard Hollywood superheroes with only the faintest resemblance to real human beings. Yes it's clever - clever;it might even be post -modern ironic (if I knew what that actually meant)but it's superficial gloss should not to be allowed to disguise it's shortcomings. You can ironically or otherwise refer to as many other films as you want,but you can still end up with something resembling a Steven Seagal movie with a billion dollar budget - and the new 'Star Trek does just that .",6,2,3,17 February 2012
As Good as It Gets," Ultimately an empty vessel making a lot of noise.
","If you think people with severe social deficiencies are amusing - perhaps you fell about laughing at 'Rain Man' - then 'As good as it gets' is just the movie for you.Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder is not funny,millions of people suffer from it in one form or another and I sincerely hope no decent and reasonable human being would dream of laughing at their symptoms. However,in the cinema,cloaked by anonymity and the herd instinct, audiences rolled in the aisles as Mr Jack Nicholson misused his considerable skills to caricature all the most obvious outward signs of this distressing illness.Shame on him. And shame on Mr Gregg Kinnear and Mr Cuba Gooding Jr for adding two more stereotypical gays to an already overcrowded field. Only Miss Helen Hunt escapes admonition in another role that could easily have slipped over into clich√© as the single mother. She is so good she doesn't deserve to be in this movie. I can see why the Academy liked 'As good as it gets',it has three flashy performances heavily flavoured with the ham it delights to reward so regularly,the prestige of Mr Nicholson's name and the gold - plated production values of an Aaaron Spelling TV soap of the 1980s. But it is ultimately an empty vessel making a lot of noise.",3,3,8,25 March 2007
Inglourious Basterds," 'Nein,nein,nein,nein,nein'.....Adolf Hitler
","One thing straight away - this isn't 'les regles du jeu',this is a ludicrously overcooked fantasy aimed at little boys who go 'kak-kak-kak' whilst pretending to fire machine guns. The director - if that's not too strong a word - has 'cleverly'- if that's the word - appropriated almost every scene from some cinematic source and camped it up to the extent that 'Inglourios Basterds' is what you might call a gay romp through post - D.Day Occupied France. There is no sense here of 'lions led by donkeys',merely psychoes led by madmen. Mr Brad Pitt is dreadfully bad as Aldo Ray - yes,I got that thank you Mr Tarantino,surely the worst performance even Mr T has coaxed out of an established actor. He is i/c of a cadre of sadistic psychopathic Jewish 'soldiers' whose main task seems to be murdering and desecrating the bodies of German soldiers who are far braver and more honourable than themselves. This of course is Tarantino 'irony'. There is a sub - plot involving a 'comic' Hitler attending a movie premiere in Paris where Mr Pitt's brave lads slaughter virtually the entire audience whilst the cinema burns down (don't ask). The sad thing is there are one or two moments in the 2 and a half hours (and it seemed much longer)where you can see (or glimpse,anyway)that under all the self - indulgent post - modernism,Mr Tarantino has an eye for an image but it is buried under so much baggage and he is so deeply up his own bum that it hardly gets a look in. The opening sequence where a Nazi officer(clever,sophisticated.multi - lingual and quite,quite mad) questions a French farmer about his Jewish neighbours who have slipped the net,is by far the best thing in the movie.I even enjoyed the reference to the title sequence of 'The Sound of Music' where the daughter runs across the fields like Julie Andrews, but that was quite enough references for me,thank you. Nobody said 'So they call me 'Concentration Camp' Erhardt..'but they got too damned close for comfort.",1,9,16,14 May 2012
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," An interesting novel totally screwed...........................................
","'Kefalonia,Greece,1940'.We know that because it's just been on the screen.In case we think it's Kefalonia,Mississippi,presumably.Then to make sure we are on message a Greek dance starts up.To allay any lingering doubts,another ten minutes into screen time and there's another Greek dance.OK,thank you,we got it the first time. Unfortunately all this desire to impose ethnicity is thwarted by the appearance of the very English Mr John Hurt as the wise doctor/philosopher Iannis and the very Spanish Miss Penelope Cruz as his daughter Pelagia. Mr Hurt has a grey walrus moustache and disconcertingly black hair. He doesn't speak so much as spout wise doctor/philosopher stuff so you just know he is really really wise and really really loves his daughter in a wise fatherly way.She becomes engaged to Mandras a simple fisherman after he throws her into the sea.Then war comes and her simple fisherman goes off to fight the Hun.Irrepressible child of nature that she is,Pelagia skips gaily along the footpaths surrounding her village.The island is invaded by the Italian army with only one thing on their minds singing extracts from Puccini and playing various stringed instruments. Well there is one other thing on their minds as exemplified by that dratted handsome Capt Corelli when we first see him looking in his dress uniform as if he would be happier piloting Thunderbird 3.On spotting Pelagia in the crowd as they march through town to accept the surrrender he orders his men to salute 'Bella bambina at 2 'o clock' thus identifying himself as a dog and a sexist at once.A stereotypical Italian then. Mr Nicholas Cage plays Capt Corelli in a way that clearly pleases him. He and child of nature fall in love which Miss Cruz valiantly tries to depict,her brow furrowing with effort from time to time.Wise doctor/philosopher Iannis thinks no good will come of it.The Italians surrender as soon as is decently possible leaving the dour humourless Germans to fight alone with entirely foreseeable results. Not to be confused in any way with the well - received novel of the same title,'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' sets clich√© upon clich√© and devil take the hindmost.It tries for the sweep of a David Lean but lacks the absolute control of his subject that categorised his work. Should American viewers wonder why Europe is still so bedevilled a continent then they can rest assured that the Greeks still hate the Germans,the Germans hate the Italians and the English hate everybody. Peace - to Europeans - is merely a continuation of war by other means.",5,2,4,22 November 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Funny,anachronistic,beautifully written.If you have tears to shed....
","A group of actors crowd noisily round a table at an inn in 16th century London.They comprise the cast of the first ever production of 'Romeo and Juliet'.As they chatter excitedly about their new roles,the one selected to play the nurse is asked 'What's it about then?'He leans forward..'Well,it's about this nurse......'Thus is encapsulated the small totally self - absorbed and artificial world of The Theatre, unchanged in over 400 years and I ,for one ,am eternally grateful for it.Tom Stoppard - a witty and erudite playwright - has taken advantage of that premise and recreated Shakespeare as a 20th century man weighed down with the eternal problems of the creative writer plus the additional burdens constraining those involved in the Elizabethan theatre.Deliberately anachronistic and very funny 'Shakespeare in love' presents the Bard as a frustrated genius trapped in a loveless marriage pursued by creditors and desperately seeking backers for his new play. Just as 'The Dresser' depended on a working knowledge of Lear for its full effect so 'Shakespeare in love' will offer more reward to those familiar with the workings of 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Twelfth Night'. Having said that,one of the beauties of this marvellous film is that it can be enjoyed by anyone who loves words regardless of their familiarity or otherwise with 16th century drama. Notwithstanding the casting of Miss G.Paltrow in the female lead this is a very English production ,no slick David Mamet one - liners ,just the throw away humour redolent of 'The Fast Show' very popular on TV in England at that time that also provided a number of members of the cast.Admirers of non - sequitur humour will have a field day. For all that the performances are uniformly first - rate and acknowledging that Miss J.Dench impressed the Academy no end with her showy turn as Queen Elizabeth,'Shakespeare in Love' is predominantly a writer's triumph. A few words about the ending,filmed not at some exotic location but at Holkham Sands in Norfolk '...if you have tears to shed - prepare to shed them now'.",10,0,0,11 April 2007
12 Monkeys," 'Destroy the human race?......'s a great idea!'
","Great Fun.A dazzling virtuoso display of directorial tricks during which one can find 'hommages' to-and this is by no means a complete list - 'Alien','Star Wars','Citizen Kane','Close Encounters','2001''Blade Runner','One flew over the cuckoo's nest','Paths of Glory' and several Hitchcock films culminating in lengthy extracts from 'Vertigo'.Mr Gilliam also quotes from his own work - the very definition of chutzpah.Well,if you're that good,why not?Reduced to the bare bones the story is of the resolution of a fragmentally remembered dream which is shown at various stages of the film,each stage revealing something extra until it finally comes together at the climax.This is masterfully done and a textbook exercise in cinematic teasing.Mr Gilliam takes a not very original plot about the destruction of 99% of the human race by a man - made virus and weaves it round the recurring dream idea and adds the catalyst of a reluctant time traveller (Mr B.Willis running the gamut of emotion from A to C for once). Mr B.Pitt shows off a bit as the maladjusted son of the corporate Bad Guy (Mr C.Plummer who,for some reason,choses to play him with a terrible Southern accent).Miss M.Stowe plays the only other serious part in the film,a psychiatrist entrusted with the care of both Mr Willis and Mr Pitt - surely a job too big for any one human being.The rest of the cast are comic book figures.She does a nice line in confused disbelief,an attitude I imagine she shared with a fair percentage of the audience.But the point in 'The Twelve Monkeys' is not in the acting,the writing or the plot.It is a signature piece for the wildly iconoclastic Mr. Gilliam,and it is entirely his creature. It's showy,it's flashy,it's astonishing.I loved it.",10,3,5,15 April 2007
The Other Boleyn Girl," The adventures of Anne Boleyn's smarter sister.......
","Mary was of course Anne's older sister,not younger,and she and her siblings were pimped by their social climbing father the appalling Thomas Boleyn(even the name 'Boleyn' was an affectation borrowed from the French Court,their real names was 'Bullen').The overall feeling is that if Henry had a taste for bestiality Boleyn would have pimped one of his wolfhounds. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is trash,basically.Only Miss S.Johansson escapes unscathed as 'The King's Great Matter' is presented as a bodice - ripper that almost plays like a badly - written satire about the Tudor Court. Eric Bana is lousy as Henry the Eighth,portraying England's last all - powerful king as a spoiled 14 year old.Here was a sophisticated,learned man seen as a bearded Zac Effron. There were no feminists in Tudor England,whatever thoughts Lady Boleyn,who had allegedly been Henry's mistress as a young woman, might have had about the King's conduct about her children she kept to herself in order to survive. Mary Boleyn bore the King's Bastard and kept her head when many about her were losing theirs - a not inconsiderable achievement. That may be a subject worthy of a movie,but one would hope that it might be rather better than this load of tosh.",1,6,7,24 December 2010
Bloody Sunday," Two Tribes
","In 1972 the British Army was still bemused as to how it had become to be regarded as an invading force when only 3 years earlier it had been welcomed by the Catholic community as a means of protecting them against Protestant aggression. The Marxist IRA had done its work well and the Brits were hated,despised and murdered if it could be done with no risk to the killers. The Army was embittered and resentful,confused as to its role . Bloody Sunday was a disaster waiting to happen in a testosterone - fuelled cauldron of mutual distrust and hatred. In Mr Greengrass's film the blame for this tragedy is laid firmly at the door of the British Government. The only innocents are those that died. Mr J.Nesbitt is superb as the Stormont MP leading the march to protest against Internment. As in real life,the moment the first stone is thrown all bets are off. The two sides confront one another,and not surprisingly,the one with the biggest guns wins. Over 40 years have passed and vested interests amongst Republicans and senior British officials have ensured that the truth will never be known. The film is chaotic,jagged,noisy and bloody.There is no time for reflection,again as in real life. As details of the casualties filter through,the senior RUC man - hardly a provo sympathiser - says to a clearly shocked army officer,'Is this what you call a measured response?'. The truest and most significant line in the whole film.",8,1,1,29 June 2015
Elizabeth," 'I knew her before she was a virgin'Groucho Marx................
","Of course Groucho was talking about the wonderful Miss Doris Day and not the most powerful and ruthless of English Queens,but it's still all a matter of image and perception. Too often seen as a dried - up old woman with horror make up,it's a revelation to have Elizabeth 1 portrayed as a vital and passionate young woman with normal appetites.Miss C.Blanchett who can sometimes allow herself to indulge in a set of irritating mannerisms is quite mesmerising.From frightened vulnerable adolescent to confident determined grown woman,every change is completely believable.She is one of those fortunate actresses whom the camera loves. It is her performance that sets 'Elizabeth' above the run - of - the - mill.Because for the most part it comprises familiar actors putting on their posh voices and swishing about dramatically in various drafty castles around the country.Mr C.Eccleston is particularly guilty of excessive swishing,closely followed by Mr J.Fiennes. Mr G.Rush alone behaves as though he believes that people in Tudor times did not move about as if they were on the stage at Stratford - on - Avon. Monsieur Cantona once scored a wonderful winning goal against Liverpool in the Cup Final,that,surely,should be enough for any man? 'Elizabeth' is not a great movie,but it does contain one of the great movie performances,and that,surely,is enough for me.",7,1,2,25 January 2009
Billy Elliot," Simplistic patronising nonsense.Proof that P.T.Barnum was wrong.
","Working Title Films have produced some of the most twee movies ever made. At least Hugh Grant isn't in 'Billy Elliot',nor is that bloke famous for having a nice bum in 'Pride and Prejudice'. 'Billy Elliot' could be a 'New Labour' production.I'm sure it must be one of our Dear Leader's favourite films.It represents everything he and his woolly-minded Armchair Socialist chattering-class cronies hold dear. The Third Way,Non-Judgementalism,Inclusivism,Moral Equivalence,One Nationism,every clich√© of the Limp Left,every slightly pathetic belief of the 'It's grim oop North London' brigade is regurgitated in this fairy (no offence) story about a little boy who'd rather be a ballet dancer than have his brains scrambled in the boxing ring. Unless you've been living on the Planet Zarg for the last five or six years you'll know that the film is set in the tim e of the Miners' Strike (Hooray for Arthur Scargill - Yah boo sucks to Maggie Thatcher).Young Master Elliot's father and brother are striking miners (there's daring for you)and involved in scuffles with the police(scum) and neither are impressed when he reveals his ambition.His teacher(that nice Julie Walters - she's so good on the telly - and so often) believes in him and gets him an interview at Ballet School. Despite,in a rare macho moment,beating up a posh kid(that's all right then) he gets accepted. Saying goodbye to his best(and only,as far as I could make out) chum he discovers that this 11 year old pal is gay (the way 11 year old working class Geordies so often are),but doesn't hold it against him(if you'll pardon the expression). At the end,Dad and brother proudly go to see Billy in 'Swan Lake'.In the audience are Billy's ex-best mate and his black friend(there's daring for you).Billy,looking a well-preserved 30,leaps onto the stage and that's it.The only sound is people sniffling into their Kleenex and me snoring. Simplistic patronising nonsense then ,but proof that Mr P.T. Barnum ,actually,was wrong.",4,8,25,6 March 2006
Pirate Radio," The whole cast should be made to walk the plank.................
","Whereas in 'Love,actually' one might have imagined the director displaying a board marked 'Cry now' every few minutes,here he clearly has substituted 'Laugh now' with the same degree of subtlety. Ludicrous,badly acted,smug,self-referential,right-on and twee.Not a firm of posh lawyers but a description of Mr Curtis's body of work for the cinema.Almost as soporific as 'The Vicar of Dibley' that displays all the characteristics it is supposed to be satirising. Pirate radio stations were largely responsible for the appalling cult of the loud-mouthed talentless egomaniacal D.J.that has plagued the airwaves for the subsequent 40 years so quite why Mr Curtis should decide to commemorate this phenomenon is a bit beyond me.The terms 'bandwaggon jumping' and 'potboiler' have been bandied about but of course I couldn't possible comment on that. Mr B.Nighy does his usual irritating schtick,Sir Ken and Em slum it up and count the cash,it's all too predictable for words,or at least polite ones. A sign that perhaps at last the Britcom gravy train is coming off the rails,'The boat that rocked' was not quite the huge success it's makers had anticipated. If there'd have been a funny movie to be made out of pirate radio,Peter Rogers would have made it 40 years ago.He didn't then,and Richard Curtis hasn't now.",3,8,15,25 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," Laugh? - I nearly started............
","As someone who has never seen 'Shaun of the dead' I may be almost uniquely qualified to offer an unbiased and independent opinion on a movie that has been lauded as a comic masterpiece and a great piece of British cinema. Two words here you might not like to read...it isn't. Lampoons,irony skits,parody,satire,call the genre whatever you wish but it is not easy to do well.Poor satire is a cheap and easy way of getting laughs on the back of other people's hard work and 'Hot Fuzz' never veers from the obvious path for its whole length. Cop shows generally have become self - parodying,there's no point in taking the p*ss out of actors like Keanu Reeves who are already taking the p*ss out of earlier action movies in the first place. To the millions out there who clearly love seeing blood spilled in an 'ironic' way I can only say 'duh?' If 'Hot Fuzz' really is funnier than 'Shaun of the dead' then I would say my decision not to go and see the latter was - for me - the right one. And witless mugging is not great comic acting either. If you want to see a great genre parody watch 'Dead men don't wear plaid'.It has no gouts of blood,no bad language - but it has charm and wit by the shed load.Both of which are conspicuous by their absence in 'Hot Fuzz' I'm afraid.",4,1,3,3 March 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A sad film about the destructive power of love.
","'Brokeback Mountain' is a sad film about the destructive power of love. The danger of making a movie from a short story/novella with an explicit homosexual storyline is that - given the potentially enormous audience base as opposed to a relatively small readership for a cultish author - the work may be hi - jacked by those with a different agenda and used for their own political purposes. Thus 'Brokeback Mountain',the movie,has been declared by many as a 'Gay Masterpiece',a revolution in film - making and 'Empowering' for gay men. And it is of course none of those things. By setting it in the last year of the Kennedy Adminstration we are dealing with the mysterious past for most of its target audience.But even in repressed old England attitudes towards homosexuality were relaxing as a result of a wider general tolerance for individual sexual freedom as exemplified by the 'Lady Chatterley' trial when Penguin Books were acquitted of obscenity charges at the Old Bailey. 40 years later the battles have been won.This is reflected in the fact that apart from a few rumblings from the Fascist Right and the usual protests from the Bible Belt,the movie passed unscathed through mainstream theatres throughout the U.S. and Europe.It is preaching,then,to the converted.Not a revolution,a re - affirmation. Gay men and women do not need 'Empowering' - a patronising concept at the best of times - they have the same civil rights as everybody else. They do not have to use separate washrooms,sit in the back of the bus,eat in 'Gay Only' diners,they are not discouraged from voting..... to compare the treatment of gays to the treatment of black people is insulting to one faction and condescending to the other. What we have left in the movie 'Brokeback Mountain' relieved of its baggage is a very sad tale of two men who fall in love and because of the moral climate of the day are forced to live a lie.The tragedy is not only theirs but more so their wives.Two totally innocent women who,all unknowing,are being used and deceived by the men they love.All those lives ruined.If it had been made in 1964 the movie would have indeed been revolutionary,daring and sensational.By 2005 it is merely a look back to an age when the love that dare not speak its name still dared not speak its name.Now,perhaps,there are no more Great Causes for movie makers.",7,2,8,27 September 2008
Chicken Run," The Great Eggscape?The yolk goes on too long for me....
","Foghorn Leghorn...now there was a chicken;feisty,cocky,funny and with a great voice.Compared to him,Nick Park's collection of milquetoasts are a Mild Bunch indeed.I thoroughly enjoyed Aardman Animation's anthropomorphic commercials,but a good proportion of their appeal was based on the premise that they were voiced by 'real people' unaware as they spoke that their words would later be 'sampled'.Wallace and Grommit had a certain Northern charm,mainly provided by Peter Sallis,but 'Chicken Run' is too self - consciously cute and takes a one - joke concept too far.Bigger is not necessarily better nor indeed funnier.The great Silent comedians knew a thing or two about brevity being the soul of wit;if the Mona Lisa was twice the size it wouldn't be twice as good. I found the movie a great disappointment.It quickly runs out of chicken jokes and the references to various PoW films start wearing thin early on.This is a good 15 minute short dragged on far beyond its welcome.",5,0,2,25 March 2008
L.A. Confidential," Sometimes betrayal is the only option.
","As a film of an unfilmable novel this is somewhat of an achievement. As a film per se it is very nearly a masterpiece. When I read 'L.A. Confidential' it was my first venture into Mr James Ellroy's seriously weird world where much of the enjoyment is in the idiosyncratic writing style.I never imagined a movie could be made of the book and,of course,it hasn't been.What we have is the title,some of the characters and a severely pared down plot that bears a resemblance to the novel but fails to capture Mr Ellroy's bizarre voyage to the distant shores of obsessive sexuality.'The book is mine....the movie is theirs',he said when invited to comment on the screen adaptation. So forget the novel then and watch 'L.A. Confidential' THE cop movie of the 1990s.Set in the early fifties when cops were tough and the third degree was commonplace it depicts an LAPD that had become judge and jury in its own bailiwick.It's a story of loyalty and betrayal involving cops,reporters,lawyers and crooks.It's a film of extreme violence,much of it played out in the unnaturally bright and sunny L.A. hills. Mr Kevin Spacey has been lauded for his rather flashy role as Sgt Jack Vincennes but for me the performance of the movie is Mr Russell Crowe's as Bud White the not very bright but shrewd thuggish detective. He is easy meat for the manipulative Dudley Smith (Mr James Cromwell) but his Achilles Heel is a sympathy for abused women,and at the same time it is his salvation.Of all the actors in the movie only Mr Crowe looks as if he belongs in his character's clothes.Bud's sports jacket and casual trousers look suits Mr Crowe as to the manner born while the rest of the cast appear too conscious of the fact that they are wearing '1950s clothes' rather than simply clothes. There is a lot of good period detail including an appearance by Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker(the coolest of the cool) lookalikes. Everyone involved is eventually confronted with a dilemma concerning loyalty.How these interlock and how they are resolved is the key to this movie.In the end it all comes down to one question.Is betrayal ever an acceptable option?'L.A. Confidential' seems to be saying that sometimes its the only option.",9,1,2,1 May 2006
We Were Soldiers," War is Hell,Mel.
","The United States of America lost 58,000 lives in Vietnam.I don't know even a Ball Park figure for the number of Vietnamese killed.It is at the very least arguable whether the Americans were defending freedom or satisfying the ambitions and ego of Kennedy,Johnson and Nixon.The 'Domino Theory' was very much in vogue at the time,this has since been proved to be not quite right - rather like 'Flat Earth'. One of the few things Harold Wilson is remembered fondly for is his refusal to commit British troops to this war of attrition where,basically,over a period of ten years from the events depicted in 'We were soldiers' America's political will to fight was ground down and 58,000 of their fighting men died,ultimately,for nothing.God knows the military flesh was willing but the political spirit was weak,so to speak.I have nothing but respect for the brave Americans who fought the war both on the ground and ,afterwards, back home,excoriated by many for being sent against their will to be cannon-fodder in a foreign country for a cause that many were - to put it mildly - doubtful about. As a Brit with no axe to grind -and well aware that,along with the Russians,the Americans saved our arses in WW2 - I watched this movie with an open mind.I wouldn't presume to argue with the Vietnam vets who found it an accurate account of events,they were there,I wasn't. As a movie,per se,judged purely on those terms,it is a mixture of the harrowing and the clich√©d.Sam Elliot's redoubtable Sergeant Major echoes back to Nigel Green in 'Zulu' and many another gruff but caring noncom in movieland.Presumably there were such guys in real life,certainly if I were a grunt I'd feel much better having one around.Mel Gibson's Col Moore certainly puts himself in harm's way for most of the duration, a charismatic leader and a man of courage.Clearly the message here is the Americans were not lions led by donkeys. The NVA is treated with more respect than usual,as befits an organisation that out-thought if not out-fought a Superpower. I found the ending where the NVA leader replaced the tattered American flag slightly strained my credibility but maybe it happened.As Jonathan Miller said in 'Beyond the Fringe'...'Funny thing,war'. There is very little fresh that Hollywood can concoct in the 'War Movie' genre beyond increased technical advances in sound and special effects to increase its reality factor,but until you actually have to dodge the bullets the cinema is never going to produce an 'authentic' film. War is hell,soldiers die horribly,it's noisy,terrifying and very,very dangerous.Sitting in our air-conditioned,popcorn-crunching safety we have absolutely no idea of what it's really like. 'We were soldiers' deserves respect for not sinking into the cigar- chomping foul-mouthed sneering G.I.mould .Whether it accurately depicts the event it concerns only those who were there are qualified to say.",7,2,3,8 August 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Jules et Jim' goes West.
","Many Westerns can be read as having homoerotic subtexts with the advantage of 21st century attitudes and the apparent need of modern - day critics to seem 'aware' of what was never intended in the first place.This tendency slowly but surely prepared the ground for film makers to introduce openly gay characters into the genre until it climaxed - if you'll pardon the expression - in 'Brokeback Mountain',a full -on adaptation of a charming short story by Annie Proulx. In 1969,even at the rag - end of the liberal 1960s ,the world wasn't ready for a story of man - love between chaps in chaps,especially one starring such hetero heroes as Mr P.Newman and Mr R.Redford .So Mr Hill gave them the very pretty Miss K.Ross as a shared love interest that neither of the boys,frankly,seemed very interested in,being pretty much wrapped up in each other. With this strangely asexual menage a trois borrowed from 'Jules et Jim' (complete with anachronistic bicycle riding sequence)and other devilish nouvelle vague tricks Mr Hill possibly hoped to set the Western along a new path but,in fact,succeeded in closing the genre down for a few years allowing Mr C.Eastwood to re - invent it almost single - handedly. 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is wonderful entertainment,witty, clever,beautifully photographed and a hymn to the physical beauty of Messrs Newman and Redford but it isn't a great Western.In fact it's almost a parody of Western conventions. In pursuit of a fast buck (always somebody else's) Butch and Sundance are like a pair of computer geeks let loose in 'P.C.World' as they rob banks and trains more or less at will and with a sort of open - faced innocence.Moving to Bolivia (the way you do) they come up against the army who do not share the widespread vicarious admiration their banditry had apparently caused back home and when cornered in some adobe hacienda decide to go out literally with all guns blazing - cue stop action and sepia fade.A nicely mythic ending that rather spoilt the chances of Butch and Sundance Part 2. There are no incorruptible lawmen,there is no great quest ,no wrongs are righted,no maidens saved.The world has not been made a better place by their passing - except for bank owners and railroad clerks.In short 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is not really a Western at all. But it is immense fun and I enjoyed it hugely. The boys got together a few years later to make 'The Sting' which was better in every department - especially the music.I mean,'Raindrops keep falling on my head'? What was that all about?",8,0,1,10 April 2007
Snatch," 6 cans of Stella,a prawn vindaloo and thee.......
","In the gutter and looking down,that's 'Snatch'.Obviously its extremely violent,foul-mouthed and aimed at blokes under 30 who think Mr Vinnie Jones is the mutt's nuts.Cheap laughs,racism - 'I hate fxxxxx pikeys' is a constant refrain - abound and the movie continues to demonstrate the director's peculiar sycophancy to the South London demi - monde. One day those Frankie Fraser wannabees are going to get fed up with being portrayed as beetle-browed psychopaths without the wit to stay out of the nick long enough to sit through 15 three minute rounds. Here Mr Ritchie has trawled through the pages of 'Rent an 'ard bastard' and come up with a 'comic' cast whose idea of doing comedy is to read their lines like Morecambe and Wise,almost nodding and winking at the audience to let them in on the gag. The worst offender is the aforementioned Mr Jones who,regretfully, displays all the signs of a man who has come to believe his own publicity. The bareknuckle boxing plot has Irish Traveller Mr Brad Pitt outsmarting the crafty cockneys at their own game - not perhaps the most challenging of tasks - and the saga of the big.big,big,big diamond is more than a little reminiscent of Stanley Kramer's early sixties masterpiece but instead of under the Big Dubbleya,the treasure ends up inside a traveller's dog. Best viewed as a twenty - something bloke with a bunch of other twenty - something blokes,belching,breaking wind and necking the Stella as if there was no tomorrow. If that is not your thing I can honestly advise you to give it a wide berth.",3,8,21,30 June 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Overheated,over- -rated,over -long,over - acted.Underwhelming.
","There is more ham on display in 'Dr Strangelove' than on the ham counter in Sainsbury's on a day when ham is on special offer.Look at the names involved...George C.Scott,Sterling Hayden,Slim Pickens,Keenan Wynn,Peter Sellers,Peter Bull.....................none of them actually renowned for understatement and all under the control - for want of a better word - of a director who was to prove throughout his career that he was often unwilling or unable to restrain his actors on the one hand or motivate them on the other.In a number of his best known works the human beings are merely ciphers,secondary to the machinery,be that machinery a rifle,a coca - cola machine,a computer or a B 52 bomber. In 1964 we lived under a constant largely imaginary threat of nuclear holocaust.It kept us in line in much the same way as the threat of Al Quaeda does today.And the threat of eternal damnation did two hundred years earlier. Instead of the big bad Reds it is 'The axis of evil' and 'Rogue States' that are our enemy now.The result for us is just the same,we meekly hand over our taxes to whoever at the moment is slopping around in the trough and they keep the shareholders at British Aerospace Arms Division and Boeing in the style to which they have become accustomed. 'Dr Strangelove',like many a Kubrick movie,is merely an overstatement of the bloody obvious.It is clothed with the trappings of the satire boom which was reaching its peak at the time,Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce in the U.S.,'Private Eye' and 'Beyond the Fringe' here in the U.K. In the persona of Dr. Strangelove himself,Mr P.Sellers gives one of the worst performances ever seen in a so - called' serious ' movie.This is closely followed by George C.Scott and Sterling Hayden in a tie for runner - up. Much like Richard Attenborough's 'Oh!, what a lovely war' ,Kubrick's movie tells us what we already know and hammers it into us like a sadistic maths teacher with a blackboard rubber.War is a Bad Thing. Nuclear Bombs are a bad thing.Letting them off without proper supervision can be dangerous.Well,thank you Stanley.",4,4,16,5 January 2008
The Expendables," Barney and Biggles - two guys saving the world with a flying boat.........
","Of course Flying Officert/Major/Captain/Inspector Bigglesworth(depending on which stage of his career you find him at) was meant to be a hero to British schoolboys especially those who would be tasked with keeping The Empire running later in life.
Presumably this is not so with Mr Stallone's Barney Ross(named after the boxer - biopic 'Monkey on my back'?) .
Although to be fair to him ,in the opening scene he displays the patience of a saint in dealing with a psycho pirate.
But,once he goes..he goes.
And whilst Biggles can rely on his chums Algy,Ginger and Bertie,Barney has really only Jason Statham to help him annihilate a dictator's private army.
Wearing only jeans and a tee shirt Mr Statham finds an endless supply of throwing knives which hit their target unerringly during their first encounter with the enemy.
Biggles thought knives were the province of the slightly shady 'foreigner' and,to the best of my knowledge of the canon never resorted to their use.
There is a plot - beloved of movie makers for the last thirty five years - involving ex - CIA men who Barney has promised current CIA man(Bruce Willis)
terminate with extreme prejudice.
Just so you know you've not been transported back to 1985 there's a waterboarding scene.
'The Expendables' is an action movie.That is its raison d'etre.
The one character that had remotely any depth was Mr Mickey Rourke,much maligned and misunderstood in my opinion.
I was pleased to see him.However briefly.
I loved the 'Tom and Jerry' violence,the satisfying explosions,the total lack of logic.....it's a bloke thing.
Half the population are too smart to fall for it,I guess.",7,0,0,7 March 2018
Alien," The eye of an artist,not that of an accountant.
","Ridley Scott has made two good films,'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'. Both concern themselves with men and women functioning in an artificial environment,an arena of perpetual darkness where the only light is that created by machinery.In both the challenge to the survival of the main character comes from 'otherness'.Of the two,'Alien' is the more likely to be regarded by future generations as a work of lasting merit. Constrained by a comparatively small budget,Mr Scott pushed his and his cast and crew's creativity and ingenuity to the limits.Miss Sigourney Weaver seized the opportunity the part of Lt. Ripley provided her to become a beacon for the empowerment of women. The special effects,although small - scale compared to the likes of 'Star Wars',are beautifully realised and genuinely shocking. 'Alien' is a haunted house movie set in deep space,Mr Scott's achievement is in spinning that familiar theme to the extent where its very familiarity is hidden by his smoke and mirrors. Mr.James Cameron's 'Aliens' is flashier,noisier and more populist,but it is the work of an artisan rather than an artist.You get more bang for your buck but it's movie making by numbers. In 'Alien' Mr Scott's vision comes to fruition in relative austerity, but it remains his vision and not that of a committee,it is a movie made with the eye of an artist,not that of an accountant.",10,3,7,20 August 2006
The Book Thief," 'Ve have vays of making you talk........'
","It's heart may be in the right place but 'The Book Thief' suffers mightily from the almost impossible task of translating a book which was basically about the power of words into a medium that is often at its best when it uses as few words as possible. When an illiterate young girl is adopted by a poor but worthy German family prior to the outbreak of the second world war her desire to better herself is aided and abetted by her adoptive father. As the influence of The Party grows the family give shelter to a Jew thus endangering all of them. That's about it,really in basic terms,but the girl and the fugitive from Nazism develop a friendship and he eventually leaves the house in order to protect them all. The village is destroyed in a bombing raid and only the girl survives. In the end,a bit like in 'Titanic',we see the mementoes of her long life and history. It's all very standard stuff but somehow unaffecting when we should be in floods of tears. What happened to 'Death'?Here he is an almost peripheral figure whereas in the novel he binds it together and adds to our understanding of the actions of the characters. And the German accents ?They were very much of the 'Ve have vays of making you talk'variety and merely distracted the viewer.We know they're supposed to be Germans,for heaven's sake,this isn't 'Hallo,Hallo!' where Herr Flick of the Gestapo is going to limp in slapping his leg with his baton. Mr Rush and Miss Watson were particularly guilty of giving us 1950s British War film Germans,but then they say there's nothing like a foreign accent as a prop an actor. I did want to like 'The Book Thief' and I did want to be moved by it.Unfortunately I didn't and I wasn't.",4,0,0,23 April 2017
Elf," 'Goodbye Mr Narwhal'....
","Why is British Christmas TV so damned depressing?There is an annual Yuletide Cull in all our favourite soaps,characters we have let into our homes for months or years get raped,pillaged,bludgeoned or stabbed or emotionally destroyed with indecent haste over a four day period,leaving us rubbing our eyes with disbelief.Of all the Christmas Specials only 'The Royle Family' was even vaguely uplifting.As Jim Royle would say,'Happy Christmas - my ar*e!'So in desperation I scoured 'Radio Times'(other listings magazines are available)for a movie to get me out of the slough of despond.'Santa Claus - the movie' lasted 10 minutes,a multitude of 'Chrismas Carol' clones had me reaching for the Amontillado.'A matter of life and death'?A fine movie but hardly likely to warm the cockles of my heart........'Elf'?Never heard of it.With nothing to lose except my taste for mince pies I turned to Filmfour as I have so often done more in hope than anger before.Bingo!! 'Elf' is 100% a Christmas movie.It has elves in it(honest!),reindeer,some cute North Pole creatures including a wonderfully surreal narwhal that pops its head out of the water to say farewell to Buddy(Mr W.Ferrell) as he leaves on his Odyssey to the Big Apple. Chief amongst the elves is the wonderfully laconic Mr B.Newhart - remembered with affection by my generation for his brilliantly inventive one - sided telephone conversations.His is the voice - over that helps the story move along. What I loved most about 'Elf' was its unremitting optimism,its belief in the inherent decency of mankind despite all the evidence to the contrary not only in 2003 but even more so today. It has all the wonder and innocence of childhood and the deeply - held conviction that we lose rather than gain wisdom as we grow older. Mr J.Caan,splendid as Buddy's natural father, is a deeply suspicious man totally unable to accept his newly - acquired son at face value.Miss M.Steenburgen - perhaps more in touch with her inner child - has an immediate empathy with him.Here is an actress who has grown more beautiful and honest as she has got older. With all the best bits from many earlier Christmas movies lovingly embedded,'Elf' is a pure pleasure for adult or child. Together with its diametric opposite,'Scrooged',it will certainly play at my house for many Christmasses to come,and as far as I'm concerned the BBC can go and jump for their licence fee next year.",8,1,2,28 December 2008
Shutter Island," Cop who liberated the Death Camps goes into meltdown........
","Not a 'Horror Flick' as far as I'm concerned,but a Hitchcockian exercise in delving beneath the surface of a routine Cop story. Much the same as 'Psycho' in many respects then. Clearly Mr Scorsese has studied The Master's oeuvre and come up with a smart tribute hiding behind the schlock - horror label and the trappings of slasher - flickdom. It is 1954.Traumatised cop Mr L.de Caprio is called to what used to be known in less sensitive times as an Insane Asylum when a patient goes missing. He has his own agenda as he believes the arsonist who killed his family may be detained there. With his partner he starts making investigations that lead him to believe some kind of 'Reds under the beds' conspiracy has taken place. The Superintendent,Mr.B.Kingsley,is less than helpful,adding credence to the cop's suspicions. A convoluted plot ensues whereby - aided by liberal use of flashback - Mr de Caprio is drawn more and more deeply into the mystery of the missing patient and its wider significance for him. Twist follows twist until the ultimate turn at the end which is open to various interpretations. After about 15 minutes a vague memory was nagging at me and eventually I recalled that I had read 'Shutter Island' in novel form two or three years ago and it says much for Mr Scorcese's skill that I still found the ending brilliantly ambivalent. Mr de Caprio plays the deeply troubled detective quite brilliantly. He is a man who has seen things no person should have to see,both in wartime and peacetime.Just how much more can he take?",10,1,4,5 June 2015
Lost in Translation," A small oasis of humanity in the desperate life of a big city.
","Jet - lagged, bleary eyed and jaundiced,Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo to star in a whisky commercial and,incidentally,pick up a $2,000,000 fee. As he stumbles out of his cab at the hotel a huge poster of himself confronts him.It is quickly established here that he is married,well -known and well -off and rather blase.He is courteous to the over eager Japanese company people who meet him but purposely distant.It's clear he doesn't give much of himself away. Scarlett Johansson is staying at the same hotel.22 years old,recently married Ivy Leaguer whose husband is a photographer on an assignment to shoot rock bands.She is far cleverer than he,and although she loves him she is beginning to wonder whether being married to him was such a good idea after all.He is totally self - absorbed. Miss Coppola transmits this information to us almost before we know it,whilst we are being distracted by the garish aspect of the city itself which becomes the third character if you like,a vital component in the movie and the catalyst that slowly but inexorably brings Miss Johansson and Mr Murray together.He is superficially pleasant enough to encourage strangers to talk to him in a bar but withdraws very quickly.When Miss Johansson walks over to him he is willing to endure a two minute encounter but not much more.As their paths cross by accident or design in the claustrophobic world of the hotel they become more aware of each other's situation.Tentatively,very tentatively,they begin to reach out to one another. They are refugees from 'The City' both as in Tokyo itself and the 'city' as in the values system as exemplified by the culture that encourages a young man to make a living sucking up to rock stars and photographing them and an old man to make $2000,OOO by drinking iced tea and pretending it's whisky.They are companions in disenchantment and alienation. They hang out and just talk together about anything and everything,trivial or important,impersonal or intimate.It soon becomes clear that by movie conventions they should fall in love or at least have sex together,but Murray knows more than Johansson that what they have is too precious to risk.He is not averse to extra - marital sex as he demonstrates by sleeping with a bar singer,but he is wise enough to know the difference between sex and love. In the end of course they have to part,which they do stiltedly and formally at the hotel as he gets a taxi to the airport.On the journey through the city he spots a blonde head in the crowd and orders the driver to stop.As he follows the girl you begin to wonder whether Miss Coppola will use the movie clich√© and have her turn around and be someone else,but no,she's too honest for that .They hold each other and kiss for the first and last time.Words pass between them but are lost in the sound of the traffic,perhaps a last comment on how big city life has suborned all human feeling and that human beings themselves have become merely a small and not particularly important part of a great noisy,overcrowded corrupt and corrupting inferno.",9,1,2,26 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," In which Miss A.Hathaway goes from Annie Hall to Jerry Hall........
","Miss Hathaway gives a spot - on imitation of the young Diane Keaton in this Selznickian take on the old 'Faust' theme.I almost expected her to say 'Well,la - di - da!',certainly the temptation to have done so must have been great.Miss Streep as the devil called 'Priestly' (well, la - di - da indeed)seduces innocent young wannabe journo away from her avowed intent to fight for truth,justice and the American Way,and tempts her with the lure of Prada and Jimmy Choos. In the weird somewhat perverse world of high fashion where supermodels - like Premier League footballers - seem to be above the law,the values appear to be those of bling and conspicuous consumption.Vacuous anorexic women are fawned over and the tabloids hover with all the grace of hyenas fighting over a rotting corpse. Why the presumably intelligent Northwestern alumna would want to get involved in this incestuous,self - perpetuating,preposterous so -called industry is beyond my feeble imagination,but get involved she does. She very quickly changes from Annie Hall to Jerry Hall. I would tentatively suggest that most male viewers would prefer her as the former rather than the latter. Because this is not actually a true story,she reverts back to Annie in the end and is saved from eternal damnation - phew. Miss Streep - unaccountably nominated for an Oscar - seems barely alive for much of the movie.The only performance that could not have been equalled by Pixar Animation is that of Miss Blunt as Miss Streep's P.A. She alone has the stuff of humanity. As a Brit OAP I doubt I belong to the demographic the producers were aiming at.Just as well,really.",4,5,8,27 April 2009
Bridget Jones's Diary," Inhabits a neverland of foul mouthed media luvvies.Terrible.
","It is clear from reading a lot of reviews from this site that there are many who sincerely believe that 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a story of real English people and that the whole country is populated by extremely irritating types who all work in 'The Media' and live smug,self - satisfied lives and have big houses in the country where they turn up en famille every Christmas rather like children on holiday from the public school they all undoubtedly attended.They are all terribly,terribly well - spoken and most certainly don't buy their clothes from Matalan. They all met up at 'University',Cambridge,generally,rather than Middlesex or Manchester and live in an almost incestuous round of dinner parties and soirees.Mr Cleaver and Mr Darcy - rivals for Miss Jones's hand in the movie - met at Cambridge.What a surprise.We are not told much of Miss Jones's background but she is most definitely not a working - class English girl as fondly imagined.Miss Zellwegger is spared the need to 'do' Estuary English and settles for a sweet'Well- educated' accent although it is not clear how well - educated Miss Jones has actually been.Well enough presumably to have heard of F.R. Leavis but not well enough to have known he has been dead rather a long time, much to her better educated Cambridge boss's amusement.The England portrayed in this movie sets a lot of store by one - upmanship like that where the intellectually and socially superior can feel comfortable in their superiority,and say what you like about Mr Grant - and I am by no means an admirer - he is very comfortable in the sort of role where he can patronise those less fortunate. To him Miss Jones is,basically,a good sh*g and, almost, you might say,a bit of rough.So he does. Then he dumps her. Hardly pausing to take breath,Miss Jones changes her affections to his college pal Mr Firth,hardly the act of a feisty,independent 21st century woman one would have thought.What is it they say 'Man is to woman as bicycle is to fish'?Don't tell Bridget. As for any other Richard Curtis work I did not believe in a single minute of this film.Mr Grant has gone beyond the merely irritating,Mr Firth should really try to display some sign of life.The constant use of the 'F' word is no more amusing here than in 'Full Metal Jacket' where at least it was excusable. Salman Rushdie shouldn't give up his day job. This is a film set in England for people who have never been to England,about the English for people who've never met any.Do so on the strength of 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and I guarantee you'll be disappointed.",3,2,4,3 August 2008
Notting Hill," 'Ohmigosh,look here,I mean,er,er,......yes it's a Hugh Grant movie
","Had Hugh Grant not existed we would have been forced to invent him if only to banish the whippet and Woodbine heroes forever to that strange land somewhere over the M25 where no filmmakers live. He was in the vanguard of the resuscitated middle classes who gleefully began filling our screens in such self - regarding fluff as 'Four Weddings and a funeral' . In 'Notting Hill' he plays a Trustafarian who falls in love with a huge Hollywood Star who is so well - known that he doesn't recognise her. He owns a book shop so he can appear to be clever(probably an Oxbridge man)and wear glasses without seeming girlie.His flatmate is played by Mr Rhys Ifans who is apparently Welsh and clearly believes he is giving one of the great comedy performances.The huge Hollywood star is played by Julia Roberts in not the most taxing role in her career. His friends,trendy and liberal to a person,are just the sort of tossers you'd run out of 'The Ivy' to avoid. The Notting Hill they inhabit is unrecognisable to any real Londoner, being - as the former D.G. of the BBC coined the phrase - 'Horribly white' and totally unlike the vibrant culture - mix of the real area. Come Carnival time,Hugh and his chums would hotfoot it to the South of France for the duration,but still consider themselves 'street'. Who watches stuff like this?Quite a few people apparently,presumably those fans of Miss Roberts who found 'Pretty Woman' believable,or admirers of Mr Grant who find anything he does believable. After 2 hours I began to long for the likes of Arthur Seaton and Frank Machin to stagger vomiting along a poorly lit alleyway to the sound of yapping whippets.",4,1,5,29 November 2007
The Revenant," I can respect it,but not enjoy it.
","After all the hype I expected to be overwhelmed by 'The Revenant' but sadly I wasn't. Yes the scenery was awesome,nature was red and raw in tooth and claw,it was obviously jolly cold and Mr di Caprio struggled manfully wrapped up in a bearskin and spent the night inside a horse and generally suffered for his art but somehow he didn't inspire much sympathy from me. I suspect the film has a more appreciative audience in the United States and Canada where the term 'frontier' still has some meaning. Regrettably it made me think of the New Christie Minstrels' song 'Four wheels on my wagon' in a lot of places. Somehow all that snow and freezing water,all that suffering and brutality and 'nature is pure - only man is evil' stuff whilst not exactly passing me by did leave me unaffected. Yes it was crisply shot,well - lit and the sound was excellent,but the unrelenting evil on display eventually got to me and made me more or less indifferent to Mr Glass's fate. Perhaps I am too sensitive. Whatever,'The Revenant' is obviously worthy of the viewers' respect but it did not induce in me the slightest desire to watch it again.",6,1,2,20 January 2017
Little Miss Sunshine," Exploits innocence despite purporting the opposite....
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a movie that despite making loud noises about the exploitation of innocence goes ahead and exploits it anyway.I should imagine it will be enjoyed immensely by the sort of men who spend a lot of time on their computers grooming pre - pubertal girls.Here,without the attendant risk of detection they can indulge their paedophile fantasies as little Olive is groomed by her family for the 'Little Miss Sunshine' competition where a dozen seven year olds going on 25 smile desperately and gyrate 'sexily' to the delight of a large audience.Granted the event itself is shown to be tacky and tawdry,but the camera lingers just a little longer than absolutely necessary on the skimpily - dressed children,and goes in just a little too close. It is a comedy of embarrassment yes,but one is embarrassed by the actors rather than for them.Their performances do not rise above the level of a TV soap opera but they clearly think they are involved in a cutting - edge movie that is daring to be different.Equally clearly,a lot of paying customers thought so to,but I beg to offer a dissenting opinion. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is merely yet another movie about that great Hollywood institution the dysfunctional family coming together to fight a threat from the outside .It is not in the least funny - whoever marketed it as a comedy should be sued under the Trade Descriptions Act. It is not in the least original - Chevy Chase did much the same thing a quarter of a century earlier - and it left a very nasty taste in my mouth.",1,7,13,6 January 2008
Hugo," Not a children's film - but a film about childhood.
","If you come to 'Hugo' expecting the fairy -tale qualities of 'Narnia' you will be desperately disappointed.However it may have been marketed,it will not hold the attention of a young audience who want to see princesses and wizards,cuddly animals and castles. In 'Hugo' there is a railway station - and that's as exotic as it gets. (Although - mischievously - there is a 'Narnia - style wardrobe in M.Melies' apartment). The film is about the wonder,innocence,pain and joy of childhood. The main characters are all children - or grown - up children,from the spiteful yet redeemable Station Inspector( a slightly less scary Child catcher)to the petulant,clever toy repairer,the Arbucklish innocence of the late Mr Richard Griffith and the gawky awkwardness of Miss Frances de la Tour. It is about the relationship between man and machinery - a theme explored by many of the early movie greats to whom Mr M.Scorcese pays tribute. The clocks on the station Hugo repairs,the automaton that leads him ultimately to M.Georges Melies,the Station Inspector's mechanical leg,even the railway engines themselves play an important part in the narrative.And,of course,the cinematograph. For 'Hugo' most of all is a film paying tribute to the pioneers of early cinema from the Lumieres,through Melies to the great silent comedians. Anyone pretending to have an interest in movies should watch it.",10,0,3,13 January 2015
Collateral," 'I 'ad that Tom Cruise in the back of my cab last week'...........................
","'Strange geezer 'e was - good tipper though',pauses to flick a rude sign to a Bobby directing traffic,'coppers,bleedin' useless,all of 'em'. If 'Collateral' had been set in London,that might have been a reasonable summation of the plot.Fortunately it was set in the more exotic arena of Los Angeles and Michael Mann has given the plot more twists and turns than an L.A. cabbie trying to keep off the freeway during the rush-hour.Just when you think its going to be pedestrian - suddenly it surprises you. I am not generally an admirer of Mr Cruise but he has blindsided me here with a portrayal of a man who, whilst exhibiting all the signs of a sociopathic personality, is occasionally prey to human frailty.He seems almost puzzled as to where these traits are drawn from when they show themselves unexpectedly.It is a mature,assured performance. In L.A. for one night and contracted to kill five witnesses due to give evidence against a drug cartel,Mr Cruise hires a cab driven by Mr Jamie Foxx who reluctantly becomes embroiled in the action. This is an excellent,exciting,involving movie, a sort of odd couple buddy flick,cleverly plotted and well written. To be honest I didn't expect much of it,but I am happy to say my expectations were confounded.",8,0,1,3 July 2009
Enchanted," Innocence and virtue triumph.A New York Fairytale.
","When Prince Charming,searching for his bride - to - be knocks at her door, a harassed woman with a handful of kids glares at him and says 'You're too late'.That is the best gag in the movie and it is a good one.It requires a leap,a connection that young children probably won't make but one which adults will grin wryly at. 'Enchantment' has a determined foot in both camps. Miss Amy Adams is all sweet innocence,Mr Patrick Dempsey knowing cynicism,and from the moment they meet - cute they are clearly made for each other despite themselves. Add some deliberately hackneyed Disney cartoon schtick and you have a winning formula. From Andalasia,Fairyland to New York N.Y.Prince Charming pursues his true love until he finds out it ain't necessarily so. As world - weary as the next man I enjoyed 'Enchantment' in a 'full of mince pies and wine' kind of way.The tunes are tuneful,the dancing fun and the cast handsome. If you can still be just a little in - touch with your hidden child you will too.",7,0,0,27 December 2010
The Duchess," Georgiana - The People's Duchess...................
","Beautiful but naive upper - class girl,Georgiana Spencer marries selfish,arrogant serial - womanising Royal whose only motive is to sire a son and heir.Couldn't happen nowadays,of course.The world has moved on. 'The Duchess' is a beautifully paced,elegantly costumed Regency romp with a fine performance by Mr R.Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire,a man without a moral compass who no doubt thinks ethics is a county between London and Kent. As his virgin bride Miss K.Knightley is indeed beautiful,but she rather overdoses on the serenity,giving us endless close - ups of her classic if immobile three - quarter profile. Miss C.Rampling is magnificent as her mother,cold - eyed and acquisitive,greedy and grasping,pimping her daughter to a vile man whose proclivities she must have been aware of. There are some jolly moments from Sheridan and Fox,but generally the film is serious in tone,concentrating on Georgiana's determination to be taken seriously as a wife and a political woman. Born perhaps two hundred years too early,Georgiana's story indicates that Women's Suffrage had deeper roots than perhaps many imagined.",Null,0,0,27 August 2011
The Commitments," Blame it on their youth
","These are Dubliners that James Joyce would recognise.raucous,opinionated, lustful,quarrelsome......but,far above everything else,alive.Gloriously rudely,bursting with energy alive.Despite the sink estates,the tower blocks,the overcrowding,the repressive religion and the poverty,these people are grabbing life by the testicles and squeezing.'The Commitments' is if you like a story about the redemptive power of music.A fairly random group of young musicians and singers of varying abilities who get together to form a Soul band initially getting unpaid gigs in the Church Hall/Youth Club circuit before graduating to semi - professional status. Most of them are looking for a way out of an apparently pre - ordained future as shelf - stackers or baby factories.Playing Soul gives them a release,however fleetingly,from this promised drudgery. The one grown - up(if you can ever refer to musicians as grown - up)in the band is the trumpeter,a fifty something who has been there,seen it and got the album credits.The others are deeply respectful of his ability and experience . The Commitments improve gig by gig and by the time they appear at the 'Miami'club they are on the verge of securing a record deal and having a shot at the Big Time.But there is to be no fairytale ending. The boys are wildly hormonal,the girls profoundly distrustful.There are petty jealousies and musical differences.As the saxophone player's technique improves he takes on a jazz - like tone.'Jazz is music for w*nkers',says the band manager dismissively.The drummer leaves because he can't stand the lead singer and they are forced to 'train up' the local psycho to take his place.The band becomes a disaster waiting to happen and the it implodes after the 'Miami' gig when a promised appearance by Wilson Pickett fails to take place. Perhaps if they had been older the testosterone would not have flowed so freely,but their sheer energy was a large part of their appeal. So,in a whirlwind of boots,fists and recriminations The Commitments spectacularly self - destruct. But all of them have been changed in a positive way by the music. Their experiences have broadened horizons and raised bars. None of them will ever be the same again. I have deliberately refrained from talking about performances because right across the board they hardly seem like performances at all. That is artifice of the highest order and Mr Parker and his cast are to be congratulated on bringing it off so triumphantly. Finally 'The Commitments'is a movie about the unquenchable human spirit, the refusal to accept the ordinary and the fires lit in adolescence that some of us,if we're lucky,carry through the whole of our lives. Whether it's Percy Sledge,Charlie Parker or Yehudi Menuhin,it's all music and whatever gets you through the night is all that matters.",10,4,8,4 February 2007
No Country for Old Men," 'A Simple Plan' for Philosophy Majors....................
","Well,everyone loves the Coen brothers - right?But they can be a bit up their own viewfinders and in 'No country for old men' they have created a smug intellectualised Peckinpah 'hommage' with none of the old geezer's sly humour and bruised humanity. Mr Tommy Lee Jones looking more and more like one of those expensive Japanese dogs portrays a completely unbelievable cracker-barrel philosophising sheriff who is clearly in the wrong job.He is overwhelmed by the crimes he is supposed to be investigating and lacks the energy or inclination to inspire his equally timid deputies. Set in the 1970s,there are no computers,no inter - agency co-operation,no grasp of the bigger picture,just a bored sheriff on the verge of retirement looking for a quiet life. When a homicidal maniac crosses his path he regresses to the days when it was safe to leave your covered waggon unlocked at night. There is nothing new in 'No country for old men',it's just the Coen brothers being clever - clever with the old 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' plot that Sam Raimi did so much better in 'A Simple Plan'. If you like to sit with furrowed brow considering the serious sub - text in 'Mr Magoo' you'll have a ball with this.",5,2,7,28 October 2010
Mamma Mia!," in which your humble reviewer gets in touch with his feminine side
","The anodyne bubblegum music of Abba exemplifies the pre -Punk era of 70's pop.The Sex Pistols - compared to the Swedish Supergroup - were like Tequila compared to Babycham.From the lofty heights of their inverse musical snobbery,rock critics espoused the superiority of the unwashed ones over the glitzy candyfloss of the easy - on -the -eye - and - ear foursome whose popularity some saw as rivalling that of the Beatles. Thirty years on in a world bereft of Punk tribute groups,there is an Abba wannabe band on every street corner and their music has been further immortalised in the fabulously successful movie 'Mamma Mia!'.Eat that,rock critics! Let it be said right from the start that 'Mamma Mia' is more likely to appeal to members of the gentler sex.Admirers of messrs Willis,Seagal,Stallone,Van Damme et al would be well advised to stay at home and play with their remotes.There is nothing here for you,boys. And the first twenty minutes or so,full of squealing girls and middle - aged ladies, is a tad tiresome,but the movie finds its own rhythm in due course.Even the most cold - hearted of critics will be won over by the sheer enthusiasm of the performances.This is not a Hollywood Musical,there are no great singers or dancers on display - indeed one might say some of the dancing is definitely of the end - of - the - pier variety,but it is all so energetic and good - humoured that it defies po - faced criticism. Miss M.Streep,not by any means a favourite of mine,gives her first truly great performance since 'The Deer Hunter'.Near the end of the movie she sings 'The winner takes it all' against a backcloth of towering cliffs and the sparkling sea and it is a veritable tour de force.It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Ever since Mr Rex Harris proved back in 1956 that you don't have to be able to sing to star in a musical,actors have happily croaked their way through even the most complex of melodies(Miss Glynis Johns in Sondheim's 'A Little Night Music' being amongst the most notable). Fortunately for Mr Pierce Brosnan,Abba's tunes are slightly less challenging and his valiant attempts are all the more charming for being clearly the work of an amateur rather than the polished dubbing of a seasoned pro. It is left to Miss Amanda Seyfried as Miss Streep's daughter to deliver the best performance of the movie when,accompanied by a solo piano,she sings 'Thank you for the music' over the End - Titles.In complete contrast to the brash brassiness of all that has gone before it is a performance of true sensitivity,thoughtful,insightful and sincere. Wonderful;and a fitting finale to a movie that will bring back joy and laughter to our cinemas after far too long an absence.",8,3,7,28 December 2008
Bridesmaids," is this what Emily Davidson threw herself under a horse for?
","..ok,it was the King's horse and it was at the Derby,so it was a pretty big gesture back in the day when women were regarded a as second - class citizens,so all the more reason to doubt that Miss Davidson intended her sacrifice to pave the way for 'Bridesmaids' to portray the gender as equally as foul - mouthed,sex - obsessed and gross as the male. And yet...by some perverted reasoning we have reached this stage where women are applauded (mostly I must say by other women)for exhibiting the worst traits of their opposite numbers. If you want to see women swearing,vomiting,defecating and fxcking then here's your chance. All the women in the audience were hooting with laughter. Miss Davidson,I suspect,would have had an attack of the vapours and wished she had contented herself with waving her fist at the jockey.",1,6,9,27 July 2016
The Princess Bride," Charming and funny with a wide audience appeal................
","I was not ten years old when I first saw 'The Princess Bride',far,far from it.And it isn't,despite hundreds and hundreds of pleas on this site,one of the greatest movies ever.Sorry,but it just ain't so.It is rather sweet,aimed at children but movie - savvy adults will enjoy much of it. Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes get in some neat swordplay,Robin Wright is very pretty if a little wooden.The rest of the cast ham it up to a greater or lesser degree(think Alan Rickman in almost anything).Along with Bryan Forbes' 'The slipper and the rose','The Princess Bride' represented a late 20th century take on the fairy story.Mr Forbes used music and dance and 'serious' actors,Mr Reiner a script by William Goldman that worked on many levels and young,vigorous actors.I suspect it succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.",7,2,3,13 August 2008
The Pianist," 'You can't change history by turning a few faces to the wall'
","Pandit Nehru,India's first Prime Minister,used to display pictures of former Colonial Governors in his palace.When questioned about this practise he said 'You can't change history by turning a few faces to the wall'.Roman Polanski is clearly an adherent of this school of thought.If you want to know why Europe will never become the Super - State so beloved of liberal politicians you have only to watch 'The Pianist'. Too much blood has been spilled on the streets and plains of that benighted continent for the sovereign nations within its boundaries ever to live in anything but wary suspicion of one another. From the Balkans to the Mediterranean tribal hatreds have reigned supreme for a thousand years. To the Polish people it made little difference whether the Germans or the Russians occupied their country.In implementing the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem, the Germans ethnically cleansed Warsaw. Later,fearing a resurgence of Polish militarism,the Russians took 20,000 army officers,intellectuals and aristocrats and shot them dead in the infamous Katyn Forest massacre.Not content with perpetrating this appalling atrocity,the Russians then did their best to make sure the Germans were blamed for it. Later still,rather than offend his 'good friend' Stalin,Churchill declined to interfere with the Russian dictator's plans for thousands of Polish prisoners of war,thus condemning them to a lingering death in the Gulags. It would hardly be surprising then if Poland were to look at its E.U. colleagues in a rather jaundiced fashion. As well as demolishing for ever the pipe dream of Europeans living together in brotherly love,'The Pianist' also looks at the idea of the role of the artist in a disintegrating society. Here he observes rather than participates, and survives. Of course many musicians and entertainers collaborated with the Nazis and lived well under their patronage.But this option was not available to a Jew from the Warsaw ghetto. Spiellman survives by becoming the Invisible Jew right up until the end of the German Occupation when his last hiding place is discovered by a Wermacht officer who,recognising his artistry,helps him to survive. Unfortunately he is not able to return the favour as the officer dies in a Russian p.o.w. camp a full seven years after the war actually ended. Mr Polanski's vision is a bleak one indeed. The brutalisation of an intelligent and sensitive man who gradually becomes a zombie - like figure totally unresponsive to the horrors around him,desiring only one thing - his personal survival. The contempt for human life shown by 'ordinary' German soldiers,shooting Jews at random for no better reason other than that they could. Images linger;a man in a wheelchair being tipped over a balcony,a young woman shot in the head at point blank range for asking what was happening,ghetto police beating their fellow Jews enthusiastically to gain the approval of their masters,the Wermacht officer listening poker - faced to the 'untermenschen' Jew playing Chopin on a grand piano and,most disturbing of all - and demonstrating the utter futility of hope - the look on the face of the man on the end of the row of workers being summarily executed when the killer's pistol runs out of ammunition.Thinking he has been spared he dares to look up for a second or two before the magazine is replaced and he shares the fate of his colleagues. Spiellman,'The Pianist',untermenschen,invisible Jew,zombie,died at the age of 88 in 2000.I don't know whether he ever forgave;he certainly never forgot.If Polanski's movie helps to ensure that what happened to him and millions like him is never forgotten then not a single frame of it has been wasted.",9,0,2,9 May 2007
The Transporter," Absolutely bloody hilarious - a hoot from start to finish..............
","Presumably M.Besson produced 'The Transporter' between two more pressing engagements.Indeed one might be forgiven for thinking that 'produced' might be too strong a word.For this is a film that has run amok.I lost count of the number of 'hommages'up on the screen to such an extent that it seemed one long 'hommage' to dozens of infinitely better movies. To get to the particular rather than the general,the hero is a narcissistic criminal of indeterminate origin whose desire for anonymity is so strong that he leaves a box of snapshots and souvenirs on top of a cupboard.He is a man so unthinkably stupid that he uses his own car when hired as a getaway driver in a bank robbery.His sole attempt at concealing its identity consists of fitting revolving number plates,a device James Bond was using forty years ago.Duh......I think the Old Bill have rumbled that one son.For some reason not made clear he has a laissez - faire relationship with the local flic that is almost oedipal.He drives a black and shiny BMW penis - symbol with fine disregard for other road users and clearly needs a refreshment course on the Highway Code.He has - and you could have knocked me down with a rolled - up copy of 'Soldier of Fortune' - a background in the military.And just in case you thought he was a clerk in the NAAFI there's a medal thrown carelessly in his ditty box.He is played by Mr J.Statham in a particularly tight - fighting suit.He is a man so vain as to be unable to resist gazing lovingly at his own image in every reflective surface he comes across.Presumably Mr Statham wishes to assume the mantle of Mr S.Seagal in the comedy action hero stakes,but I must say he has a lot of ground to make up.He is not as funny,neither does he display Mr Seagal's sang froid in dispensing mayhem.Mr Statham wrinkles his brow a lot to signify thought,something Mr Seagal never has to do.I am not entirely sure what accent Mr Statham attempts to assume,he appears to be a little confused himself at times,veering between Bob Hoskins and Joe Pesci in random fashion.To be fair to him he has very little to work with,he might as well be playing the tooth fairy for all the basis his character has in reality. There is a nice line in product placement,if I was considering doing a blag,for instance,I'd give serious consideration to big Beamer after watching this.And if I had shares in 'Orangina' I would be well pleased. Mr Statham was prominent in 'Lock,stock and two smoking barrels'.I suspect 'The Transporter' will appeal to the same audience of mainly lager - swilling wannabe geezers who will sit in front of their tvs burping happily trying not to knock their cans of Carling over as they reach for their Naan bread and Lamb Tikka.",6,1,2,6 September 2007
Seabiscuit," A bit soggy.
","I can understand 'Sea Biscuit' being very popular in the United States, a country where the people are taught to be aware of the events in their history that have combined to turn the nation into what it is today.Memories of the Great Depression are still deeply etched into the psyche of Middle America and the country is rightly proud of the superhuman efforts that were made across the board to get it back on its feet.Any movie set in that era showing the 'little guy' winning through against tremendous odds has a head start at the box office.Courage,resourcefulness and resilience were the qualities required both in life and in art.Fine movies have been made about the Depression,' The Grapes of Wrath','Sullivan's Travels' and,more recently,'Paper Moon',that have skirted the edge of sentimentality,but 'Sea Biscuit' slides over almost into bathos in my opinion. We Brits have a reputation for being a bit stuffy,repressed,uptight or whatever you like to call it,although you'd never think it if you'd ever been to a soccer match in this country,and national outpourings of emotion are not our thing despite the completely atypical frenzy over the death of Princess Diana in some quarters which,in any case,was largely media - induced.So perhaps it is not such a surprise that some of us find the emotions roused by the exploits of a racehorse and its entourage a little strange.The same incomprehension extends to the praise given to a perfectly adequate - but no more - movie of the same subject. Mr Cooper and Mr Bridges are fine,giving thoughtful and understated performances,but I found Mr Maguire unsettlingly like Huntz Hall of 'The Bowery Boys',both in appearance and performance.which was an unfortunate distraction. Mr W.H.Macey was a positive dynamo of energy in what was otherwise fairly lethargically paced movie,his character wouldn't have been out of place in a 'Batman' comic of the era. But the sentiment was laid on with a trowel,the metaphors blindingly obvious and repetitive and the semi - documentary style employed for parts of the movie disrupted the flow of the narrative. In the end I found I was rebelling against its manipulations in the same way I refuse to shed tears when 13 year old boys sing 'Pie Jesu' on 'Britain's Got Talent'. I will cry when I want to - not when somebody else wants me to.",5,2,5,26 May 2008
1941," A last hurrah of movie comedy rather than the final nail in its coffin
","Whilst I suspect Stanley Kramer would like to have made 'Schindler's List'( I hope against hope he would at least have retained the original title),he already made '1941',but he called it 'It's a mad,mad,mad,mad world'.There are those perverse moviegoers who consider it his best and most human work and I am not about to argue with them.Similarly with Mr Spielberg;he too makes 'worthy' films,films about Middle America,socially - conscious films,good heavens he might even be the new Stanley Kramer - now there's a thought.But,apart from Elliot's mommy in 'E.T' I have never believed in or loved any of his characters,his humans lacked the stuff of humanity. In '1941',however,every gloriously loopy, lovable,eccentric and downright demented aspect of the human psyche is given full rein.There are 'hommages' to more movies than you can shake a stick at,including some of his own,the military,be it Japanese,German or U.S. is guyed affectionately.To suggest,as some have,that the movie is racist is absolute nonsense.Mr Spielberg takes the p*ss out of everybody . On its release,many watched it po - faced,disappointed that it was 'only' a comedy,as if comedy was beneath a man of his stature.To make comedy that is funny is no laughing matter. In '1941' you can see echoes of Chaplin,Keaton,Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy, The Marx Brothers and the more physical humour of The Three Stooges,in fact all the great movie comics that so influenced early Cinema;Mr Spielberg cannot be faulted on his Movie History. It's failure at the Box - Office brought to an end the era of big budget retro - comedies that had been very popular in the 1970s.Now the word 'comedy' is synonymous with foul - mouthed rant and we can look back on 1979 as an age of relative innocence and '1941' as the last misunderstood hurrah of the genuinely funny movie rather than the last nail in its coffin.",8,7,11,11 October 2008
P.S. I Love You," Not since 'The Quiet Man'has there been such Oirish whimsy.
","Like an Irish theme pub,full of shillelaghs,four - leaf clover,Guiness and bar staff who insist on making shamrocks on the head of your pint of porter. There is even a man dressed as a leprechaun. Only the Americans could believe that an Ireland like this actually exists. John Ford perpetrated a crime against Irishness with 'The Quiet Man' with Sean T'ornton and 'God Bless all here' from a brave rebel(or murdering terrorist according to one's point of view) and 'P.S.I love you' merely perpetuates the stereotype. Mr G.Butler is the wild Irish Rover in New York who suffers from a fatal brain tumour so swiftly it might almost appear rude. His Coleen is Miss H.Swank in a role Miss J.Roberts must have thanked god she was too old for. Prior to his unfortunate demise he wrote a series of letters to his widow which are delivered throughout the film in some mysterious fashion that is only mysterious if you are under ten years of age in which case let me stop you and warn you that there are one or two rather raunchy scenes your mom and dad might not want you to see. Miss Swank follows these letters to the letter - if you get my drift and ends up in old Oireland having sex with one of her late hubby's best mates.Way to go,eh? It will surprise nobody that this bloke eventually ends up with her(and her mother who is casting covetous looks at his fellow farm worker) so it all ends up happily and predictably. Is it just because I'm a bloke?",1,4,6,9 June 2016
Schindler's List," Is The Holocaust really a suitable subject for a Hollywood movie?
","Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold 'Surgical Rubberware'.Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies of 'The History of Torture', 'The Kiss of the Whip','L'Erotisme au Cinema' 'Health and Efficiency' and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown handwritten sign promising 'Trusses fitted here','The Scourge of the Swastika'. As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of 1962,Mosley's rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off Colin Jordan,the British Nazis' new Messiah in a bloody battle near Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their grandparents' lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase for virtuoso acting. It's a horrific reminder of a period in recent history when all the vilest parts of man's nature were allowed and even encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours'flying time from London and don't let anybody kid you it couldn't happen again. However sober it might be I have a problem with 'Schindler's List' inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific an event to be reduced to a 'Hollywood Movie' status no matter how well intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie with star names and marketing it as 'Entertainment' risks rousing the interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants.",7,1,3,18 March 2006
Stardust," 'If your heart is in your dream,no request is too extreme.........'
","As religion sets in the West so the appeal of another form of escapism - Fantasy - is fulfilling young people's need for a set of values, a vision of a simpler,better world with a reassuring if simplistic philosophy where decency and 'Good' will prevail in stark contrast to the harsh reality that exists outside their books and computers. We're all aware of the appeal of Tolkien's cuddly hobbits and Rowling's Boarding School Gothic. 'Stardust',while perhaps primarily appealing to this pre - sold audience,is also sufficiently Mainstream to satisfy the picturegoer who happens on it perchance as I did on FilmFour two nights ago. I am not conversant with the writings of Mr Gamain and have never seen a graphic novel other than on the shelves at Borders.This is not something I am either particularly proud of or particularly ashamed of,it's simply because I don't feel that they are aimed at my generation. I mention this merely to disclaim any prejudice one way or the other in commenting on 'Stardust'. A dying King.Three witches.Star cross'd lovers.An enchanted land.A voice - over by a theatrical knight.A pirate called Shakespeare.All satisfyingly throw - away gestures perhaps,but indicative of the fun the makers of 'Stardust' were having.Gratifying too,was the enthusiasm displayed by the cast for the material;even the 'names' seemed to be having a good time.Such goodwill is contagious and even a cantankerous old grump like me could hardly avoid exclamations of delight at several stages of the film. A resume of the plot - treated with straight - faced seriousness by the cast,an absolutely essential element in any good fantasy movie - will be unnecessary here.Sufficient to say it borrows freely from the Fairytale tradition. As the young boy on a quest Mr C.Cox changes convincingly from breathless youth to adulthood.Miss C.Daines as the star that falls to earth is enchanting. Miss M.Pfieffer as the chief witch proves you can be a fully - clad woman and still be really sexy. I am not an admirer of Mr R.Gervais and his performance here does not endear him to me.He may be a deliberate anachronism but it just doesn't work I'm afraid. I loved the lightning - catching air galleon and it's scurvy crew,the wonderful unicorn,the sinister village inn,the crumbling castle,the 98 year old 'minder' at the wall dividing fantasy from reality........... I think you could fairly say I was happily caught up in the artlessly artful world created by 'Stardust'. I was even ready to accept Mr R. de Niro as a cross - dressing Can - Can dancing pirate and no movie can do more.",9,2,4,5 June 2010
Gran Torino," Slope.Gook.Wop.Mick.Chink.Polak.What's in a name?
","Walt Kowalski is the grumpy old man's grumpy old man.Just widowed,he lives with his dog in an immaculate clapboard house in a blue collar neighbourhood in Michigan having worked for over 30 years on the assembly line at Ford's.His pride and joy is his Gran Torino which he helped build and has owned since 1972.The demographic of his 'hood has changed and 'White Flight' has meant that it has become largely Asian. A large family of Vietnamese refugees has moved in next door,loud,chaotic and close - knit,a complete contrast to his distant sons and their cold - eyed acquisitive offspring. Korean war vet Kowalski sees them with a jaundiced eye and rebuffs their attempts to befriend him. Under pressure from a street gang their youngest son tries to steal Kowalski's car and is nearly shot for his trouble.Slowly and grudgingly in an almost Fordian way,Kowalski teaches the boy to become a man. Nobody but Ford,you might think,could get away with such sentiment,but Mr Eastwood proves yet again that he has inherited the master's mantle. Influenced also by his mentor Mr D.Seigel's 'The Shootist',Mr Eastwood has his main character commit suicide by gangbanger,redeeming himself and saving the neighbourhood at the same time. Half a century of guilt over an incident during the Korean War has turned Kowalski into a miserable misanthrope with a bad word for everybody.Whilst hardly Mary Poppins at the death,he has gone to his grave 'justified',much as Mr R.Scott and Mr J.McRea in 'Ride the high country'. His total and joyful lack of 21st century political correctness has offended many but actions speak louder than words and a brave and brutally honest man chooses to end his life in a way that will benefit his Asian neighbours.Not,I submit,the act of an unregenerate nazi. Those who thought 'Unforgiven' was Mr Eastwood's swansong will have to think again as his theme changes from unremitting bleakness to a rather tentative glimpse of optimism about the human condition.",10,1,5,3 May 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," 'Hostile Waters' with whistles and bells..........................
","Mr Liam Neeson and Mr Harrison Ford growl at each other like two grumpy old bears fighting over a hollow tree trunk.The loyalty of the O.R.s is stretched to breaking point as each manipulates his acolytes amongst the crew and lots of brave submariners sacrifice their lives to save their shipmates from a 'Chernobyl' 25 years before its time. Clearly 'K 19' is an unlucky ship.Sailors,superstitious creatures that they are, will be crossing their fingers,stroking their rabbits' feet etc right from the start of the movie as the bad omens mount up. However,a nuclear meltdown is not a nuclear explosion and the threat to world peace is rather exaggerated.Not that that in any way lessens their heroism,but hyperbole tends to detract from authenticity. Having recently watched Rutger Hauer's brilliant earlier 'Hostile Waters', made on a low budget for TV,I can only remark on the similarity - which of course can only be a coincidence - to the basic plot of submariners risking their lives trying to fix a damaged nuclear reactor. Certainly Russia was paranoid about news leaking out to the West,it didn't acknowledge Chernobyl until it became self-evident,and then declined help from the U.S.,so it is easy to imagine that,a quarter of a century earlier,at the height of the Cold War,Premier Kruschev would not have looked kindly upon a submarine commander who sought assistance from the hated,feared and despised Americans. After 'detente' came 'glasnost' and the peace dividend of hundreds of Russian nuclear submarines rotting away somewhere in the Arctic Circle, an environmental ticking bomb far more immediately dangerous than any 'Global Warming' theory. 'K 19 - Widowmaker' is not a bad movie,it might have even been a timely reminder that heroism doesn't necessarily have to come wrapped in the Stars and Stripes,but it is long,noisy,and a bit over the top,a 'Titanic' of submarine pictures.Neither Mr Neesom nor Mr Ford are particularly comfortable in their roles;charging up and down in a sweaty radioactive submarine is definitely work for one of the newer fellows.'Hostile Waters' with whistles and bells' is about what it amounts to.",6,0,1,10 April 2009
Kelly's Heroes," War is funny as hell................................
","The First Casualty of War is not truth,apparently,but a sense of humour. 'Kelly's Heroes' is a very funny anachronistic look at war every bit as worthy as the over - rated 'Catch - 22'and without it's intellectual pretensions.We all know war is hell,but if you've got to be there,Jesus,if you can't have a laugh you might as well shoot yourself and save the Germans the price of a bullet.There are enough harrowing,gory,explicit war movies out there already,why not show war as the Cosmic Joke it really is. I never thought I'd write this sentence but Telly Savalas steals this movie.He plays the cigar - chomping sergeant/father figure to perfection,alternately cajoling and threatening,always professional and ruthless,it is a star - making performance and he revels in it. Clint Eastwood has a lot of fun as the Soldier with No Name(well,only Kelly)and slaughters nearly as many Germans as he did in 'Where Eagles Dare'under the same director(is there a racist agenda at work here I wonder?).Don Rickles I'm not so keen on him,his sour humour - paradoxically - does not work in a comedy film,it's too bitter to fit in with the throwaway dialogue and quickfire gags. Mr Sutherland has the showiest part, his 'Hippy Manque' persona neatly transposed from the then current Vietnam War to the European Front.He descends from his tank in a very neat fashion by sliding his arm along the gun barrel,and easing himself onto the ground imbuing every movement with the epitome of 1960s cool. A strange sort of morality pervades the movie,after all what is such a big deal about stealing a few million dollars worth of gold in the midst of global slaughter?Who are the real villains?Kelly's Heroes or Hitler,Stalin,Churchill and Roosevelt?Enough with the serious - the movie is a comedy and a damned good one.Even if you can think of no aspect of war that is in the least bit funny try to accept that for the combatants,having a sense of humour can be a saving grace.",7,2,3,5 October 2008
World Trade Center," An opportunity wasted I'm sorry to say.......................
","I watched 'World Trade Centre',if not against my will then certainly against my better judgement and I'm afraid my better judgement was justified. Regardless of the argument that so cataclysmic an event should not have been made into a feature film within such a short time of its occurrence, if one was to be made it would necessarily have to be of very high quality to do its subject some semblance of justice,and,regrettably, 'World Trade Centre' is extremely pedestrian. I accept that it is respectful - indeed it could hardly have been otherwise even with arch de-constructor Oliver Stone at the helm - but nowhere does it have a spark,a flicker or any sign that it was not made by a man on auto - pilot dealing with stock Hollywood characters (brave loyal wives,grim-faced comrades,stoic Wasps,emotional Hispanics...). Mr N.Cage has little to do except look grim. Nobody would expect 'World Trade Centre' to be entertaining but surely it should have been compelling and involving? Instead it drifts along to a standard Hollywood ending leaving me with the frustrating feeling of having witnessed an opportunity wasted.",5,1,2,8 September 2009
Green Street Hooligans," Green Street?More like Sesame Street.....
","Call it pedantry if you wish,but if I was making a film centred around supporters of a specific football team I would make sure that at the very least I got the words of their theme song right.No true Hammer would sing'....and like my dreams they fade and die..',it's '..then like my dreams they fade and die'.....so much more schadenfreud as befits a team that played the beautiful game before the media invented it. And,despicable as these hooligans may be,at least they are fighting to win back football from the Guardianistas and bring it home to the people who breathed life into it and loved and supported it long before it became a fashion accessory for middle-class knobheads.These blokes will be shouting and screaming on the few remaining terraces at football grounds around the country long after Giles and Digby have returned to the jolly japes of the Varsity Match at Twickers. 'Green Street' soon gives a clue regarding its intended audience;twice in the first five minutes we are treated to the phrase 'Rhyming - slang' just in case we fail to understand how these alien beings are communicating with one another......'Bees and Honey - money....apples and pears - stairs...oh,I get it!How neat!' Most of the adulatory views of this movie come from an America safe from the phenomenon of the football hooligan and where they may be regarded as some sort of exotic species ,here in the UK we are under no such misconception. Dougie Brimston,the co-writer of this rubbish,has made a living out of chronicling street violence connected to football for some time. He certainly knows a lot of swear words,the first line of dialogue in the movie is 'F... me!',which rather sets the tone for what is to follow.Lots of extremely unpleasant cockneys run about kicking and punching and spitting blood everywhere for far too long.Shouldn't they be at home with Richard and Judy's Book Club Choice?During their last spell of bird (rhyming -slang) did they forego the Anger Management Classes? There is-for want of a better word - a plot but it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone over the age of nine.There is also - yet again for want of a better word - acting,albeit outrageously bad acting.It is as if the director assembled all of the thesps who failed their auditions for 'Eastenders' and shut them in a pub with instructions to drink themselves stupid for 3 days then filmed the results. I will not court the libel laws by naming names,but many of these actors are clearly more used to resting than acting,and,in an ideal world,will remain so. There is not a single imaginative shot in the whole movie,not one believable moment.I watched in vain for the slightest sign that a creative hand was on the tiller. Alas,the abiding image for me was a group of fat sweaty middle-aged blokes milling around in 'artistic' slo - mo. Fine if that's your thing.Me - I'd rather watch Sumo Wrestling on TV.",2,0,1,20 July 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Man and Superman.Arthur C,.Clarke's theory of evolution.......
","Whenever a movie based on a work from another medium is considered it is imperative to take into account the original source.However many times Mr S.Kubrick is referred to as a 'genius' and '2001' as a 'Masterpiece' his role in the production was to re - interpret another man's vision.Even if one took the Auteur theory 'Reductio ad Absurdam' no movie is ever the sole work of the director. Mr Arthur C.Clarke's 'The Sentinel' was written 60 years ago.At that time the only rockets were adaptations of Herr von Braun's V2 which,3 or 4 years earlier had the sole modest - if deadly - ambition of clawing its way high enough into the sky to drop on London. By the time Mr Kubrick was considering making '2001',the Apollo space programme was well under way.Of the two Mr Clarke's vision was the more imaginative and percipient. Certainly '2001' is a remarkable movie by any standards,perhaps,along with the vastly different 'Alien',at the very peak of the Sci - Fi pantheon.Mr Scott's masterwork,made 11 years later,shows space travel as routine,boring and a little grubby,in complete contrast to Mr Kubrick's concept of it as a new and exciting step in freeing Mankind from the confines of Earth. Furthermore,the Clarke/Kubrick collaboration reaches far wider,no less than the elevation of Man to the next step in the evolutionary scale. Having performed some Herculean tasks the surviving astronaut is finally reborn as a'Starchild' thus marking the beginning of a new journey for the species. Generations of moviegoers have grown up whose only knowledge of the movie is via the video or more lately,DVD.However grand their Home Cinema equipment may be it can only give them a very limited idea of the magnificence of the original visuals and the almost overpowering soundtrack.Occasionally you can catch a theatrical production and I most strongly urge you to do so if possible.Only then can you appreciate the impact the movie had on my generation forty years ago. And then there's THAT cut........................",9,1,5,6 January 2008
Taken," sometimes it's hard to be an Albanian pimp...........
","....I mean you're just doing your job,right?Kidnapping young girls,doping them raping them and beating them before turning them into prostitutes,stuff like that,and along comes this crazy guy acting like Captain America just because you've taken his daughter.I mean,they're all somebody's daughter,right? Mr L.Neeson is spectacularly impressive as the ex - C.I.A. operative whose estranged 17 year old daughter is snatched from a Paris apartment block and sold on to traffickers. Making use of all his Black Ops experience he goes where Surete either feared to tread or were paid off and decimates the gang responsible for the kidnapping.Having traced her he then steps up a gear and decimates the gang selling her to an Arab sheik who is about to deflower her on a boat on the Seine when his plans are rudely interrupted.He,in turn,is decimated. Now that is a hell of a lot of decimating,but Mr Neeson is a one man killing machine once riled. 'Taken' is fast - paced and many Albanian pimps were harmed during its production. Although it deals with a deadly serious issue it is not a serious examination of sexual exploitation.Some may feel that in itself is exploitation by other means,but by bringing the matter into popular cinema and making it better - known,'Taken' just about justifies itself morally,and,incidentally, made a hell of a lot of money whilst doing so.",8,3,3,7 April 2013
The World's Fastest Indian," One man and his hog.....................
","An elderly man restores an old motor - cycle and takes it halfway round the world to ride it on Bonneville Salt Flats. This is the story of an obsession eventually realised by 63 year - old heart patient Burt Munro.Stubborn,ornery,bloody - minded,call him what you will,he was a man of no small courage,fully aware of the risks involved in pushing himself and his machine to the limit. He makes an epic journey across America towing his 'Indian' behind a clapped - out old clunker,encountering a full and varied selection of the population en route,giving them the benefit of his wisdom whether they want it or not. From black ladyboy(there couldn't have been many of them to the pound in 1962 even in Hollywood) to Native American to lonely widow to hitch - hiking serviceman on leave from Vietnam,Burt gets to meet a suspiciously 'Cross Section of America' cornucopia of citizens of this strange land. Gruff but kindly,he's not too happy at being mistaken for a Brit,but New Zealanders were rare visitors to the U.S. back in those days. In fact the inference is many Americans had never heard of it. As Munro,Mr Anthony Hopkins gives a performance of quiet charm with reserves of strength that are brought to the fore just when required. It is a complete contrast to some of his flashy scenery - chewing roles that have bought him the time to appear in movies like 'The World's fastest Indian'which seem to have little general appeal. Not a financial success,it is well worth seeking out and a worthy introduction to N.Z. Cinema to a wider public.",7,2,2,18 October 2010
Chariots of Fire," A marvellous celebration of the Corinthian Spirit.
","I write this comment on a wet,dark November morning in Cambridge.Through my window the roof of Gonville and Caius' Master's Lodge is slick with the drizzly rain,and I can imagine the shade of Harold Abrahams - one of it's most notable alumni - running down Senate House passage,laughing,half - hidden under his umbrella,a girl on each arm. In 1924 the University was far more an elitist establishment than it is now,and Abrahams may well have considered himself something of an outsider but most of his fellow students were far too well brought up to be impolite to him.An added bonus would have been that he was rather good - looking and - obviously - a top class athlete. When he 'Beat the clock' in the race round the Great Court at Trinity College it further boosted his popularity amongst his peers. Incidentally Lord Coe,head of London's bid for the 2012 Olympics,pulled off the same feat 40 - odd years later. In 'Chariots of fire' we are not seeing a cross - section of British society in the early 1920s.The Amateur code dominated sport.Professionalism was a dirty word.In cricket there were Gentlemen and there were Players(Professionals).I remember going to Gentlemen vs Players matches in Surrey as late as the 1940s,the old values were dying hard.The Professionals were almost exclusively working class who had been excluded from athletics at its highest level because of the predominance of the Gentleman Amateur.Men like Abrahams,Liddell and the fictional Lord Lindsay. The Corinthian Spirit was abroad.To compete was an honour in itself. No drugs,no food supplements,no 'Athletics Scholarships',no Lottery Money.No cheating.Just endeavour and sportsmanship.How quaint that all may seem after the most expensive Olympic Games in history where the nation's gamblers funded 'Team GB' to success on a raft of money. And yet.......to me there is something eternally appealing and very British about the cult of the gifted amateur in an era when everybody is obsessed with 'winning' and athletes can become millionaires overnight and consider silver medals an insult. 'Chariots of fire',happily,does not concern itself with such heresy. It is a wonderful evocation of the complex social mores of Upper Class British life in the immediate post World War One era when the Donkeys who had led the Lions on the battlefields of Europe were having one hell of a last hurrah before bending their knees to the inevitability of history. It may not contain enough cheery cockneys and canny northerners to satisfy some people but to have done so in such a context would have been a distortion of the facts.Their time was to come. Instead it features a class whose values and moral code was on the verge of extinction.And that was not,arguably,a cause for celebration.",10,1,1,30 November 2008
Victory," 'Goalkeepers are crazy'
","I don't know who first said that,but it has become a bit of a truism,and,like most truisms,it has a kernel of truth. No other position in the field of play is so exposed.One error can live with you for ever.You've got to get down among the flying boots and up among the flying elbows.You've got to judge speed,angles,flight of the ball and organise your defence.In fact you've got to be crazy to want to be a goalkeeper.Mr S.Stallone fits the bill in 'Escape to Victory'. His antics reminded me of Rene Higuita of 'Scorpion kick' fame the Colombian international goalie who served time for his connection to the Medellin cartel. I'm not sure who the movie was aimed at.Stallone to attract the Yanks? Pele to attract the Brazilians?The great Bobby Moore to keep us Brits happy? Many of Mr Huston's later films were not exactly fireworks at the Box - Office but I guess video and now DVD saved this one. A bit like 'The Great Ecape' - everybody knows what happens and it is impossible to criticise seriously because it's just a bit of trivia that the Old Man knocked out between the things he really wanted to do. Just go with the flow and you'll be O.K.",6,0,2,6 August 2010
Selma," 'Selma' :- an outsider's view.
","As an Englishman my view of the events portrayed in 'Selma' is conditioned by contemporary reports shown on the BBC and cinema newsreels. We saw the de - segregation of schools in The South,George Wallace,Little Rock,Rosa Parks and the Freedom Marchers at one remove. There was a relatively small number of black people living here in the 1950s and they had the vote were educated and neither hated nor feared.They had come to this country voluntarily,not brought in chains. We felt rather smug about that. When Kennedy became President I rather naively thought one of his first priorities would be to address such inequalities but it was not to be so and he was soon engaged in a p*ss*ng contest with Kruschev that took our eyes of the ball.It took his much - maligned successor LBJ to confront the problems,however reluctantly.He may have been a potty - mouthed,bigoted corrupt oilman but he wasn't a fool. And he did more for race equality in the U.S.than any of his predecessors and most of his successors. As I say,that's an outsider's view. And largely one promulgated by 'Selma',a well - made,well - acted story of Dr.Martin Luther King's battles against ignorance and hatred,organised opposition and state - controlled violence. It may be difficult for younger viewers to credit the implacable hatred shown by the Authorities towards what they saw as a challenge to the status quo(and they were right,for that is exactly what the protests were all about). Emotions were raw on both sides. The film pulls few punches and is obviously a deeply - felt work that will inform generations to come of the hard - won rights that can too easily be taken for granted in times of relative tranquility but have recently been brought into sharper focus. It is of course a creative piece and the child of the director but has more than enough hard truths that she has refused to smooth out. Not an easy view then,but an essential one.",8,1,2,10 February 2015
The Artist," Cold and calculating,with a cynical eye on the camera...
","When I was 11 years old and innocently in love with the daughter of a Salvation Army officer in Guildford,I used to go to meetings and sit in the dark hoping my 'Start - rites' would brush against her leather sandals as we watched 'Blood and fire in action' and other epics about the Army's good works in the London slums. As light relief we were shown a few silent shorts and I was introduced to 'Easy Street',extracts from 'Chrismas Tree salesmen' and several episode of 'Tol'able David' which sealed my fate as a devoted film - lover for the next 60 - odd years. Over the years I bought 8mm prints of many silent and they seldom failed to produce the tingle that was only partly induced by the scrape of shoe on shoe all those years ago. So when I watched 'The Artist' I was slightly disappointed to find very little emotional engagement. Yes it's clever and perhaps an interesting conceit for a 20 minute TV slot,but it is constantly telling us how cute and funny the characters are and how many movies the makers have seen,which I found a little irritating. It goes on too long in telling its story which is not so much a re - telling of 1920s cinema but rather a re - telling of a 1950s take on 1920s cinema. It may be a simplification to declare that only comedy,melodrama and epic works in Silent form,but not much of one. 'The Artist' is giving us a musical comedy (with no on screen music,obviously)with bits of drama thrown in. The cast is energetic,but in a 21st century post - modern - ironic way. It lacks the apparent spontaneity that was the genius of Chaplin,Keaton and Lloyd,and the loveability that emanated from Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy in every frame. Rather it is cold and calculating with a cynical eye on the camera. Comparisons to the contemporary 'Hugo' - another tribute to early movies are valid and invidious despite the latter having dialogue in sound rather than just a musical track.It has what The Artist' lacks - heart. In that respect maybe 'The Artist' might have been better off with just a solo piano to reinforce the mood. Somehow a full - blown orchestra blasting out at inappropriate moments seems a little de trop.",6,2,4,25 January 2015
From Hell," 'May my throat be cut and my tongue ripped out'..Yeah,right.
","Personally I thought 'From Hell' was a quite entertaining exposition of the least likely of the 'Ripper' myths.How much more exciting our Royal family would be if one of their predecessors had been a disease-ravaged serial killer;still,you can't have everything.Then there's the Freemasons..........A 'Society with Secrets' as they refer to themselves rather than a 'Secret Society'.Ho hum.Certainly their influence is very strong in the Metropolitan Police even today - some might have said their malign influence............and was no doubt at least as powerful in late Victorian times - but I can't help feeling if they'd been responsible for the Ripper murders they would have left absolutely no clues. So it's only a movie,then,not a history lesson.Obviously a lot of money has been spent and the net result is quite compelling,its whole being rather better than the sum of its parts. I think the fact that it's derived from a comic book should have alerted most people that the characters might not be very,er,believable. Mr Johnny Depp makes a Byronic Inspector Abberline.Mr Robbie Coltrane plays the same fat bloke he always plays.Various English thesps slum courageously and exit quickly counting the money. Don't take it seriously for a minute and it's quite fun.",6,2,4,26 February 2009
National Treasure," Exciting,entertaining and amusing...what more could you want?
","There is almost too much going on in 'National Treasure'.Parallel plots involving the theft of the Declaration of Independence by two teams,one 'goodies' team led by Mr N.Cage,one 'baddies' team led by his erstwhile colleague Mr S.Bean,clues that would baffle a 'Times' crossword solver, feats of derring - do that Sir Ranulph Fiennes would baulk at,cops,FBI, Freemasonry,Knights Templar......everything a boy could wish for in fact. An excellent cast have a lot of fun and I was particularly pleased to see Mr Bean shake off his dour working-class northern image in a rare excursion up the social scale as Mr Cage's fellow treasure hunter who shares his ambitions but not his scruples. Mr H.Kietel sports a Masons' ring on his pinkie as the FBI SAC with a grudging admiration for Mr Cage and his labyrinthine manoeuvres. Whilst tipping its hat to many adventure movies,'National Treasure' manages to create a groove as a clever and satisfying work in its own right.I found it intriguing and amusing,thought Miss D Kruger was a wholesome and plucky heroine,took my Ovaltine to bed and slept the sleep of the innocent.",8,1,2,8 September 2009
Inside Man," 'One More Time!'.........................
","You know that old Count Basie recording of 'April in Paris' where at the end the Count calls 'One More Time!' and the band repeats the last section of the Milt Buckner arrangement then it's 'One More Once' etc. until even the most avid Basie fan wants to cry 'Enough already'? Well,'Inside Man' left me with the exact same feeling. Just when you think it's time to shove your can of 'Coke' (T.M.) underneath the seat in front of you and wolf down that last handful of roasted peanuts before making the dash for the Late Bus,what appears to be a perfectly good ending turns out to be not an ending at all and the film drags on for another unnecessary scene,an occurrence that repeats itself ad nauseam until I could feel myself in sympathy with Mort Sahl who famously stood up towards the premiere of 'Exodus' and yelled 'Otto,let my people go'. What is basically the old 'Nazi Treasure' plot that I first saw utilised in a Tarzan film at the Saturday Morning Pictures 60 years ago is is given 'gritty,urban,edgy'makeover with the usual not -too -subtle Spike Lee racial undercurrent and Pseudo Tarantino plot construction that makes little sense whilst you watch it and even less sense when you think about it afterwards. It is performed with an air of desperation by a cast that clearly want done with it as quickly as possible,Miss J.Foster in particular has rarely seemed so offhand. Look as I might,I was unable to find much to like in it.",4,0,3,5 May 2010

Mr Vinnie Jones,a former professional footballer,is pressed into service as a hit man I'd have been more frightened of him if he'd kept his boots on.

Titanic," A brilliantly assembled mishmash of movie clihes-wonderful!
","'Titanic',like 'Gone with the wind' is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so 'Titanic' repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a 'great' movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even 'opportunist' might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and 'Titanic' has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the 'buts' and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clich√©s one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched 'Titanic' six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry. Furthermore I would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my Christmas Card list. This is film - making of the highest order and I take my hat off to everybody involved.",9,5,10,24 July 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Comrade Kruschev is sent to stiffen the spines of the Red Army.....
","Less than twenty years after these events,Premier Kruschev was taking off his shoe and banging it on his desk at the United Nations Building. Always a consummate actor,Kruschev terrified half the world,put the first man in space,built the Berlin Wall and forced Kennedy to remove US bases in Turkey by deploying missiles in Cuba.He debunked the myth of Stalin when it suited him and gloried in the image of the ignorant peasant who had fought his way to the top of the heap.People who bought that fatally underestimated his political genius. A crumbling Red Army was re- vitalised by his dynamism and dialectic. Sniper Vasily Zaitsev certainly had his mind concentrated wonderfully. His exploits were broadcast throughout the Soviet Union,making him a legend amongst the defenders of Stalingrad. In order to eliminate him the besieging Germans employed Major Konig,their best man.'Enemy at the gates' tells the story of their duel. Both adversaries were cunning and ruthless,but also respectful of the other's ability with a rifle. Along with the operators of flame throwers,snipers were the most hated of opponents and could expect absolutely no mercy if captured by the enemy.Neither Zaitsev nor Konig had any intention of being captured. The siege of Stalingrad was definitely not won on the playing fields of Eton.The Russians were systematically slaughtered by the Wermacht and the Luftwaffe to whom they were 'untermenschen'.Hardly surprising then when the roles were reversed very few German soldiers returned from Russian Prison camps at the end of the war. I will mention Mr Ed Harris who gives the standout performance as the cold - eyed Major Konig,seeking revenge for the killing of his son. All the other actors are more than adequate without really breaking into a sweat. There is a quite unbelievable and absolutely unnecessary 'love' scene where Miss R.Weiss struggles to get into Mr J.Law's pants and when she does it seems hardly worth the effort. The raison d'etre of the movie remains the battle of the two marksmen which is resolved finally in a bit of an anti - climactic scene where Major Konig removes his hat and stands still whilst Zaitsev shoots him at close range. But to me the shadow of Nikita Kruschev looms large over this movie,as it did over the world at the height of the Cold War which remained Cold not least because Kruschev had no intention of ever letting it become Hot.",7,0,2,25 January 2009
The Holiday," 'Death by Chocolate - The Movie'
","Kate Winslet,Jude Law,Cameron Diaz,Jack Black,four names right at the top of my 'Over-rated and over-familiar' list I'm afraid,so if 'The Holiday' was going to work for me it was going to have to be out of the ordinary if not exceptional,but I'm sorry to report that it wasn't even the former and was an extraordinarily long way from being the latter. Fairy Tale England meets Fairy Tale America.Fifteen years ago Hugh Grant and Andie McDowall would have been it it.By 2006 the formula was wearing just a bit thin. Too-cute kids,a too-cute oldster,heavy layers of sentiment, this is 'Death by Chocolate - The Movie'. No believable characters,a plot 11 year - olds would have trouble with,a rose - coloured vision of comfy Waspism that is as soporific as a barrel of 'Ovaltine'. For believers in the Tooth Fairy only.",4,0,2,13 January 2010
Love Actually," Miss Emma Thompson - gold amongst the dross.....
","If you think Hugh Grant is the greatest light comedian since Cary Grant you may be able to watch his performance as the Prime Minister through slightly open fingers.If you think having a sprinkling of thespians spread thinly amongst the 2nd rate TV actors is 'fun' and not patronising,and if you think smug trustafarians happily send their 'kids' to bog standard comprehensive schools then you are the sort of person at whom 'Love actually' is aimed.Martine McCutcheon,so well-scrubbed she almost gleams,seems surprised to be in this movie,as well she might.She must have got a really good agent. The story line involving her,Hugh Grant and a Clintonesque US president(whatever his other faults,G.W.Bush couldn't be said to be a ladies man) is absolutely ludicrous,and Grant's speech at the Press Conference is nearly as nauseating as his 'amusing' best man's speech in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. The use of the music couldn't be more blatantly manipulative and unsubtle.If someone had appeared on the screen with a card marked 'Cry now' I wouldn't have been surprised.Only Miss Emma Thompson as a betrayed wife is the least bit believable,a vein of gold amongst the dross. Mr Neeson,as the stepfather to a precocious bad-mannered little curly top,looks as though he has remembered a subsequent,rather more important engagement and is just looking for an excuse to slip away. That rather anonymous chap from 'The Office' is,er,rather anonymous in a particularly silly episode about two porn movie stand-ins finding love whilst pretending to have sex.. Colin Firth was not born to play the author falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper,nor indeed any other comedy part. Rowan Atkinson is almost as bad as he would later be in 'Johnny English' and he can't really need the money,can he? I will save the blushes of the other actors by drawing a veil over their performances. So - obviously - I didn't think a lot of it.I looked for some sign of wit,originality or even truth (heaven help me) in 'Love actually' and Miss Thompson excepted,found none. I don't mind being manipulated by a movie - after all,that's what they do - but I don't want my intelligence being insulted at the same time.",4,1,2,10 November 2005
12 Years a Slave," A 'Guess who's coming to dinner?' for the 21st century.
","Worthy rather than outstanding.Well - made,well - acted and with little apart from the subject matter to set it above many other well - made and well - acted films of the last decade. Nobody in their right mind would suggest that slavery was anything but evil - that's a given.Perhaps a younger generation who have never heard of Little Rock or Rosa Parks need a reminder that equality and freedom having been painfully gained must never be surrendered,and it may be those people to whom '12 years a slave' has the most resonance in much the same way that 'Schindler's List' brought the horrors of the holocaust to those to whom it had been merely an historic event. To sum up,you could say that '12 years a slave' is a triumph of substance over style in much the same way as Fifty years back 'Guess who's coming to dinner?',another worthy,well - made and well - acted film was a minor sensation but is now remembered only for its social message and not for its merits per se. Perhaps in 2063 the critics will be saying something similar about '12 years a slave'.",6,0,1,6 May 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," Fear and loving in New Deal Macon County...
","'To kill a mockingbird' as envisioned by Mr R.Mulligan is an exploration of fear and courage. We are given the indicator early on when,in introducing the characters in voice-over,the grown - up Scout says'We had been told that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself',a quote from an early Roosevelt broadcast. She and her brother Jem fear Boo Radley,a vulnerable neighbour whose father's idea of care in the community to is lock him in the cellar beneath the courthouse. Radley is widely thought to be mad,bad and dangerous to know and despite - or because of this Scout,Jem and their friend Bill go to his near - derelict house and bang on the wall. They are not fearless,quite the opposite;but there is no courage without fear. Their father,Atticus,a widower and pacifist lawyer,is a wise and influential presence in their lives. When he is called upon by the sheriff to shoot a rabid dog,the children are surprised at his skill with a rifle because of his anti - gun stance. Atticus is asked to defend a poor black labourer up on a rape charge and it is soon clear that his decision to take the case on has divided the community,with the poor whites,who hate and fear the blacks,siding against him. The alleged victim clearly fears admitting to her father that in fact she made a move on the man against his will because he was lonely and frustrated. hen the suspect is arrested the sheriff fears a lynch - mob will storm the jail and,armed only with a book,Atticus sits on the porch keeping guard. The three young friends,against his orders,visit the jail and Scout's courage shames the mob gathering outside and they make their way home. Despite clear evidence to the contrary,the defendant is found guilty - to the obvious exasperation of the judge,and whilst waiting transportation to the city jail he breaks free fearing for his life if kept in custody,and is shot dead. Later Aticus's children are murderously attacked by the alleged life-long beliefs.Atticus Finch,slowly and carefully played by Mr G.Peck,is an omnipotent figure in his children's lives. Wise,calm,shrewd and protective,he is everything we would like a father to be.A man of old - fashioned Southern courtesy,he is stubborn and courageous,well - respected in the small town where he lives.The sort of man Norman Rockwell loved to depict sitting in a leather - backed rocking - chair in a wood - panelled office,looking benignly at at spit - licked spiky - haired little boy. His son and daughter are on the thoughtful side of the 'gee whizz' All - American brother and tomboy sister school,that quite possibly went out with the demise of the picket fence and auto- tyre swing. The voice - over by Miss Kim Stanley is one of the film's highlights. highlights,mellow and loving,nostalgic but not regretful.It is her brother's keepsakes box that forms the basis of the quite brilliant Saul Bass title sequence,the contents shot in extreme close up,needle - sharp with wonderful use of differential focus. Atticus Finch and his children will live long in your memory, as they have in mine since I first saw 'To kill a mockingbird' over fifty years ago.",10,0,1,20 August 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Nice bridge,Colonel,but there is a war on you know.......
","I saw this at the cinema as a 17 year - old and was most impressed by the sheer size and sweep of the film - a characteristic,I later learned of most David Lean productions.Mr A.Guiness represented the bulldog spirit and unquestionable integrity of the British officer - class and the various jolly cockney,witty scouses,dour northeners in the ranks were typical of the portrayals of rank and file soldiery we had come to expect in just over a decade of obsession with the role of the armed forces in the second world war. Mr S.Hayakawa was eminently hissable as the evil Oriental who was eventually outwitted by our brave and stubborn Col.Nicholson. Nearly sixty years and many viewings later I have come to realise that 'Bridge on the River Kwai is still a hugely impressive film and Mr A.Guiness is even better than I first thought,but that my reading of the film was all wrong. Mr Lean has in fact borrowed deeply from Joseph Conrads'Heart of darkness'with a plot about a rogue officer with his own agenda running what is virtually his own private army in cahoots with the enemy to the extent that an assassin is sent on a mission to kill him. Col.Nicholson,in short,is as mad as a sack of weasels and his obsession with building the eponymous bridge,rather than giving his chaps something to do and improve their conditions,is considerably aiding the Japanese Imperial Forces and the movement of their troops. The last third of the film detailing the efforts of Mr J.Hawkins and Mr W.Holden to destroy the bridge is amongst Mr Leans's best work,taut, with beautifully conceived editing,and a wonderfully managed climax where Nicholson finally realises the blind alley his obsession has led him into. 'What have I done?'he asks as the first train is about to cross the bridge and he stumbles around on the sand seeing the explosives set by Mr Hawkin's commandos exposed by low tide. In 'Heart of darkness',Kurtz's last words are 'The horror,the horror'. As the bridge finally blows up, Mr J.Donald mutters 'Madness,madness',which isn't too far removed from that. With the possible exception of 'Lawrence of Arabia'(maybe just a little self - indulgent)Mr Lean never again made a film so near to perfection that was so ambiguous and no character that was so complex. Undoubtedly one of the best 'British' movies ever made.",10,0,1,28 February 2015
The Wrestler," The Passion of the wrestler.........................
","Right early on the parallels are set between 'Ram'(Mr M Rourke) and Christ with his Mary Magdalene being a pole dancer(Miss M.Tomie)rather than a prostitute.Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of The Christ' even gets a name check just to put us on the right track. Later his body is pierced by nails and he lies on the floor of the ring as if crucified. His disciples are a gang of small boys who hang on his every word and his old - time fans who wish it was still 1986. This is a wish shared by 'Ram' himself,who is,basically,a washed - up,burnt - out case of a professional wrestler with his future all used up.Short - sighted and hard of hearing,with arthritic knees and elbows,he pumps his body full of drugs just to keep going.It might be said 'The Wrestler' starts where 'Requiem for a Heavyweight' left off. It features very compelling performances by Mr Rourke and Miss Tomei whose character is even more complex than 'Ram',albeit she too makes her living by displaying her body to strangers and inviting an entirely one - sided intimacy between her and her public. After suffering a heart attack,'Ram' at first refuses to quit,but when it becomes clear he cannot run a hundred yards without losing his breath he reluctantly decides to call it a day. But things get steadily worse for him when he misses a dinner date with his estranged daughter and he opts for a comeback fight with his old adversary 'The Ayatollah' on the 20th anniversary of his greatest triumph. Relishing the applause of the crowd,'Ram' enters the ring and so starts the match that is not going to end in any good way. The wrestling scenes are all excellent,but the best scenes in the movie for me take part in the 'Acme' supermarket where 'Ram' is forced to work in the deli counter to earn some cash.He starts off tentatively but gains confidence and is soon on a high,but it all comes crashing down in a truly frightening scene where he deliberately injures his hand(symbolic again) on the cheese cutter and,spraying blood everywhere, goes into an orgy of destruction,screaming obscenities. Mr Rourke is very impressive,totally in control of his persona;a man rather belatedly looking at himself and not liking what he sees. 'The Wrestler' is a very fine film about a very human man who,like most of us has weaknesses that generally are just about balanced by his strengths,and decides at the end,to go out with all his strengths blazing.I hope I might be morally brave enough to do that when the time comes.",10,0,1,31 January 2012
The Terminal," 'A Great Day in Harlem' echoes half a century on.......................
","The back story - if you like - of 'The Terminal' is rather less celebrated than the 'Man without a country' type plot that has been well - covered by writers on this site. Back in 1958,'Esquire' magazine commissioned Art Kane to take photographs for a special Jazz edition.It was his idea to get together all the top jazz musicians who were in New York on the actual day of the photograph and picture them outside a Harlem Brownstone. The resultant portrait became one of the most iconic of all jazz photos and was the subject - 30 years later - of a TV programme known as 'A Great Day in Harlem'. Victor Navorski (Mr T.Hanks) had flown to New York To complete his late father's collection of autographs from all the musicians shown in Kane's photograph.That collection was in the tin of peanuts he guarded so fiercely. Saxophonist/composer/educator Mr Benny Golson was leading a quartet at a New York hotel.His was the last signature Victor needed. JFK's crystal - like appearance resembles Superman's Fortress of Solitude as our hero refines his game plan,righting wrongs,uniting star - crossed lovers and jumping over tall buildings in his spare time. Despite the worst efforts of the Lex Luthor - like Mr S.Tucci,Victor is able to escape from his glass prison and meet Mr Golson. He then returns to Krypton where no doubt everyone is as compassionate,honest,multi - talented,decent and forgiving as he. Mr Hanks is really very good in this movie.Not,as some have suggested,patronising or even racist. As a European male myself,I feel more than happy that we have been presented not as pimps,drug dealers,robbers and fraudsters but as polymaths who could teach the Yanks a thing or two about what is actually important.",8,0,1,8 March 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," People may read what they like into movies.How a cult is born....
","First off... I really liked 'The Shawshank Redemption'.It's a movie that is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good prison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy ending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has become an 'aftermarket accessory',so to speak. With only a 'so - so' initial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be elevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world desperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the small man was becoming increasing powerless against 'Them',heroes like Andy and Red,abundantly decent and 'ordinary' raged against the machine on the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether 'Star Wars', 'Lord of the Rings' or the later 'Harry Potter' series have built huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella could not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its immediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the audience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus weakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively short space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing that has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita Hayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had escaped? That apart,'The Shawshank Redemption'is a completely satisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James Cagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a special message,think it amongst the finest films ever made.",8,1,1,13 February 2010
Music and Lyrics," Ohmigosh,er,er,it's Hugh Grant with a bit more balls but not much
","Slightly less foppish than customary,Mr Grant is not altogether convincing as a faded pop star trying to hitch his waggon to a rising young phenomenon (Miss Haley Bennett stealing the movie rather effortlessly)in a slight variation of the 'Star is born'(plot no 24 in the Hollywood Scriptwriters'Handbook). Competent at writing jingletunes,Mr Grant is at a loss for words,figuratively,when Miss Drew Barrymore comes into his life. Able to toss off a snappy lyric at will she helps him write a song for Miss Bennett that will make them rich and famous and kickstart his comeback. Miss Barrymore bears an unfortunate resemblance to a coy Stephen Fry - now that's an oxymoron for you - but that doesn't stop old Hugh from falling for her in his stammering ineffectual way. She has musical integrity but he has his snout deep in the trough. Rodgers and Hart they ain't. As usual in a Hugh Grant movie,nobody in it bears any resemblance to any real human being that ever drew breath,but if you accept that as a given and are feeling particularly uncritical you can let it all wash over you and come out the other side without having engaged either heart or brain.As usual in a Hugh Grant movie",6,0,1,9 January 2011
The Queen," 'It's not easy being Queen'.............................
","From reverence to ridicule,the Windsors have ridden the slippery spiral for the last thirty years.Only HM herself has retained the respect of her subjects whilst all about her have been losing it.Lumbered with Clueless Charlie,Aimless Andy and Pointless Camp Eddie one can only feel sympathy with her.When her estranged daughter - in - law dies the nation - encouraged by a power - mad media - falls into a form of hysteria,a folie en masse that was as inexplicable as it was embarrassing. The makers of 'The Queen' have portrayed one of the most courageous and stubborn auto - didacts of the 20th century as a petulant cold schemer hiding behind a thin veneer of haughtiness.In a scene of risible unlikelihood she bursts into tears at the sight of a well - endowed stag (not the D of E).Mr J.Cromwell makes a fair fist of the Prince Consort himself.Both a supporter and a wholesale slaughterer of wildlife,he undoubtedly would have reached for his rifle rather than his handkerchief if confronted with such a magnificent creature. Diana Spencer must have felt she was marrying into 'The Simpsons'. I can't believe she was ever 'in love' - whatever that means - with Bart - sorry - Charles Prince of Wales,surely one of the most spoiled,arrogant and self - obsessed men at ever drew breath in our fair isle.I suspect the idea rather than the actuality of marrying into the Royal Family drew her into their orbit.Whatever the reason,both she and they luived to regret it. I hardly believed a word of this purely fictional account of how her death affected - or - more properly - failed to affect her mega - rich socially isolated in - laws. Tony Blair and his Champagne Socialist wife are comic book figures,Blair himself only redeemed by his respect for the Queen as opposed to the institution of Monarchy. Alistair Campbell is worthy of being roundly hissed and booed by a pantomime audience.Poor,silly,beautiful,vain and betrayed by the most powerful family in the land,Diana Spencer deserved a better epitaph than the lugubrious hyberbole spoken by her brother in Westminster Abbey that September day.It is a measure of the times that he was cheered to the echo then but has few friends in society now due to his appalling exploitation of the memory of his 'beloved' sister.",3,10,20,22 September 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Preposterous.Psychobabble meets schlock horror.Laughable.
","Allow me to gingerly dip a toe into the chill waters of dissenting opinion here.'The silence of the lambs' was nothing more than a risible schlock horror meets pop psychology movie that rode to huge success on the back of a quite brilliant advertising campaign.Mr A.Hopkins,on his way to becoming v.v.rich,slums it up gleefully with some jovial serial-killer quips,lending like Richard Burton before him,his glorious voice to the Studio paymasters.His character,a repulsive homicidal maniac,a lover(of course) of classical music with dialogue direct from the Smart-alec Hollywood Writers' Handbook,,a Lord Byron amongst serial killers,seeks amusement by manipulating young and inexperienced FBI trainee (Miss J.Foster) at will.Of course in real life any inexperienced FBI trainee after her first meeting with such a nutjob would have told her bosses where to poke their badge and gone on a long holiday as far away from Quantico as possible,but this isn't real life and plucky moppet that she is,Miss Foster takes him on at his own game.Really,how likely is that? With plenty of ripe ham from Mr H. and some Nancy Drew like behaviour from Miss F.,the movie trundles over familiar ground with lots of shocks that aren't shocking for people who remember them from the first time around.Mr H escapes and eats somebody.Excuse me whilst I repair my split sides. They should have given an Oscar (T.M.) to the publicity department.",4,7,16,6 August 2009
Bruce Almighty," If God is a cow,being a vegetarian might be a useful option......
","Find the concept of God as an old white man with a beard just a tad patronising?Or maybe racist?How about.....wait for it......making him an old black man with a beard?You can give him a white suit to appease the Klanners of course,but,basically,is that radical or what? Mr M.Freeman isn't quite as cool as Mr S.L.Jackson but he's cool enough to steal this movie from under the nose of Mr J.Carrey quite effortlessly.Miss J.Aniston - game as a young Debbie Reynolds - plays Lois Lane to Carrey's Superman(for what is God but Superman after all?)and is - in my opinion - a far better actress than she is given credit for.She radiates intensity and determination and it is not her fault that she is required to replicate Miss M.Ryan in a totally unnecessary and faintly embarrassing sequence where our Jim tests out his supreme power in a predictable manner. 'Bruce Almighty' does not travel well.Mr Carrey is an acquired taste. When he demands of Miss Aniston 'Love me,love me,love me' he is echoing the command many American comedians issue peremptorily to their audience ,one which does not settle too well with the more delicate stomach of the average Brit. There is a breakthrough role in the history of canine cinema for Mr Carrey's dog whose thespic skills are tested to the limit when he is required to sit on the can whilst reading a newspaper,now there's a first for you.You may find this the highlight of the whole movie. What,one wonders,would God make of it?Well,presuming he/she is human and not,as Gary Larson suspected,a cow,then I hope that for Mr Carrey's sake the saying 'To err is human - to forgive divine' has at least an element of truth in it.If however God is a cow,being a vegetarian might be a useful option.",4,0,0,4 January 2008
Casino Royale," Marvellously energetic,exciting and fun.Welcome back 007.............
","O.K. so now there are two good James Bond movies - 'Dr.No' and 'Casino Royale',wildly disparate in almost every detail but both pulsing with energy and an odd kind of innocence. 'C.R.' starts off like a manic computer game played at 'Expert' level with breathless action and frankly ridiculous stunts that build to a frantic climax before the movie slows down to let us recover our breath and James Bond is allowed a little time to develop into a 21st century version of Fleming's Cold War warrior. This is Miss J.Dench's best performance as 'M',oddly humanised by being shown in bed with a man - presumably her husband as he is fast asleep. If it matters the plot diverges somewhat from the original,but if what you want is cinematic thrills then fill your boots. Mr D.Craig is nothing like any previous movie Bond and a good job too. With movies as good as this the franchise could run another 40 years.",8,0,2,1 September 2010
Sweet and Lowdown," Woody Allen's 'Amadeus'.
","The guitar is the subtlest of instruments,capable - in the right hands - of expressing nuances so fragile that they appear to fade into nothingness almost as soon as they are heard.Sublety is a formidable weapon in the jazz guitarist's arsenal,and Howard Alden,who plays the guitar on the soundtrack of 'Sweet and Lowdown' is a master of the 'Chord Melody' style and a man with the touch of a gentle yet ardent lover.When he plays 'I'm forever blowing bubbles' as a solo a la Eddie Lang you are hearing sublime artistry.Could a person capable of making music of such beauty be a lying cheating thieving son of a bitch? Well,yes,actually,if that man is Emmett Ray(Sean Penn) in Woody Allen's examination of the nature of genius. One minute stunning a noisy nightclub crowd into silence with a breath- taking version of 'Parlez - moi d'amour',the next urging his girl-friend 'Let's go to the dump and shoot some rats',Mr Ray is not an easy read. Jazz lovers are particularly prone to looking at their heroes through rose - coloured glasses,a trait Mr Allen has a gentle dig at despite quite possibly possessing it himself.As a jazz lover no doubt he worshipped many a musician and probably more than a few failed to live up to his fantasies. They were still brilliant artists but flawed human beings .Emmett Ray is no Mozart,but 'Sweet and Lowdown' is Woody Allen's 'Amadeus'.",9,0,0,8 November 2005
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," It's not easy being Queen.....
","Not since 'The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex' has our greatest monarch been so ill - served.'Elizabeth:The Golden Age' is dumbed down tosh that would have been kicked out of an 'Eastenders' story conference.It patronises its audience that clearly is supposed not to be able to accept or even understand that 21st century values and conventions did not apply in Tudor times.Women were considered mainly as objects for male pleasure and their main use was to continue a bloodline.This applied even to Queens.Hence the concern over Elizabeth's childless state.The only way she could keep the throne was to behave in a manner so ruthless it would have made her late father blanch. She may have had lovers but they were strictly for political gain or to perform a purely sexual function.She was never to display weakness or vulnerability. I find her physical contact with Bess Throckmorton to be highly fanciful but it might please a modern audience looking for some girl - on - girl action. Mr C.Owen plays Raleigh as a second - rate Errol Flynn,defying his Queen with flashing eyes and sparkling teeth. Miss Blanchett has certainly mastered the English accent but she poses rather than acts and barely seems in control of her horse during her battle speech. Mr G.Rush seems to have decided to play Walsingham as if he was in a state of acute sleep - deprivation.Elizabeth would have had him for breakfast. The interwoven plot about Mary,Queen of Scots,seems to have atrophied on the vine,so to speak.Only on the morning of her cousin's execution does Elizabeth seem to have given the matter much consideration. Still,it's not easy being Queen............. I wondered,as the film came to a close,what it was actually supposed to have been about.The Spanish Armada?The growing pains of the Anglican church?The end of the Spanish Empire?The love affair between Raleigh and Bess Throckmorton?The conceit that anyone can fall in lurve even the Virgin Queen?All of the above? Whatever,it failed to engage my interest at any of those levels.",4,0,2,1 January 2011
The Deer Hunter," Explores the bounds of friendship and community as none since.
","Mr Robert de Niro is often mooted as the greatest movie actor in America if not the world.Well,not on recent form he isn't.He may well be one of the most omnipresent movie actors in the world,but that isn't quite the same thing.There is a whole generation of moviegoers who have grown up since he last gave a performance that wasn't redolent of over-ripe ham. To them let me introduce 'The Deer Hunter'.Not the DVD with its superfluous 'extras',not the video with its flickering images and muddy soundtrack,but the movie.In all its widescreen,stereophonic sound all - enveloping glory.Make no mistake,the cinema is the only possible place to fully appreciate Mr Michael Cimino's masterpiece.This isn't some overblown TV mini-series designed to be absorbed in 15 minute bites between adverts for dog food or MacDonalds(there's a difference?). 'The Deer Hunter' is serious movie - making,requiring the viewer to exercise his or her full attention for a little over three hours. Perhaps the present generation find themselves unable to turn their mobile phones off for that long;certainly many contributors to this site seem unwilling or unable to make the effort to give TDH their full attention for all its 182 minutes.Possibly they'd be happier if Picasso had made 'Guernica' a lot smaller so it didn't take so much time to look at. TDH is a movie about love and friendship.It's about an immigrant community engaged in the intricate process of retaining its ethnic identity whilst assuming that of its host nation.It's about loyalty,loss and the resilience of the human spirit.And some of it is about war.It happens to be the war in Vietnam,but it could be any war. Soldiers die,get crippled,become traumatised,be it Vietnam,Europe or Iraq. If the Russians had made TDH it would have been hailed as a great humanitarian document - another 'The cranes are flying'.But it was made by the Americans whose capacity for self - hatred is exceeded only by that of the British,and was duly trashed by many so-called intellectuals and opinion-makers,all wracked with fashionable guilt. The only salvageable asset in the movie was adjudged to be Mr de Niro's performance.Denigrators and admirers of the movie alike were united in their admiration for his portrayal of Michael (Cimino?),the charismatic slightly aloof natural leader of the group of young men who willingly go off to war,seeing it as their duty to their community and their community's unspoken obligation to the country that took them in. Michael is a strong-minded moral man imbued with the values of both the Old Country and the new one.A Frontiersman born a hundred years too late perhaps.In the sort of role Mr Gary Cooper might have played thirty years earlier,Mr de Niro is truly inspired.Only as the deeply unlikeable Jake La Motta was he ever near to this level of performance again.Mr Christopher Walken has been caricaturing himself for so long that is a surprise to see him as a hungry young actor,intense and seething with inner energy,playing a man so traumatised by his experiences that his post - war life is one long drawn - out act of suicide. Miss Meryl Streep,now a grande dame of the cinema,is so beautiful and vulnerable that you want to weep.Here she has no funny accent,no mannerisms and she lights up the screen.It is the only performance of hers about which I have absolutely no reservations.When her drunken father punches her I would quite happily have taken out a gun and shot him. Mr Cimino is not a flash - bang - wallop director.He takes the time to establish his characters and their milieu,he is in this for the long haul .To me the wedding sequence is the most interesting and best realised of the movie.All the group dynamics are established here and at the deer hunt.Some of the young men go off to war,some stay at home. The community will carry on whatever happens. That is the crux of this movie.That is why it doesn't matter whether the war is in Vietnam,Europe or Iraq. Ultimately it's the survival of the community that matters,albeit at a high cost.In the controversial last scene where the survivors at first haltingly then more firmly sing 'God Bless America' it's as a hymn to the community and a defiance to ill - fate .Only incidentally is it an anthem of patriotism. There is no doubt in my mind that 'The Deer Hunter' is one of the great American movies.It doesn't matter that the hunt itself was filmed in the 'wrong' mountains,that the VC guards would never have given Mr de Niro a loaded gun......this is not a documentary we're talking about here.Simply put,its scope is huge,its performances uniformly magnificent.Its reach,however ambitious,never exceeds its grasp.Mr Cimino set out to explore the bounds of friendship and community and succeeded as no director has done since.",10,0,0,22 November 2006
Saving Mr. Banks," Write what you know.
","Well,Mrs Travers certainly did that,basing her best known book 'Mary Poppins' on her own somewhat fraught childhood. Having achieved that catharsis she had no wish to see her characters 'Disneyfied' by a man whose only achievement as far as she could reckon was to have drawn a cartoon mouse and gotten very rich on it. Thus the contest began between this strong determinedly unimpressed Englishwoman and one of Hollywood's richest movie moguls for the 'soul' if you like,of the world's favourite nanny. Well,we know of course that Mr Disney won her over eventually and ended up making possibly his best - ever film,and probably his most - loved. The 'Mr Banks' in the title refers not only to Mr D.Tomlinson's character but that of her father,a gently alcoholic businessman in Australia on whom it was based. Miss E.Thompson is blindingly good as Miss Travers,charming yet steely right up to the end. Mr T.Hanks plays his usual good - humoured and slightly exasperated character,a turn he has made his own over the last 30 years. It's a sad and funny quite uplifting film - rather like 'Mary Poppins' itself. Even if you haven't been to the pictures since 1964 when you sat down to watch Julie and Dick armed with a 'Kia - Ora' and some popcorn I urge you to give it a go.",10,1,2,17 May 2017
Am√©lie," 'Amelie' est les nads du chien.
","Just when you are being encouraged to think of the French as cheese - eating surrender monkeys they bring out of the chapeau a film so completely Gallic,sweet and enchanting,full of insight into the human condition that only a nation completely aware of its own strengths and vulnerabilities and proud of its liberal and creative traditions could possibly have produced it. 'Amelie' is all of that and more.It is ,in fact,sui generis.It provides Mlle Audrey Tatou the role of a lifetime as the eponymous heroine,a naive and kind - hearted young Parisienne determined to bring happiness to peoples' lives whether they want it or not. Now you will either buy into this or you won't.Simple as that.But I suspect that if there is an ounce of romance and optimism in your soul 'Amelie' will reach out to it. Starting on the day of Princess Diana's death,the film follows Amelie's path to true love and happiness through good deeds.Simply irresistible.",10,2,9,31 March 2007
The Producers," Laugh ? I nearly started.....
","'Very loud,'The Producers' '- as Noel Coward might have said.10 minutes of it goes a long way.I remember the posters on the Underground when the movie first came out.'The funniest film I have ever seen',says Peter Sellers.Well,certainly everybody who's in it seems convinced they're being funny.Knowing looks,nods and winks are dispensed freely isn't this a hoot everyone seems to be saying,you've got to laugh haven't you?Er,no,actually,you haven't.You've seen one spoof Nazi production number and you've seen them all.Messrs Mostel and Wilder work themselves up into a frenzy to very little effect as far as I'm concerned although I note that many many people find them hilarious. Mel Brooks can be very funny,a master of the witty riposte,interviewee sublime and king of the punsters,but in 'The Producers ' he over eggs the pudding enormously - grotesquely even.Frantic humour can work but it needs a director in charge of his actors - a firm controlling hand. Contrast Bogdanovich and 'What's up doc?' with Mr Brooks either failing or not bothering to get a grip on his cast. He did better with the sublime Madeline Khan in 'Blazing saddles ' and curbed the excesses of Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein' so perhaps 'The Producers' was the start of a sharp learning curve. Certainly it exudes a certain 'I'm making fun of the Nazis so it must be funny' quality that might make you feel guilty for not falling about. See past that and there might be less there than meets the eye.",4,13,22,3 June 2007
Shall We Dance," We marry because'We all need a witness to our lives'? Yuk...
","Come off it!That is exactly the sort of psychobabble that gives wealthy middle class American women like Mrs Clark(Miss S.Sarandon) a bad name. In 'Shall we dance?' she utters it straight-faced and with every appearance of deadly earnestness.No one in the movie questions this statement so we are left with the impression that the producers actually believe it and that Mr Clark (Mr R.Gere) not only needs Miss Sarandon to witness his life but also Miss J.Lopez to witness it as well and to hope that Miss Sarandon doesn't witness Miss Lopez witnessing Mr Gere's life........I could go on but life(witnessed or no)is too short....... So,apart from some cringe-worthy dialogue,what does 'Shall we dance?' have to offer?Perhaps surprisingly,quite a lot.Mr Gere exhudes charm as the lawyer slightly bored with the apparent perfection of his life.Spotting the winsome Miss Lopez on a balcony from the passing El,this aspirant Romeo leaves the train and joins her Dancing Class with a motive that is not Strictly Ballroom.She rebuffs him and he settles for learning to dance instead. Later,warming to him,she is all dilated nostrils,half - closed eyes and heavy of breath whenever he is within ten feet,but it is too late by then;she has had her chance and lost it. Mr Gere's fellow students are a righteous mixture of race and gender so everybody in the audience except perhaps the odd Eskimo (sorry,Innuit) can feel comfortable. But it's easy to be hypercritical,and the raison d'etre for 'Shall we dance?' is the wonderful music and the dancing that is made to seem accessible to even the least likely tyros. This is a movie awash with great tunes even though Mr Gere is shown to be sufficiently down with the kids to enjoy a sanitised Rap performer with his son and the son's girlfriend.And if it isn't really him dancing with such elan and grace,well,I don't have to believe it if I don't want to. Because of Mr Gere's charm I can forgive the crass dialogue,I can forgive Miss Lopez's inadequacies,I can even forgive Mr Tucci for wearing a wig.Such forgiveness brings with it a heavy burden for his slim shoulders,but he bears it well. He is also carrying,like a torch,the hopes of many middle-aged men,wrinkly of skin and droopy of butt,that experience and wisdom can triumph over energy and youth.Ah,keep on dreaming lads...........",6,1,3,11 April 2009
Thirteen Days," 'The Big Red Dog is digging in our backyard'...............
","October 1962.The American Embassy,Grosvenor Square,London.Half a dozen Met cops,rushed for some unfathomable reason from their East London nick are drinking coffee in the underground car park which is rapidly filling with gun - toting U.S.Marines.Our sergeant.a grizzled vet who had seen service with the Welsh Guards in what he called 'The Big One' suggested to a nervous - looking grunt that his President might be over - reacting to a typical piece of Kruschevian provocation. 'What would Macmillan do if the reds put their missiles in Ireland?'was the response.Taff thought for a moment then said,'Try and set the buggers off,probably'.The marine snorted.'The Big Red Dog is digging in our backyard'.He threw his coffee cup into a bin and went to join his mates who were getting in position to repel a couple of dozen 'Hands off Cuba' demonstrators in case they were stupid enough to charge the Embassy. I was reminded of this brief encounter when I watched '13 Days' and the placement of Soviet Missiles in Cuba was referred to in the exact same terms in the film. Fortunately for all of us Mr Kruschev was exercising his penchant for brinksmanship and President Kennedy earned his respect by calling his bluff.There was a deal to be done and both men took advantage of the opportunity. In '13 Days' we see how Kennedy had the moral strength to beat down the military who were set on 'First Strike' as the preferred option. In scenes thick with testosterone he defies this baying pack and listens to the voice of reason. Having lived through this event,the details are less of a revelation to me,but that does not detract from the efficacy of the film. The weak point is Mr K.Costner who not only has a very poor accent but also wears his underpants beneath his pyjamas. Just over a year later I was back at the Embassy in the turmoil caused by Kennedy's assassination and a few years further on fought the mob in Grosvenor Square during the 'October Revolution'.I got a nasty kick on the shin.A small price to pay for supporting our close friends and allies,in my book.",7,0,1,26 November 2010
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Laugh ?.- I nearly started
","If you were to cut Mr J.Cleese in half you would find 'Oxbridge/BBC' written all the way through,rather like in a stick of Brighton rock.He is just the kind of chap the Oxbridge mafia who run the BBC think should have unlimited air time,hence his seemingly endless TV appearances on chat shows,compilation programmes reruns of the hideously unfunny 'Fawlty Towers',discussions on what makes comedy funny,(shurely shome mishtake here - as soon as you start dissecting comedy it becomes distinctly unfunny),Monty Python reunions etc etc.They see his task as the edification of us proles,for he is surely one of 'them' and not one of us.To me Mr Cleese has never got over his schoolboy wish to say 'Fxxk' in a church.Once he had achieved that at Graham Chapman's memorial service he should have grown up a bit,but,alas,he never has. Mr Chapman was still with us,although already an alcoholic,in 1975 when 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' was released.In the 32 years that have passed since then,the film has acquired a reputation -particularly in the U.S. where Pythonmania seems rampant - that far exceeds its merits. Put succinctly,it is nowhere near as funny as the cast thinks it is and they are nowhere near as clever as they think they are. Much of the humour is 'hommaged' from sources as diverse as The Goon Show and,er,...The Goon Show.Much of the rest can be traced back to the Marx Bros,British Music Hall and radio stars and 'Hellzapoppin''. That doesn't leave an awful lot of original innovative stuff that many people credit them with for introducing to TV and films. Every evening at the going down of the sun,these Python boys should be giving thanks to Spike Milligan.And Max Wall.And Gillie Potter.And Nat Jackley.And so on. Now on the West End stage as the musical 'Spamalot'(Laugh ? - I nearly started)it plays before packed audiences who could no doubt repeat the 'Dead Parrot' sketch by heart. Back in 1975 such an event would have beyond even Mr T.Gilliam's rich imagination.",5,3,9,27 July 2007
Braveheart," Mel Gibson's Woad Movie
","As a man born in Scotland but brought up in England I am in a position to see both sides of the war fought by one means or another for a thousand years.The Scots,perceived as the good guys by the rest of the world if the comments on this site are anything to go by,have,as is customary for smaller nations,held the moral high ground for as long as the conflict has been going on.Yet the English,for most of the time are hardly aware of the war at all.Only when the two nations played each other at football(soccer )at Wembley Stadium and what the sports media referred to as 'The Tartan Hordes' descended on London did Anglophobia raise its ugly head above the parapet . Mostly the English can't be doing with the 'Scotland the Brave' nonsense as sung in English pubs by drunken Scots,glaring round aggressively to deter any gainsayers.'Get a life',is the usual quietly muttered retort. One would like to think that cockneys singing 'Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner' would be treated as tolerantly should the circumstances be reversed.And tolerance is the key word in any consideration of Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart'.Because the movie is so ridiculously biased as to be almost racist in concept and execution..Simplistic and bad history,Little Mel has allowed himself to make a movie swayed by resentment and hatred,real and imagined grudges and the sort of chauvinism that,had it been expressed by the English,would have been sneered at by Guardianistas all over Highgate. Did a single English person object to this farrago of nationalistic fervour?No.To most it's a matter of supreme indifference that yet another Hollywood director sets out to rubbish the nation.Get a life guys - better yet get a history book.Hollywood movie",3,4,10,14 June 2007
Gladiator," 'Infamy! Infamy!...they've all got it in for me!'
","Along with many Ridley Scott films 'Gladiator' is cleverly made,full of dialogue that at first hearing sounds deeper and and more meaningful than it actually is and comic - book characters. Up to the time of Marcelus's death it holds the interest well enough apart from Mr R.Harris's constant use of the word 'Ah!' in order to convey 'irony' ,and Mr R.Crowe's occasional lapse into his native 'strine' isn't too grating and he's certainly handy with a sword.But the development of the role of Commodus (a name worthy of any 'Carry on' movie)as the new Caesar (Mr J.Pheonix about as frightening as a baddie in 'Batman')and the ousting of Mr Crowe signal a drastic change from a well - realised account of the conduct of the Roman Army in Northern Europe to a second - rate retread of 'Spartacus'. With bits liberally borrowed from 'Ben Hur' and 'The fall of the Roman Empire' and 'The Searchers' via 'Star Wars',Mr Scott's sources are impeccable,it's his execution that is disappointing. A few British TV actors appear as Senators and such,to very little effect I'm afraid,their over-familiarity does them or the movie no favours.Presumably 'Isn't that the bloke from Z Cars?' was not the response Mr Scott was looking for. Where the movie scores is in the Special Effects department. The fight scenes are well - handled,the tigers being particularly impressive,but CGI alone do not a great movie make. The late Oliver Reed acts almost as if he knows 'Gladiator' is going to be his last hurrah,it's all in his eyes,most of his dialogue is pretty banal.His leonine head held high with obvious effort,he gives the movie what little gravitas it possesses.His may have been a somewhat checkered career but he went out with all guns blazing. Mr Scott,as highly accomplished as he is ,continues,since 'Blade Runner' to be a director in search of a movie.I note that many people believe he found it in 'Gladiator',but I respectfully beg to differ.",6,0,4,9 June 2007
Dodgeball," Like an endless Monty Python sketch..................
","If this were the 'Eurovision Song Contest','Dodgeball' would be awarded the dreaded 'Nil Points'.It is a movie beyond bad.Mr Rip Torn is the best thing about it .He is merely very very bad.Apart from Mr Ben Stiller,Mr Torn is the only member of what can loosely described as 'The Cast' that I have ever heard of and I am quite keen to keep it that way.Not that Mr Stiller is any good.He is so bad the word 'bad' begins to lose any meaning.He contrived to screw up 'The Royal Tenenbaums' but it flowed blithely around him.He managed to be less amusing than Robert de Niro in 'Meet the parents',not an easy task for a comedian.In 'Dodgeball',in the face of sterling opposition,he gives the worst performance in the movie. I have never heard of dodgeball as a competitive sport,I thought it had been invented purely for the movie,rather like 'Rollerball',but it appears not to be the case.That being so,all I can say is 'Only in America'...... The game appears to revolve around two teams throwing a ball as hard as possible at each other with the object of hitting an opponent with it. We may have to wait some time for the Joe DiMaggio of dodgeball to emerge I would imagine. Whatever its merits or otherwise as a game per se,whether it is a worthy subject for a feature film is certainly to say the least debatable. What is beyond debate is that 'Dodgeball' is a movie that has been allowed to sprawl,start and stutter with no sign of a controlling hand until it peters out rather like a Monty Python sketch nobody could be bothered to think of an end for. The man who made this should be smacked gently but firmly on the legs, have his toys taken away from him and made to promise never to do it again.",1,1,5,29 July 2007
From Here to Eternity," Mr Burt Lancaster dominates a copper - bottomed classic.....
","This movie gives us a chance to see Mr M.Clift at his angst - ridden best,Mr F.Sinatra either creating a character he was to morph into for the rest of his career or merely playing a character he had already become and Mr B.Lancaster at the height of his grace and beauty stalking across the screen like a hungry tiger.Watch the way he walks during the beach scene,light on his feet,slightly leaning forward,every sense aware........it is a marvellous performance.Miss D.Kerr is put in the shade in their every scene together despite her showy part as the officer's lady with a taste for noncoms. Miss D.Reed is excellent as the social - climbing tart. Often imitated but never excelled,'From here to eternity' is a story of the Army overseas on the brink of war.There are not many good guys,but plenty of ordinary guys doing their best to get along without upsetting too many people.On the 'Day of Infamy' these disparate elements come together in common cause against the enemy. The ending,played out between the two very different leading ladies,is outstanding,Miss Reed walking away with the honours. The plot is too well - known to bear recounting and it is definitely a guy thing,the sort of tale where the women are either whores or saints,and there aren't too many saints in the movie. A gay subtext?Well,not in 1953 Hollywood there wasn't,and Mr Clift may be sad and vulnerable but he's reassuringly hetero when push comes to shove. But it's Mr Lancaster who grabs this movie by the balls and never lets go.Somewhere in heaven there's an Oscar waiting for him.",10,5,6,11 November 2008
