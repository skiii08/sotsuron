Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awful
","This movie is one of the worst movies in science fiction history. Without giving any spoilers, the only things I can say are the following:||extremely inconsistent storyline. ||very noticeable plot holes. ||Anakin's narration of what he is doing and when, during each scene of which he is apart, becomes extremely annoying. Even for 8 year olds, it doesn't look or feel right. ||Age problems -- Anakin is clearly too young. ||Special effects are stocky, blocky, and could not have been worse if Ed Wood directed them. ||Due to Lucas' intent on using blue screens everywhere, the direction looks staged, ridiculous and confined. In places which should be great grand halls, everyones huddling around center stage. ||Jar Jar Binks is a very racist and overt stereotype of a black Jamaican. I found it morally offensive. Anyone who has anyone else say 'Massa' the way Jar Jar says it should take a clear look at themselves in a mirror.This movie is absolutely unwatchable for anyone with a sense of good cinema. What's amazing is George Lucas managed to capitalize on these 7 or more bad points on this Episode 1 film, and found a way to make the subsequent films even WORSE!How could it have been this bad while the original 3 were so great? Simple: a man named Joseph Campbell was on set throughout the filming of the other movies. Those with philosophy and anthropology degrees know him as a man who did the Power of Myth series for PBS. It is clear he kept George grounded. Unfortunately he died long before George did Episodes 1-3 and the absence of the man's mind is clearly demonstrated in these god awful prequels.",1,4,7,9 March 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Best adaptation of a children's book to movie!
","Anyone who doesn't like this movie, and claims the original is true to form obviously never read the books. While the original movie was a fine production, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was a great improvement. The first such improvement lay in the title: 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' -- NOT 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. This movie is about Charlie first and foremost, not about a comedian from SNL. The rest lay in the scripting of the book to movie format. While all translations will undergo some changes (Lord of the Rings), this movie kept true to not only the attitude of each character (Violet and Mike make perfect sense), but presence of the gadgets (opening scene), the Oompa Loompa description (Deep Roy was amazing as opposed to candy colored midgets of the first movie), the songs (all written by Roald Dahl), down to Willy Wonka's view of the degradation of society. Roald Dahl's second wife has a producing credit on the film, forming a close tie between the family and this production (which, according to her in a recent newsweek interview, was lacking in the first film). I believe this made all the difference. The only major change in this book dealt with Willy Wonka, however, considering the character description in the book compared with last years 'Series of Unfortunate Events', it would likely frighten any kid if Willy Wonka were put in makeup to resemble the book description. Having said that, Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka, as opposed to Gene Wilder being Gene Wilder. Charlie is always an innocent, without a single mean streak, rather than the first movie. The rest of the kids you absolutely hate -- like you should. I have seen it twice and wish to see it again.",10,3,6,24 July 2005
