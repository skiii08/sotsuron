The Blair Witch Project," Overhyped under acted and as scary as a kiddies cartoon
","This film was so overhyped I should have realised it would be rubbish as is often the case when critics are paid to push the film.
However even I wasn't expecting it to be that bad not only is the story lame it is boring. If you want Horror then look no further than The Excorcist now that film even by today's standards is up there forget the Blair Stichers project",1,3,9,21 October 2018
The Avengers," Marvellous
","When it comes to super hero movies Marvel is no1The reason they are far superior than any DC production is they take the time to write a good story script employ great actors and also superb special effects.This movie has it all and adults and teens will enjoy
Take note DC this is how you make a good super hero movie!",8,1,1,21 March 2020
Aquaman," Jason Mamoa saves DC without him this movie would join all the other DC flops
",I continue to watch DC films with the hope that some day they will develop movies of the standard of Marvel sadly I fear that day will never arrive. Not only do DC continuously have bad scripts but the story is weak! Aquaman is better than most mainly due to the lead actor Mamoa however the script and story base is still poor from an adult perspective although youngsters may love it?,4,1,4,3 January 2019
Bird Box," Senseless literally!
","Well it was only a matter of time after the movie based on monsters that react to noise (a quiet place) that we would get a movie based on monsters that effect you by sight! Bird box should have been named a dark place.
I am surprised that Sandra Bullock accepted the role considering the total lack of substance and storyline.
Simlair to a quiet place they managed to fill 2hrs with bad script bad story and a lot of boredomDon't waste your time unless you loved a quiet place then this 2hrs of stationary boredom is probably right up your street!",1,14,25,3 January 2019
The Revenant," Very underwhelming to the point of boredom
",Not much of a story infact remove the bear from the equation and there is no story! As much as I admire Leonardo d Capricorn as an actor I don't think even he can save this film infact he prob would like to forget starring in it,2,2,4,6 July 2019
Now You See Me," Entertaining from start to end!
","This is a very slick entertaining movie superbly scripted with first class cast great drama that will keep you guessing and like a lot of thrillers you think you have it Sussed only to find you are wY off base,love the magic involved and find it fascinating this movie will not disappoint had me gripped right to the end",10,1,3,29 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Quiet boring place
","This movie was definitely overhyped! To the point the few trailers that they rammed down everyone's throat to publicise the movie was the most action in all of it!
No real story as such no substance and a script that beggars beliefWhat will they think of next? Probably a movie where monsters get you by sight so the world has to wear blindfolds! ðŸ™„",1,1,4,3 January 2019
Inception," Great concept superbly developed
",I loved this movie the concept was brilliant and the way the story developed sure genius! It is one of those few movies that has such an in depth story that I had to watch the movie twice to really appreciate all the twists and plots within it great scripting and acting a joy to watch,9,0,2,4 January 2019
Green Book," A Must watch movie
","Based on a True story this film is a very beautiful thought provoking look and battle of predjjustices held not only of a persons skin colour but of their own identity .
Superbly acted a story that will provoke many emotions ending in a heart warming finish and feel good factor Loved this film as much as I loved the 2 main actors.",9,5,11,3 January 2019
