First Man," Enjoyed the intensity, some decent acting from Claire but Ryan leaves something to be desired.
",Couldn't tell at times if Gosling was a husk of a person or acting like it. Very empty personality,7,0,0,8 February 2019
The Death of Stalin," Amazing satirical comedy
","The movie starts slightly slow as you build the characters but after a short, serious period, it really becomes something special. The dialogue is first-class, the directing feels like an HBO comedy (VEEP director) I just loved it.",9,1,2,8 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Made me feel like a kid again
","Few movies can make me feel like I'm in a comic book. Tron: Legacy, Watchmen, and now Captain Marvel all did an excellent job capturing the essence of comics in film. There was the staple cheesy dialogue, the over-the-top sarcasm, the badass fight scenes and none of the over dramatic crap the DC universe has been crafting since Nolan walked away from Batman.The soundtrack fit the bill perfectly too, almost unnoticeably so. I didn't realize until the final fight scene that the music was really helping me feel like I'm in this moving graphic novel. Pleasantly surprised!",8,0,1,10 March 2019
Prisoners," A just-fine ending doesn't ruin a fantastic journey
","There were many misdirections, and lots of skin-crawl-inducing moments. The music and overall tone were great, and the confusion around the villain was excellent.Jake Gyllenhall puts up another masterful performance.",8,2,3,22 December 2019
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix carries this, otherwise bland, film
","Phoenix is amazing, deserves any and every award for acting. The writing and plot are boring and leave something to be desired. Clearly the writers wanted something grounded in reality and that meant there couldn't be such an immediate jump to insanity, but it also meant that the viewer has to slog through a long checklist of items a normal man must go through to descend into madness, and many of those aren't entertaining.",6,4,9,21 December 2019
