10 Cloverfield Lane," Not that Cloverfield Lane
","Relatively enjoyable, interesting little flick, which predominantly takes place in an underground bunker whilst the end of the world is playing outside...or is it?Great casting with Goodman & Winstead, reminisce of War of the Worlds Cruise & Robbins, but better acted & fleshed out. Walter Sobchak is a very underrated actor. He's genuinely creepy and unhinged in this.May polarise audiences(well maybe those with expectations), but it's pretty solid for the most part.The end seems a little tacked on, but there are worse things you can do for 90 mins....just don't expect Cloverfield, which in itself isn't a bad thing.7/10",7,3,10,9 March 2016
World War Z," World War Propaganda...eghhh.
","More like World War 'P'.What should have been a good, fun zombie flick is killed with such an overt political message, that's so in your face, I'm surprised there weren't any reps from big-pharma handing out drugs and administering injections in the cinema lobby after the film ended.Meh! An hour and a half of pro-Israeli, U.N, W.H.O propaganda?!? And such understated subtly! Chalk up another from the Ministry of Truth's mouth-piece, Hollywood.Max Brooks must be spinning in his grave ;)Disappointing.4-4.5/10",3,27,59,19 June 2013
Pacific Rim," Big, Dumb, Loud Fun - Just remember to turn your Brain Off
","Afternoon off so snuck off to the flicks to see -[*Pacific Rim*]Big, dumb, loud, apocalyptic, destructo-fest of huge robots fighting bigger monsters, bent on the destruction of the world.Del Toro's vision & attention to detail is awesome. A great looking film.Ignore the cheezy acting & dialogue(& even worse Australian accents) and immerse yourself in the robot/alien apocalypse to end all robot/alien apocalypses(or is that apocalypsi/ies/s - never mind).Won't win any Oscars for acting or writing, so along with your mobile, just remember to switch off the brain before the film starts ;)I came out afterwards entertained, grinning like an adolescent fool ;)Good fun if you can take it for what it is. Was like watching an hour & a half of that great 80's arcade game, Rampage, made into a live action flick.[*7 Cheezeballs outta 10*]",7,0,3,2 August 2013
Dunkirk," Dunkirk @ IMAX 1570: A Must See
","Caught this @ Imax on Thursday night on the 1570 viewing.It's a beautifully crafted film. Zimmer's score drones throughout creating a sense of non-stop tension and foreboding. It's relentless, almost fatiguing in parts. The sound-stage and the score really make the film. You hear and feel so much of the film. It was bloody loud in parts. I could have been Tom Hardy's co-pilot and still couldn't hear or understand a word he said.Nolan once again uses time as a motive, utilising a non-linear structure telling three separate stories that intersect during the Battle of Dunkirk. It's done very well. The cast is very good throughout, all giving solid performances.My only criticism would be that it was pretty tame and a somewhat low- key rendition of the Battle of Dunkirk. It's almost minimalist in parts.Very, very solid filmmaking. Will watch this again as I think the Imax experience was a little overwhelming and all encompassing at times – the dog fights, dive- bombing and air scenes were intense!Definitely an early contender for awards season.",8,4,12,22 July 2017
Drive," Solid, entertaining flick, but not the hyped masterpiece others portray
","Fairly solid popcorn flick, though there seems to be some hype over substance.Nice looking film that's well shot, but felt like I had seen it all before. Soundtrack seemed to be all over the place and stylistically it seemed a little mish-mash at times, i.e 80's Miami Vice/Scar Face meets 70's film-noir, which creates a kind of weird modern/retro look and feel to the film. Pacing was a little off for the first 30 minutes of the film.I kept on thinking back to Gosling's performance in Lars and the Real Girl (those awkward, long silences). Great to see Nemo's dad as a psychopath. Solid, workman-like performances by most of the cast, though Mulligan seems to be putting in the same goofy, doe-eyed performances of late(Never let me Go, Wall Street 2, etc) Enjoyable, but I think some of the hype/talk has made this film something that it isn't.You can certainly do a lot worse for 90 minutes.7 - 7.5/10",7,0,2,5 October 2011
Elysium," What could have been
","Film left me a little flat. Conceptually good, visually great, but pacing seemed a little off @ times and was quite clunky in parts. Back story kinda pointless(except for the young Matt Damon who looked like River Phoenix as a boy, unless that was the point). Last 1/3 or ¼ of the film seems to go off the rails.I guess shaky cam is still OK? Just makes the visual blur of any action sequence frustratingly unwatchable.Went in with high expectations, but the film just didn't have the same impact as District 9. Can't quite put my finger on what was missing/wrong with the film, but it didn't gel with me.Again Sharlto was great, until the last 1/3rd which turns into transformers with humans or something like that.Not a bad film, just not a great one.What could have been.6.25/6.75 – 10",6,0,2,18 August 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Meanderers of the Galaxy
","Missing a lot of the fun that the first Guardians had. Felt the story meandered and plodded along for the most part.Had a few moments, but felt more like it was filmed as an omnibus TV episode than a fully realised block-buster.The underlying father motif gave the film a little more weight in the feels department(there was a woman further down my row who was balling her eyes out, a complete blubbering mess), but it all seemed a little uneven in the way it played out and the way the story was handled.Not terrible, but not great either. A bit meh. A mixed bag for me.6 – 6.5 trash pandas.",6,19,40,26 April 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Solid, entertaining flick of ground hog day, apocalyptic, sci-fi proportions
","Just caught a late screening in 3D. I'm a sucker for sci-fi/time travel flicks when done well.Film looks great on the big screen. Not a massive 3D fan, but it's done reasonably well throughout the film, with some good effects as well as adding reasonable depth to various scenes. Seeing it in 2D isn't a deal breaker though.Well acted, it's hard not to get sucked into the story. I'll say it, Cruise is great in this(I'm far from his biggest fan!), so too Blunt(who looks great) & the rest of the cast. Will reiterate what others have said & that it seemed a little short. More character development wouldn't have gone astray. A very satisfying film, with some good laughs and plenty of action. Good to great performances and reasonably well paced, it's a film I'd happily see again.EoT gets a solid 8.",8,1,3,4 June 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Film making on Meth or jebus what did I just watch???
",Film making on Meth or jebus what did I just watch???Seriously...what did I just watch?An action packed car chase musical?It's as if George Miller had channeled Baz Lurhmann in the throes of a post-apocalyptic Meth bender searching for a come down whilst watching The Blues Brothers.Tweaked...and then some.Seriously insane film. Was there a plot?Probably go see it again as we walked in a little late. Think I must have lost something by missing that first 2 minutes of the film.,7,3,10,14 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Is Ridley trying to out Lucas himself in killing off his own franchise?
","Is Ridley trying to out Lucas himself in killing off his own franchise?A great looking film ruined once again by a sub-par plot, characters and story. There were audible groans and unintentional laughter from the audience throughout the film.It was just a disappointing movie experience, especially as you could see potentially interesting plots and sub-plots, only for the film to descend into predictable farce.I question my own motives as to why I keep on repeating this exercise and going to films of this nature.",6,10,25,11 May 2017
