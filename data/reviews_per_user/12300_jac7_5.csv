","I took my soon to be ten year old son, on his request, to go see this movie. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. For an animated movie I found it funny, and entertaining. I would recommend it to all.",9,0,0,2 December 1998

","I didn't see this movie for the first time until '95 on tv. I was thoroughly impressed with it. I had to see it on video. I don't know how accurate the movie was to reality, but I thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I made my eight year old son sit down with me to watch it. A fine example of bravery in many, many ways. The trials they went thru from beginning to end were fantastic. A great historical movie. I applaud Hollywood for making such a film!",10,0,0,7 June 1999
Remember the Titans," I will never forget the Titans...
","What a great movie, hooray for Hollywood for making such a film. This is what watching family movies is all about. The only disappointment in this movie, was the Academy Awards passing on this one. I have a son that plays HS football, he has mentioned this film as a film that has influenced his teammates in a positive way, and I believe it, because it is a great film.",9,0,1,13 January 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Hmmmmm........
","I can't say a good word about this movie. I kept waiting for something in this movie that never came. What a disappointment for me. I hold a lot of value on marriages, call me old fashioned. But, this movie seemed to throw it all away.......",1,3,6,26 July 1999
The Matrix," Wow
","Action, sci-fi., suspense, they even throw in some love. I think This movie has it all. Though, not in much length, in some of the above, but a good movie.",8,0,0,6 April 1999
