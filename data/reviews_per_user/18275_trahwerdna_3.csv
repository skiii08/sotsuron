Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane: Review
",Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and one of my favorite films. Orson Welles' use of the camera is what stands out the most in this film. Every set and background was filmed with a sort of mathematical precision. Another great aspect of the film was the story. The story reveals so much about the life of Kane yet leaves the audience baffled about his true feelings about his life. This leaves the audience to discuss with each other and for the people to use their own imagination. This film also explores the the theme that money does not but happiness. Throughout his whole life Kane had unlimited power and resources and became consumed by them. If we can't share our successes with other people then what's the point?,9,0,1,10 May 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Grapes of Wrath: Review
","This film was a great adaptation of a great American novel. It presents a historical overview of life following the Great Depression through the eyes of the common American family. American's from the midwest were struggling for survival against elitist's performing inhumane acts of taking away land from them. These robber barons stole from the poor only to feed their own quest for power. One of the things you get from this film is a depiction of human spirit backed by the power of love, family, and togetherness. After countless failures, the Joad's move on with noble determination to create a new life where they are not slaves to the giant industrial machine.",9,0,1,10 May 2010
