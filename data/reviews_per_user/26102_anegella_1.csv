Conquest 1453," Very bad... :(
","First I saw the title I was excited since I have not see any movie about fall of Constantinople and I thought it would be interesting to to see it from other side (from Turkish perspective), but I was very disappointed.The story-line was built so badly and so boring. Things too fast and you could not get positive or negative feelings to characters. I'm not going in to historical context cause it will take us too fare, but I must say that it was fare from historical facts. But that's usual for movies, right? I felt smell of propaganda. Byzantines were so evil, standing on the Turks way and Turks choir Boys Choir on Sunday Mass... At battle scenes only Byzantines were dying and only Byzantines could kill were innocent, unarmed farmers. Acting was terrible. Even I could understand the original language acting was so bad. It was some kind of Turkish Soap Opera level. Costumes and props simply bad. CGI was awful, reminded me 90's. It's understandable that Turkey doesn't have experience on visual FX and it would be OK if the rest was good, but no...",1,1,4,3 August 2016
