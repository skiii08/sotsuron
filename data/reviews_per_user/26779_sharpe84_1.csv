The Longest Yard," expected it to be alright, but shocked at how much fun it was
","just saw a free pre-showing free is good because Hollywood owes me for that kingdom of heaven tripe but i digress... this movie was a blast i laughed way more than i expected to it had a good build up and was a fun feel good underdog movie!!! this is not the first movie this is a different movie same plot Sandlers movie doesn't have the drama and grit of the first but it does display some nice pathos in a handful of scenes. Anyways if you are going to do a remake or re-imagining this is the way to do it Sandler makes it his own the way Willie Nelson did with you were always on my mind. would the complainers rather watch the shot for shot remake of psycho or the brilliant Ridley Scott's heavy borrowing from lord of the rings in kingdom of heaven? so if you want to see the first movie buy the new DVD i'm gonna if you want to laugh, have a good time and see Adam Sandler see the new movie i loved it!!!",8,14,30,11 May 2005
