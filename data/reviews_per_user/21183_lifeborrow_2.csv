Marie Antoinette," Not a historical documentary!!!
","This is an entertaining and pleasure-for-eyes movie. Great picture to make one interested in history, but not a historical one; and, i think, just what this kind of art supposed to be. Yes, Kirsten Dunst doesn't fit the role: her face, smile, eyes, eyebrows (untreated, by the way), teeth, cheeks, chin etc... But the moment she first uttered something rational: 'This is ridiculous!', i personally realized: this is a real contemporary performance! In that flow she acts precisely! In the combination with appropriate action, music, visuals, cinematography... By the middle of the movie i had a feeling, that it's a pure gem no worse then 'Lost in Translation'. Alas, the ending... A symbolically trivial ending, much disappointing! A very important for the 'ego' of movie's director to logically complete the historical events, but stylistically inappropriate, really.",9,0,2,30 December 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," i WISH i could mark it 10 stars
","Something prevented me to give this marvelous animation movie 10 stars. I think it is that peculiar (and weak) ending. Weak comparing to the promising beginning of the 'Monsters vs Aliens'. This is what most of DreamWorks animation movies lack. An exact and EverEnding ending. It's just about to remind the great 'NeverEnding Story', each part of which actually was given a great ending! Maybe, it's some kind of marketing move: say, if you, audience, approve the movie, we, DreamWorks, could shot further. No, precious 'producers folks', it doesn't work that way. Please, make it a complete movie! An amusing performance for children and adults with a proper and kind ending. A thoughtful-joyful-at-a-time ending! Else is just marvelous: action, comedy, animation, characters, scenes, editing, 3D (modeling, lighting, texturing etc.).",9,0,1,18 December 2009
