Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It's strength is also its weakness
","Jak sie masz! My name a 81Sorp! Well, not really, but let's not sweat the details.Borat, a reporter from 'Kazakhstan' travels to the U.S and A to learn about the great country in the west and hopefully learn how to deal with his own country's problems who he himself says are: 'social, economical and jew'. In the U.S and A he sees a TV show called 'Baywatch', falls in love with the voluptuous Pamela Anderson Lee and descides to travel all over the U.S and A to meet her and her very appealing bosom. On the road to his dream girl many cultural misunderstandings ensues.This 'Documentary' has some funny moments and some half funny moments that are OK. If you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier work it's the same old stuff he has done before: interview people who don't know it's a joke and get confused and/or angered. It's built on a lot of improvisation from Cohen's part which has its good and bad sides. The good is that it's spontaneous reaction from his interview victims and the funny misunderstandings from these people who think it's for real. The bad is that more than a few improv-jokes become very lowbrow and potty-oriented. Many times it relies on shock, testing the boundaries and obscenity to create laughs, like nudity and aforementioned potty humor. Maybe it's just me but I grew up with and expected a slightly more clever British humor than this. However, all in all it's not all bad. Half the humor comes from his interview victims who fit the picture of the conservative American, out of touch with the rest of the world. THIS was was more of the cleverness that I had expected and wish there had been more of. Cohen could have toned down Borats acted craziness and given more room to these peoples real craziness.That's all from me. Now if you excuse me, I have to go and milk my goats.Dziekuje!",5,0,2,27 November 2007
Spider-Man 3," A step down, but not that bad
","In the third installment of the Spider-Man franchise our favorite web swinger has to tackle his old friend Harry Osborn turned super villain, Flint Marko, a thug turned into a sandy super villain and Eddie Brock, a photographer with low morale who later turns into something worse. And let's not forget fighting inner demons caused by a living costume/goo from outer space.Sure, it could be better, but it could also be worse. The problem as I see it, is too many story lines. Besides the ones already mentioned there's the MJ story and the Gwen Stacy story. While some of the subplots were given time to grow, others weren't. It felt like they were thrown into a space too small for them to grow in the pace they needed. Guess Raimi got a little too eager in the big candy shop that is the Spider-Man-universe, and I can't blame him. On the plus side: the action scenes are very good and Thomas Hayden Church's portrayal of an ordinary man with bad luck, turned thug, turned super villain is good, memorable and makes you feels sympathy for the poor guy. Agreed, it's not as good as Spider-Man 2, but not bad either. It's good enough to watch more than a couple of times.",5,2,4,9 May 2007
Nacho Libre," An OK wrestling flick with Jack Black
","Jack Black plays a monk in Mexiko with dreams of making it big in the world of Mexican masked wrestling.Now, Jack Black as a Mexican didn't bother me that much. It was even explained at one point in the movie. (his mother was a Scandinavian missionary) So it's not like they pretend that he doesn't have the ethnicity.The story is a wee bit thin though, the writers probably decided to lean on the impulses of Black. Don't get me wrong, the first half of the movie has several good moments but after that the story get thin and sometimes predictable, a little more work on the story would have been in order. The writers probably wanted to avoid any form of already used 'Rocky-like' movie formula, but maybe a little bit of formula would have helped. Having things constantly going against them may be funny for a while but it leaves you wondering how they are ever gonna reach their goal. A little transformation of the character would have been nice.Jack Black delivers the usual Jack Black stuff, including some scenes with his trademark singing. Héctor Jiménez, not as much as acts as just has fun with his role, does a good job playing the homeless Esqueleto. Don't expect the comedy of the year, if all you are looking for is a Jack Black movie, look no further.",5,0,0,24 June 2007
Avatar," Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue
","Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic, former marine becomes a last minute replacement for his dead twin brother on a mission to the inhabited faraway moon known as Pandora. His mission is to, through a remote controlled, genetically grown body known as an 'Avatar', explore this new world and find a MacGuffin called 'unobtainium', a rare and valuable material in the future, kind of like gold or oil in todays world. Of course after having been wheelchair bound for several years he really loves waking up in a new body with legs that work and allows him to run for the first time in years. However, all is not sunshine and lollipops on Pandora as we and Jake soon find out. The reason one would need an Avatar-body is because the air on Pandora is not friendly to earth lungs. Neither is most of the plant life, animal life or the ten foot tall, blue skinned, feline natives called Na'vi. One of the characters describe the place as being worse than hell. On his first mission, Jake gets separated from the group, gets lost and gets rescued by a female Na'vi called Neytiri(Zoe Saldana). She brings him to her tribe where he learns about the Na'vi, their customs, culture and their relationship to nature.Now. Why do I in the title to my review compare this movie to a wedding dress? Maybe I want my review to stick out a little bit, because there is not much I can say about it that hasn't already been said. Kinda like the movie itself. The thing that is old and borrowed is the story. It's 'Pocahontas, Ferngully and the last samurai- In Space!' with impressive CGI. The old 'person comes to a new world, meets native from new world, is introduced to it's culture, falls in love with world and native and wants to stop his own world from taking over and exploiting new world'-thing. What's new is the the way that it's told. This is one of the few times where earth is invading a new planet instead of being invaded. The concept of an avatar: moving your mind to a body meant to be remote controlled is interesting and quite new (sure, 'Surrogates'(2009) came out before this, but to my knowledge James Cameron came up with the idea before 'Surrogates' was written). The blue thing: The Na'vis of course! (Heheh!)The main appeal about this movie is the CGI and the 3D, since, like I said earlier, the story is something we've seen before. While that is not directly a bad thing, originality is always appreciated. At first I wasn't gonna watch this in 3D but I thought that since I've never done anything like this before I'll try it just this once... it was pretty cool. A movie shouldn't have to rely on cool technology though. This movie is basically about showing the latest in movie technology. The story is till good, just a little unoriginal. The CGI-motion-capture is not that new (I'm looking at you Robert Zemeckis!) but it is done very well. The movements and facial expressions of the Na'vis really made them seem alive, like Gollum in 'Lord of the rings'.I'm writing this a few days after I saw the movie, so hindsight has affected my view of it slightly. So how did I feel when watching this shameless display of the latest achievements in cinematic entertainment technology? Did I like this movie? Was I entertained? Would I recommend it to others? Yes, yes and yes. Do you have to watch it in 3D? No. Sure, it's cool but not necessary.I see you... reading this review!",6,0,4,5 January 2010
