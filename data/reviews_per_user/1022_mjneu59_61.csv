The Double Life of Véronique," like watching a film where every third scene is missing
","The story of two identical women, born on opposite ends of Europe and connected only by a tenuous spiritual link neither one is fully aware of, asks the question: are we really alone in the world? Bur director Krzysztof Kieslowski doesn't provide much else besides an affirmative answer, and the concept itself is limited because the two Veroniques are never allowed to meet (if they did the whole thing would be just another Twilight Zone episode, with subtitles). It's certainly a beautiful movie, with quite a few magical moments balanced against an unforgivably vague narrative concerned mostly with the French Veronique's pursuit of an enigmatic puppeteer. Along the way are some intriguing, teasing suggestions of several more-then-coincidental similarities between the two women, but the effect is not unlike watching a film where every third scene is missing, and because the burden of meaning is placed entirely on the viewer it will likely infuriate anyone expecting a more coherent story.",4,10,16,14 November 2010
Come and See," devastating depiction of wartime atrocities
","The title of this extraordinary film is borrowed, appropriately, from the biblical Book of Revelations, and the apocalyptic vision it presents of a Russian village destroyed under the advancing juggernaut of Hitler's 1941 blitzkrieg certainly ranks among the most horrific depictions of wartime madness ever recreated on celluloid. The story follows a young Russian boy separated from his partisan brigade, and tracks his slow descent into insanity as he witnesses one atrocity after another, until Nazi soldiers finally herd him (and, by extension, us) into a crowded peasant church and set it ablaze with flamethrowers. After several long, ominous establishing scenes the pace builds with feverish intensity to the climactic moments of annihilation, a tour de force of camera-work and editing apt to leave a permanent scar on the viewer's nerves. Faint-hearted patrons are advised to stay away: this face-to-face confrontation with the stark brutality of modern warfare is gut-wrenching stuff indeed.",9,1,1,12 November 2010
Ghost," textbook crowd-pleaser, for better or worse
","Young Wall Street whiz kid Patrick Swayze is murdered but his spirit lingers on, earthbound until it can find the man who killed him and who still threatens bereaved girlfriend Demi Moore. You would think a dead man could afford to be fatalistic about such things, but Swayze wants revenge, and after a slow start (to both the film and his vendetta) he gets it, with reluctant help from a bogus medium (Whoopi Goldberg) able to hear his disembodied voice. The clever (and often eerie) effects help salvage the story from some predictable clichés and tired comic relief, and by the time Swayze joins that big Industrial Light and Magic show in the sky the film has carved itself a sizable chunk of territory once claimed exclusively by Steven Spielberg, who no doubt is kicking himself for making the similar but saccharine 'Always' instead. With a pair of more than simply photogenic stars the movie might have been a bubblegum classic; as it is, 'Ghost' succeeds in putting a warm afterglow around the afterlife.",6,0,1,22 November 2010
Spartacus," more Kirk Douglas than Stanley Kubrick
","Never mind the supposed parallels between the slave rebellion led by Kirk Douglas against the Roman Empire and the embryonic civil rights movement; the real virtue of this pre-biblical epic today is the nostalgia it holds for the Golden Age of wide-screen entertainment. The film looks fabulous but, rose-colored memories aside, it never was much of a classic. Instead of following the gloriously trashy example set by Cecil B. DeMille, it tries (too hard) to give the sand-and-sandal genre a token measure of highbrow prestige, not an easy task with a cast dressed in togas. But the script is far too dull (to say the least) and except for some lively battle scenes the film moves at a snail's pace. Thank goodness for Peter Ustinov, who alone among the cast of thousands seemed to have enough wisdom not to take it all too seriously. When it was re-released in 1991 the film included a previously cut scene of patrician/pederast Laurence Olivier bathing with body servant Tony Curtis, and also restored the original pre-credit orchestral overture, which added nothing to the film except length, the one feature it already has plenty of.",7,1,3,4 January 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," for better or worse, it changed the game
","From the moment the cartoon characters first walk off their animated 'set' into the real world it's clear that more than just a humorous visual breakthrough is being made: there have been blends of live action and animation before, but nothing like Roger Rabbit.It's strictly a novelty film, of course: a showcase for its own technical wizardry. But the eye-popping interaction between humans and toons has something for everybody: enough ingenuity to entertain adults, and plenty of color and noise to distract even those children unable to follow the serpentine, gum-shoe plot (a comic strip echo, believe or not, of Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'). Hardboiled private eye Bob Hoskins has a tough time answering the title question because the toons obey their own peculiar physical laws, setting up a topsy-turvy conflict between reality and fantasy. Thankfully, the live actors play it straight, all except Christopher Lloyd as the obvious villain, revealed in the end to be (not surprisingly) a toon in disguise.When first released in June of 1988 (I saw it at a press screening, even earlier) the film was a timely reminder of what summer movies are supposed to be all about, offering brisk, clever pop entertainment, with a homeopathic (but worthwhile) moral: a laugh is better than a frown.",8,1,1,14 January 2011
Chinatown," a classic that improves with every viewing
","Roman Polanski's wide screen, Depression era detective story is more than just another anachronistic homage to the film noir gumshoes and femme fatales of yesteryear. The serpentine labyrinth of corruption uncovered by tough but intelligent private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) involves nothing less than the consolidation of greater Los Angeles itself, where the most tainted currency of thieves isn't money, but water. This is one of those rare productions where every element seems to fall into place, from Robert Towne's exciting, original screenplay to a definitive performance by Nicholson to John Huston's unlikely but effective portrayal of what must be one of the most depraved villains in screen memory, a man who, by his own chilling admission, 'is capable of anything.' Music, art direction, editing and photography are all first class, but the true test of any classic is longevity, and in this regard the film passes with flying colors by actually improving with each viewing.",10,3,5,10 November 2010
Unbreakable," the moody style effectively camouflages some pretty thin material
","The director and star of the supernatural blockbuster 'The Sixth Sense' reunite to see if box office lightning will strike twice: hardly likely, given the astronomical numbers posted by the earlier film. This time around Bruce Willis is again the odd man out, the only survivor of a fatal train crash who begins to suspect he owes his life to something more than mere serendipity. Is he an accidental plaything of fate, or (believe it or not) an unsuspecting comic book superhero down on his luck? A little more ambiguity might have added some necessary tension to the far-fetched scenario, but from the first frame the issue is hardly in doubt, and as a result the obligatory surprise ending (around which the entire film revolves) is unfairly deflated, trading the compelling supernatural hook of its predecessor for an intriguing but esoteric Twilight Zone plot twist demanding a more laborious suspension of disbelief.Writer director M. Night Shyamalan maintains the same somber, self-conscious style that so effectively marked his earlier film, with long meaningful pauses separating every portentous line of dialogue, and a deliberate editing scheme favoring suspense over easy shock tactics. It's refreshing to find a moviemaker not enslaved to Hollywood's current hyper-kinetic visual fads, but it's also safe to say the pacing flags at more than one point: Rod Serling could have told the same story just as well in less than 30 minutes. An economic, two-character cast (Willis, plus Samuel Jackson as his crackpot guide to reluctant enlightenment) makes the whole thing look not unlike a student screen writing exercise, pulled out of Shyamalan's old college trunk and hastily dusted off to help keep his suddenly hot career from losing any momentum.",6,0,0,12 January 2011
Fight Club," a dark comic male fantasia for the new millennium
","As we approached that totally arbitrary year 2000 it seemed Hollywood movies were becoming darker and more pessimistic, or at least (to be more accurate) were being marketed to give that impression. A perfect case in point was this violent, cynical fantasy about disenfranchised men getting even with an unsympathetic world by bonding together to beat the living pulp out of each other.It's called 'Fight Club', and Brad Pitt is the charismatic psychopath who kicks it (sometimes literally) into gear, enlisting insomniac everyman Ed Norton into a netherworld of black eyes and broken noses. Pitt only wants his otherwise mild-mannered new protégé to embrace his own dormant masculinity at its lowest and most honest level, and in a sense the eponymous club is presented like the ultimate touchy-feely support group, offering members the epiphany of uncomplicated pain as an antidote to the numbing monotony of modern life.But what begins as a strictly masochistic form of macho catharsis soon devolves into an underground skinhead cult promoting worldwide anarchy and destruction. And if, after reading that, you suspect this is where the plot gets derailed, give yourself a pat on the back and a blue ribbon for eagle-eyed film analysis.'Fight Club' is a disturbing movie, not least because it can, at times, be a lot of fun to watch, in an admittedly twisted sort of way. Viewers are invited to chuckle in sympathy at thoughtless acts of petty rebellion such as waiters urinating in the soup at pretentious uptown restaurants, or (my favorite) the 'homework' assignment asking club members to pick a fight at random with a total stranger, and lose – not an easy task, as it turns out. And let's face it: who among us hasn't entertained daydreams of demolishing a tacky piece of corporate public art or destroying a generic coffee franchise (or, better yet, accomplishing both at the same time)? Boys will be boys, but a lot of that guilty juvenile pleasure gets pushed aside when the anti-establishment vandalism turns to wholesale sabotage and terrorism. It's too bad, because elsewhere the film presents a canny dissection of the American male psyche: not an altogether pleasant topic, but certainly ripe for exactly this shade of black comic satire. Few other movies have dared to approach the same subject with such unblinking candor (the closest recent equivalent was probably Neil LaBute's 1997 feature 'In the Company of Men', a minor classic of y-chromosome misanthropy), and none with this degree of microscopic scrutiny.It even begins, pointedly, at a subatomic level, tracing the feverish sparking of nerve impulses across poor Ed Norton's sleep deprived synapses. From there the focus expands upwards and outwards, targeting all the usual suspects of our late 20th century social stalemate: the credit card economy, the empty consumer culture, the slow brain-death of a television habit (of course), the empty paycheck at the end of another dull day's meaningless labor. 'This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time', says the desensitized Norton, a white collar wage slave unable to find any emotional release outside of other people's support networks: terminal cancer patients, adult survivors of childhood incest, alcoholics anonymous, and so forth.Until the fateful moment when he first crosses the path of kindred spirit/alter ego Tyler Durden, one of the more compelling anti-heroes (for better or worse) in recent screen memory, brought vividly to life in a typically extroverted performance by Brad Pitt. Durden is Norton's dark companion: a post-modern messiah preaching a gospel of enlightened self-destruction. 'Forget redemption', he tells his disciples (although he doesn't actually use the word forget), 'we are God's unwanted children.' That's a lot of philosophy to swallow in one sitting, but over most of its (considerable) length the film successfully negotiates a precarious narrative tightrope between brilliance and pretension. Unfortunately the chosen method of discourse in the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls is non-stop voice-over narration, the laziest tool in the arsenal any hack (and a pet peeve, to be sure). Movies work best when used as a model of visual, not verbal, expression, showing (or better yet, merely suggesting) the meaning of things, instead of artlessly spelling out the intended lesson in exactly so many words.To be fair, director David Fincher does his best to open up the format and have some fun with it, for example asking Norton to address the camera directly (spoiling Pitt's aim while he's peeing in the lobster bisque), and employing a typically hyperactive visual scheme stocked with every up-to-the-minute gimmick imaginable, all set to an effective electro-shock soundtrack by a team calling themselves The Dust Brothers. The sets are likewise dressed to the acme of stylish decay (an apparent specialty of Fincher), and attentive viewers will even catch some ultra-cool subliminal foreshadowing: strategic single frame inserts of Tyler Durden popping up at random, anticipating his first appearance by several scenes.But after setting up such a novel premise the script quickly runs out of first-person prose, having exhausted itself on hackneyed pearls of Occidental wisdom such as: 'the things you own end up owning you', perfectly true, but hardly the most original observation. With nowhere else to go and nothing left to say, the story collapses quickly to a desperately over-plotted climax, losing the thread of its already subversive sexual aggression sub-text to foreground the 'Project Mayhem' conspiracy agenda, and finally introducing a ludicrous doppelganger dénouement too far-fetched for even an old Twilight Zone episode.Bottom line: it's a provocative movie at odds with its own ambition, leaning hard on a necessary crutch on black (bordering on tasteless) humor. Ignoring all the stylistic window dressing, the film is also more cynical, and in many ways more original, than anything since the pre-Lucas/Spielberg '70s: think of William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer', written for laughs. That, by itself, is enough reason to recommend it, but is this where one hundred years of screen art have brought us?",8,4,9,17 November 2010
Citizen Kane," still the Great American Movie
","If Orson Welles' debut feature isn't the best American film ever made it certainly remains one of the most impressive, combining narrative and technical dexterity in a stunning display of talent unmatched before or since. Every scene is a minor masterpiece of style and invention, and the elliptical story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, who squandered a wealth he never earned on a woman he couldn't love, is as much a catalogue of camera techniques as it is a compelling drama. It's hard to believe the film flopped at the Box Office when first released in 1941, but perhaps it was simply too sophisticated for widespread audience appeal. Today of course it remains a model of creative entertainment, and a sad reminder of Hollywood's disdain for rogue talent. Welles never equaled the achievement, but even if the film itself could never be repeated the joy of watching it certainly can, and after half a century the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane is as fresh and compelling as ever. In all likelihood the only viewer left unimpressed by the film was its inspiration, William Randolph Hearst, but what angered him more: Welles' reckless re-creation of San Simeon (Kane's Xanadu), or the true identity of 'Rosebud'?",10,0,1,10 November 2010
Mississippi Burning," tabloid movie-making at its worst
","Alan Parker's volatile attack on good ol' fashioned Southern racism is meant to be a controversial film, and it is, but for all the wrong reasons. The idea (one hopes) was to make a powerful, topical docudrama, but the result is an ugly, artificial, irresponsible exploitation of an actual civil rights crisis, condescending to blacks (condemning their treatment at their expense) and elevated out of all proportion by a false sense of prestige. This is true tabloid cinema, not far removed from one of Chuck Bronson's 'Death Wish' scenarios, with enough burnings, beatings and lynchings to satisfy even the most unrepentant redneck, and with the gall to suggest that the most effective answer to bigotry is to adopt attitudes and methods even more violent than those of the Klan. A first-rate cast is totally wasted by Chris Gerolmo's one-dimensional screenplay (and not for the first time: see 'Miles From Home'). If a film insists on asking questions like, 'where does it come from, all this hatred?' the least it can do is attempt to provide a legitimate answer.",1,9,26,8 December 2010
Au Revoir les Enfants," a haunting a personal recollection
","It took Louis Malle over forty years to write and direct this autobiographic coming-of-age story, in which he recalls an extraordinary moment from his childhood in Nazi occupied France when he betrayed, with an involuntary glance, a Jewish classmate attending his Catholic boarding school under an assumed name. The setting is a cloistered adolescent world of petty cruelties, minor triumphs, and a few not-so-childish secrets, with hardly a false note throughout. Even after four decades the details are crystal clear, showing none of the distortions or exaggerations of memory; every virtue of the film is so well balanced that each one is virtually invisible. The story is disarmingly simple and straightforward, and yet in its own restrained, undemonstrative way the final impact is heartbreaking. There is no gunfire, no bloodshed, no violence, but Malle reminds us that sometimes, on an all too personal level, the consequences of warfare are no less lethal for being so quiet.",9,1,2,5 November 2010
Rocky V," down for the count
","When it comes to boxing films, there's 'Raging Bull' and then there's just plain bull. The fifth chapter in the interminable saga of America's favorite pugilist presents a kinder, gentler Rocky Balboa, down but hardly out after his flag-waving triumph against the Soviets in 'Rocky IV'. The new film was meant to be a return to roots, for both Stallone and his alter ago, but humility was never Rocky's strongest virtue, and his fall from grace barely registers as an inconvenience (notice how Rocky himself is innocent in his own downfall, and how the adulation of his fans doesn't waver, before or afterward). Even the suggested brain damage (is this something new?) never quite becomes an issue; it certainly doesn't stop him from beating the crap out of his rogue protégé in the climactic fist fight, actually more a street brawl than a boxing contest. Elsewhere Stallone's screenplay favors domestic soap opera over fisticuffs, with some predictably sloppy father/son bonding trauma lending it all the conviction of a Hallmark greeting card. It may be hard to believe, but the film is even more cheap and sloppy than its predecessors, if such a thing is even possible.",2,1,6,30 December 2010
12 Angry Men," no argument here: it's still a classic
","An all-star jury deliberates what seems to be a clear-cut murder charge, but each guilty verdict is swayed, one by one, by the reasonable doubt of good Samaritan Henry Fonda. The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.",9,0,0,11 January 2011
Dead Poets Society," a trite scenario salvaged by its director
","Peter Weir took time off from an otherwise noteworthy career to direct this crowd-pleasing melodrama about yet another maverick schoolteacher with unorthodox methods, who in this instance bucks the traditions of his stuffy New England prep school by quoting Walt Whitman and inspiring his students to 'seize the day'. It's ironic that a script defending freethinking nonconformity should be so predictable, but under Weir's typically intelligent direction the film is (likewise predictably) never less than enjoyable. He pulls all the right strings in the right order, patching the familiar story together with a surplus of lush pictorial glue. Robin Williams downplays his trademark mugging style to actually offer a credible performance, despite being miscast (or at least misrepresented) in the pivotal lead role. Despite a few gratuitous moments of token stand-up comedy shtick (John Wayne and Marlon Brando impersonations, and so forth) it isn't, after all, meant to be a comedy.",7,0,0,13 November 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Well, boys, I reckon this is it: nucular combat, toe to toe with the Roosskies!'
","Stanley Kubrick's end-of-the-world comedy was merely topical back in 1963; today the film is essential viewing. No other Cold War feature (and certainly no straight-faced drama) so accurately depicted the lethal absurdity of the arm's race, and the chilling consequences of one rational madman pushing the wrong buttons. The stark overhead lighting and low-level camera angles aptly illustrated the combined myopia of the military, scientific, and political communities, with all three represented by the versatile Peter Sellers in a characteristic triple performance. The supporting roles are no less memorable: George C. Scott as Air Force hawk Buck Turgidson; Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper (who initiates the apocalypse to 'protect and preserve our precious bodily fluids'); Slim Pickens as B-52 pilot Major Kong (riding the Bomb like a bucking bronco to oblivion). The giveaway names only underline the broad simplicity of the satire, but oddly enough the sometimes childish (black) humor makes an already frightening scenario all the more plausible.",10,1,2,14 November 2010
The Doors," just another Oliver Stone fever dream
","In an early scene of Oliver Stone's typically overwrought tribute to one of the 6o's more typically overwrought bands, young rock messiah Jim Morrison makes an uninvited visit (over the balcony) to the Venice Beach pad of his girlfriend Pamela Courson, who says, 'don't you believe in doors?' Morrison's reply, 'they're a waste of time', not only provides the one moment of (unintended) wit in the entire film, but sounds an ominous warning to what follows: another jarring one-note melodrama from a director clearly too preoccupied with his own bogus sense of cinematic 'style'. Stone's ballistic visual scheme and grade school symbolism are perfectly matched (in his own mind, at least) to the feverish 60's counter-culture of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but even at such a strenuous length (135 minutes) the film only scratches at the surface of its subject: concert follows scandalous concert, with no variation in tone or texture, until the Lizard King finally overdoses and dies. Val Kilmer does a credible rendering of Morrison's languid sex-and-death mannerisms, but the ill-judged caricatures of Ed Sullivan and Andy Warhol are foolish, as is the non-existent bust added to the martyr's graffiti-covered Paris tomb: it resembles Kilmer more than Kilmer resembles Morrison.",2,5,9,14 November 2010
Full Metal Jacket," born again hard
","(Note: the following was written when the film was first released in 1987...) Can anything new be added to the current cycle of Vietnam War films? Stanley Kubrick seems to think so, and he goes about his business after a seven-year absence as if his were the first film to be made on the subject (which it might have been, back when he began it). What's surprising is how well such a fussy and deliberate filmmaker like Kubrick captures the madness of war (much as he did in his earlier Paths of Glory). But the best part of this lopsided scenario (co-written with Michael Herr and author Gustav Hasford) has nothing to do with the conflict in Vietnam, focusing exclusively on the rigors of Marine Corps training and indoctrination (i.e. brainwashing). These early scenes are classic Kubrick, and would have made a near perfect short film if released independently. The subsequent battle scenes (famously, if not always convincingly, recreating Southeast Asia in rural England) are, by comparison, only anticlimactic padding, showing what happens when the hot-blooded fury of combat gives way to the cold-blooded reality of death, represented here by a single, harrowing incident where a squad of soldiers is pinned down by an invisible sniper during the urban fighting of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Never mind that Francis Coppola covered similar ground in one brief scene of 'Apocalypse Now'; for Kubrick, it's a welcome return to form, up to a point: a compact, mini-masterpiece awkwardly matched to a rambling, episodic war story.(postscript: twenty-plus years and countless viewings later 'Full Metal Jacket', like any genuine classic, makes a lot more sense...not as an unbalanced film-in-two-mismatched-parts, but as a construct following the elliptical arc of a boomerang. I've said it many times but it needs repeating: if you've seen a Stanley Kubrick film only once, you haven't really seen it at all...)",8,0,0,21 November 2010
Empire of the Sun," Steven Spielberg grows up
","From the first glimpse of open caskets floating down the Yangtze River to the final image of the young hero's childhood baggage drifting away on the tide, it's clear Steven Spielberg is trying to challenge both himself and his audience, with a daring (for this director) adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel. For the most part he succeeds admirably, harnessing his state-of-the-art talents to an allegorical wartime fantasy (written from firsthand experience) about a young British boy in Shanghai, separated from his parents after the Japanese invasion and thrust into the alleys and gutters of an alien world, ending the war in a civilian internment camp. But this is no typical coming-of-age drama; in wartime the end of innocence often brings madness, not maturity, and Spielberg doesn't compromise the material with the expected blockbuster flourishes (as he did in 'The Color Purple'). Despite the director's distracting emphasis on flashy visual exposition, his film nevertheless makes demands on its audience that they may not be prepared to meet: fans of 'Indiana Jones' and 'ET' really can't be expected to shoulder the burden of so much arcane symbolism and haunting, dreamlike imagery. If for nothing else Spielberg deserves credit for taking a risk on such an uncommercial property.",8,3,7,15 November 2010
Glory," misguided historical drama
","The true story of an all-black Union regiment in the Civil War (all but the officers, of course) would like to be a socially aware anti-war epic, but unfortunately there isn't anything in the film to suggest the title might be ironic. Instead, it offers all the usual patriotic myths of noble self-sacrifice, while choosing to ignore the sad fact that the only way an ex-slave could earn a white man's respect was to die fighting his wars for him. Even worse, the impression is left of the regiment being little more than a surrogate plantation, with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) literally whipping a rabble of black men into fighting shape. Denzel Washington earned a well-deserved Oscar as the only soldier able to face the truth ('no one will win'); by comparison Broderick, while in fact the same age as his character, resembles a high school drama student, chomping down on a mean cigar in a vain attempt to look less immature. Typical of the film's self-congratulatory liberal (white) attitude is the climatic charge into battle, where Broderick is allowed a heroic slow-motion death while his black troops (in the ultimate bid for equality) are simply used as expendable cannon fodder.",4,4,21,22 November 2010
The Godfather: Part II," more complex and even richer than the original
","It's rare for a sequel to match its predecessor, but the follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's monumental mob family drama does more than simply continue the same story, expanding on themes only suggested in Part One to present an ambitious overview of organized crime in 20th century America. The Corleone family tree is divided here into parallel histories, with young Vito (Robert De Niro) arriving in the New World to begin a family, and a family empire, which a generation later his bitter and lonely son Michael (Al Pacino) would consolidate, destroying in the process everything he holds dear. The sudden displays of gangland violence are no longer placed in ironic juxtaposition to the unlikely richness of Corleone family values, being used instead to measure the corruption of il padrone's immigrant idealism: murder to young Vito is strictly a matter of honor, but to Michael it's only an extension of his absolute power. The crosscutting between two stories sacrifices a consistent narrative flow in favor of complexity and depth, but it's a fair trade, and seen together with Part One (Part Two should not be seen without the introduction provided by the earlier film) is a rich experience not soon forgotten.",10,5,9,22 November 2010
The Killing Fields," a strong movie, despite the second-half stumble
","Civil wars and political upheaval can often bring out the best elements in a film: suspense, emotion, and the immediacy of current events, in this case turning yesterday's headlines into a grim but gripping human drama. The 1975 collapse of Cambodia and subsequent 're-education' of its population (through brainwashing and genocide) by Khmer Rouge insurgents is reconstructed through an unlikely but true friendship between two journalists from opposite ends of the globe: hard-nosed New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg and his resourceful Cambodian counterpart Dith Pran. From their anxious refuge inside the French Embassy in Phnom Penh to the horrors of a post-revolution work camp, the film builds moments of agonizing intensity, although the latter half splits into separate stories of unequal impact: Schanberg, in New York, agonizes verbally and at length over the unknown fate of his friend, while Pran, in the newly named Kampuchea, endures a torment that surpasses words. The performances in general and the cinematography in particular merit special attention, with the moody colors suggesting the light of a solar eclipse: darkness in broad daylight.",8,1,1,30 November 2010
The Color of Money," stylish but unnecessary sequel
","Paul Newman slips comfortably into the familiar role of Fast Eddie Felson in this belated sequel to the 1961 pool room classic 'The Hustler'. Now older and wiser, Eddie begins grooming an arrogant, immature upstart (Tom Cruise, naturally) for pool hustling stardom, but is unwilling to pass the torch when his pupil's talent begins to eclipse his own. It all ends, of course, in a showdown between mentor and protégé at the championship games in Atlantic City, but the expected climax is missing, and the lack of peripheral characters leaves Newman and Cruise in a high profile vacuum. Martin Scorsese can be excused for attempting to bolster his commercial credentials by agreeing to direct this rather conventional surrogate father/son bonding drama, but at least he injects the film with enough style to make it consistently interesting. A lot of the credit properly belongs to ace cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who does some amazing things with camera and cue ball.",6,0,0,12 November 2010
Judgment at Nuremberg," star-studded drama is certainly ambitious
","The horror of Nazi Germany is put into human perspective through the testimony of several civilians at the tail end of the war crime trials, long after the more spectacular persecution of the military high command. Maximilian Schell won an Oscar for his portrayal of a young German defense attorney, and the rest of the cast is no less impressive, in particular Montgomery Clift in his brief appearance as an unbalanced mental patient, and Judy Garland as a conscience-stricken witness. The film's three-hour length (consisting almost entirely of courtroom dialogue) can be daunting, but the difficult subject is handled with care, rejecting sensationalism in favor of intelligent (if sometimes long-winded) drama.",6,3,4,29 November 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," blockbuster mayhem for FX junkies
","In director James Cameron's blockbusting sequel to his popular 1984 hit the indestructible killer from the 21st century returns to 1990 Los Angeles, this time to protect a future revolutionary leader against an even more deadly assassin, able to change shape at will. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the advantage of superior firepower, but the script wants to present him as a surrogate, cybernetic father figure, softening a role already ideally suited to his limited talents (poor Arnold can't even portray a convincing robot without effort).The liquid metal computer effects are impressive, and the spectacular action sequences are staged with cold, mechanical precision, turning what could have been a thrill-a-minute adventure into the big-screen equivalent of an arcade video game. In the end the film amounts to little more than a marathon of furious destruction, undermined by some pretentious moralizing and by an absurd streak of pacifism: Arnold's terminator is ordered not to kill anyone, so instead he simply (yuk, yuk) maims half the armed forces of the Free World.",5,1,5,7 January 2011
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's zenith
","The granddaddy of all Vietnam War films only improves with each successive viewing; in years to come, long after the others have been all but forgotten, this will be the one still being watched and talked about. Worthless as history (and never intended as such) it nevertheless is a triumph of filmmaking, showing astonishing craftsmanship in every moment of soldier/assassin Martin Sheen's obsessive search for renegade Special Forces Colonel Martin Brando. The plot is episodic (even rambling) as it follows a narrowing river deep into Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but unlike later, more popular treatments of the war it never pauses to stroke the viewer's guilt or wrap the conflict up in any sort of tidy resolution. Despite the obvious care lavished on every frame, the narrative remains even more messy and incoherent than the war itself, with each new sequence becoming more surreal and disturbing until the final, hypnotic confrontation with Brando and his native army in the pit of his own private jungle hell. Audiences continue to respond more to the helicopter attack on the Vietcong village, ironically the only conventional, 'old-fashioned' war movie scene in the entire film (a point driven home by the heroic Wagner fanfare). The last act, by contrast, is usually dismissed as too murky and cerebral, perhaps because it shows all too clearly how the human conscience becomes an irrelevant luxury when faced with the moral depravity needed to effectively exterminate an enemy. That's not exactly a message anyone wants to hear; witness the patriotic justifications for Operations Desert Storm and Just Cause, and the invasions of Panama and Granada, to name but a few of our post-Vietnam overseas adventures. The end result is a climate of horror few other war films have managed to capture.",10,1,2,3 November 2010
The Patriot," kindergarten history
","Samuel Johnson was right when he identified patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, and the proof is in this cartoon call to arms from the makers of 'Independence Day' and the Hollywood remake of 'Godzilla'. The film is a bubblegum whitewash of early American history, with all the misguided crowd-pleasing appeal of an Armed Forces recruitment ad, casting Mel Gibson as a conscientious objector (in screen vernacular always the next worse thing to an outright sissy) who rediscovers the moral rewards of deep commitment during the Revolutionary War, mostly by slaughtering half the Redcoats in New England. Screenwriter Robert Rodat waves the flag more stridently here than in his previous 'Saving Private Ryan', helping Gibson to shed his pacifism by presenting him with an adversary (British colonel Jason Isaacs) so evil and sadistic that even his own troops despise him (and later impaling the villain directly onto the Stars and Stripes, in a particularly grisly bit of low-brow propaganda).The story invites obvious comparisons with Gibson's own Oscar winning 'Braveheart', but despite the quality of the production (and the transparent self-importance of its epic 160+ minute running time) the film is still little more than a prestigious vendetta drama, on the same emotional and intellectual level as any Charles Bronson 'Deathwish' scenario. Ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel provides the fabulous scenery, and then newcomer Heath Ledger valiantly takes up the matinée idol torch passed to him by his on-screen father (and fellow Aussie heartthrob) Gibson.",3,15,29,26 December 2010
Rocky IV," Raging Bullsh*t
","What's the point of criticizing this shoddy, shabby waste of time after it became such a huge box office hit? An outline of its shortcomings would fill several pages, so perhaps a more succinct response would simply be to slap Sylvester Stallone's face for sustaining the notion that success is easily attained by shameless pandering and mindless self-parody. In this episode, writer-director-star Stallone spends ninety minutes (in between blatant product plugs) giving celebrity advice and selfless encouragement to everyone around him, including, in the end, the whole of humanity, wrapping himself in the stars and stripes to plead for universal peace and goodwill after slugging the hell out of his Soviet man-machine adversary.",1,12,25,30 December 2010
Aliens," ...at least it doesn't star Arnold Schwarzenegger
","The sequel to Ridley Scott's repugnant (but memorable) sci-fi monster movie is nothing more than slick, professional, high intensity trash, with Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as the indomitable sole survivor of the earlier expedition. Here she returns to the planet of her nightmares with a company of marines assigned to exterminate the growing colony of voracious aliens, but unlike in the eerie, otherworldly original the emphasis now is strictly on cheap thrills: military firepower vs. insect acid slime. Writer director James Cameron clearly knows how to manipulate his audience: each shock is delivered on cue at a furious and exhausting pace, and every visceral effect (not to mention every line of formula dialogue) has been calculated to guarantee the proper response, whether laughter or revulsion or (says Weaver to alien threatening small child: 'get away from her, you bitch!') a rousing cheer. The end result may be short on brains, but packs plenty of muscle; a lot of summer moviegoers apparently don't expect anything more.",3,15,34,2 November 2010
Gone with the Wind," Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith
","What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame.",10,5,8,23 November 2010
Lawrence of Arabia," can only be appreciated on a really big screen
","David Lean's stunning 1962 portrait of the fabled World War One adventurer is sometimes hard to pin down, and perhaps for good reason. Filming Robert Bolt's thoughtful script against the spectacular wide-screen panoramas of ace cinematographer Freddie Young, with Maurice Jarre's justifiably famous music score for support, makes it all too easy to overlook some of the finer nuances of such a complex character. Lawrence went into the desert not only to enlist Arab aid against the Turks, but also (in modern jargon) in a quest of self-discovery. In the end he found more than he bargained for, after being transfigured by the unforgiving landscape into something more than just an ordinary man, but something less than the near-deity all but worshipped by his Arab hosts. The length of the film (overture included) is intimidating, but seeing it again on the big screen shames the petty ambitions of today's ersatz blockbusters, proving in truly epic proportions that intelligent entertainment is not an oxymoron.",10,1,3,30 November 2010
The Elephant Man," a heartbreaking story, brilliantly told
","The story of John Merrick, crippled from birth by a hideous deformity that left him a carnival side-show attraction for most of his life, would seem a natural choice of subject for director David Lynch's first commercial feature following the cult success of 'Eraserhead'. But it's doubtful many people would have anticipated the rare maturity he exhibits here, a combination of forthright compassion with an admirable sense of understatement. Lynch presents Merrick as the ugliest duckling ever, cultured and polite beneath his grotesque appearance, but resigned to a life of misery before his rescue from the freak show by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and his eventual introduction to London society. The true story may not have been so poignant, but this is still a striking film, with its empathetic cast, evocative music score, atypical editing scheme, and magnificent black and white photography (courtesy of old pro Freddie Francis), capturing all the soot and steam of England's Industrial Revolution.",9,0,0,15 November 2010
Casualties of War," almost too strong at times
","The latest in a now long line of post-Vietnam War flashbacks is suitably intense and horrific, but suffers from a major drawback: it's all been seen before. Director Brian De Palma nevertheless brings a professional sheen to the film, adding a note of urgency to the already shocking story of the kidnap and gang rape of a Vietnamese girl by battle-scarred American GIs, acting out their most primitive instincts beyond the jurisdiction of any moral restraint. David Rabe's screenplay was based on an actual incident, which shows in the weak resolution: the punishment (prison terms) doesn't fit the brutality of the crime. De Palma's direction is always at its best when he isn't, as usual, aping Alfred Hitchcock, but this film is almost too strong at times: it's easy to read the story as a microcosm of the war and of the fate of the Vietnamese people, but that doesn't make it any less difficult to sit through. Michael J. Fox handles himself well playing the only soldier with a conscience, and Sean Penn obviously enjoyed taking advantage of the opportunity to further refine his Robert De Niro imitation.",6,1,4,9 November 2010
The Last Emperor," almost too remote at times
","Bernardo Bertolucci's epic biography of Mainland China's final hereditary monarch shows a man adrift in time, born into a century which saw a hundred generations of history and tradition become anachronisms. Crowned at age three the Sun of Heaven and Lord of a Thousand Years, the emperor Pu Yi would serve as little more than a symbolic figurehead throughout his life, with no real power beyond the walls of the Forbidden City.The scenario has all the elements for a compelling history lesson, and the scale of the film is hard to resist: Bertolucci and co-writer Mark Peploe trace the emperor's life from opulent cradle to inglorious grave (he died a humble gardener in post-Revolution Peking), setting their story against a turbulent and colorful background of modern Chinese politics. The panoramic photography is like a window opening onto another world, filling the screen with rare and exotic sights. But at times the spectacle almost overwhelms the lonely figure at the center of all the pageantry: the emperor himself, a prisoner on his own throne, and as much a mystery at the end of the film as he was when it began.",7,0,1,30 November 2010
Mission: Impossible II," certainly diverting, in an empty sort of way
","The second entry in what promises to be a reliable series of action-packed blockbuster diversions is, for better or worse, pure popcorn: an adrenalin-driven, quintessential summertime crowd pleaser. The franchise at the time showed none of the formula staleness of its obvious role model, the James Bond adventures, despite sharing the same exotic international settings, the same megalomaniac villains, and the same beautiful, willing bedmates. Plus (of course) a similar superspy hero, played by producer Tom Cruise, using the role to show off all his favorite hobbies: rock climbing, high-speed ballistic driving, designer sunglasses, and so forth.Never mind the convoluted plot, which is just an excuse for an unlikely but exhilarating series of clockwork chases and cliffhanger stunts, the latter earning expatriate Hong Kong director John Woo a lot of praise for their balletic choreography (from people who, apparently, don't remember Sam Peckinpah). The film is surprisingly bloodless for having such an impressive body count, with all the colorful, comic book violence making it easy to enjoy, if almost impossible to recall in detail afterward.Thandie Newton is the token love interest, and a capable foil to Cruise's strictly juvenile machismo, until the inevitable moment when she's reduced (almost on cue) to just another damsel in distress. And the typically glossy presentation will likely impress anyone with a weakness for high-tech gimmicks and gadgetry; if nothing else the film provided ample employment for the best technicians in Hollywood.",5,1,3,7 December 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick re-writes the cinema rulebook
","Stanley Kubrick's landmark sci-fi epic blew a lot of minds back in 1969, and at the dawn of the 21st century the film lends an even more compelling perspective to our place in the cosmos. Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke ask more questions than they answer, which is only appropriate, since their scenario follows nothing less than he entire evolution of human consciousness, moving in daring narrative leaps across time and space from the genesis of primitive intelligence (notably, an act of violence) to Mankind's first, enigmatic encounter with infinity.And yet rarely has a film drawn on such a monumental canvas communicated so much by saying so little. Kubrick embraces a truly cosmic vision of exploration and discovery, but the ideas are expressed with an equally cosmic reticence perfectly suited to the arid emptiness of outer space (the human astronauts show even less emotion than their renegade HAL 9000 computer). Ironically, it's the void itself that leaves the deepest impression, and the film is able to capture its intimidating silence and sense of disorientation using a spare economy of images and sounds: a spacecraft racing silently over the barren, blue lunar surface; the mammoth Discovery probe en route to Jupiter, floating through the loneliest reaches of the solar system; and above all else, there's always that compelling, opaque black monolith, hovering in perfect symmetry between the sun and the stars.",10,1,6,11 January 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," a sprawling mess of a masterpiece
","Sergio Leone's opulent, operatic fairy tale of Jewish gangsters in New York City wants to be the 'Citizen Kane' of organized crime movies, tracing the roots of gang loyalty and corruption from childhood to old age in a complex leapfrogging structure spanning more than half a century. The full length, belatedly released, restores to the film the astonishing scope and depth of feeling left on the cutting room floor before its initial opening, and boasts several excellent performances, led by Robert De Niro as the erstwhile street punk who betrays his friends in order to save them. The ambiguous script is still a textbook lesson in narrative overkill, with half a dozen writers contributing episode after incident after colorful digression, and the accumulative effect of the film's three-and-a-half hour running time is finally more exhausting than exhilarating. It's certainly the late director's richest (and, in many ways, most accomplished) feature, mixing equal parts elegance and crudity, not unlike a long, beautifully written poem peppered with gutter expletives.",8,0,3,21 December 2010
Chariots of Fire," unexpected Oscar winner
","The true story of two athletes in the 1924 Olympic Games is given a gossamer screen treatment and becomes a visually elegant inspiration piece, English to the core, glorifying God and Empire with pomp and circumstance, and no shortage of heartfelt virtue. The subjects are Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary who ran to experience divine ecstasy, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew for whom running offered an answer to bigotry. Dramatic momentum demands the two compete, but history is not so obliging, leaving an empty spot at the heart of the film. The big Olympic finale is, as a result, almost anticlimactic, with a token conflict built around the not exactly earth shattering dilemma of Liddell's refusal to race on the Sabbath. Every character is built atop a foundation of noble thought and decent English manners, providing the true source of the film's inspiration – not the competitions or the training scenes, or the absurdly popular theme music by synthesizer wizard Vangelis Papathanasiou, which lacks a certain period flavor, to say the least.",8,0,0,9 November 2010
The Fly," inventive but often crass re-make
","There's no reason to remake a 30-year-old (minor) horror film unless improvements can be added, but David Cronenberg's grisly update is an imaginative rethinking of the 1958 sci-fi scenario. In the original, a scientist experimenting with teleportation unwittingly swaps heads with a housefly; this time around, when the absent-minded professor (Jeff Goldblum) accidentally mixes molecules with an insect, the alteration is at a genetic level, leading to a gradual physical metamorphosis better suited to the horror film format. Tiny hairs begin sprouting on his back; next he begins to exhibit unusual strength; then he experiences a sudden craving for sugar; and finallywell, suffice to say that viewers with sensitive stomachs are hereby forewarned. Cronenberg earns points for emphasizing the tragedy of Goldblums's predicament, but the nauseating shock effects are strictly for kids. With a little more subtlety the film might have emerged as a classic of its kind.",6,2,5,18 November 2010
Total Recall," hard to remember five minutes afterward
","It's an ironic title for such a forgettable movie, reportedly one of the most expensive ever made, although most of the over-bloated budget, wasted on gratuitous special effects, would have been better spent on a halfway decent screenplay and basic elocution lessons for Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former Mr. Olympia certainly has the beefcake proportions of a matinée idol, but none of the necessary charisma: he mutters expletives, sprays bullets around, and thereby exhausts his acting skills.The almost incoherent plot, concerning mind games on the Martian colonies in the near future, is just an excuse for an endless, irritating succession of chases and mayhem, directed by Paul Verhoeven with a lack of excitement matched only by his lack of imagination. Verhoeven hasn't enough sense of style to bring even a token gesture of fun into the (mean-spirited) action sequences, and when Arnold uses an innocent bystander to block a villain's bullets we're meant to applaud his quick thinking.The script was based (very loosely, one suspects) on a Philip K. Dick story, but it's a shame artificial memory transplants like those featured throughout the film couldn't be used on the audience to leave a better impression.",3,6,19,10 January 2011
Hoosiers," corn-fed inspiration
","Critics compared it to 'Rocky', but this hackneyed inspirational drama actually looks and sounds more like 'The Natural', trading an enduring baseball myth for the fairy tale of small town high school basketball. Never mind the competitive spirit: the film is more a celebration of spacious skies and amber waves of grain, with hard luck coach Gene Hackman leading his undisciplined team to the Indiana State championship, bullying his way into the hearts of taciturn, conservative farm community where the game is regarded almost as a religion. The outcome of every match up is never in doubt; no matter how far behind they may be, the Hickory Hucksters always manage to find themselves with a tie score just before the final buzzer. But the music-and-montage approach to the sport flattens the genuine mania and suspense generated on a high school basketball court. Every cliché, from the triumphant music fanfares to the slow motion, game winning jump shots to the exultant crowd scenes, is as familiar as an old pair of gym sneakers, which is sure to be a reassuring comfort to some viewers. But to others it may simply mean the time has come to buy a new pair of shoes.",4,5,15,27 November 2010
The Untouchables," formula nonsense
","This crowd-pleasing revision of the Elliot Ness-Al Capone rivalry certainly has its share of expertly choreographed shootouts, including a heart-stopping confrontation on the steps of a railway station, complete with Peckinpah slow-motion effects and an Eisenstein baby carriage in peril. But it takes more than exciting gunplay to make an epic gangster drama, and all the usual film school references expected from director Brian De Palma (a famous Hitchcock plagiarist) can't hide the cartoon trappings.The end result is the sort of summertime adventure that passed for popular entertainment in the late 1980s, a grand and artificial gangland opera designed with careful attention to reliable stereotypes, right down to the disposition of the incorruptible quartet of G-Men, shown striding abreast and in step down the vice-riddled avenues of Prohibition-era Chicago: the idealistic, naÃ¯ve leader; his salty veteran partner, a crack-shot rookie cop; and a meek, comic relief accountant who naturally becomes a terror with a shotgun.Robert De Niro steals the film with his over-the-top caricature of Al Capone, but (true to life) his conviction on tax evasion charges lacks a satisfying narrative punch. The script (written by David Mamet, apparently while he was sleeping) takes so many other liberties with the facts, so why not have Big Al brought down in a final, heroic hail of gunfire instead?",4,1,6,12 January 2011
The Godfather: Part III," better with age, but not by much
","It shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that the long-awaited end (hopefully) to The Godfather saga doesn't measure up to its predecessors. Francis Coppola accomplished everything he set out to do and, under the circumstances, produced as good a Part III as anyone possibly could, but the fact remains that the movie didn't need to be made in the first place, except of course to help revitalize the sagging career of its director. The new film does nothing to enrich the earlier episodes; too much of it is simply a carbon copy of what worked (because it was fresh) the first (and second) time around. That terrible sense of Mafia ritual is still vivid, but Coppola takes the operatic elements of the story much too literally (especially during the protracted climax), and the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone into a kinder, gentler padrone was a major miscalculation. The film at least provides one memorable performance (a fiery Andy Garcia, playing Sonny Corleone's ambitious bastard son), but the script reads as if it were written under duress, with plenty of incidental plotting but not anywhere near enough momentum.",5,0,1,22 November 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," hard to imagine a more pedestrian romance
","It isn't exactly love at first sight: Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan share a car from Chicago to New York, and after a decade of chance encounters finally become close friends. But by mutual consent the two are determined not to sleep together, thinking that a commitment between lovers would somehow jeopardize the casual rapport they otherwise enjoy. Will they or won't they? It's a ridiculous argument at any rate: men and women can of course be just friends, but there's no reason for this couple to prove the point, since both are young, single, compatible, obviously attracted to each other, and have no luck with other partners. Nora Ephron's overwritten screenplay benefits from two stars with plenty of chemistry, playing characters with very little appeal: Harry is smug; Sally is cuddly; and neither is able to define him- or herself outside of a sexual relationship. Meg Ryan fakes a good orgasm, and the film in general does an even more convincing imitation of 'Annie Hall', to a point where it could easily suffer from charges of plagiarism.",5,9,17,14 January 2011
All Quiet on the Western Front," sadly, it hasn't aged very well...
","Lewis Milestone's First World War epic is fondly regarded as a classic, but it may appear stale to viewers not conditioned to the shortcomings of early sound cinema. The battle scenes (shot mostly silent, with sound effects added) are still quite powerful, but the dialogue sequences come across as clumsy and stilted by comparison. The problems of pacing were very much a worry for sound productions in the early 1930s; new techniques of exposition and editing had to be acquired, and the learning process was often slow and painful. Had it been made just two or three years earlier, with judicious cutting and with silent intertitles replacing the labored talking scenes, the film would have been unforgettable.",5,5,14,2 November 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," fatally flawed but never less than entertaining
","From the long-winded title (the film was originally released as 'Bram Stoker's Dracula') you might suspect Francis Ford Coppola of not wanting credit for this flawed but entertaining adaptation of the classic horror story, and he may well have a point. The umpteenth remake foregrounds all the repressed Victorian sexuality of the vampire legend with sometimes subtle, sometimes sloppy Gothic imagery and effects, but the details are by now too familiar to raise any serious goose bumps. At any rate the colorful bloodlust and overheated ambiance is diminished by all the amateur theatrics, with playacting English accents ranging from the merely embarrassing (Winona Ryder) to the downright hopeless (Keanu Reeves). A notable exception to the unfortunate casting (not overlooking an equally over-the-top cameo by Tom Waits as the spider-eating Renfield) is Anthony Hopkins deranged interpretation of fearless vampire slayer Professor von Helsing. His performance completely overshadows Gary Oldman in the title role, who shows none of the evil charisma expected from an immortal, bloodsucking aristocrat.",5,1,2,8 November 2010
The Mission," the cross and the crucible
","Religion squares off against politics in the unspoiled jungles of the New World, where Jesuit missionaries rescue heathen souls from eternal damnation before being forced to abandon them to the more civilized fate of musket and cannon fire. Robert De Niro is the Spanish mercenary and slave trader who sees the Light, wielding cross and sword with equal vigor in this visually rich but difficult and often uninvolving drama. The story itself is all but overwhelmed by the spectacular photography and my Ennio Morricone's typically overwrought music score, which at least succeeds in distracting attention away from the stiff formality of Robert Bolt's screenplay. Sincere efforts and a well-intended message ought to count for something, but the film distills complex issues into a simple slaughter of innocent women and children, with the added, condescending title reminding audiences of the continuing destruction of primitive cultures.",4,2,5,7 December 2010
Stalag 17," Billy Wilder's Heroes
","Billy Wilder's adaptation of a popular stage play drafted the blueprint for every subsequent World War II POW drama, and by now it's been seen in so many familiar variations that the original can't help but look a little stale. The searchlights and barbed wire, the Old World Prussian kommandant, and the elaborate escape tunnels are all here, together with the same bunch of gruff GI Joes, always cursing the krauts and moaning over dames. Who would expect a Nazi concentration camp could be such fun? The pendulum shift in tone from boyish humor to stark melodrama probably owes more to its theatrical source than to any sort of cinematic expression, but the spy-in-the-barracks plot is still effective, once the fun and games finally end. But the only member of the cast able to rise above the ranks of cardboard cutouts is William Holden, both in character and performance. As the cynical lone-wolf prisoner who bargains with the Germans for his own comfort (and draws the resentment and suspicion of his barrack mates), he single-handedly makes the film worthwhile after all this time.",6,1,2,4 January 2011
Platoon," revisiting the film, six months after its premiere
","When I first saw 'Platoon' in December of 1986 (less than a week after it opened) my reaction was more or less typical, and likely swayed by popular opinion at the time...No politics, no apologies: just a blood and guts version of the Vietnam War as seen from a soldier's point of view, written and directed by one who was there. Oliver Stone's previous writing credits ('Midnight Express', 'Scarface', 'Year of the Dragon') showed an almost obsessive inclination toward melodramatic bloodletting, but here at least he found the perfect vehicle for his sweaty daydreams. The film is a soldier's act of public catharsis: a dramatized but painfully vivid account of one young grunt's transfiguration from eager, innocent recruit to brutalized, savage veteran, driven by his horror, fear, and fatigue into acts of violence against both his enemies and his comrades.Some of the details may be exaggerated out of all proportion (Tom Berenger's cruelly scared face; the stately Barber adagio on the soundtrack), but the overall effect works not unlike a swift blow to the stomach: not exactly an enjoyable experience, but the pain is hard to forget.Six months later, after seeing the film a second time (it was still screening at first-run theaters in San Francisco), my response was more circumspect...after all the Oscars were awarded and all the hype and hysteria quieted down, it became easier to appreciate Oliver Stone's career making war movie for what it really was: not the best film made of the Vietnam experience, but certainly the most timely and accessible.There's no doubting the necessity or sincerity of Stone's vision. Or the grim accuracy of his details (drawn no doubt from his own memories of combat). But as a filmmaker he is, at best, more a skilled craftsman than an artist, and his claustrophobic grunt's-eye view of the war can't help but suffer from a foot soldier's single-minded lack of imagination, simplifying complex moral dilemmas into obvious and easy personifications of good versus evil: saintly Willem Dafoe vs. battle-scarred Tom Berenger.The only way Stone can think to take up the narrative slack is with unnecessary voice-over narration (letters to grandma, no less), usually a last-ditch tactic designed to camouflage a film's inability to communicate in its own language. The same can be said for the biblical epigraph (from Ecclesiastes) and, to a lesser degree, the stately Barber adagio, both of which substitute false piety for the very real emotional drama already in evidence.Further proof, if any were needed, that first impressions are rarely complete.",5,3,8,27 December 2010
Raging Bull," an unflinching portrait, superlative in every way
","There are boxing movies, and then there's the film that may well prove to be director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece; a tough call, given the level of excellence throughout his career. It may or may not be, as many critics have claimed, the best Hollywood feature of the 1980s(actually, it was released in the last year of the 1970s), but the visceral impact of the film is undeniable. Some people may (understandably) not see many virtues in a biography of middleweight champ Jake LaMotta, a man so filled with violence and jealousy that he tormented everyone, including himself, both in and out of the ring. But through Scorsese's fluid direction and Robert De Niro's intense (almost frightening) performance a portrait emerges of a beast who, beneath the rage, is at least halfway human, if never entirely sympathetic. It may not be a pretty picture (despite the stunning black and white photography and Oscar winning editing), but it's certainly a powerful one. Surprisingly, De Niro himself wrote the (uncredited) final, decisive draft of what, before, was a trouble-prone (for obvious reasons) screenplay.",10,3,5,27 December 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," doesn't deserve its high reputation
","Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter.",3,17,47,3 January 2011
Ben-Hur," needs to be seen on the biggest screen in town
","The best of the wide screen biblical epics may have more brains than all the others combined, but that doesn't save it from being any less of a guilty pleasure. Of course any Hollywood 'Tale of the Christ', however tastefully presented, is going to have a certain camp appeal, and the real attraction of the film remains the sheer scale and spectacle of its many set pieces, in particular the sea battle and thrilling chariot race. In between those two highlights is the usual middlebrow Christian soap opera, full of noble Jews and arrogant Romans, with (representing the former) the young Prince of Hur seeking bitter revenge after being unjustly condemned to slavery by his childhood friend Messala, now a Roman tribune. Ben Hur's vendetta eventually leads him to a Messiah who preaches love and forgiveness, two simple virtues all but lost behind the mammoth production costs and rousing Miklos Rosza music score. But the drama is salvaged by a semi-literate script (the screen writing tag team included a skeptical Gore Vidal), several worthwhile performances (all the more noteworthy from a cast dressed in togas), and a homeopathic dose of that old-time religion.",8,0,2,6 November 2010
Bull Durham," strictly minor league
","Two favorite warm weather diversions (summer movies and professional baseball) are ill-served by writer director Ron Shelton's debut feature: a thinly disguised third-person daydream of fistfights and fastballs in the Carolina League. Kevin Costner portrays a veteran 'player to be named later', doing what he can to mature a hot shot but dim-witted rookie pitcher (Tim Robbins), while competing against him off the field for the heart (and body) of local groupie/baseball guru Susan Sarandon. Shelton draws on his own experience in the minor leagues for background, providing a few good laughs about interview etiquette and pitching mound conferences, but the film is more about Sarandon's libido than the ballgame itself, with all the expected male fantasy frills: locker room humor and easy sex, to be specific. It proved to be a popular crowd pleaser (such is the devalued state of the Romantic Comedy these days), but it's a pity Shelton couldn't have taken a few cold showers while writing his script.",3,4,10,9 November 2010
Ran," unforgettable samurai Shakespeare
","Sitting through three hours of Shakespeare transposed to a feudal Japanese setting might be enough to test the endurance of many viewers, but Akira Kurosawa's colorful reading of 'King Lear' offers a bold (and, at times, barbaric) spectacle well worth the effort, and not soon forgotten. The music of Shakespeare's language suffers in translation, but the scenario is faithful to its source, filling the screen with operatic intrigues, skullduggery, vendettas, and a Götterdämmerung climax that leaves just about every character dead. Like other Kurosawa films it takes a while to work up any momentum, requiring several long, static dialogue scenes to establish the conflicts between an aging warlord and his (thankfully color-coded) sons (plus one totally ruthless daughter-in-law). But once underway the story builds into an exciting, impressive, and exhausting melodrama far removed from its humble stage origins.",9,0,2,29 December 2010
Apollo 13," over-written but convincing space-age drama
","The near tragic flight of unlucky Apollo 13 galvanized (at least for the duration of the crisis) a nation grown predictably bored with the Space Race after Neil Armstrong's historic one small step on the Sea of Tranquillity one year earlier. But its unlikely Ron Howard's dramatic re-enactment will have the same effect on moviegoers, however well crafted and exciting it can be. The trio of marooned astronauts is shown responding to their predicament with not unexpected fortitude, but the film correctly identifies the true heroes as the aerospace engineers who improvised a series of life-saving maneuvers using slide rules, string, and sealing wax. The best moments, as a result, are those at Mission Control in Houston, and the near documentary flavor of these scenes generates surprising tension for such a familiar scenario (facts aside, the outcome is never in doubt: high caliber stars like Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon would never be allowed the indignity of a slow death in outer space). Too bad the suspense is then diluted by constant cross-cutting to flight commander Jim Lovell's anxious family: Kathleen Quinlan may in fact be the real hero of the film for enduring such a thankless token role (Mrs. Lovell's lonely vigil was certainly every bit as brave as her husband's ordeal, but it belongs in another movie altogether). The screenplay, credited to three writers (including 11th hour script doctor John Sayles) leans hard on space cowboy techno-jargon, but at least it's convincing. Someone obviously did his homework, and co-writer Al Reinert's experience making the 1990 documentary 'For All Mankind' (for which he watched five million feet of NASA Apollo footage) was obviously a boon.",7,2,4,3 November 2010
Gladiator," Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive
","Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.",3,5,12,22 November 2010
Born on the Fourth of July," a moving true story, put through the Oliver Stone wringer
","Just because Oliver Stone's heart is in the right place doesn't make this unofficial sequel to his Oscar winning 'Platoon' a good film, and in typical sledgehammer fashion he turns the moving true story of disabled, disillusioned Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic into little more than a bad soap opera. Stone co-wrote the screenplay with Kovic himself, but judging from the presentation it's clearly an Oliver Stone project: the film is visually and verbally bombastic, overwrought with clichés, dripping with sentiment, and weighed down by the director's usual battery of cosmetic effects. The combat sequences and VA hospital scenes carry moments of genuine impact, but elsewhere the film is saturated with artificial music cues, fancy camera angles, portentous slow motion effects, and more tight close-ups than the average made-for-TV movie. A measure of redemption is supplied by the high caliber acting of (surprise) Tom Cruise, but there's a limit to what even he can do: when the life of an actual person is reduced to stereotype it's difficult to stretch him back to three credible dimensions again.",3,22,37,8 November 2010
Goodfellas," a perfect match of director and subject
","Martin Scorsese's black comic Mafia case history claims to be a true story, but the facts are less important than the exaggerated, hyper-kinetic style in which they're presented. In just over two hours the film covers more than thirty years in the career of model criminal Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his childhood rise to privilege to his inevitable downfall through drugs, and finally to the ultimate treachery of his testimony under the FBI witness protection program. With so little time to cover so much ground the film, by necessity, moves like greased lightning (Liotta's constant voice-over narration is almost like having the entire source book, 'Wiseguys', read aloud), and although a certain depth is lost in the process the density of detail is amazing.Scorsese admitted he wanted to structure his Mafia epic like a two-hour coming attractions trailer, and that's a fair description of the finished film: there's no actual dialogue in the first thirty minutes, no real conflict for a least an hour, and no suggestion of a plot until the film is two-thirds over. What emerges instead is a visually dense and hyperactive stew of details, incidents, and non-stop music references, often suggesting an insider's guide to New York City Italian-American culture. The technique is often as violent as the subject (even with the gallows humor provided by comic psychopath Joe Pesci) and, while the director certainly deserves all the acclaim the film has earned him, equal credit for helping build such incredible kinetic energy belongs to his longtime collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing), especially in the latter half of the film, when Liotta's cocaine habit starts getting out of hand.Scorsese might be criticized for elevating style over substance; his film doesn't really say anything except 'crime doesn't pay' (not exactly a revelation), but says it with a thrilling, kick-in-the-pants vitality, succeeding in putting a unique spin on a genre many people might be excused for thinking had long been exhausted.",9,0,0,23 November 2010
Jurassic Park," 'Westworld' revisited
","Steven Spielberg's popular crowd-pleaser rode the crest of a passing dinosaur craze (a craze engineered, in part, to coincide with the film's release), but it also delivered enough genuine summer matinée fun to justify all the hoopla. There isn't anything particularly original about the film: the skimpy plot, following a group of reluctant tourists trapped on an island theme park with marauding dinosaur clones, is a state-of-the-art update of 'Westworld', also written by Michael Crichton; Sam Neill's paleontologist hero is a cardboard ringer for Indiana Jones (the role might have been written for Harrison Ford); and if the film is Spielberg's most effective thrill ride since 'Jaws' it's only because his dinosaurs are distant cousins to Bruce the Great White Shark.The script may be thin and the (human) characters unforgivably shallow, but none of that should worry viewers expecting to be scared half out of their seats. Spielberg's only aim - reinforced by an anticlimactic ending almost begging for a sequel - is to provide two hours of undiluted distraction, and (fortunately) the best moments lean more on expensive lab work than on decent writing or depth of character. For one tenth the budget (and one tenth the profits) Ray Harryhausen could have made essentially the same movie, but 'Jurassic Park' is a legitimate blockbuster, with one nagging reservation: after so much advance publicity, did the director really need to plug his own promotional merchandise in the film?",6,1,5,29 November 2010
All the President's Men," a time when 'Investigative Journalism' wasn't an oxymoron
","At the time it was made some people might have scoffed at the idea of a star studded Hollywood dramatization of the events following the Watergate break-in only four years earlier, but the finished film is both an intelligent thriller and a superb evocation of the corruption at the heart of our nation's capitol. The outcome of the story is of course no mystery, but director Alan J. Pakula and writer William Goldman cleverly used this to their advantage. All the familiar villains are kept off-screen (except for TV images and voices over the phone) as the growing scandal is gradually revealed by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, building layer upon layer of deceit and paranoia following what first appears to be a routine investigation of an unsuccessful burglary. From the often confusing chronology and characters the filmmakers were able, without altering the facts, to extract a coherent, swiftly plotted drama, in the process creating a modern political Film Noir that works better than most fictitious examples of the genre.",10,2,2,3 November 2010
The Wizard of Oz," simply beyond criticism
","What more needs to be said about a film that has gone beyond the status of a mere classic to become an enduring part of our national heritage? Is there anyone alive unfamiliar with Dorothy or Toto or the tornado or the Munchkins or the Yellow Brick Road or the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, the Emerald City, the Great and Powerful Oz, the ruby slippers, or the fact that there's no place like home?Before the age of home entertainment most people knew the movie only from its frequent television screenings (always introduced, in our youth, by Danny Kaye), but seeing the film uninterrupted by commercials (and preferably on a big screen) is the best way to appreciate the fairy-tale simplicity of L. Frank Baum's story and the wealth of his imagination, in no way compromised by the economy of the film's Depression-era 1939 budget. This is one of those rare adaptations that is actually better than the original book: a film that will never grow old, for people who will never grow old.",10,3,6,17 January 2011
The Godfather," a classic when first released; only improves with age
","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga ('I believe in America') are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.",10,9,14,22 November 2010
