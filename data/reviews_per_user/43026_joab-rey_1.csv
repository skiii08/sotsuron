The Avengers," kick-ass!
","I brag about movies being good all the time, but rarely when I believe they are great. I'm a fan of all genres of movies, but lately I have felt a bond to grow with superhero movies because they keep getting better, it seems Hollywood finally listened to regular, common people that pay to watch the movies they produce. It has been a while since I walked out of a movie theater with a sense of satisfaction, and today was no exception. I live in El Paso Texas, but today I crossed the border(legally of course), to Juarez to watch the avengers movie. I know I am still a little immature at my age(35), on some things of course, but sitting at the movie theater I felt like a kid again, happy, excited, and with a smile from cheek to cheek when it was over. I am a geek regarding comic books, superhero movies and stuff, heck, my favorite toy and item of collection is my wolverine #1 in near-mint condition, lol. But seriously, this is a movie to see more than once in movie theaters, specially in 3d, then purchase it on blu-ray when it comes out, because it will be one of those movies that you can watch over and over, I am very happy this movie was made, every other superhero movie that comes out after this has to be spectacular, near- perfect, because this movie just raised the bar for the genre, good job, and thanks to everyone involved in creating this awesome production. Go watch it, take your kids, nephews, grandkids, your entire family, or even just yourself, you will not regret it! :-)",9,1,4,29 April 2012
