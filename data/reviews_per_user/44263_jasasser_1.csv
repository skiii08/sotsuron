The Benchwarmers," Disappointed
","After watching and enjoying Napoleon Dynamite many times, we were excited to see another movie with Jon Heder. Unfortunately, Jon Heder lowered himself to a script with debasing and crude humor. There were few funny jokes with an overwhelming focus on nose picking, crude name calling, sexual references and just poor slap-stick comedy with few laughs. After subjecting ourselves to enough, we gladly walked out of the movie theatre in an attempt to reclaim some dignity. I still hope for actors and actresses that are secure enough in who they are to produce a movie that a family can enjoy. This was not one of those movies.",2,7,15,8 April 2006
