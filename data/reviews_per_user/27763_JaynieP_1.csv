Despicable Me 2," A brilliant sequel!
","For a sequel, Despicable Me 2, is brilliant! Unlike most sequels that try to re-create the feeling of the first movie (and generally fail :( ), Despicable Me 2 continues the story of Gru now that he has 'gone legit' and is a full-time father to the three girls, Edith, Margot and Agnes, he adopted in the first movie. We see his softer side when he fills in for a fairy at Agnes' birthday party and his very, very protective side when Edith meets a boy...Gru is also recruited by the Anti-Villain League to help find a new villain and is partnered with Lucy, the 'love-interest' in the movie.The minions are especially entertaining and I spent most of the movie chuckling, often laughing out loud at their antics! Good, clean fun for the whole family, with a sweet, happy ending :)p.s. beware the chicken...",7,0,0,24 March 2014
