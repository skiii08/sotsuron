The Avengers," Greatest action film I've seen
","There are not many films that are good enough (In my opinion) to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas, HOWEVER from start to finish The Avengers was an excellent example of how to develop a reasonably detailed plot-line whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequences.The chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic. Getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from Captain America, sarcastic and nonchalant from Iron Man, zen and rage from Bruce Banner. They really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes.At the end of the day if you want the most unexpected, ground shattering storyline with serious real-life connections tho may not be the best movie for you. However if you want a brilliantly laid out series of action sequence, funny one liner, small plot development, action sequence, action sequence and bigger action sequence. This movie is going to rock your world!",9,8,18,16 July 2012
