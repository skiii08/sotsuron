Lucky Number Slevin," Great Movie, not for those without a brain
","This movie is very well written and full of action. The ending is pretty obvious about halfway through the movie but the dialogue and action scenes make up for it. The beginning of this movie is amazing...it is a must see. Bruce Willis plays a hit-man and Josh Hartnetett plays a character that gets hit with a severe case of mistaken identity. Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman play rival mob bosses who where once best of friends. If you like movies like pulp fiction this movie is for you. It has violence, sex, gangsters and whats a movie without Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue.Great Movie well Worth the 10 bucks to see it",9,1,8,24 April 2006
