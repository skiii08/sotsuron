3:10 to Yuma," Good acting, good cast, awful third act
","Was looking forward to watching Bale and Crowe in this, they put in a good performance with the added bonus of Dallas Roberts who I first saw in The Walking Dead and I always enjoy the comic relief of Alan Tudyk. So I don't need to tell the story as its described above but I think this movie could of been edited a lot shorter, maybe even cut half an hour off. Okay so when Wade and Dan start running from their hideout, why does Wades gang all start firing upon them?? Like Wades gang has travelled so far to catch him and instead of just storming the place and taking their leader back, they just start shooting at him in hopes of shooting his captor. Then of course it's such a silly ending that Evans dies then Wade kills his whole gang, then he gets on the train to go to prison so the audience thinks he's taking responsibility of his wrong doings. But that is just thrown on its head a few seconds later when he calls his horse from the train so he is obvs just gonna get off and escape. Like he wasn't a redeemable character at all, Evans died because his gang was after him, so the hero of the film died just because Wade was bored and wanted to travel across the wild West pissing people off and killing folks.Also Christian Bales character was supposed to have his leg blown off and had a wooden replacement. yet he was clearly bending it at multiple points during the film. this movie defo doesn't deserve the rating it has.",4,0,0,18 June 2013
Crash," Great Acting, Fantastic Scriptwriting
","This film didn't really seem like my cup of tea, but I kept it on and really got into it. There is some really fantastic performances in this film. I really liked the way all the different people's lives were interlinked. Although I really thought the film was going to end on a downer, I was happy that some of the stories turned out well. Especially the locksmiths story it was a huge relief to find out his daughter wasn't accidentally killed. I thought Sandra Bullocks character was far too outwardly racist and don't really think there would be anyone that vocal about it. Their story was probably the worst. Don Cheadle got what was coming for him and Ludicrous' story ended with a nice touch.",7,0,2,18 June 2013
Man of Steel," A perfect Superman films for fans of Superheroes from the year 2000 onwards.
","My title sums up my review of this film perfectly. if your looking for John Williams, Red Underpants or flying round the world to turn back time, then this film will still impress you. But maybe not as much. To quote Tony Stark from Iron Man 3, 'Things are different now', and so they are. Ever since Batman begins in 2005, the 'dark' superhero films have ruled the roost. Comic fans will know that even before that we were seeing a dark theme running through the pages. I personally think its for the better, characters are getting more depth, getting more personal and gritty. Anyway on to Man Of Steel, if you say the trailers or the posters you knew this wasn't going to be like any Superman you've seen before. I also think this superman film was for the fans. a lot of people who weren't familiar with his backstory told me they'd wished the film had more of him learning of his powers. but the true fans already know all this, which is why I think Snyder skipped over the small ills part so much. It was interesting that they showed more of what a krypton was like, they used special effects to show even avid Superman fans, a whole new side to the mythos. I think Hans Zimmer done a perfect job on the score, and I even think the new 'theme' is perfect for this film. Cavill done a great job as the Man Of Steel, as did all the other characters. Shannon's Zod was perfect and there are some great Easter eggs that will help set up future films. I know people complain about Superman Returns being too romantic and mushy. but one complaint I do hear is that there wasn't enough character development and too much action. if I'm too enjoy the sequel as much as this one I think our man of tomorrow will have to be a lot more grounded. also I think to avoid repeating the past Lex Luthor should team up with someone like Braniac so it's more believable that Luthor can do any harm.",8,1,4,18 June 2013
Black Hawk Down," Some of it was good, some of it was bad
","This was a hard film to rate, I enjoyed some of the acting and some of it was truly awful. I really enjoyed Eric Bana, McGregor and William Fitchtner. Although Josh Hartnett was the lead I felt it should of been Bana. There was some great set pieces although was annoyed they had the smith character on deaths door only to have him appear on the mend at the end, then there was that extra scene that showed Hartnett over his dead body. This film seemed to not be able decide whether it was a Hollywood action blockbuster or a serious war drama. You may ask me why I feel it's a typical action blockbuster, well that's because the McKnight character (played by Tom Sizemore) had no regard for his own well being. He just dandered about while bullets were impacting all round him. Like were the film makers trying to show him as some Kamikaze mental case, he should of been acting just the like the rest of the actors, scared and part of the action. I'm sure the real soldier didn't act like that. Regardless it was an interesting film but maybe just not my full cup of tea.",5,1,4,25 June 2013
The Dark Knight," Fantastic Movie For Comic Fans & Film Fans Alike
","This is the best of the Dark Knight trilogy in my opinion. Heath Ledger is fantastic as The Joker, also I feel he kind of gets put in the back burner but Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/ Two Face is also fantastic and the special effects on his face are incredible. Bale will always be my favourite Batman and this story is brilliant especially the tension between the two boats at the end. Kind of annoying they changed the actor of the Rachel character only to have her go and get killed, but that's only one small gripe in an otherwise perfect film. I'd also like to mention the fantastic opening sequence in the bank that has to be one of my favourite scenes in any film, hopefully the second Man Of Steel film will be as fantastic as this second Dark Knight movie!",10,0,1,18 June 2013
