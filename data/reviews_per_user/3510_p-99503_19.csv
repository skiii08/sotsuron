Argo," A good movie.

L.A. Confidential," A sublimely complex story.

The Aviator," CB is simply sublime.

Full Review",9,0,0,4 April 2020
Avatar," Technically wow! But the story is meh...
","Back in 2009 3d movie is a big thing(now I just crave for a normal 2d film), I went to see this with my girlfriend back then. No good seats available, so we had to do with first row. As you can imagine, not a pleasure experience. But seeing those 3d characters were still exciting. As for the story, just cliche.",6,1,1,23 March 2020

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Just don't wanna say goodbye.
","Ultimately, the chief difference between this film and its two predecessors is the presence of resolution. The story ends, just like we all knew it would. And there's something inherently disappointing about that.",7,0,6,27 March 2020
The Great Gatsby," A typical Luhrmann film.
","This is a typical Luhrmann, gorgeously shot, exquisitely designed and beautiful to look at. I'm not a huge fan of the storytelling, but it can still grab my attention. Overall, I know it's not perfect but I dig it.",8,0,0,15 March 2020
