The Expendables 2," Not as good as the first , but still mandatory viewing for action fans
","As a movie I like the first one better . However, I am a huge fan of 1980's action movies and with the combined cast of Ex2 I own about 100 movies in my personal collection . The positive aspects of Ex2 is the expanded roles for Arnold and Willis, the Chuck Norris cameo, plus JCVD as a villain and Scott Adkins as the heavy. Van Damme's performance was so good , it is my favorite aspect of the film. Also, having everyone here in the same film is an action fan's wet dream. What I didn't like was the tone. The first film was darker and if there was anymore comedy , this tough as nails franchise turns into a slapstick comedy . In action movies a lot of this stuff is tongue in cheek , here it is a touch much. Yes, there are bigger action scenes. But there was better action in Ex1 and some of the action here is downright stupid. Not to mention the lack of Jet Li and turning Gunnar,the loose cannon psychopath into a circus clown . Having said that I still like the movie and urge all fans of action to go see it.",6,1,3,27 August 2012
Fury," 'Ideals are peaceful, history is violent'
","Fury is an excellent and action packed WW2 movie by one of my favorite current film makers David Ayer. He is best known for working as a writer and/or director on a lot of excellent police thrillers. Besides the cinematic abomination known as Suicide Squad, I enjoy the movies he works on. This is unlike a lot of more one dimensional jingostic WW2 movies. The film is very gritty and violent and portrays a fairly bleak view of survival of Brad Pitt and his crew fighting the Nazi's and doing their best to survive inside a Sherman tank, which is inferior to the tanks driven by the enemy. This gives a fairly sound depiction of the horrors of war and what these men must endure. The performances are very somber and very good. The actors had great chemistry. The overall tone and mood of the film brings to mind the band Discharge, which would be a good aural companion piece to the film. Fury is a very good film, that is solid and well made.",8,2,4,20 May 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One is on the right track for sure
","I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with Rogue One. Having seen all the Star Wars films at the theater when they were released theatrically(I saw the first film at the drive in with my parents when I was four), besides the original trilogy this is the only one I like. Rogue One is easily the darkest since The Empire Strikes Back. This has a fairly serious tone to it and a lot of the corny stuff prevalent in the prequels and last year's film is thankfully absent here. This feels the most like a Star Wars film for sure. Some criticisms I would have are some of the cgi with regards to certain characters in the film and like the last Star Wars film, the action scenes are a bit excessive. There really is no need to outdo the existing Star Wars films in that regard and I think the film would benefit from less emphasis on action and special f/x and more time on character development and plot. One thing that this film and The Force Awakens did get right was that the f/x for the most part look really good and is a combination of digital and practical f/x. I am not sure how well this will hold up in the years to come, but I currently enjoy it.",7,0,5,22 December 2016
Stripes," Classic
","Stripes is my favorite movie from comedic genius Bill Murray. Stripes is hilarious from start to finish and this is in my opinion director Ivan Reitman's finest film work as well. Harold Ramis has excellent chemistry with Bill Murray and his character and rapport with Bill Murray is a crucial component of making this film work. Murray and Ramis give some of their most memorable performances on screen and play off each other wonderfully. Plus, I am sure behind the scenes, his writing made this excellent(when combined with Murray's brilliant improvisation). The support cast is amazing with John Candy,PJ Soles,Sean Young,John Larroquette and Judge Reinhold. Also, let's not forget about Warren Oates in a very memorable role as Sgt. Hulka. Warren Oates gives the role and film some credibility and is excellent in this role. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and company party all the time in this comedy classic and if you don't find this movie to be funny, you probably would'nt know a good time if it was sitting on your face.",10,1,2,15 August 2017
Blade," Good 90's action
","The 1st Blade film is the best in the series and a box office hit that would set things in motion for more comic book adaptations to come on the big screen. What we have here is an avalanche of action with a 90's techno soundtrack. The action is quite stylized, with a whole lot of it, borrowing a lot from Hong Kong action movies mainly with some early CGI f/x. The tone of this film is very dark and is grounded by an excellent performance by Wesley Snipes as the title character. He does not need to say much to convey the hatred and coldness of his character and as such is singularly focused at taking out the vampire populace for the pain and struggles he had in his life as a vampire/human hybrid. Kris Kristofferson is great as Whisler, a Van Helsing type and father figure for Blade. Steven Dorff is lousy as a villain opposite Blade, it seems he tried too hard to play a cool villain, but comes off as a annoying dufus. The support cast is pretty strong with Udo Keir(who would have been a better choice as the title villain), Donal Logue and N'Bushe Wright who appears as Blade's love interest, sort of, is really good as well as gorgeous. There is no shortage of hot chicks either,early in the film we have a cameo from Traci Lords. It has been a while since I have watched Blade and comes across a little dated, but is still a good action movie that would be influential to movies like Underworld.",7,1,2,17 March 2019
L.A. Confidential," Brilliant movie, one of the best crime dramas ever made
","LA Confidential is an outstanding and original film that is well made and performed across the board. This is a very absorbing modern film noir with meticulous attention to detail with corruption running rampant once the many layers are peeled away. In this world, nothing is quite what it seems, especially in 1950's LA. Performances are second to none and Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey bring lots of depth and complexity to these roles as these characters are brought to life. The film is beautifully shot and scored with period songs and Jerry Goldsmith's score going back and forth. The storytelling is excellent and is a great adaptation of James Ellroy's novel. LA Confidential holds up well and as far as crime thrillers go, it is one of the best with the right mix of action, suspense and a truly engrossing story with complex characters. A very interesting film and flawless in my opinion.",10,3,3,30 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," I needed something to trash , this more than deserves it! Contains spoiler
","This is by far one of the worst movies I had ever seen . I only watched this because Chow Yun Fat was in it and when he dies the DVD went flying across the room . I have no idea what makes these movies appealing to people as I found no dramatic , artistic or entertainment value whatsoever . This is even worst than the movie that Patrick Swaze and Wesley Snipes dress in drag. For the budget of this movie ten good movies could have been made instead . It goes to show you how many people have poor taste when the masses come out in droves whenever one of these are farted out. Teenage girls should seek out some better entertainment, besides Edward Penishands don't want to jump your bones . He's into dudes.",1,4,5,26 June 2012
The Terminator," Awesome
","Arnold Schwarzenegger brings presence, intensity and menace in James Cameron's futuristic sci fi nightmare. James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels. T2 is clearly the best of the lot, but after that James Cameron is no longer in the mix and from that point on continuity and quality drop.",9,2,3,3 September 2015
The Hateful Eight," I heart The Hateful Eight
","As far as writer/director Quentin Tarantino goes, in the past I had not been a great admirer of his work for the most part. However, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by his new film, The Hateful Eight. I would compare The Hateful Eight as a combination of two of QT's previous films, Reservoir Dogs and Django Unchained.(both titles are Quentin films I like) Throw in a huge nod to John Carpenter's The Thing for the frostbitten tone of the film and for the general theme of mistrust. The Hateful Eight is a beautifully shot and epic film with an equally impressive score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. The scope of the film is massive and by having the benefit of seeing this in the theater, if you had not then you missed out. The Hateful Eight looks and sounds amazing, but the film is a gritty, bleak, bloodsoaked whodunit taking place in a brutal blizzard in post civil war Wyoming. Our main cast is an unsavory bunch with some less rotten than others, but overall everyone is pretty bad in this film any way you slice it. That dynamic does not work against the film or make it less interesting and our cast did a fine job portraying these violent miscreants. QT has redeemed himself for his poor use of Kurt Russell in Death Proof by casting Kurt as the rugged bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth. Tarantino regulars Samuel Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madson were all excellent. Casting western legend Bruce Dern gives the film a lot of credibility and class as Bruce was one of the few actors around to have worked on westerns with both John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. His performance and presence was great and enhanced the film in my opinion. Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a real gutsy and cold performance as despicable sociopath Daisy Domergue. This western is QT's bleak tale of frostbitten darkness that is harsh as the North American frontier in the heart of a blizzard. There are campy elements that go a little over the top, but this is kept to a minimum as this is Quentin's most serious film to date. There is a bit of dark humor and QT's violence is much bloodier than 'Bloody Sam' would have went. Overall, I really enjoyed what I saw here and in my opinion this is QT's best film to date.",8,1,4,1 April 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Timeless western classic
","This came out the same year as another crucial western, The Wild Bunch. This was in a lot of ways similar to that in the sense that they are both stories about outlaws in the final days of the west, but they are approached in completely different ways. Both are game changers for cinema and great, great movies. While I have a slight preference for The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance kid is a tremendous movie as well. This project is more light-hearted than the aforementioned classic, but is is not in any way less potent of a film. The film looks great and was very original and took a very different and fresh approach to the genre. Paul Newman and Robert Redford saddle up for roles for a lifetime and share a perfect and very organic onscreen chemistry. While the film has a bit of humor, it is a great story with multiple layers to these characters. Director George Roy Hill was brilliant in bringing this to life and it was a huge hit on its release and spoke to a generation. This is a precursor to the buddy film, but has more depth and complexity to it. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid is a great film and is very unique. I have not seen a film quite like this and is one of not only my favorite westerns, but also one of the greatest movie's that was ever made.",10,0,0,26 March 2020
The Expendables," The best of the franchise
","The Expendables is an 80's style action movie with an all star cast brought to life by action icon Sly Stallone. Sly was on a roll with excellent sequels to both Rocky and Rambo making a strong comeback to the cinema. Then he made this and rounded up a very good cast of tough guys with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolf Lundgren,Randy Couture and Terry Crews. The much under rated Eric Roberts is an excellent villain and Steve Austin and Gary Daniels are excellent heavies. Plus cameos from Arnold and Bruce Willis. While this film is in some ways flawed with not too much time to spend on character development and not the best dialouge, I appreciate and enjoy The Expendables regardless. The film looks great and delivers huge on action. Great shootouts, explosions, fighting with fists, knives, feet. It also is very violent and bloody along the lines of the last Rambo film. While not quite as gory or violent as Rambo, the action scenes are bigger and more over the top. The tone of the film is lighter than Rambo and has much in common with the 80's action flicks that this is in the same tradition of. However, this is an ensemble piece and plays like a modern version of The Dirty Dozen. While not as good as The Dirty Dozen, it is a breath of fresh air for me as I am not a fan of most modern action movies that rely on cgi and cast with wimpy actors. The Expendables has a very credible cast of tough actors and brings down the thunder with the firepower and gritty violence much needed in modern cinema. This is not the type of film that critics will praise, but is just what the doctor ordered in an era where the film market does not make films specifically for men anymore, The Expendables are much needed and were a shot in the arm to otherwise lame Hollywood action. Almost a decade has gone by and this holds up pretty well and is much better than the sequels. I did like the second film, but it had too much comedy and was more of an 80's action parody rather than 80's styled action film. The third film was complete garbage and a complete mess and waste of time.",7,0,0,6 April 2017
Taxi Driver," Really holds up, my favorite collaboration with DeNiro and Scorsese
","Taxi Driver is a true classic and one of the best films ever made. Robert DeNiro gives one of his most compelling performances as disaffected Vietnam war vet and mentally unstable loner. The film is mostly a character study of Travis Bickle, under the backdrop of NYC in the 1970's. Which was a truly dangerous, but interesting place. In this environment, our main man Travis boiling over in a violent rage is inevitable. Writer Paul Shrader and director Martin Scorsese crafted a very important, unique and real well crafted film that is a classic and influence many filmmakers to come. While there are many movies that have been influenced by Taxi Driver, very few of them are in the same class. Taxi Driver is Scorsese/Shrader's post Vietnam urban American masterpiece that is powerful, gritty and uncompromising. Robert DeNiro is pretty much always great, but this is one of his finest performances and I can't think of anyone who could play this character as well as he did here. I have a lot of admiration and respect for 70's cinema, an era where filmmakers had much more artistic control and had the balls to make movies like this.",10,0,2,1 May 2015
Full Metal Jacket," My favorite war movie of all time and one of the best movies ever made
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a powerful, original, well crafted masterpiece that is in a class of its own and in my opinion, flawless. Don't get me wrong, there are many great war movies that are also classics. Full Metal Jacket is unique from other Vietnam War movies as no one made movies like Stanley Kubrick. Stanley had a unique take on the subject matter, got the finest performances possible from his cast and made a film that still looks and sounds incredible nearly thirty years later. Lee Ermy, a decorated Marine and Vietnam War veteran serves double duty as technical adviser and as Drill Sgt. Hartman. He brings both authenticity and an unforgettable, intense performance as drill instructor. From what friends of mine who served in the Marines tell me, the training sequences are one hundred percent accurate. The other half of the film may be slightly less intense, but director Stanley Kubrick's story told through Joker's perspective flows smooth and is no less interesting when Joker arrives in the 'Nam. Matthew Modine is exceptional here and shows great range in his performance. He has a lot of charisma as well as great screen presence. In my opinion, Stanley Kubrick made an excellent choice casting him as he did a great job carrying the film. Of course Vincent D'Onfrio was exceptional as the ill fated Private Pyle and Adam Baldwin kills it Alpha male bad ass Animal Mother. The rock n' roll soundtrack compliments the film greatly and gives it a feel for the period. The characters in this story are brutalized and their lives are changed forever by what they go through in the course of the film. Full Metal Jacket is one of my all time favorite movies and is one movie you will never forget once you see it.",10,0,1,18 August 2014
Predator," 'If it bleeds...we can kill it'
","Director John McTiernan put himself on the map big time with box office hits and action classics Predator and Die Hard. Predator next to Conan The Barbarian is by far my favorite Schwarzenegger film and in my opinion his best performance to date. The film has a lot in common with much of Arnold's output at the time, but is also unique and one of his most well made cinematic efforts overall. Predator is a hybrid of Aliens, Commando and The Dirty Dozen. What starts out as a routine rescue mission turns awry when Arnie's alpha male special forces team of commandos starts getting picked off by an unknown enemy. You know if Arnold's group of seasoned bad ass soldiers are afraid of what is hunting them, I am as well. While there is less screen time for the ensemble cast, they all performed well and are memorable bad ass characters. Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham,Richard Chaves and Shane Black were all excellent and were eliminated by high tech alien hunter/warrior the Predator. The special f/x are state of the art and is due to the brilliance of special f/x wizard Stan Winston. The tone of the film is right and is very well written and put together overall. There is not a lot of time for humor here, but there are a lot of memorable one liners and all the firepower and pumped up testosterone that should please the most jaded action fans. The sci fi and horror elements are prevalent as well and along with James Cameron's masterpiece Aliens, Predator is the best sci fi/action/horror hybrid of its time and all time.",10,2,2,13 April 2017
The Thing," John Carpenter's sci fi/horror masterwork!
","Kurt Russell and John Carpenter collaborate again in this frostbitten masterpiece of extraterrestrial terror. Kurt is the lead and the film contains an excellent ensemble all male cast. In this horror/science fiction story and sausage party, our cast and film makers deliver the goods. They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier. Great winter viewing and goes down even better for yours truly with some hot chocolate and sponge candy as snow rapidly falls.",10,3,9,9 February 2015
American Psycho," If I hear 'The Greatest Love Of All' one more time...people will die!
","American Psycho is a lot of different things...80's period piece, satire and social commentary. There also has a heavy dose of black comedy, along with horror and brutality. Combining the various elements work well as the team of writer Guinevere Turner and writer/director Mary Harron laid the groundwork for a very good film. Without being preachy, Harron has a lot to say about the yuppies and many of the social problems that existed in the 1980's. Christian Bale did an excellent job as a NYC executive that does his best to fit in and has terrible taste in music. He also is an amoral psychopath and brutal serial killer. To tell the truth, if all I had to lisen to Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston eventually I would go crazy as well and leave a stack of corpses behind me for sure. American Psycho is a great film that works on many levels and shows the dark side to yuppie culture that was huge in the 80's. There is a lot of truth in this film and is well performed and structured.",8,0,1,25 April 2015
The Shining," Classic horror epic from Kubrick
","Writer Steven King has openly showed his disapproval of Stanley Kubrick's film that is different from its source material. But I don't care because what makes a good novel and a good movie are two different things. The Shining is not a good movie, it's a GREAT movie! The film is the highest quality of cinematography, sets and acting. The Shining is a slow build of suspense and terror that does not get dilluted from repeated viewings. The score helps create a haunting melancholy moods and atmosphere that seeps into your subconscious with lush and disturbing visuals. This is a very effective psychological horror film that gets under your skin. All of the layers and elements come together beautifully by film master Stanley Kubrick and has Jack Nicholson's absolute finest performance, which is diabolically brilliant and absolutely convincing balls out performance of a mans sanity lost throughout the course of the movie. Shelly Duvall was brilliant as well and she plays of off Jack Nicholson perfectly. The Shining is a flawless horror movie in my opinion and while it is as disturbing and terrifying a film, this is a very classy movie as well.",10,1,4,13 January 2019
American Beauty," A classic, holds up
","American Beauty was commercially and critically successful and walked away with 5 richly deserved Oscars in 1999. This was a much talked about and hyped movie of that time and the film lives up to the expectations set at that time and holds up really well actually. The film is extremely well made with excellent cinematography, storytelling, direction and acting. The themes of dysfunction in suburbia are still relevant and American Beauty was an excellent social commentary/satire that is very engaging and well executed. The dialouge is clever and the film is equally effective with its more serious, tragic scenes as well as really funny in the more humorous ones. Say what you want about Kevin Spacey, but his skills as an actor can't be diminished. He is brilliant in this and this is one of the best films of its time. American Beauty is great, thought provoking entertainment that went long on characters and story. Everything the film did, it did very well. Flawless film in my opinion.",10,1,1,12 July 2018
Heartbreak Ridge," Excellent entertainment and Clint's best 80's movie
","Clint Eastwood's Heartbreak Ridge is best described as a cross between Stripes and Full Metal Jacket. Also, Heartbreak Ridge came out in a time frame in between both film's releases. Clint is great as Marine Corps. lifer Thomas Highway. The supporting cast was excellent as well with Mario Van Peebles giving his best performance ever as 'The Duke Of Cool' Stitch Jones. Heartbreak Ridge is a great blend of comedy, drama and action. There is great dialogue, performances and balances genres really well. While not strictly an action movie, Heartbreak Ridge has a lot in common with the cold war era 80's action flicks that were popular in this period. Heartbreak Ridge was not exactly the recruitment poster the US Marines wanted and they withdrew their support for the project. Clint did an about face and went ahead and made the film he wanted to make. Heartbreak Ridge is an excellent film and by far my favorite Clint film to come out in the 80's.",10,0,2,9 June 2016
Apocalypse Now," Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece
","Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece that explores the dark side of humanity with the Vietnam war as a backdrop. The film is very unique and very well done. While there is much to take in on a visceral level, this is a very psychological film. Apocalypse Now is Hell on Earth that reflects the dark side of American culture and takes the characters from the Heart Of Darkness novel and places them in a Vietnam war setting. The acting, cinematography and score are all top notch. I guess this originally was supposed to be directed by George Lucas, but fell into the hands of Francis Ford Coppola and I would not change a thing. John Milius wrote the screenplay to this and along with Coppola, he is one of the best filmakers in Hollywood. Apocalypse Now is a humid and gritty tropical nightmare that is deeply engrossing and disturbing. There is no other film that I have seen that is quite like it and as such is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite movies.",10,1,1,31 May 2018
Collateral," Solid action thriller from director Michael Mann
","I am not much of a fan of either Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx. I definitely respect both of them as good actors even though the majority of their work dose not appeal to me. This project however is more akin to my taste. Collateral is a dark, noir like character driven action thriller . Both Cruise and Foxx perform very well here with the tight direction of Heat director Michael Mann . Tom Cruise is a ruthless , nihilistic hit-man and Jaimie Foxx is a cab driver forced to transport Cruise to his various targets he sets to eliminate before the night is over. Although very much a different film , Collateral reminds me of Training Day in a lot of ways. However, I found Jaimie Foxx 's character to be much more sympathetic than Ethan Hawke's character in Training Day . Both are excellent films and I'm glad I gave Collateral a chance.",8,1,1,15 December 2012
Dark City," Reality may not be what it seems
","Dark City is a very underrated science fiction masterpiece that has a devoted cult fan base, but ultimately did not get the respect it deserves. A year later a blockbuster movie would be released and that film is The Matrix and that movie rips off Dark City left and right and is in my opinion half as good as this. Dark City is a cerebral and visual feast that is both visually and intellectually stimulating. This is a very noirish looking thriller that has lots of twists and turns that bends reality. Dark City is a grim existential thriller in a horrific science fiction world. It has a lot of style and substance and is a very well done and original sci fi flick. While Dark City might be beyond the comprehension of some viewers, it's worth watching and rewatching to pick up on details you may have missed the 1st time around. Great cinema in my opinion. Recommend watching for certain.",9,0,0,15 April 2020
Dunkirk," Boring big budgeted snoozer
","As far as the technical aspects of the film go, the film is pretty solid, has lush visuals, looks and sounds amazing. However, in viewing a cohesive film that tells a story and entertains? Not really, as impressive as the film is visually, it did not resonate with me and bored me to tears. I did not care about a single character in this film and was a serious struggle to stay awake to the film's conclusion . The film is taken from the point of view of three, on land, sea and air and much like the characters in the film, I was sitting around and waiting for this to end. Durkirk is Christopher Nolan's WW2 war epic and as such is way too long, self indulgent and very low on action. The action that is in the film is all pyrotechnics and essentially a big special f/x circlejerk with forgettable characters and an incoherent story. Thumbs down on this one.",4,2,6,24 May 2018
Cross of Iron," Great WW2 movie, Peckinpah style
","Cross Of Iron is a very good and different WW2 film that is very original and well done. This movie was'nt a big budget production by any means, but Sam Peckinpah got a lot of bang for his buck in his last great film. The film is gritty, bleak and depressing and is taken from the German soldier's point of view in the final days of battle on the Russian front. This film is mostly devoid of dogma or politics of the war, but very accurately conveys the horrors of war. James Coburn gives one of his finest performances as skilled German soldier Sgt. Steiner who is a killing machine, but hates the war and his superiors.(which mirrors Sam 's views on authority, especially producers, of which his battles are legendary) The film has excellent performers for sure with Maximillian Schell, James Mason and David Warner. The battle scenes are great and showcases a lot of Sam's signature slow motion shootouts. This is Sam Peckinpah's only war film and it is very unique and quite excellent that he comments on violence and ultra authoritarian governments. He does not beat the viewer over the head with this subtext, but the anti war message is there. Even with Peckinpah's alcohol and drug problems, he still is on the top of his game in this production and made a very memorable and effective anti war film.",8,0,4,22 April 2018
Aliens," Brilliant sequel
","Aliens is James Cameron at his best in this very ambitious and action packed sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien. There are certain aspects of the film that don't come off as well as the first one. Such as the horror elements and HR Giger's superior design of the alien. However, James Cameron is an insane talent and brought his vision to the screen with high efficiency. Siguorney Weaver returns again as Ripley and delivers an outstanding performance that is vulnerable, intelligent and tough. It was impressive enough to get a nomination for best actress that year.(which was pretty much unheard of for sci fi, action and horror, genres the academy usually ignores) There are also some iconic and very memorable performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson and Jenette Goldstein. Aliens has a dark tone and packs a mean punch with heavy doses of action. Aliens blend the genres of horror, action, drama and science fiction well. James Cameron is a guy who is a jack of all trades in film and also as a director and storyteller knows what he wants, as well as how to best achieve it. So, with the aid of his very talented crew the f/x, set designs, camera-work and editing are all top notch. Aliens is a great sequel and a classic that in the sci fi/action realm is tough to beat.",9,2,5,28 September 2015
Drive," Overrated
","This much over-hyped revisionist action flick was better than I though it would be.(which is'nt saying much) However, Drive still sucks as Ryan Gosling is not a credible tough guy and not talented enough as an actor to carry a movie with little dialogue . Gosling 's wooden performance had me care less about what went on storywise. This often gets compared to the 60's and 70's films of Eastwood, Bronson ,McQueen. Those actors were tough, but also had the acting chops and charisma to carry along material without speaking much . I did enjoy the violence and bloodshed in the few scenes there was some to wake up to enjoy . So , the film moved slow, which would not be a problem if I cared about the characters. Overall it is nice that this material was taken seriously , however Drive drove me to sleep most of the time. Lame score also.",4,1,10,24 November 2012
Gran Torino," After all these years Clint still delivers!
","Gran Torino is one of Clint's finest performances. He plays a grumpy retired, racist Korean war vet that becomes a hero of the neighborhood for preventing neighbor Thao from being taken by his gangbanger cousin. Walt had no intention of helping his Hmong neighbors, he was just trying to get them off his lawn. He ends up finding a kinship with his neighbors and a bond between them grows. While bonding with Thao and teaching him to become a man, he learns about the Hmong culture and ends up giving up his racist ways. The film the takes a dark turn as is expected when dealing with gangs. This is very well put together overall with a lot of wit and humor with one of Clint's most powerful performances in front of the screen. As one of Clint's biggest fans, I sincerely hope that he is not done acting yet. I didn't think I would like Trouble With The Curve, but Clint is great in that too. I would watch Clint read a phone book.",10,0,2,25 May 2017
Slap Shot," Classic
","Slap Shot is a rough and tumble hockey drama/comedy that holds up through the years. In some ways the film is terribly dated with some of the worst music and fashion from the period. But, where Slap Shot succeeds is the brutally honest portrayal of the material. Paul Neuman was great here and was a very talented and charismatic leading man. He plays a coach and lifelong professional hockey player on a team that is to play their final season in a dying working class town where their factory is closing and laying off 10 thousand workers. The team so far has'nt been doing well and things start to turn around for them when The Hanson Brothers join the team and start knocking heads. Paul Neuman's character is a shyster as well, lying to his teammates and resorting to dirty tactics to win the game, not to mention trying to bang everything that moves. The film is pretty gritty and brash in its presentation and is quite violent. I think director George Roy Hill used this as a commentary on violence, but uses hockey and the bleak, downtrodden 70's urban landscape as a backdrop. The Hanson Brothers are the glue that holds the film together and being real professional hockey players gives the movie some serious credibility and are the coolest characters in the film. While the film is quite brash, it still is funny and most importantly a very good entertaining film that pulls no punches in getting it's point across",8,0,0,27 March 2020
Patton," Excellent
","Patton is a very rich and engrossing biological film about General Patton. It is more of a character study of the man than a film about WW2 and George C Scott delivers an incredible performance that won him an Oscar. The film holds up well through the years and looks and sounds amazing. The script was very edgy and original at the time and elevated the status of up and coming film maker Francis Ford Coppola, who also received an Oscar for his work on the screenplay. While the approach to the subject matter was fresh and original, it has much in common with much of the other WW2 films that came before it. What is most interesting is the complicated layers to General Patton as a man and George C Scott delivered an amazing performance. Overall, the film Patton is very classy and very well made production that was both commercially and critically successful. A classic film that deserves the acclaim it has received.",10,2,3,29 April 2018
1917," Excellent war picture
","I haven't seen many films about WW1, but Sam Mendes WW1 epic is really well done. 1917 is a crowning technical achievement as this film looks and sounds amazing. It was also well performed. While 1917 is not the most action packed war movie, it makes up for it with it's stark realism . 1917 shows the loss of innocence and the horrors of war in a manner not really seen before. This takes you to the battlefield amongst the rats and rotting corpses and drags you through the mud for the first modern war in history and is a grim and harsh tale of survival. This is a slow burn of a cinematic journey, but not one you will soon forget. Very gripping and excellent all around.",8,1,3,27 April 2020
Casualties of War," Very good
","Casualties Of War is no doubt in some way influenced by Platoon, but does not come across as well or as powerful as the aforementioned Oliver Stone classic. With that being said, I still think Brian De Palma's Casualties Of War is very good and like Platoon, it shows opposing sides of morality when it concerned with the horrors of The Vietnam War. This is a chance for Michael J Fox to show he has some serious acting chops and in this role, he did very well. Michael J Fox plays a soldier(Eriksson) that is on a five man unit(led by Sgt. Meserve, who was played by Sean Penn). On their way to the jungle, they kidnap and gang rape a young girl from the village. Eriksson, objects to this immoral behavior and does not participate in the sick, cruel indulgences that the other 4 men seem to enjoy. He does not stop them and the girl ended up being killed. This haunts Eriksson and this leads to a trial where the 4 men are brought to justice. Casualties Of War is not so much a film about the war in Vietnam, but this horrific incident, which similar things happened and continue to happen in war. Sean Penn plays his role as good soldier gone bad from experiencing too much insane horrors from that war. He then embodies the sadism and vile cruelty he has witnessed on not only enemy soldiers, but civilians as well. It was a very powerful performance and Michael J Fox does a good job opposite him.Overall, Casualties Of War is a very good film that shows the horror of war.",8,0,0,6 January 2019
Event Horizon," Pretty cool and bleak sci fi shocker
","Event Horizon is a very dark and well acted science fiction/horror hybrid from director Paul WS Anderson. The plot is complex and principally involves our cast going into space to investigate and find the vessel Event Horizon. I would say this is more for sci fi fans than horror fans, but there is more than enough tension, suspense and grisly images to please horror fans. A lot of this stuff is psychological and the special f/x are outstanding. Early on in the film, much is lost due to an overemphasis on technical jargon(which sci fi fans I am sure love), but later on the film picks up and goes full throttle into dark and horrific territory. There are nods to Hellraiser and The Shining as well as the Alien series. Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neil are both excellent in this. Event Horizon is in many ways a flawed film but it is an interesting watch and much recommended for fans of dark science fiction.",7,1,2,18 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not as bad as some of these people say, here's my take on the movie...
","The newest installment in the Star Wars series has critics and a portion of the fans divided. While, I can't say The Last Jedi is without its problems, overall I did enjoy it and consider it to be an improvement over The Force Awakens. In some ways The Last Jedi is predictable and rips off The Empire Strikes back, but director/writer Rian Johnson took some left turns and added some plot twists that made it interesting. I thought Mark Hammill gave a excellent performance as Luke with this new take on the character. The film looks great and is fairly on point with action and special f/x. The characters are beefed up are and there are more layers to them and the cast did a fairly good job. The creature/critters are there for little kids that like that crap, but are mostly in the background and did'nt bother me too much. On the downside, the story could use some tightening up. The film also is too long and could have edited some of this stuff out to make it flow better as a whole. Some scenes and humor go way past ridiculous as well. The Last Jedi is a kind of mix of highbrow and lowbrow elements that does not always work and won't please everyone, but it is far from being a bad film and at the very least entertaining and not completely predictable. It also must be noted that movie productions with gigantic budgets have a lot of people's hands in the creative side of this, with studio executives, producers,etc that go out of their way to try to make this appeal to as much of a wide audience as possible, so some of those problems are probably a product of that of what elements to throw in/take out. It is doubtful that on a big studio production like this how much creative control Rian Johnson really had or how much material made its way in to generate money and appeal to the lowest common denomenator. As of this moment, I found this to be interesting and enjoyable, how well this holds up, time will tell in the years to come.",6,1,4,21 December 2017
The Evil Dead," 'Join us'!
","Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a very original splatter flick for it's time that would be a great start to a series and very influncial to loads of other filmmakers. Pretty serious in tone, 2 couples rent a cabin in the woods and discover The Necronomicon and awaken The Evil Dead. Very different for its time this gory fright film delivers on both scares and horrific make up f/x. This has very little comedy and moves at a slower pace than the other entries in the series. I must admit, I prefer Evil Dead 2 with more Bruce Campbell, the introduction of splatstick comedy. Evil Dead 2 is pretty much a reimagined version of the 1st film that does everything the 1st film does better. But, that is only my preference and opinion. Having said that, The Evil Dead is still very good and the most pure horror movie of the lot. A classic.",8,1,1,20 May 2020
Major League," Entertaining
","To be honest I could care less about baseball, but Major League hits the spot for some good light entertainment. Charlie Sheen and Tom Betenger unite after working together on Platoon and are among a nice ensemble cast here. Major League has a cast of characters and is the Cleveland Indians are on a loosing streak and our unlikely heroes and underdogs set to turn their misfortunes around. Charlie Sheen was a good baseball player and gave his all for the role. He even juices up to get more in the shape and character of an actual professional baseball player. That's some dedication Also, there is a nice early showing for future star Wesley Snipes. Overall, Major League is a good watch and is funny with good performances from the cast. Pretty solid 80's comedy overall.",7,0,0,28 March 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," Great mob epic and last film from the legendary Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's last film Once Upon A Time In America is a very well crafted gangster epic that looks and sounds great with excellent acting and direction. The film is somewhat in the same vein as The Godfather, but with more unexpected twists and turns and of course shot in Sergio Leone's distinct style. The film was supposed to be 6 hours long in Sergio's original cut, over 10 hours of footage was shot, the version that I have viewed clocks in at around 4 hours and is the closest version available to the directors cut. While some of this footage could have made the film more comprehensible, what is left is cohesive and much of what is missing is left to the viewers interpretation. Which is good, I think. Anyway, the film centers around the life of Noodles and his friends and business associates, who were street hoods as youths in NYC's lower east side and later bootlegger gangsters during the prohibition era. The cast is excellent with Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe and great looks and excellent performances from Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth Mc Govern. Joe Pesci and Burt Young have memorable cameos as well. Another thing that sets this apart from most other films in the genre is that these mobsters are not Italian or Irish, but Jewish. Once Upon A Time In America is a great film and is recommended viewing if you have seen The Godfather films, but are open to something a little more offbeat, but still very much high quality then you should give this film a go.",8,1,8,15 September 2016
The Last Samurai," Tom Cruise is The Last Samurai? Yeah sure, why not?
","Before I sat down to watch the film, thought the premise of Tom Cruise as The Last Samurai was completely ridiculous. But in the context of the film it makes sense and The Last Samurai is a great movie indeed. Tom Cruise is an a self loathing alcoholic soldier that gets a job abroad in a rapidly modernized Japan to train Japanese soldiers. In a battle with their enemy, the last remaining clan of samurai he ends up in captivity. In the months that follow after living with the samurai, he ends up embracing the traditional Japanese culture and changing his ways. This is easily my favorite movie that Tom Cruise has made and he delivers a great performance as the lead. Ken Wantanabe gives a extremely powerful performance in his English language debut as the leader of the samurai clan. The film itself is really well put together and beautifully shot and scored. The battle scenes look fantastic as well. This is really well done epic film making and great entertainment. This is mostly a good story about a man and his personal journey of redemption. But also brings to light western imperialism and racism that runs deep in our culture and how it has effected the world at large. Great movie, really well done.",9,3,12,6 January 2020
Total Recall," 'See you at the party Richter'!
","Total Recall was based on a story by Phillip K Dick(Blade Runner) and was in development Hell, kicked around Hollywood with various directors and actors attached. Arnold saw the script early on and really wanted to do it. After he got established as the top action star of his time, he convinced Carolco Films to buy it and hire Paul Verhoeven who Arnold was an admirer of after seeing his film RoboCop. Total Recall is great high octane entertainment, but is also very clever, complex and psychological film. Paul Verhoven did a tremendous job putting this all together and is one of Arnold's best acting performances, as well as one of his most unique and memorable action movies. Ronny Cox(Robocop) is great as corrupt super villain and Michael Ironside is just as impressive as his deadly henchman. Sharon Stone also is very impressive here in an action oriented role and shows some real talent and range here that nearly matches her beauty. There are lots of twists and turns, some groundbreaking special f/x and lots of extreme violence and tension. This is balanced out with lots of satire and the usual Arnie one liners. This is quite the entertaining sci fi/action blockbuster, but is also very thought provoking as well. Total Recall is a great film and really holds up. Ignore the remake with the Stormtroopers and stick to this classic for an evening's entertainment.",8,1,2,15 April 2020
The Untouchables," Great mob movie from Brian De Palma
","The Untouchables is a slick looking, action packed crime epic with a great ensemble cast of up and coming actors(Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia) and veteran stars(Sean Connery, Robert De Niro). The film is taken from the perspective of law enforcement and as such Kevin Costner really shines in his 1st leading role as Elliot Ness and has excellent chemistry with Sean Connery as an old and uncorrupted police officer. This is a period film taking place during the prohibition era in Chicago. Mob kingpin Al Capone is played by none other than Robert De Niro and while he does'nt have a lot of scenes in the film, his scenes are memorable and De Niro is perfect in the role. The film is pretty violent and bloody, but not gratuitous in any way. The Untouchables holds up pretty well and has great camerawork and outstanding performances.",8,5,7,27 December 2018
Die Hard," Classic action that made Bruce Willis an A list star
","Coming off of Predator, director John McTiernan was on a roll making a very different, but also an instant action classic with Die Hard. This movie also turned relatively unknown actor Bruce Willis into a big star instantly. Bruce was a different kind of action hero than Stallone or Schwarzenegger, being much more of an everyman than a jacked up killing machine. He plays a heavy duty cop caught in a building that is being taken over by terrorists that his wife is also held hostage by. This is really well done, nicely shot and put together. The story flows well with tons of great looking action scenes and explosions. The acting is also very solid with Bruce Willis truly rising to the occasion as leading man. Also, Alan Rickman gives a super strong cinematic debut as terrorist leader Hans Gruber, who is easily one of the best screen villains of all time. Hollywood tried copying this formula for years to come. I personally, don't like any of the sequels and the ripoffs like Speed, Cliffhanger and Con Air are pure crap in my opinion. But, Die Hard is really solid and really holds up. Essential action, an absolute classic.",9,1,1,15 August 2019
The Witch," Hail the goat!
","I really dig this movie and have found The Witch to be very authentic and well done period horror that brings these morbid tales of New England folklore to life. The Witch is a very serious minded production and pays meticulous sense to detail from the sets, to wardrobe and to dialogue. It also has the right tone, psychology and atmosphere to deliver the creepiness and horror. The crumbling family dynamic is also a pivotal part of what makes this film relate able to audiences and have them encompassed in the story as well. Performances and direction are real strong and while The Witch may not suite all tastes, it is a solid and original horror story that delivers and one that I have grown fond of and truly appreciate.",8,1,3,21 July 2016
Bram Stoker's Dracula," 'Whoa, Dracula... Stay away from my woman, dude!'
","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is a very good film. While the film is flawed in some ways with the casting of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, who were both bad choices for their roles. The film is otherwise excellent with state of the art visuals, exceptional,lush costumes, great set design, excellent f/x, great score and Gothic ambiance, fluid storytelling and powerhouse acting performances from the rest of the cast, especially Gary Oldman who shows exceptional range and depth as Dracula. Anthony Hopkins also is very good as Van Helsing and delivers a very good, eccentric performance. Keanu Reeves is horrible in this role and is very much more like Ted 'Theodore' Logan than Jonathan Harker. His accent is laughably bad and performance was very wooden and unconvincing. Winona Ryder is less awkward in her role as Mina Harker, while a British actress would have been a better casting choice, she kind of makes it work. Plus the fact that Winona Ryder is stunning and absolutely gorgeous helps too. I always liked her and had a huge crush on her as well, and she is very beautiful in this film. However, I like her much better as the weird Goth girl in all those 80's movies, especially Heathers, where she really shines and is one of her best performances. But, the film is a real interesting and well made take on Bram Stoker's novel and is one that you don't need to be a fan of horror to appreciate. However, as a horror fan I love it and is a big budget epic that is a very classy and very entertaining Dracula adaptation.",8,2,4,19 January 2017
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," The Brotherhood Of War
","Tae Guk Gi(The Brotherhood Of War) is an A+ movie and easily one of the best war movies I have ever seen. This is the story of two brothers and their harrowing journey on the battlefields of The Korean War. The film does not have much political dogma and as such portrays war itself as a tradgedy and the relationship of the brothers as a metaphor for the war itself. While having a ton of epic battle scenes, the film pulls out all the stops for realism and the lasting effects of warfare. The violence is very grisly as is the aftermath, with blown apart bodies, charred corpses, heads, arms, limbs blown off,etc. Tae Guk Gi is a very moving and emotional journey and is very effective at showing both sides of the conflict could be just as bad as the other in committing wartime atrocities. Everything here was done really well and I guarantee after watching the film you cannot walk away unaffected. Tae Guk Gi is a extremely powerful film that doesn't come along very often. Incredible Korean film.",10,1,1,5 May 2020
The Cannonball Run," Cocaine is a Hell of a drug...
","The Cannonball Run is a completely insane comedy that no major studio would touch in today's market. Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham collaborate on another major box office smash. However, not everyone loved it, critics tore it to pieces upon its release. Which is fine, this was not made with them in mind. The Cannonball Run was based on a real illegal cross country race and made for a really wild and fun movie with a great ensemble all star cast with Dom DeLuise( who is hilarious as JJ(Burt's buddy) and steals the show as superhero alter ego Captain Chaos), also Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Roger Moore and an early US appearance from Jackie Chan. For good looks Farrah Fawcett and Adrienne Barbeau make a good showing as well. There is a whole lot of content in this movie that would not play well in today's more PC climate. While the film might be a little rude and crude, there is nothing mean spirited or malicious about this movie. The Cannonball Run is just insane fun and I'm sure it was snowing on that set, if you know what I mean. Great movie.",8,2,2,17 December 2019
Centurion," Awesome
","Centurion is another way underrated film from one of my favorite directors Neil Marshall. This time around it is a Roman period action movie based around the myths of the disappearance of The 9th Roman Legion in The British Isles and what could have possibly happened. Taken from the point of view of a Roman soldier and is a wonderful early performance( from now acclaimed actor) Michael Fassbender. Fassbender is in top physical condition and along with the rest of the cast truly earns his pay in this grueling, physical role. In a time of fake digital effects and seizure inducing cgi, Neil Marshall takes his cast and crew to the mountains and shoots on location in the blistering cold. In the opening scene we see our hero Michael Fassbender running shirtless through a violent snowstorm, which sums up the tone of the film early on. Although similar to Gladiator in many ways, this is much smaller scale and more action packed as well. The battle scenes are very bloody and brutal with lots of gory dismemberments and decapitations. Heads roll and body parts fly in a brutal gory fashion in this period action classic. The acting is quite good as well and the film is very, very gritty. This has a similar feel to John Carpenter's work, I see a big nod to him here. I see some similarities to Assault On Precinct 13 and Ghosts Of Mars in particular. Centurion gives a good glimpse into barbaric times and in my opinion is much better than a lot of much more hyped films that get heaped with praise.",8,2,2,2 March 2020
Platoon," Great Vietnam War film from Oliver Stone
","Coming off Oliver Stone's underrated, but not so successful feature Salvador. Platoon is a critical and commercial success. At this point Oliver Stone had made his mark in Hollywood as an excellent screenwriter with classics like Conan The Barbarian, Scarface and The Year Of The Dragon. This production was his breakout film as director. However, if you ask me Salvador(which Oliver wrote and directed right before Platoon) is a great film that never got the respect it deserves. Platoon is the first Vietnam War film to be made by a veteran and was based on Oliver Stone's experiences. Platoon is a very well structured and great looking film that captures the gritty essence of war but is beautiful to look at as well. Characters are rich and well developed and the story flows smoothly from scene to scene. Performances are top notch from an up and coming cast of great actors and future stars such as Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, John C Reily, etc. The story is told through Charlie Sheen's(Chris) perspective and is a morality tale about innocence lost, different takes on the war from soldiers who support the war and those who do the best they can to stay alive and survive a war they found to be immoral and insane. Willem Dafoe is from the latter camp as Sgt. Elias. Tom Berenger delivers his best performance as hard as nails hawk Sgt. Barnes. Following in the footsteps of his father(Martin Sheen) the underrated Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as the lead in his own classic Vietnam War film. The battle scenes are gritty and Oliver did not try to sugar coat the material in any way. He shows the madness and brutality of the war and did not shy away from showing atrocities that became associated with the war. The film won a richly deserved Oscar for best film and director in 1986 as well as best sound and film editing. Platoon made its mark and hold up great decades later as well as making Oliver Stone a household name.",9,1,1,28 August 2014
Paths of Glory," Back to the front
","Paths Of Glory is Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti war film that was in stark contrast to many of the more hawkish war movies that came out during that time. Also, this is one of the few films to be made that take place during WW1. This shows the grim reality of life in the trenches. This also shows how during war how sometimes ridiculous, suicidal orders come from high command and how some high ranking military brass value their own career advancement and image over what would seem to be in the best interest in their troops. Paths Of Glory shows how cheap life is, especially in a time of war and the futility of it all. Kirk Douglas is great as Col.Dax and is the moral center of the film and one Hell of a tough soldier. The themes of the film are still relavent in the modern world, especially in the military. Kubrick's film is timeless in the sense that this still holds up today and is a tremendous achievement and a really fantastic film.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Untouchable
","The Silence Of The Lambs is a riveting psychological thriller that gets in your head and under your skin. The film is done really well and the story is engrossing and both the motivations of the killer and law enforcement are explored and understood. Anthony Hopkins brings it big time with an iconic performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter which won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. The film won multi academy awards that year, which also had Jodie Foster walk away with a gold statue as well with her best performance ever as FBI agent/trainee Clarice Starling. Scott Glenn and Ted Levine are strong support for this very dark and suspenseful film. Director Jonathan Demme made a remarkable film that has no equal until Seven comes out. There is no doubt that The Silence Of The Lambs would be influential to Seven and many other films and for what it is, it is flawless. The sequel Hannibal however is not nearly as good, but this is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to be movie literate, The Silence Of The Lambs is a must see.",10,1,2,17 June 2019
Tombstone," Gloriously detailed and action packed western classic
","Tombstone is a very action packed and well crafted western. Those involved with this production made a very authentic, high quality character driven film centered around Wyatt Earp and his family when they arrive in Tombstone, Az. The Earp's are looking to put their lawmen days behind them and make loads of cash in the booming town of Tombstone. However, several confrontations with the cowboys bring the Earp's back to law enforcement. Events soon escalate at the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, where the rest of the film results in an blood feud of revenge until the film's conclusion. Before the gunfight at the O.k. Corral the film spends time developing and humanizing these iconic characters in American history, exploring their lives and relationships while putting forth a great effort to be truthful and historically accurate. The film has an excellent ensemble cast starring Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Michael Rooker and a brief appearance of Hollywood icon Charlton Heston. I must say that I enjoy this a lot and the quality of performances, rich attention to detail and characters really knock this out of the park. If you just want to see a shoot em' up western, Tombstone is quite action driven and delivers big on bad ass action. I also enjoy the other film that came out a year later about Wyatt Earp, called Wyatt Earp. Stating that will not make me more popular with most other Tombstone fans, but I really like both films and if you want to know more about what I think of that film than check out my IMDb user review on that film.",8,1,1,21 March 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Classic horror from Wes Craven, contains minor spoiler
","I must say with all the time that has passed and sequels (most of which suck)that have been made this holds up really well. The story of a child murder that got burned alive by angry parents that comes back to kill their children in their dreams is brilliant. Wes Craven did a great job here I must say,as well as Robert Englund. The younger cast did alright acting wise and is rounded out by screen veteran John Saxon.The death scenes are good and my favorite is when Johnny Depp gets killed. He is'nt bad here actually,but I can't stand most of his work. In my opinion Nightmare 3 Dream Warriors is as good as this and ties a lot of stuff from the 1st film together. Nightmare 2 is horrible and is nowhere near close to the quality of the 1st and 3rd films.",8,0,0,31 October 2013
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The beautiful people, The beautiful people...
","While Interview With The Vampire is cast with hunky Hollywood pretty boy actors like Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas . This is not the chick flick soap opera I thought it would be at the time of its release. Years later, I decided to give the film a chance and ended up really digging it. Based on a novel by Anne Rice, Interview With A Vampire is a very serious minded big budget vampire epic that was a refreshing take on the genre. The cast actually delivered solid performances in this very somber vampire movie. The epic and dramatic approach to the material was innovative with good storytelling and characters with strong visuals and excellent camerawork. While this brings a new approach to the genre, it still retains enough gloomy ambiance and thrills that are prevalent to Gothic horror. So, in as many ways as Interview With A Vampire is different, it still sticks to a lot of traditional Gothic horror conventions. Overall, this is a really good film and should appease both horror fans and more arthouse type of viewers that normally would stay away from this type of film.",8,0,0,16 January 2020
Windtalkers," My favorite of John Woo's efforts in Hollywood
","Windtalkers is a very underrated and misunderstood movie that was critically panned and did poorly at the box office. In some ways I can understand, as a realistic or historical accurate WW2 movie it definitely isn't. But as a long time admirer of John Woo's body of work I can appreciate this and enjoy it for what it is. This has Woo going back to more of his style of movie, but with big Hollywood budget and an American cast. In some ways I am reminded of Woo's A Bullet In The Head, but not nearly as dark . To say this is action packed is a serious understatement and the carnage on display here is nothing short of insane, but also in the tradition of John Woo action films, it also is beautiful. No one can shoot an action scene like John Woo. Even though this is heavily stylized, the dramatic scenes are really strong too. This does well showing the comaradery and bonding between these Marines at war and makes these characters able for audiences to relate to and care for. Nicolas Cage plays the lead and is a complicated and self loathing man who is ridden with guilt and is in conflict with himself and what his mission might entails him to do. At the same time, while a dark and conflicted character, Anders(Cage) is ultimately a righteous guy who always tries to to the right thing. To be honest, before seeing this I was not much of a fan of Cage's work, but I learned if he gets a good role he can take the ball and run with it. That is not to say that the support cast was not excellent as well. Adam Beach and Christian Slater were really good as well and were a good contrast for Cage's more downbeat performance. While Windtalkers is very stylized and brutal it is not without emotional resonance. The film is also beautifully photographed and scored . This is not Saving Private Ryan, but it is far from stupid and well above average when compared to lots of more standard run of the mill action movies that get heaped with more praise.",8,1,1,3 May 2020
Braveheart," Classic
","Say what you will about Mel Gibson as a person, but when it comes to telling a story or acting, he is quite brilliant and immensely talented. Mad Mel has never been better than he was here, both in front and behind the camera. Braveheart is the story of William Wallace, a legendary historical figure for Scotland. The film is not completely historically accurate, but its a film and a great one at that. Braveheart was absolutely deserving of the critical and commercial success it has received. Mel Gibson is on top of his game here in this bloody, brawling epic with excellent storytelling and acting and incredible and very brutal battle scenes that of the likes prior to this have never been captured in this manner on celluloid. For its time, there was nothing else quite like it opening the doors for movies like Gladiator and such. To be movie literate, Braveheart is essential and it holds up really well all these years later.",10,1,3,16 March 2020
The Breakfast Club," Classic, John Hughes best
","I think John Hughes was great, he made some classic comedies and was undisputed champ of the 80's teen comedy. While I enjoy movies like Weird Science and 16 Candles and think they are funny, The Breakfast Club is by far the best of the lot and holds up the best. To be fair, The Breakfast Club is not strictly a comedy and has a lot of depth and is truly a brilliant, brilliant movie. I grew up in the 80's and I felt John Hughes portrayal of social classes in high school during this period were fairly accurate and throughout the course of the film he deconstructs the stereotypes that were prevalent during this time period. The Brat Pack ensemble cast here is excellent and speaks to a generation of kids and represents them fairly accurately. I spent a lot of time in detention and in school suspension myself, so I identify most with the Judd Nelson character John Bender. I also identify heavily with Ally Sheedy's character as well and dated a girl a lot like her in high school. I could not relate much to Emilio or Molly Ringwald's characters, but they were very well performed and real. The film is very intelligent, well made, funny and the performances are very organic and very good. Life after The Breakfast Club was great for the cast and every one of these actors had a good career in films.",9,1,1,5 December 2016
Gladiator," Great
","Gladiator is a more modern take on the sword and sandal Roman period epics like Ben Hur and Spartacus. With a big budget and Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator is high powered entertainment. Epic in scope with a huge cast and great f/x, this is a marvel to look at and was put together well. A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around. This is in my opinion one of Ridley Scott's finest works and like most of his films, stands the test of time and holds up really well.",9,1,1,9 March 2020
Born on the Fourth of July," Great anti war film from director Oliver Stone
","Originally conceived as a film collaboration between director William Freidkin and actor Al Pacino in 1978, but for whatever reason the studio pulled out and abandoned the project. After the success of Platoon, writer/director Oliver Stone kept his promise to Ron Kovic that if he ever broke as a director he would make his film. Born On The Fourth Of July is the story of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic and spans three decades(50's, 60's and 70's). From his youth as all American boy who joined the Marines to fight communism in Vietnam to his life at home as a veteran paralyzed from the waist down. Charlie Sheen was originally cast by Oliver Stone to play Ron Kovic, but at the last minute Stone chose to cast Tom Cruise instead. This caused a rift between Sheen and Stone and they did not talk or work together for many years. In my opinion Charlie would have been great, but the film would be different also. As much as the film is about Ron Kovic coming to terms with his injury and changing his thoughts about the war, it also is about how poorly the veterans got treated when they came home. I would also say it has a lot to say about how polarized American society was about the war. Most of Ron Kovic's experiences were horrible and Oliver Stone did not shy away from that one bit as it would diminish the impact of the film. Born On The Fourth Of July has one of Tom Cruise's finest performances and Oliver Stone won his second Oscar for best director. There also are cameos from Platoon's cast , most notably Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Great movie in my opinion, thumbs up for sure.",8,1,8,4 September 2014
Goodfellas," Classic and my favorite movie dealing with The Italian Mafia
","Typically when it comes to Mafia movies most people cite The Godfather pt 1 or 2 or this as all time favorite. Goodfellas is my favorite and is among director Martin Scorsese's best work. This is excellent storytelling and cinema with top tier camerawork, writing and editing. The ensemble cast did a phenomenal job knocking this out of the park giving authenticity to these characters and with Scorsese's tight direction brings this story to life. Even though Robert De Niro is a in a supporting role, this is still some of Scorsese's best work. Ray Liotta was up and coming as an actor and rises to the occasion as the lead in this film as mobster Henry Hill, holding his own cast alongside Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. As a whole the film comes together perfectly with great chemistry from the cast, no one outshines anybody and everything is done to service the story. The film might be longer than the average film, but never seems so as it has the viewer engrossed in the story. In my opinion this is perfect(or nearly flawless) film making. It is criminal that this did not win an Oscar for best film of that year, but through the years this really holds up and not only is this the best mob movie in my book, this is one of the best movies ever made and is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to see a great movie.",10,0,0,13 January 2020
Evil Dead II," My favorite of the trilogy
","Evil Dead 2 is the best in the series for me as it has the best combined elements of the original as well as Army Of Darkness. The pace is quicker , the overall quality of the pictures is better as the budget is bigger and Bruce Campbell has matured as an actor and had more experience acting between Evil Dead 1 and 2 . There are more elaborate f/x and visually the film looks better across the board. There also is the introduction of splatstick comedy but stays on target with the horror by maintaining an unsettling , brooding atmosphere . Lots of splatter and gore and a great blend of horror and comedy . I love all 3 Evil Dead films , but Dead By Dawn is my personal fave. As well as one of my favorite tracks from the 1st Deicide album.",10,1,2,2 December 2012
