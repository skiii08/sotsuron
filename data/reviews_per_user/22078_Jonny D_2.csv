Raiders of the Lost Ark," Nothing quite like it.
","Raiders is a shining example of what a big American blockbuster should be like, it is so rare to see such intense action combined with a fantastic story full of wonderful characters.  Some say the female lead is just there to be ogled, they are completely wrong, Karen Allen adds a touching brilliance to the character of Marion, and anyone who disagrees should look closer, (i'm a regular male and I found myself more interested in her depth of character than her looks).  Raiders doesn't try to be offensive nor does it achieve it, seeing the odd soldier getting pounded is trite now, personally I quite enjoy seeing Nazi's get the thrashing they so deserved. Raiders of the lost ark is a work of brilliance, I grew up with Indy movies, and even now they make me want to move to America and take up Archaeology. Thank you George and Steven.",10,0,0,11 February 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Worst of the three.
","Raiders was easily the best of all the films, but Temple of Doom was by no stretch disappointing, full of dark humour and highly memorable scenes.  Yet the third film seems full of cliche, which doesn't really work,(as it did on Raiders) and the jokes aren't that funny.  Dont think for one moment I don't like the film, but it's not as dark and realistic as it could have been, (especially with the two best actors ever in the lead).  Also as a separate point, the effects seem to have aged very quickly which is not the case with the first two, I cringe at the site of Indy and his dad in the plane, minus wind effects and surrounded by almost visible matte lines.  Good but not the Indy I grew up with.",7,0,2,11 February 1999
