Ghost," A Classic
","This film is known for the most deserved Oscar win in History, for Whoopi Goldberg. Everything works about this film, just watch and watch over. It's the best.",10,0,0,2 May 2020
The English Patient," A Rare Masterpiece
","The late, great, Anthony Minghella's masterpiece is a beautiful collaboration of some of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The screenplay is exquisite, an intimate epic telling of a nurse caring for 'The English Patient' at the end of WWII, who learns of the tragic romance earlier. The filming and music is unforgettable. All the actors own their roles, the Oscar-Winning Juliette Binoche as Hana is standout and the Nominated Kristin Scott Thomas as Katherine has never been better. A nine-time Oscar-winner worth every second of your time, and should be appreciated as the truly rare gem it is. I've never seen a film like it, before or since.",10,3,4,8 July 2019
