The King's Speech," Why is Geoffrey Rush's Name so far down the Credit List?
","I saw this Movie today 26th January 2011 (Australia Day). I enjoyed it immensely. It was not at all what I was expecting. I know that Colin Firth has the Starring Role and he was excellent, what an Actor!! (Nominated today for an Oscar for Best Actot) Surely Geoffrey Rush deserves to be further up the Credit list!! His performance was brilliant - nominated also, for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. You may have guessed I am Australian & so is Geoffrey Rush. I am not writing, because of that reason. If it hadn't been for the role that Geoffrey Rush plays this Movie would never have been made. It is a True Story and had to have Royal approval. This was denied before the Death of the Queen Mother - the Consort of George V1. I wasn't expecting all the swearing & did not know of the cruel treatment of King George V1 as a child and the taunting of his close family members. I recommend this Movie - Amazing!!",10,0,2,26 January 2011
