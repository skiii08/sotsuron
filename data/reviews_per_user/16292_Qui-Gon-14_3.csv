Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Most Fun You'll Ever Have in a Theatre!
","The critics have never been more wrong (they've also never been so divided). This movie was the most fun I have ever had in a theatre and it was more exciting than I could have ever imagined.Don't go in expecting 'Star Wars: A New Hope' with better special effects. It is a far cry from the original trilogy. It has a completely different feel and look to it. It's hard to believe that this is the same Tatooine that where Luke grew up. But that is no reason to trash the film. Nor does it mean that this film does not have the heart of Episodes 4-6. Believe me after viewing this film you'll agree that it is the original trilogy that is lacking (a great many things).This is the most action packed, epic, thrill ride ever put to film. If you're a Star Wars purist there will be alot of things you'll question about this film but by the time the credits roll you'll just want to stand up and cheer.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
The Usual Suspects," ?
","Although it would appear that most people here disagree, I felt this movie needed more than a plot twist to save it. Kevin Spacey's performance was good but the last 10 minutes of the film were just him bragging about the importance of the plot. And they are the best 10 minutes of the whole film.The first three quarters of the film were unforgettably bad. Poor performances (Kevin Spacey is the only guy who can act in this film), poor action, a lame plot and some of the least picturesque visuals I've ever seen. Any other director in Hollywood could have done a better job with this script.",1,9,17,13 December 1998
A Bug's Life," Eye Candy
",It's rare that a film as entertaining as A Bug's Life comes along. It was one of the most visually spectacular films I've ever seen if not THE most. My only complaint was that Flik's redemption was a lttle unsatisfying.,9,0,0,12 December 1998
