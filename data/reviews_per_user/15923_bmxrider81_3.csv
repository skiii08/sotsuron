The Hangover," I don't get why people found this movie funny
","I really don't. There were SOME chuckle points but for the most part, I thought this movie was boring; unless this was a stoner film then a few things make more sense but I still found this movie BORING. Movies are meant to entertain, but I sure as hell didn't find this movie entertaining. It's more of an insult to heavy drinkers.1) nobody noticed the groom-to-be when they pulled the mattress from the roof? 2) how is moving a tiger funny? 3) how is seeing a naked Asian funny? 4) the sackless guy who was afraid of his fiancé didn't bother to bring the photo album from the chapel? 5) what kind of retard brings a camera to a bachelor party?I recommend that anybody who hasn't seen this film, watch it once then get wasted to forget such a crapfest.",2,3,7,1 February 2011
Transformers," Such a fun movie
","This movie was a blast. Such memorable jokes, and plot that was relatively unique. At almost 30 years old, I was surprised that this movie would be as ENTERTAINING as it was, and considering that it's a Michael Bay film. No other director could've pulled this off. I recommend that parents watch it first and if you're satisfied with the movie THEN watch it with you children. The jokes a pretty mild, but over all it's still a fun movie. ENTERTAINING ALL AROUND. Amybody who disagrees is probably a fan of indie films and NOT really a fan of just plain, old fun flicks. The only part that kind of made the movie drag was that the Autobots save the day so late toward the end. There's only so many ways to say it, so I'll say it again; SUCH A FUN MOVIE!",Null,0,1,14 September 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Holy Crap! 20 year old concept for the modern age
","OK, going into this I was very surprised that a sequel would be made period. Given the people that were hating on this movie, I was scared when I went into the theater; BUT I thought 'it can't be anyworse than 'the hangover' or 'twilight'. I was surprised in the first 30 minutes that this movie was such a blast, a vast improvement over the original. A thinker of a story, comedy where action was at a null. The trailers are a bit misleading to this movie, they almost give off 'creature awaken from a thousand year old sleep vibe' but totally goew off a different direction. Toward the end I was actually questioning how the end woud turn out. The circumstances are Sam and Optamus I thought were kind of cliché depressing but the outcome of the movie was a happy one to say the least",Null,1,4,14 September 2011
