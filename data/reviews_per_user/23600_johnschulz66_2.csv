The Avengers," The Incredible Hulk 2: Hulk Smashes Again!
","I'm a comic book nerd. I grew up on Spiderman, X-Men, and anything and everything Stan Lee and Jack Kirby helped produce. I had seen every tie-in movie, in theaters, as soon as I had a chance. I remember watching Iron Man and everyone had told me to stay after the credits because there was a huge surprise waiting for me at the end. So began the most painful 4 years of my life.In the 1960's, comic books were fun excursions into a world where magic, science, and wonder all coexisted. It was a world where it would be perfectly normal if a giant dragon, a man with the abilities of a spider, and a god straight out of Norse mythology all got into a fight to the death. I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me so I'm just going to go ahead and get to my point. The Avengers is the greatest superhero movie of all time.'But what about The Dark Knight?' you may ask. The Dark Knight was a fantastic film in it's own regard, but that sense of wonder and mystery was replaced by realism and fear. Which is OK because you don't go to a batman movie expecting him to fight against a large supernatural force. But for me, the wonder and fantasy is what really defines a superhero story, whether it's a comic or a movie.Anyway, The Avengers were assembled perfectly. This is truly a benchmark in the movie industry; successfully combining the universes of four different movies into one; creating the grandest spectacle i have ever seen on screen. If you haven't yet, I recommend seeing all the tie-in movies before seeing The Avengers, if not for the sake that they are all great movies by themselves then for the fact that The Avengers will be a lot more enjoyable if you are already familiar with the characters.Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job of taking each of these characters, already having such strong personalities, and making them interact with each other. For me, the beauty of this movie wasn't the action scenes, it was the interactions between the characters. Whedon really understands these heroes.And speaking of action scenes, let's talk about how AWESOME the action scenes were. I was afraid that the trailer had already shown all the great moments in the film but, thankfully, I was wrong. I was really wrong. There is a plethora of fights in this movie, both between the heroes and the villains, and between the heroes themselves. And every hero gets their moments in the limelight. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I was worried might bog down the fights, were just as much of a part of the team as Thor and Iron Man were. But, let's be honest here, this is the Hulk's movie. Hulk had disappointed me in most of his previous movie outings, but not this time. Joss Whedon finally got the character right. You can see the fear behind Banner's eyes, the sense of hopelessness in his voice. He really is cursed, but must learn to use his curse for the greater good. And when he finally does change into the Hulk, Hulk smashes. Hulk smashes a lot.The Avengers can't be passed over as a marketing scheme. It deserves every cent that it reeled in from it's opening weekend. This isn't just a great superhero movie, it's one of the greatest movies I have had the pleasure of seeing.",10,2,7,8 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Could have been so much better...
","I have a lot of problems with this movie. First off, I never read the books and didn't really know anything about this movie going in. I had heard the basic premise that kids were going to be fighting to the death in some game controlled by a fascist, totalitarian state and it intrigued me. This sounded like a smart, sci-fi that should reveal something about how we glorify violence or give our government too much power or something. I expected to be enlightened, at least to some degree. Let's start with the good. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss, our reluctant heroine. Her performance was one of the few things that kept me from walking out of the theater. The plot's kind of interesting, I guess. It kept me awake. Now on to the bad. The movie has no idea what it's trying to be. It tries to show us how horrible the government is, but I never really seemed to notice anything that made them look bad aside from the games. It tries to be an action flick, but no action occurs until the last hour or so when the games start. And even then, the camera is so jerky and the director cuts so often it's hard to tell exactly what is happening. I couldn't tell whether the screenplay was awful or the production because I found it very hard to care for anyone in this story. We're supposed to feel bad for Katniss and her sister, but we never really see anything that shows how horrible her life is. There are a couple of moments later where we get a glimpse into her terrible past, but I couldn't find any time to care because they jumped quickly past this and and went right back to the slaughtering of children. Oh yeah, speaking of slaughtering children, why was this movie PG-13? This is a very R-rated story, but I guess they wanted to market it to the teenage audience or something. The lack of an R-rating really bogs down the film through poor action sequences and unbelievable dialogue. I guess the filmmakers just wanted to make money instead of making art. This really did feel as juvenile as Twilight and that really hurt the movie. OK, this is all well and good, but I really didn't start to hate this movie until the end. I know this is supposed to be the next Harry Potter franchise or whatever, but the main difference between this and Harry Potter is that every Harry Potter movie can stand on it's own (excluding the last two). Each movie had a plot line that, while adding to the over-arching plot of the series, was independent and could stand alone as one story. The Hunger Games does not do this. In the end, I felt cheated. Nobody won. Katniss has to go back to her life of hunting and caring for her family and, as far as I can tell, nothing is changed. The government is still in power and the riot is quelled and broken up like its a high school party being busted by the cops. Overall, I felt the good acting couldn't overcome the poorly written script and shoddy directing. The filmmakers didn't want to make art, they just wanted teenage girls to give them a lot of money. And they succeeded in that. My theater was filled with girls gasping and cheering as these children on-screen killed each other. Good thing I saw it during matin√©e, because paying full price for this is unthinkable.",3,21,31,28 March 2012
