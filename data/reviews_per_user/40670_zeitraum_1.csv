Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Naaa, could have been made better!
","Wow! What sound! Wow! What Computer-aided-Animations! Gosh! What a bad, bad, bad story! I only can describe it with the words of young Anakin: 'Ooops'. For me there is too much 'Ooops' in the story. The characters are not painted well and I don't like this 'Star Trek'-like 2 Minute end. To George Lucas: Less is sometimes more!",9,0,0,3 June 1999
