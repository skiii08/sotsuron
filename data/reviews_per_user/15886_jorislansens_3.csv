The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An amazing story
",This is a coming of age story which if you watch at the right time is honestly a masterpiece. When I discovered this story I was about the same age as Charlie (perhaps a bit older) and even though I am no wallflower/missfit like him I saw a lot of myself in. His struggles felt close to home and because of that the story gave a sense of reassurance. Charlie is a beautiful character and this was a movie of which I'm very glad that it was made.Logan Lerman is perfect in his role and all the actors bring their characters how I feel they were supposed to. Emma Watson is a magnificent actress but because it was one of her first movies since Harry Potter a lot of the critics act like this movie is all about her which I think is honestly sad.,10,1,2,6 December 2019
The Irishman," Borderline overrated
",The actors did their job very well and the directing was just as great but honestly this movie was boring.I knew this movie was three and a half hours long before watching it but now I can see why. The main story line is amusing and already the fundamentels for a masterpiece but I felt like they kept diverting from the plot by adding more and more substories and eventually the movie felt drawn out.,7,2,5,6 December 2019
Brokeback Mountain," Very sad
","Starting this movie I had no idea that they were going to be 'this close' as I thought this was a story about 2 friends. Putting my surprise aside I thought this movie was very cool. Both Heath and Jake are very good in their roles and in the end I was shocked, distressed and mainly sad.",8,1,2,6 December 2019
