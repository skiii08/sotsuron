The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," tooshoes
","The Double Life of Veronique  is the story of two young women who are in some mysterious and irresolvable way--- the same woman leading two different yet interconnected lives.  Veronika and Veronique are born on the same day in 1966, one in Poland, and the other in France. They grow up separately, unaware of the other's existence, but with the vague feeling that they are not  'alone'. Kieslowski fills the film with images doubling and refection, playing visually with mirrors, glass distortions, and deep shadows.",Null,1,4,1 March 2000
