The Ring," Very good but...
","Don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie. However I think that Mr Verbinsky should have made another movie, as good as this one, and American audience should learn to watch Japanese (and other non-american) movies.Just watch Ringu and you have an exactly similar movie (same story, same ambiance, same quality of acting, Naomi Watts is as cute as Nanako Matsushima).I can't see any good reason why this film was made instead of simply dubbing the original in english and make a new original movie.",7,0,0,10 March 2003
