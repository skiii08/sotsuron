The Avengers," Loud fun
","Big, bombastic comic book movie about a bunch of Marvel Comics characters teaming up to defeat alien invaders. Four of the original Avengers are joined by two other Marvel heroes, Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johanssen). For the most part, all are properly costumed (unlike X-MEN) and fit their roles admirably. Hulk continues to stand out like a sore thumb as he remains strictly a CGI creation, but mercifully we see little of him until well into the second half. The actor playing the hunted, tortured Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) easily turns in the film's strongest performance.The two additions to the original roster, the Widow and Hawkeye,are without superpowers, but are just as effective when push comes to shove. Director Whedon of SERENITY fame paces the film extremely well, so that we're not overdosed with video game-like CGI until the big finale. There's plenty of character development for a two-hour comic book movie. There's also plenty of humor, and the punchlines come and go faster than Thor (Hemsworth) can twirl his hammer. The film also boasts a villain worthy of the gang: Thor's half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). That actor has by far the silliest lines to deliver, mainly to do with he conquest of Earth and the subjugation of the human race, yet manages to make them sound convincing enough. He also knows when to play it for laughs courtesy of Whedon's sharp direction. While Downey as Iron Man may be out-acted by Ruffalo, his character is the glue that binds, even though Capt. America (Evans) is the Avengers' leader. Without Downey's quirky Tony Stark, there would be no AVENGERS movie. Sam Jackson makes his third film appearance as Nick Fury, agent of SHIELD, although I'm not clear on why he was dressed for a MATRIX movie. AVENGERS is worth a look, even if you're not a comic book fan. You can always skip the big battle at the end, which is straight out of a video game. Funny thing: Whedon reveals the villain who will appear in the sequel, following the credits. This villain makes Loki look like a circus clown.",7,2,7,18 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fun but way too busy
","If you thought the first NT movie left you gasping for aid, wait until you get a load of the followup, which takes our intrepid trio of treasure hunters (Cage, Kruger and Bartha) all over the map, including to England, D.C. and whichever Dakota Mount Rushmore is in. This time, they are seeking clues to restore the tarnished name of a forbear (don't ask). This involves tracking down a lost city of gold, of all things. Hey, it's a kid's movie! The plot rushes from here to there, a little too much so, and there are plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon. Also, Cage seems a bit long in the tooth for such nonsense. But hey, it's a kid's movie! The only question is, will a kid be willing to sit through the whole thing? The director and writers take no chances, by the way, and give us much the same death-defying finale as that in the first movie. Hey! It's a kid's movie! Keep telling yourself that. Helen Mirren plays cage's mom and Bruce Greenwood is the president, and they give this silly but likable film some badly needed dignity.",7,1,1,5 July 2009
Angels & Demons," It keeps moving, if nothing else
","Adapted from Dan Brown's novel of the same name, this one has Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) racing around Vatican City and Rome to stop a series of murders and find a bomb that could destroy Vatican City. The pope has just died, and Langdon gets called in when things don't seem exactly right. A nutcase has stolen enough antimatter from a lab to raze Vatican City and plans to kill one cardinal each hour until the explosion. Langdon and the cops chase here and there, trying to get ahead of the killer. While the killer claims to be a member of the Illuminati, Langdon knows this is a cover for someone else. Perhaps someone inside. Meanwhile, the cardinals have gathered to name a new pope. Fast-paced, although Hanks is a little long in the tooth to be playing Langdon, especially as the events here are supposed to precede the events portrayed in THE DA VINCI CODE. Not as good as the first Nic Cage NATIONAL TREASURER flick or even those Noah Hathaway LIBRARIAN flicks, but it makes a decent time killer.",7,0,0,29 November 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Slow-moving western
","Loose remake of a Glen Ford '50s classic, with Christian Bale in the Ford part (and looking and sounding a lot like Jim Brolin). Bale is a down-on-his-luck farmer who agrees to escort killer Russel Crowe to the nearest train station for transit to prison. Bale and several others escorting Crowe are besieged by Indians and Crowe's gang. They also run afoul of some railroad officials who want Crowe themselves. Along the way, Bale and Crowe exchange their philosophies of life.This is no UNFORGIVEN, but it sure has a lot of bloody killing. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and messes badly with the ending. It also goes on too long. Bale is interesting to watch, if nothing else. Crowe is just plain boring.",5,0,0,18 April 2010
Deja Vu," Time and again
","Tony Scott is a funny director, funny in the sense of bewildering at times. He can bang out an instant classic like 'True Romance, 'Crimson Tide' or 'Man on Fire' but also crank out instant turkeys like 'The Fan' and 'Domino.' He also has directed his share of hackneyed Hollywood fare like 'Enemy of the State' and 'Days of Thunder.' In the case of 'Deja Vu,' this quasi sci-fi effort falls somewhere in the middle. The first half is breathtaking, beginning with the abrupt explosion and sinking of a vessel with hundreds of people aboard. ATF agent Denzel Washington investigates, and soon discovers the body of a woman that has washed ashore in the aftermath, but that was actually killed days before the bombing. He senses a connection. Government types show Denzel a sort of time machine, a device that allows them to view events several days in the past. They use the contraption to try to spot the bomber, and this is followed by a wild car chase wherein Denzel uses the device to 'pursue' the bomber prior to the bombing. From there, things go quickly downhill. Denzel figures the machine can be used to actually travel back in time, and does so. His journey into the past is so preposterous as to ruin everything that went before. While there is shifts it focus to a romance angle between Denzel and the mystery woman. My advice: watch the movie up until the point when Denzel takes off his clothes and climbs into the machine. Then go find something else to do. Better yet, watch 'Man on Fire' again, which doesn't strike a single false note.",6,0,2,13 September 2010
Unbreakable," Not very good
","Just rewatched UNBREAKABLE. My opinion hasn't changed -- this is a bizarre and ultimately unsatisfying tale inspired by comic books -- but it is interesting to watch Bruce Willis turn into a super hero of sorts. It also is interesting to watch his developing relationship with his son, who almost shoots him at one point. But the film is just too off the wall, and its appeal will lie with art-house crowd at best. Sam Jackson plays a comic book-obsessed cripple who sets up a series of terrible accidents in order to ferret out a super hero. M. Nighgt hasn't made a satisfying film since SIXTH SENSE, which is truly sad. He builds his odd little movies around themes -- ghosts, space aliens, mermaids, etc. -- but doesn't seem to know where to go with them (other than SIXTH SENSE). Watch at your peril.",5,1,1,14 February 2010
Inglourious Basterds," WWII fantasy
","WWII drama is actually a fantasy about a small group of American Jews who land in Nazi-occupied France for the purpose of killing as many Nazis as possible. Brad Pitt leads this ragtag but deadly group. Director Tarantino breaks up the movie in chapters, which makes it comprehensible. Everything comes to a head at a Paris theater debuting the latest Nazi-made movie, 'Nation's Pride,' which all the top Nazi brass including Hitler will; be attending. Pitt is hilarious as Lt. Aldo Raine, the Tennessee-born head of the assassins. Most of the cast is European and unknown here, but special mention should be made of Chris Waltz who plays the fictitious Col. Landa. He steals every scene he is in as a flamboyant, cruel and opportunistic SS officer on the hunt for Jews. Also, an actor named Til Schweiger makes quite an impression at a former Nazi who loves to kill Nazis. And he does so with a very big knife. Some film fans may recognize Diane Kruger as a double agent, and in a bit of stunt casting, horror director Eli Roth plays one of the the Basterds. True film buffs will be reminded of THE DIRTY DOZEN, although this long film (153 minutes) is not in the same league with that all-time classic. The music choices are uneven, and occasionally disrupt the film. Gorehounds will certainly enjoy the killings, some of which are accomplished with a Louisville Slugger. A couple of closeup scalpings are fun but hard to watch, and there's an absolutely exquisite moment involving one of Pitt's fingers poking around in a fresh leg wound. A good, not great film, perhaps better viewed in segments when it arrives on DVD.",7,0,4,22 August 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Mila!
","Lightweight romantic comedy about a guy who goes to Hawaii to forget his ex-girlfriend, a self-absorbed TV actress who has taken up with a raunchy rock star. Unfortunately, the ex and her new beau show up in the very same place the schmo has flown to. No matter what he does, he can't seem to get away from her or the new boyfriend. But he does meet a nice girl working at his hotel, and romance soon blossoms. Meanwhile, the rock star dumps the ex. Guess where all of this is going, folks! Formulaic, occasionally funny, an easy film to watch on a slow Saturday night. Kristen Bell is the TV actress and Mila Kunis is the hotel worker. In all honesty, I think I would have switched their roles. Russel Brand as the obnoxious singer has a truly funny, if vulgar, bit performing his hit song, 'I'm Inside Of You,' with pelvic thrusts that would make Elvis blush. Really, this one is for the girls. Guys, beware. Although I must say Kunis would be sexy simply reading the phone book. Jason Segal as the schmo gets the role Ben Miller would have played about 10 years before.",6,0,2,19 March 2012
The 13th Warrior," Viking epic with a tinge of horror
","An Arab outcast joins forces wit a group of Vikings to protect a faraway kingdom that is under siege by an army of flesh-eating, horse-riding nomads who appear to have swept out of some forgotten homeland, perhaps central Asia. This is the same basic plot as The Seven Samurai and it is put together very well. Great battle scenes, moody cinematography (the cannibals only attack in fog), and lots of lusty, laughing, larger than life Vikings right out of a 1950s Hollywood epic. No helmet horns, thank God! We are meant to identify with Banderas' Arab, a learned man who is also handy with a sword. Omar Shariff has a small role at the beginning. Why this film tanked, I do not know. Was it the odd title? Lack of promotion and marketing? One can only guess. It also has been compared plot-wise to ancient epics like Beowulf, and borrows from Greek mythology, as the head Viking must confront the cannibals' Medusa-like queen in her underground lair. She is frightening as all hell, and the confrontation scene may remind some of the confrontation scene between Perseus and Medusa in Ray Harryhausen's Clash of the Titans.",8,1,1,4 February 2013
Just Go with It," Fuin for all
","Well now, my review hath disappeared. Let's give it another shot, shall we? Adam Sandler plays a surgeon who flies to Hawaii accompanied by his assistant (Aniston), whom he asks to pose as his ex-wife. Don't ask. Ultimately, he plans to marry his girlfriend (Decker), who is 20 years his junior. While in Hawaii, Aniston runs across an old college foe, the haughty (and barely recognizable) Nicole Kidman, and pretends to be married to Sandler to tweak her rival. Complications obviously ensue. Lots of funny bits, including an hysterical hula contest that turns into a showdown between Aniston and Kidman. We have to pretend that Aniston isn't the most attractive woman on Earth, as her character here is divorced and has two children. She and Sandler have wonderful chemistry, I might add. And the ending is a hoot. Good movie for grownups, which is rare these days.",7,1,4,3 April 2012
The Expendables," Great action scenes, not much else
","Sly Stallone and his merry band of mercenaries (including Jet Li and Jason Statham) take on an assignment involving an island run by a dictatorial general and a CIA renegade (Eric Roberts). For various reasons, Stallone decides not to pursue the assignment after visiting the island, but circumstances (like his attempted assassination) find him and his hale fellows returning to the island to turn an army of bad guys into yesterday's guacamole. We are able to buy a visibly aged Stallone in the lead the same way we went along with old John Wayne and old Clint Eastwood. Statham actually seems to have the lion's share of screen time, and that's fine as the man is definitely in his prime. Li gets to show his stuff as well, and serves as the movie's comic relief. Dolph Lundgren and the others are essentially doing cameos, and that's just fine with me as too many cooks most assuredly can spoil the broth. The plot is a bit creaky and drags between the action scenes, but those action scenes are marvelous and right out of the golden age of action flicks, namely the 1980s. The only thing bothering me was watching Stallone on various talk shows promoting the film and claiming he had a very modest budget to work with. The actual budget: $80,000,000. That ain't exactly chicken soup.",6,0,4,29 November 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Death marches on
","Do not let the title fool you: this Spanish import is not a traditional fantasy like LABRYNTH, WILLOW or LEGEND. Instead, it is a dark and extremely unpleasant look back at war-ravaged Spain in the 1940s. The young daughter of a brutish army officer begins to imagine herself in a dark realm, in order to escape real life. In her fantasy, she has to achieve a certain number of goals to be crowned queen of this bizarre realm. Meanwhile, the war rages on and her father kills virtually everyone in sight, sometimes sadistically. PAN has overtones of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, if Alice were on acid. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, but it is pretty easy to follow. The CGI is mind-boggling, but the story is so death-obsessed, it doesn't really matter in the end. PAN is a nihilistic effort that goes much too far to present the horrors of war and the savagery of men. Approach with extreme caution, and no child under 13 should view this. It may be considered a masterpiece by the art-house crowd, but it is not a mainstream film.",6,4,10,14 September 2009
Final Destination 2," Smashing and bashing
","The makers of FD obviously realized they had a great gimmick on their hands, so along came FD 2 with its spectacular opening scene involving a multiple car pileup on the interstate. The rest of the movie is just more deaths, done in various clever ways. One, involving a boy and a piece of plate glass, is the film's best killing. Ali Larter is back from the first movie, as that film's sole survivor. While she has little to do, her presence allows for a direct connection to the first film. The main reason for seeing this movie is the car pileup. It is amazing, and I haven't the slightest idea how they filmed some of it, other than to assume it must have taken a week to shoot. Gorehounds may enjoy some of the killings in this bloody flick, but it doesn't begin to approach the SAW series for true gore. It is more in keeping with THE OMEN in that sense. Recommended primarily for the opening scene.",6,1,1,7 September 2009
Knocked Up," OK comedy drama
","Rogen and Heigl meet in a club and have a one-night stand. Several weeks later, she's preggers. The two, an extremely unlikely pair (he's a fat slacker and she;s a rising business exec) decide to see things through as a couple. It's all pretty much downhill from there. A romantic comedy with dramatic overtones. The only way to accept Heigl sleeping with Rogen is that she is dead drunk at the time, of course. Solid supporting cast keeps this clichéd plot moving along. Otherwise, I guarantee you've seen the story many times before. A sidenote: I have watched the movie more than once and wondered why Heigl's character simply did not get an abortion. In real life, that's how it's done by a woman her age and station in life. But that's just me.",6,0,0,22 July 2012
Shutter Island," Air of mystery
","SHUTTER ISLAND is based on a novel by popular mystery writer Dennis Lehane, who likes to add a gimmick or twist to many of his novels. SHUTTER ISLAND is no exception, and in fact contains several twists. Leo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal in the 1950s looking into the disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island near Boston. Once on the island, the marshal finds he can trust no one -- not the psychiatrists, played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow, and certainly not any of the staff. He also finds he cannot even trust his new partner (played by the affable Mark Ruffalo) who at one point warns him they could become permanent residents of the island if they don't watch out. To make matters worse, the marshal is subject to hallucinations. He sees his wife, who is dead. at every turn and has frequent flashbacks to his time in the military, liberating Dachau. Then a hurricane hits the island and the power goes out. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is a psychological thriller with horror movie overtones. While on the long side, it moves at a decent pace and the special effects are first-rate. Your tolerance for this surreal and ultimately downbeat movie will largely depend on your tolerance for DiCaprio, (he is fine here, although I would have preferred Brad Pitt in the role), and the almost comical shenanigans going on in the spooky old asylum. And be warned: The movie gets pretty nasty, which Scorsese movies tend to. For those confused or disappointed by the ending, read the book. The book's ending is cut-and-dried, leaving no question as to what transpired. The movie's ending is left open to interpretation, which is certainly the director's and/or screenwriter's right.",7,2,6,20 February 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," OK heist flick
","While I have watched just about every heist movie ever made, I have to admit now that I am no longer a professional film reviewer that I was never crazy about the genre. There are exceptions of course, but in general, I get bored watching such films, as they all have similar plots. For those who got a kick out of OCEANS 11, I suspect this second sequel will tickle your fancy, if you can follow it. I watched it much too casually, and kept getting lost. For the record, Clooney and crew are on the vengeance trail against casino owner Pacino, who screwed over one of their own (Gould). I was quite happy to see veterans Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner still in on the action. Keep an eye on Damon in this one. For my money, he -- not Pacino -- steals the show.",7,0,2,16 January 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Antiwar classic
","What a cast, what a story, what a director. This two-part antiwar saga follows Marine recruits through basic training and then takes some of them to Vietnam in 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive. Matthew Modine narrates this gripping tale as a recruit who becomes a war correspondent journalist for the military. There' isn't anything here we haven't seen before, but Kubrick puts his own unique spin on things. I have always preferred the training portion of the movie to the combat portion, but that's me. I have seen equally good if not better war scenes in a dozen other war movies. The highlight of the training segment is the interaction between drill sergeant Lee Ermey and fumbling recruit Vincent D'Onofrio, which ends in unspeakable tragedy. Once seen, it can never be forgotten.",8,0,1,31 March 2012
Gone Baby Gone," Babysitting
","Well, my original review has disappeared. So be it. GONE tells the tale of a missing 4 year old and a private eye's desperate search to find her. The trouble is, the mom is a sleazeball who doesn't deserve the kid back. Directed by Ben Affleck, GONE is atmospheric and stars his baby brother Casey, who does a decent, DiCaprio-type turn as the detective. The film is full of great supporting players, including Michelle Monaghan as the private eye's girlfriend and partner. Other familiar faces include Morgan Freeman, John Ashton and Ed Harris. The movie follows the Dennis Lehane novel quite closely, right to the downbeat conclusion. Well worth a look, although those expecting another MYSTIC RIVER may be slightly disappointed. I was not.",8,0,0,7 November 2010
Predator," Ugly mutha!
","Like ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2, PREDATOR is a timeless sci-fi action classic. Made in 1987, it hasn't aged one bit. Ah-nuld leads a team of commandos into a dense Latin America jungle on a mission that soon has them being hunted by an alien armed to the teeth and with the ability to make himself virtually invisible. One by one, Ah-nuld's boys are picked off until it's down to Ah-nuld versus the creature. We get no explanation as to why the creature is on Earth, nor does it really matter. We know through Ah-nuld's actions later in the film that the thing clearly is on the hunt for armed warriors as a test of its prowess, obviously a rite of passage where this thing comes from. Great overacting by the entire cast, especially Jesse 'I ain't got time to bleed' Venture, great location photography and great music. It must have been very expensive to make, and no 'Predator' flick since has come close in terms of production quality and tension and thrills -- no matter how much any of the many sequels cost to make. Special mention should be made of the actor, now deceased, who played the Predator, Kevin Peter Hall (who also plays the chopper pilot). Done up in tons of makeup and loads of costuming, he nevertheless manages to give the creature real personality. One of director McTiernan's best films.",8,0,0,25 September 2010
The Thing," Monster masterpiece
","This is probably my third review here of this Carpenter classic. An American scientific expedition in the Antarctic is laid siege by a shape-shifting alien, and no one is able to stop it. Kurt Russell stars as the expedition's bearded, quirky pilot. Shot in Canada, the movie is stark and shocking at times, and the creature effects -- prosthetics, the forerunner to CGI -- are simply amazing. They look great to this day. The opening is haunting: a sled dog is pursued across frozen terrain by a gun-toting helicopter crew from a Norwegian camp. The dog reaches the American camp, and it soon becomes apparent this is no ordinary dog. It is an alien in disguise, which the Norwegians inadvertently released from its 30,000 year old frozen slumber. Carpenter respectfully pays homage to the 1951 Howard Hawks version, but takes his remake to levels Hawks could only have dreamed of. Great supporting cast, including Wilfred Brimley and Keith David. For those unfamiliar with the source material, it is a short story called 'Who Goes There?' Carpenter's version is much closer than Hawks' to this Cold War tale. Hawks' version is essentially the Frankenstein monster loose in the Antarctic. The remake is notable for its all-male cast and sense of claustrophobia and impending doom.",8,1,2,27 October 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," Eat them up
","Sick remake of old cult horror classic about a family stranded in the desert, at war with a family of bizarre killers. The gore quotient is satisfying, and the production values are first-rate. Shot in Morocco, of all places. Ted Levine of MONK fame plays the dad, and the cast is peppered with several other familiar faces. The only problem with this remake, we've seen this story played out in so many movies over the years, most recently WRONG TURN and, to a lesser extent, the remake of HOUSE OF WAX. So it becomes more difficult to offer up something new or different by way of shock or scares. The final battle between human and a really ugly, really big bad boy is a winner, however.",6,1,3,3 November 2009
Knowing," Wig on
","Gee, who can we get to do a supernatural thriller who hasn't already done one? After all, Bruce Willis did 'The Sixth Sense,' Harrison Ford did 'What Lies Beneath,' Richard Gere did 'The Mothman Prophecies,' Kevin Bacon did 'A Stir of Echoes,' Denzel Washington did 'Fallen,' Ah-nuld did 'End of Days,' Dennis Quaid did 'Legion,' Michael Keaton did 'White Noise' and Kevin Costner did 'Dragonfly.' Why, there's Nic Cage, of course! Heck, he's tried just about everything else , including a video game movie and that sci-fi flick where his character can see the future. In this case, we'll put him in a real potboiler, a cross between 'The Mothman Prophecies' and 'Close Encounters,' with a little of 'The Forgotten' mixed in for good measure. Cage comes across a piece of paper his son has been given from a 50-year-old time capsule. The sheet has numbers on it that, viewed one way, predict certain disasters. Meanwhile, his young son starts getting visits from some creepy, Men in Black-type guys who could be angels, devils or possibly even aliens. The script is incredibly flimsy, and the disasters depicted are your typical crappy CGI, to boot. Cage sleepwalks through the whole thing. But it's always fun to see what wig he's wearing.",5,0,2,2 April 2011
American Beauty," Wow!
","Watching this film 11 years later, I am reminded that it was quite probably the best film of 1999. And while it is an utter downer, it is impossible to stop watching. Kevin Spacey is a middle-aged husband father who's had enough of his crappy job, his offbeat daughter (Thora Birch) and harridan of a wife (Annette Benning). He becomes smitten with his daughter's best friend (Mina Suvari) and starts buying dope from the new kid next door (Wes Bentley). He quits his job and goes to work at a fast food eatery as a fry cook. Meanwhile, his wife, a real estate agent with serious emotional issues, takes up with a competing real estate guru (Peter Gallagher). The daughter hooks up with the dope dealing boy next door. The dope dealing boy's dad (Chris Cooper) is a military veteran and mental case who abuses his family. And so it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut used to write. Everybody is absolutely magnificent, the script sizzles and the camera-work is outstanding. Considering that all but two of the characters are headed for a big fall, it's amazing how captivating this film is. At times, it takes on a surreal quality. A must-see for adults.",8,0,1,8 May 2010
Disturbia," Keep an eye on Morse
","DISTURBIA is a youth-oriented version of Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW. We have already had two youth-oriented versions of REAR WINDOW, namely FRIGHT NIGHT and MIMIC 3. But so be it. A good plot never wears thin. Shia L. plays a kid under house arrest with little to keep him occupied. So he starts spying on his neighbors, one of whom, played by David Morse of CONTACT and HACK fame, may be a serial killer. At least, Shia's character thinks so. He enlists the aid of a pretty newcomer to the neighborhood (Sarah Roehmer) and one of his school buddies (Aaron Yu) to try and trip the guy up. Morse is appropriately sinister and menacing. Shia does his best with a role that largely confines him to one room. This PG-13 film has its moments, and will best appeal to a young crowd. Adults, beware.",6,1,3,7 September 2009
Resident Evil," Watch that laser!
","Who knew Paul Anderson had it in him? Well, the fact is, while by no means a great director, he can certainly create mood and atmosphere, as witness EVENT HORIZON. This adaptation of a popular video game has mood and atmosphere to spare, as a top-secret lab experiment goes haywire and soldiers are sent in to deal with the aftermath. Everybody's favorite Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich, is the heroine of the piece, and is surrounded by a cast of mostly unknown actors evidently from many different countries based on their potpourri of accents (the film was shot overseas). Probably the best video game-derived movie to date, as befits one the best video games ever made.",7,1,2,27 October 2009
No Country for Old Men," It's the Coen brothers
","In 1980, a Texan out hunting (Josh Brolin, looking eerily like his old man) stumbles across a large cache of drugs and $2 million in cash -- and several dead bodies, and impulsively decides to keep the money. He is on the run from that moment, pursued by a hired gun (Javier Bardem, who even with a Beatles-type haircut is scary as hell). A sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who has already had one run-in with the hired killer, is slowly figuring out what is going on. The film is a little on the long side, and requires patience as it is not told in the straightforward manner we are used to with most movies. In fact, at times it's downright weird, sort of like a David Lynch movie. That's because it is a Coen brothers flick, and these are the folks who gave us BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA. Based on a novel, this will best appeal to fans of Coen brothers' movies and lovers of violence and gore. And there's plenty of that to go around. It certainly is several notches above the awful THERE WILL BE BLOOD, which came out around the same time. Woody Harrelson has a small but significant role as a freelance 'problem solver' who is sent to dispatch the hired killer and retrieve the money. The movie is heavily focused on Brolin and Bardem, and they are both outstanding here.",7,0,1,29 July 2009
District 9," Wow!
","Shot partly in documentary fashion, this sci-fi epic tells the story of an alien ghetto that is being emptied by the government. It plays out like the Nazis invading the Warsaw ghetto. Set in modern-day South Africa, the alien ghetto has been in place for nearly 30 years, following the arrival on Earth of a disabled space ship. The aliens are truly frightening to behold, but (not surprisingly) they prove more human than the humans seeking to eradicate them, like so many American Indians. One individual caught up in the eviction process becomes part-alien (see the movie) and ends up fighting on the side of the aliens ('Avatar,' anyone?) when the eviction procedure turns into a massacre. A one of a kind movie, highly believable and with some of the best CGI I have seen 'Starship Troopers.' A must-see, but for adults only. Plot bears some resemblance to 'Alien Nation.'",8,2,9,2 April 2011
Meet the Fockers," Formula comedy
","Yet another sequel that should never have been made, FOCKERS has Teri Polo's parents (DeNiro and Danner) driving to Florida to meet and spend time with Ben Stiller's parents (Hoffman and Streisand). Polo's parents bring along a young grandson who serves as the Cheetah (Tarzan's comic relief) in this fairly lame movie. Whole bits from the original are reused here, but they're not as funny the second time around. The novelty here is having Hoffman and DeNiro appear together -- and for the most ardent movie buffs, they will spot Pacino in a very brief scene. The three great ethnic actors of the 20th century in one movie! The vulgar jokes pile up pretty quickly, most of which aren't particularly funny. Ah well, none of this matters as the movie made a fortune. It's a formula comedy.",5,0,0,12 December 2011
Hellboy," A fun comic book movie
","Hellboy works on a number of levels: as a pure action film, as a fun comic book adaptation, and even as a decent character study. That's because Ron Perlman, best known for the TV series Beauty and the Beast, completely inhabits his character, a red-skinned half-demon who grows up in the care of the U.S. government and helps hunt down bad guys and monsters of all stripes. Perlman is very human behind his alarming makeup, and gets to wisecrack in a way that works far better than it has in other comic book-oriented films. He also is surrounded by a first-rate cast, including John Hurt as a kindly professor/mentor and Selma Blair as Hellboy's psy-powered love interest. For those who don't care a whit about comic book movies, watch it just for the subway scene. And I must say the CGI is some of the best I have seen since STARSHIP TROOPERS.",8,0,0,9 September 2009
Good Will Hunting," Perfect movie
","Watching HUNTING again 13 years later, I still find it a terrific effort, especially since it was written by the then-very young Damon and Affleck. A janitor (Damon) at MIT is a math whiz with serious emotional problems. A once-prominent shrink (Williams) with problems of his own is brought in to deal with the kid. Meanwhile, romance is blossoming between the janitor and a high-spirited Harvard pre-med student (Driver). The janitor's pals, a bunch of blue collar types led by Affleck, are uneasy with what's happening but always stand by this shy Einsteinian genius. Not a single false note is struck in this intense adult drama, which was well deserving its R rating for salty language and refusing to pull any punches. It was easy to see Damon would be going places, although I am not sure I could have predicted he would become become a 21st century action star. And of course his writing partner and buddy Affleck went on to greater glory in PHANTOMS.",8,1,4,4 October 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not the FF4 I grew up with
","I sure as heck would not plan a third installment of the FF4 after this lame, tame sequel aimed at children. The FF4 have sent Dr. Doom packing and now must deal with Galactus, a force that aims to suck Earth dry. Galactus sends ahead his creation, the Silver Surfer, to get things rolling, only to run afoul of the FF4. The special effects are solid, but characterization is weak -- something the Spider-Man movies excel at. Plus Jessica Alba remains a poor choice to play Sue Storm. She just doesn't have the acting chops, and the bleached hair, or wig, is awful. The Silver Surfer is all CGI and really isn't given much to do. Also, the Thing is still missing his prominent brow, making him look clownish. At least they got the costumes right, unlike the X-Men costumes. Skip this one.",5,1,4,30 April 2012
Event Horizon," A blast
","As the years roll by, EVENT HORIZON keeps looking better and better, much like the initially maligned BLADE RUNNER and JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING. A rescue ship arrives near Jupiter to find a long-missing research vessel empty, the crew nowhere to be found. But is Event Horizon really empty? Turns out it's haunted, after going into another dimension and returning not quite right. The rescue crew gets picked off one by one by unseen forces. A great cast and terrific set design keep this baby moving along to its shocking conclusion. A variation on SOLARIS and every haunted ocean vessel movie, EVENT HORIZON is a Halloween-oriented masterpiece of scares and thrills. The second half flags a bit, but the first half is about as scary a cinematic ride as you're likely to take in this lifetime. Paul Anderson definitely came up with a winner here, and the movie was clearly ahead of its time when first released -- just like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING. The ending is open to interpretation, which actually works in its favor. This movie will grow on you with repeated viewings. In 1994, Sam Neil had starred in JOHN CARPENTER'S IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, which makes an excellent companion piece to EVENT HORIZON. Both feature Lovecraftian 'lurking at the door' themes.",8,0,1,1 September 2009
Mulholland Drive," What's in that box?
","Read Brandt Sponseller's excellent review elsewhere here for some insight into this flawed TV movie. Yes, MULHOLLAND DRIVE was indeed a TV movie that was later expanded for a brief theatrical run. It is surreal to say the least, and as far as I can tell, it is Canadian director David Lynch's acerbic take on Hollywood and the creatures that inhabit it. Naomi Watts stars as a Hollywood-bound miss who goes to stay at an aunt's apartment, only to find a mysterious woman holed up there. The woman has amnesia, and the two try to figure out who's who and what's what. They also have a very nicely done love scene, which is one of the few reasons for seeing this sometimes nutty and disjointed flick. The other big reason for catching it is for the 'Silencio' sequence,which takes place in a theater at a bizarre hour and where nothing is what it seems. The story, such as it is, is part murder mystery as well as a knock at the vapid Hollywood lifestyle. It is not told in linear fashion, and there's an awful lot of symbolism to mess with your mind. I'd say stick with BLUE VELVET, Lynch's superb reworking of a classic noir plot.",6,0,1,22 June 2010
Clash of the Titans," A couple of issues
","I no longer post messages on IMDb because of some bizarre process they make you undergo, but I still write reviews. I have read criticisms of the COTT remake for having way too much and very poor CGI. I would say this was readily evident from the trailer. Also, I read a posting where the writer complained about how quickly the Kraken was turned into stone. Well, if you go back to the original version, the Kraken (which was much more majestic-looking than the Kraken in the remake)) is also rather quickly turned into stone, almost as if animator Ray Harryhausen was in a rush to wrap things up. He delays the big moment for a few seconds by having the beast swat Perseus and Pegasus into the ocean, but they bounce right back and quickly take care of business. I have no plans to see the remake, as I am too old for such nonsense (and the truth is, the original movie was nothing to write home about, as Harryhausen was well past his prime). But I would be curious to see the new Medusa. Harryhausen's Medusa was truly frightening and the highlight of the original movie.",Null,0,1,4 April 2010
Friends with Benefits," Just OK
","Aimed squarely at the 14-30 year old crowd, BENEFITS has two young professionals becoming friends and then sexual partners, the idea being that they will not become emotionally attached. They will not be the conventional boyfriend and girlfriend as played out in the movies they love to mock. This sort of relationship is common enough in real life -- all one has to do is watch Divorce Court. But for purposes of this fantasy, we accept the situation as out of the norm. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are the leads, and Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Pat Clarkson are on hand for support. Veteran character actor Richard Jenkins plays Timerlake's dad who is slowly slipping into dementia. The sex scenes are tame for an R-rated flick, and played strictly for laughs. They are in no way erotic, for you worried parents out there. Also, for most of the movie, Kunis doesn't look all that appealing. Her makeup and hair are all wrong until the closing scenes, when she finally looks like the attractive actress we know.Perhaps this was done on purpose. I suspect it was.",6,0,1,2 April 2012
Taken," Give them heck
","Preparing to see Mel Gibson's latest flick, which draws plot elements from 2008's TAKEN, got me thinking again about TAKEN. Liam Neeson, who is not the first person one thinks of as an action hero, plays an aging CIA spook whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing overseas. Neeson immediately takes off after the bad guys and eliminates them one by one during his search. The movie is satisfyingly violent, although it was inexplicably trimmed for American audiences (go to youtube for a much grittier and more satisfying version of the electric shock interrogation scene). The fights are simply amazing, and Neeson looks pretty damn agile for an old hoss. He also gets to beat up on bad guys of several different ethnicities, including our pals from the Middle East. I hope the Gibson flick is half as good. It is rated R, and one can only hope it will be a hard R. If you see TAKEN, try to catch the European version.",8,1,2,25 January 2010
Avatar," Stick with FERNGULLY
","Derivative sci-fi epic that is unbearably long for what it is and more of a cartoon than a bona fide movie. Borrows heavily from the old cartoon FERNGULLY and various Miyazaki cartoons. Plus Cameron filches from his own ALIENS and just about every Western ever made. Worse, it sends the wrong message to its primary audience, which consists of the very young and the impressionable of all ages. Basic plot: A crew of scientists and Marines is digging for a rare element (archly called 'unobtanium') on an alien planet. The indigenous population consists of 'large blue monkeys,' which stand in for the American Indian here. These blue aborigines stand in the way of the mining. Guess where this is going. In case we don't immediately get the connection with the American Indian, Casmeron has the so-called blue monkeys living in harmony with and endlessly preaching about all living things, both fauna and flora. They ride their semi-horses bareback and fly on the backs of semi-dragons and communicate directly with the earth. They laugh and love and sing and dance -- they even engage in a MATRIX-style rave near the end. I almost expected Larry Fishburne to show up. This whole business gets embarrassing and tired very quickly, and yet it drags on and on. Worse yet, a Marine assigned to infiltrate the natives (don't ask how) himself goes native, and betrays his own people. Cameron makes this a good thing. Military bad, natives good. Ugh. It all comes to a head with an improbable, pretty graphic battle that should not have been in a kiddie flick. This movie is almost three hours long! It easily surpasses the dreadful A.I. for false endings. And like SPIDERMAN, if you were to remove most of the CGI crap and stay focused on the live action, you'd probably have a better movie for it. At least you'd have some sort of a movie, although I also must confess I was less than impressed by the film's leading man, the very bland Sam Worthington, who also narrates the damned thing. And again, no matter what one might do to this film, cut it or recast it, its message is about as left-leaning and tree-hugging as you can get. It is pure self-indulgence on Cameron's part, much like THE ABYSS, one of those it's-like-watching-a-train-wreck epics. God, I so wanted all those 'blue monkeys' wiped off the face of the planet within the first five minutes of their appearance, I knew I had been duped that quickly. I am giving AVATAR a 4 instead of a 1 or 2 because of its box office take. Movie-making is a business, after all, and I used to be a professional film critic. You have to figure that there's an awful lot of impressionable people out there who were eager to be parted from their money. They all voted for Obama, too.",4,3,7,25 July 2010
Drag Me to Hell," No 'Evil Dead'
","The first time I saw this, I thought I was watching a Wes Craven film, and that's not meant as a compliment. Craven hasn't made a decent film in 20 years. Imagine my shock and horror when I finally discovered this is a Sam Raimi film. Obviously, Raimi is off his game by a wide margin here. A loan officer played by Alison Lohman ends up under a curse placed on her by an old crone, and the rest of the film details the spirit of the now-deceased crone haunting the young banker. Most of the scares come from loud noises, musical cues and scary faces. If such things are enough to scare you, you will probably enjoy this. Personally, I think Raimi intended it to be a comedy, as witnessed by the incredibly loopy seance, which by the way is right out of Raimi's 'Evil Dead.' I like Alison Lohman; she's sort of the clean-cut version of Lindsay Lohan. And I like Justin Long, if for no other reason than he is from my home state and grew up near me. Also, he did a bang-up job years ago in 'Jeepers Creepers' (he was sadly missed in the sequel) and 'Galaxy Quest.' The two actors play well together, but they can't save this uneven mess. Watch it at your peril.",Null,0,1,1 November 2011
Up," It's Pixar
","Pixar's UP is about a widower who decides to fly his house to a falls in Venezuela in memory of his late wife. To do this, he ties helium-filled balloons to the house, and off he goes. Joining him on his crazy adventure is a neighborhood kid, and along the way they pick up a talking dog and a rare jungle bird being hunted by a crazed explorer who gets around in a dirigible. This is some nutty plot, but it works. The animation is superb, the story line quite touching. Ed Asner plays the widower and Chris Plummer is the bad guy. Highly recommended, mainly for kids and their moms. I suspect most dads mayl have a tough time sitting through this whimsical flick.",8,0,0,29 November 2009
The Departed," Great stuff
","It was nice to see 'The Departed' again today after a long absence. Basic plot: Leo D. plays a Massahusets state cop who goes undercover to ferret out murderous mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson with a hairdo crazier than in The Shining). Back at police HQ, Matt Damon as a detective in Costello's pay helps keep Costello one jump ahead of the cops at all times. Damon also is trying to figure out which of Costello's minions is an undercover cop. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Badlwin all have substantial parts in this gritty and very violent crime drama, loosely based on a real gangster of the period (and who has since surfaced after going into hiding decades ago). This is a white knuckle and sometime depressing drama with typical Scorsese flourishes throughout. Which means if you like Scorsese, you'll like this picture.",Null,0,0,9 October 2011
30 Days of Night," Nasty and scary
","30 DAYS is the best vampire flick since K. Bigelow's classic NEAR DARK. A roving band of eastern European vampires hits a small Alaskan town and quickly slaughters most of its inhabitants. Then the group begins to hunt down the few survivors. The vampires are extremely bloodthirsty, animal-like creatures, relentless and absolutely heartless in their search for blood. Josh Hartnett plays the town's sheriff who tries to save a handful of town folk and figure a way to defeat the creatures. Veteran character actor Danny Huston is the vampire group's very scary leader, and another character actor, Ben Foster, plays a man on the run from the vampires. In fact, the opening sequence of Foster hightailing it through the snowy wilderness is reminiscent of the opening scene of John Carpenter's THE THING, where the sled dog is on the run across the frozen Antarctic tundra from the desperate Norwegians. 30 DAYS is extremely atmospheric, gory without being over the top, and truly frightening. The entire film takes place in shadows and darkness, as the sun has set for 30 days, hence the title. Much has been made of the overhead shots of the initial carnage, and rightly so. Choreographing it must have been akin to staging a small war. In the end, the film goes on a bit too long, and lifts its ending from one of the BLADE flicks, but not to worry. You are guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat during this one.",7,0,2,12 July 2009
The Wrestler," Adult drama
","Extremely downbeat adult drama about an over-the-hill pro wrestler who tries to come to terms with himself after suffering a heart attack. He attempts to reconcile with his only child, takes a job in a grocery store and woos a stripper. Mickey Rourke as the titular character essentially plays Mickey Rourke, a 'bum' who is struggling to survive after decades of abusive behavior. Marisa Tomei plays the stripper, a character virtually identical to a character she played in a 1990s flick with Christian Slater as a man dying from a heart defect. The film is awfully graphic at times, and depressing just about all of the time. For reasons best known to Rourke and/or the director, this old-time wrestling champ has hair hanging down his back. Most old-time wrestlers are bald, balding or sport very short hair. His hair tends to distract.",7,0,0,22 November 2010
Shooter," Formulaic action flick
","Formulaic action picture is saved by a couple of outstanding action sequences, one of them occurring at the film's opening and the other about two thirds of the way through. Mark Wahlberg plays a retired CIA sniper who is coaxed back into duty when it appears the president is being targeted for assassination. But it turns out to be a setup involving an entirely different target, and Wahlberg is meant to be the fall guy. Except he doesn't fall down for anybody, and soon is on the comeback trail. You'll smell the setup and the bad guys right away, and the film draws to a predictable, by-the-number conclusion. The battle scene that kicks off the movie and a later, massive firefight help keep this B-flick from being a complete disaster. Wahlberg is OK, although I would have preferred someone like Matt Damon in the lead, except I doubt the film was budgeted for someone of Damon's stature. Danny Glover and Ned Beatty costar, more or less, and their age is showing. I suspect most of the money for this one went into those two heart-stopping action sequences.",7,0,0,22 July 2009
The Good Shepherd," Dry spy
","For realistic spy film lovers, SHEPHERD delivers. For James Bond-style film fans, it likely will be a colossal bore. Matt Damon is career CIA agent in the early days of the agency. The film plays out like a Graham Greene story, as we follow Damon through the years, with the story not always being told in linear fashion. The director (DeNiro) has surrounded Damon with several big-name stars including Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie and DeNiro himself. Damon is fine, but the film goes on too long. And again, it will appeal mainly to a certain audience segment, the kind that cherishes a film like THE THIRD MAN or THGE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. All others, beware. I sat through most of this purposefully dry espionage epic and gave it a decent rating, although I will admit I am more of a Jason Bourne film fan.",7,1,3,18 April 2010
The Terminal," Amazing
","A charming throwback to the Frank Capra era of filmmaking. Tom Hanks plays an eastern European come to visit New York only to find himself detained at the airport's international terminal as his country's government is toppled by civil war and he has lost his citizenship. He lives in the terminal, and finds various ways to feed himself. He speaks some English and eventually learns more by studying magazines and watching television. He also makes friends with various airport characters, including a janitor and a stewardess. The plot is based on a true incident that I suspect was much less charming and endearing in real life. The script is pure, delicious fantasy. Hanks is brilliant and thoroughly believable as the baffled but resourceful immigrant while Stanley Tucci as the airport's security chief does wonders with what could easily have been a one-dimensional role. Director Spielberg no doubt played a role in keeping everything on track. Highly recommended, especially to those who loved the not-dissimilar 'Moscow on the Hudson' with Robin Williams. By the way, the sets are absolutely amazing. I assumed the movie was filmed in a real airport terminal until I read here that the whole thing was shot on sets built in an old hangar.",8,1,3,3 July 2011
Music and Lyrics," Yeesh
","Yikes! What were Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore thinking when they signed on for this junk? Well, in Grant's case, he's lucky to get any roles these days, and I suppose Barrymore is always going to appear in fluff. Her name probably still has some marquee value as well. A washed-up '80s pop singer (Grant) is asked to write a song for a Britney-type pop star. Problem is, he only writes melodies, no lyrics. Along comes Drew B. as a cute-as-s-button fill-in greenskeeper who comes up with catchy lyrics on the spot. What a team they make! Things eventually go awry, of course, and we eventually crawl our way to a thoroughly predictable and cringe-inducing reconciliation ending. It's a chick flick, guys!

Never Back Down," Nothing new here
","A teen is new in town, goes to high school and ends up having to fight bare-fisted. He finds a guy who helps him improve his fighting technique before the big showdown with the school bully. And that's about all she wrote for this low-budget teen drama, which liberally borrows from THE KARATE KID, THREE O'CLOCK HIGH and even FIGHT CLUB. Sean Farris, who you may recognize from several other youth-oriented flicks, plays the new kid in town and Dimoin. Hounsou is his trainer. If nothing else, Farris is a solid young actor who is likely to go on to better things. Honsou, who has appeared in much better films, appears to be slumming here. Hey, it's a paycheck!",6,0,0,23 July 2009
Vanilla Sky," Huge disappointment
","Remake of a foreign film, VS is the story of a publisher who has a bad car accident and wakes up to a severely altered reality. The remake is a vehicle for Cruise, who is shown in loving closeup through a large part of the movie. His character stumbles through this altered reality, meeting a beautiful Spanish woman (Cruze) and a sympathetic police psychologist (Russell). He also encounters a strange little man who tries to coax him back into reality. Cruise has always been an acquired taste at best, much like Nic Cage and Keanu Reeves, so your tolerance for this uninspired remake will depend on your affinity for Cruise. What makes the film a bitter disappointment is the last 20 minutes, in which everything that has happened to the bewildered publisher is spelled out in excruciating detail by the strange little man, whose real name is Tech Support (are you starting to get it?). At this point, the film sharply veers away from surreal fantasy into pure sci-fi, and unfortunately its twist ending has been used many times before, sometimes successfully (as in STAY) and more often not. Cruise is simply hammy beyond belief here. If you want to see Cruise actually act, check out the ensemble flick he did several years ago in which he played a horndog motivational speaker. Now, that's acting!",4,1,2,11 November 2012
Iron Man," Get your armor suit on
","Much like SPIDER MAN, IRON MAn is at its best when the characters are not in costume. While Robert Downey is not my idea of Tony Stark, he is at least his usual charming self and entertaining whenever he's on-screen. The problem comes whenever he dons the armor suit: it's cartoony and not terribly convincing. The CGI is like something from a video game, and I suppose that's what this movie is targeting: young white males who spend half their lives playing video games and seeking their connection to the big screen. I also am not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she gives it her best as Pepper Potts, Tony's perky and devoted secretary. This is simply not a film for adults, but then again, what comic book-derived movie is? The character of Iron Man actually is at his best in those endless Marvel Comics cartoons made for TV.",6,1,4,22 January 2011
Casino," About as good as it gets
","I can't believe I've never reviewed this classic, but that's probably because it is a classic and therefore hard to do it justice in writing. Scorsese gives us an intimate look at 1970s' Las Vegas, when the mob ruled, and courtesy of Pillegi's novel. The plot centers on two childhood pals (DeNiro and Pesci), both 'connected' and shipped out to Vegas. DeNiro's charismatic character Ace Rothstein runs a casino and hotel, while Pesci's strong-arm thug Nicky Santoro delights in causing old-fashioned mayhem. The difference in their approaches to Sin City will eventually cause them to be at odds with one another. Sharon Stone plays a grifter and prostitute whom DeNiro's character marries, to his eternal dismay, as she cannot shake her old ways. An almost unrecognizable James Woods plays her loser boyfriend. Everyone is at the height of their careers here. The dialogue is sharp, the editing first-rate, the vistas of a now-vanished version of Vegas truly astounding. There are moments when the dialogue is clearly being improvised, which gives the film a more natural feel -- even though I normally associate improvised dialogue with inexpensive indies, not a major Hollywood production. Along with Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' and Mann's 'Heat,' a must-see.",9,1,3,13 July 2012
Pineapple Express," Striclty for potheads
","I'm not sure why films like this continue to be made in the new century, but so be it. PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is a very thin comedy about two loser potheads (Rogen and Franco, looking like River Phoenix) who get cross paths with killer cops, numerous gangsters -- and murder. They keep trying to escape but never manage to get completely away. In the end, they turn into a LETHAL WEAPON-style team, and not always for laughs. Some really violent deaths occur, but they are mostly over-the-top deaths. This would have been a Cheech and Chong film back in the 1970s. Not my cup of tea, but a best bet for all the stoners out there. Rogen, who I have heard of but am not familiar with, has a voice identical to Penn Gillette and looks like a young John Goodman. Franco is virtually unrecognizable with hippie hair and a scraggly beard.",6,8,16,18 July 2009
A Walk to Remember," Tear jerker supreme
","This is my personal favorite among the 917 dying people movies made by Hollywood. Based on a novel by Nicholas 'The Notebook' Sparks, it tells the story of two very different high school seniors, a boy without purpose (West) and a plain jane minister's daughter who is full of ideas and ambition (Moore). Their star-crossed romance transforms everybody, from the boy's snotty friends to the gal's uptight dad. You've seen it all before, but it is beautifully played by the two young leads and worth a look, especially if you like dying people pictures. I cry my eyes out every time I watch it, and I am a grumpy old heterosexual man. Whatever sins Miss Moore may have committee in her life, I will always forgive her for her heartfelt and restrained performance here.",7,1,1,4 January 2013
