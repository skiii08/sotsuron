Blade Runner 2049," A disappointing overlong movie
","In 1982 when Blade Runner came out I gave it a 7. How things have changed. Looking at it again today I had to downgrade it to 5. It is oh so boring!Then I watched Blade Runner 2049 and I was hopeful that this would make more sense. Oh my gosh, almost as boring, but making more sense, but even more overlong, getting close to 3 hours. Why this movie is made out to be top notch sci-fi will remain a mystery and beyond me. Movies are supposed to be entertaining and joyful to watch, but neither Blade Runner fits the bill.I was drawn to watch Blade Runner 2049 because of Harrison Ford, but normal movies would have finished before he finally appeared. 2018 it not starting with a good impression and this movie only gets a fair 6.",6,1,5,1 January 2018
12 Monkeys," Renewing acquaintance
","After about 23 years I watched this movie again. Over the last view years I have enjoyed watching the series '12 monkeys' which was based on this film. I remembered that I did not enjoy this movie that much when I saw it the first time.The reason for not liking this movie has not changed. The character James Cole was a distasteful fellow and spoiled the movie from the outset, because of his psychotic behavior and the scenes in the asylum. The role of Kathryn Railly, on the other hand, saved this film for her strong performance. The twist in the film, although good sci-fi, is not that clear at the end. But it appears I am in the minority as the very positive ratings the movie got, proves otherwise.I will stick with the series '12 monkeys', which unfortunately is reaching the end soon. I find this a superior product and much more enjoyable to watch.",5,1,5,24 June 2018
Aquaman," Atlantis rises to conquer the world
","At last a decent adventure/action movie, something which hasn't been seen for a long time. A film with an understandable plot, with minute by minute action and a great cast of well-known actors. Jason Momoa fits the bill well as Aquaman, a welcome new hero who gets clobbered most of the time, but keeps coming back for more.You cannot go wrong spending a few hours with aquaman. DC Comics is the new Marvelous!",8,1,2,9 March 2019
Deadpool 2," More trashy than Deadpool
","I remember seeing Deadpool in 2016 and thought in was rubbish and gave it an unwatchable 4 rating, but saw the whole flick.Hearing about Deadpool 2 and believing the hype that it is a much better movie, I took the plunge and started watching it. After an hour I couldn't take it any longer and gave up. It is a worse movie and total trash. How anyone can enjoy crappy jokes and listen to endless twaddle is beyond me. I wonder who those reviewers are that think so highly of it, or is it a matter of follow the leader of mindless supporters?Save your soul and if you thought that Deadpool was bad, don't bother with Deadpool 2, as it is beyond redemption.",2,9,19,8 August 2018
Ready Player One," Steven Spielberg?
","What's happened to Steven Spielberg? He used to direct fun and enjoyable movies, but this movie-insult he should have given a miss. It is not worth carrying his name and by now he should be ashamed.I watched the movie because of him, but by now, I too, am ready for the loony bin.",1,3,6,14 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The End of a Saga
","Having seen all episodes of Star Wars, the best episodes remain 4, 5 and 6, with 5 the best of them all. These were the original films made in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively. Then followed the beginning episodes 1, 2 and 3, slightly less favorable - in 1999, 2002 and 2005. The series concluded with episode 7 in 2015, episode 8 in 2017 and the final episode 9 in 2019. These last 3 episodes were slightly better then episodes 1, 2 and 3, with episode 9 unfortunately lacking behind 7 and 8.Nevertheless episode 9, although stretched out in the beginning, picked up speed in the last hour or so, qualifying for a rating of 6. It is not that bad as quite a number of viewers' personal ratings and reached a favorable conclusion, albeit at great cost of lives, which is not revealed, but can be seen. Some of the main actors in the original 3 movies made cameo appearances which was a nice touch, but they were sorely missed, hence the lower ratings!",6,2,6,16 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Morbid Film Disappoints
","Just attended a pre-release of the film with great anticipation. So much hype had been made about the movie that it just couldn't fail to satisfy beyond believe.I am disillusioned and highly disappointed after the event. Most of the film is taken up by talking heads interspersed with a song here and there. Only the last 10 minutes or so were great and that's how I remember Freddie was!Rami Malek did his best, but he is no Freddie. I will rely on the many DVD's I own seeing the real man in action, who never failed to entertain beyond believe. Of his many great songs, the one I love best is 'Barcelona' with Montserrat CaballÃ© which was featured at the 1992 Olympic Games. Freddie was a great lover of Opera and this song (not in this Film) shows that Opera and Rock can rock!",4,4,10,3 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A Spectacle of Nothingness
","Two and a half hours and what do you get? Nothing!This film is merely an exercise in CGI, lots of fighting, no actual story and finally turns to dust. I shake my head in shame and can't believe what I saw. Perhaps I was half asleep of boredom and can't relate the story.It was definitely a spectacle, but honestly, just a spectacle of nothingness. I must stop wasting my time and don't bother about the follow-up to come. Marvel is no longer marvelous.",4,2,8,3 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Inexplicably bad
","This movie has highly rated actors and producers in it, which should make it an excellent film. But alas that is a fallacy. It is incoherent and annoying to watch.Quentin Tarantino has made many magnificent movies in the past, but as Writer and Director for this plot/script he missed the ball completely. A most boring result for many viewers.A friend stuck it out for 25 minutes. This reviewer lasted somewhat longer, but after 1 hour and 9 minutes could take no more.Viewers beware of your sanity if you proceed to watch it.",1,7,11,11 February 2020
Aladdin," Brilliant entertainment
",Aladdin brought back the Arabian Nights for me to spent 2 hours in total bliss and enjoyment. Did not expect such fantastic production. No more need be said!,9,2,4,10 August 2019
A Quiet Place," An OK Silent Movie
","If the first half of the movie was as good as the second half, it would have received my rating of 7. But the first half was tedious and too slow, so overall a 6 is fair. The end result is an enjoyable movie with tense moments in it.I wonder why so many reviewers rate it so badly. What did they expect? If you want to watch a horror movie this is not it and never was meant to be one. The story was good with warts and all, but why try to demean any faults? You cannot be relaxed if you spend your time looking for errors, but you miss the thrill and enjoyment for which most people watch a particular movie. If it is not your scene, don't bother about it in the first place.I don't like silent movies, but I knew what I was in for and this film gets my thumbs up.",6,2,3,27 June 2018
1917," An anxious journey
","WWI was the trench war and this film depicts this very clearly. 500 meters ahead would be the other side's trenches. Intelligence is obtained which requires a message to be delivered to a platoon behind enemy lines. Two men are picked to undertake this journey.This film covers that dramatic journey, taking the audience along for the slog into the unexpected.Anxious moments with unknown outcomes make this film a gripping drama and covers the horrid experiences of the messengers in enemy territory.",7,1,2,19 January 2020
Logan," The somber end of the X-Men
","A dark movie not in line with the entertainment value of this genre. Very sad to see it ends this way . . .Not that the movie is bad, indeed it is a good drama but this is not what you want or expect to get. Our latest mutant liven't up the drawn out moments and the action scenes involving her were great.Perhaps the decision not to give this movie the X-Men title has to do with the producers having second thoughts as well about what sort of movie they had made of it.On purpose I have not read any reviews yet, but took note of the high ratings. If the story had been positive it would have qualified for an 8 in my books as well.",6,2,6,23 May 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Sheer Madness
","A good portrayal of what happened at the Taj Hotel in 2008. The only drawback was the muffled audio, which lacked clarity making it difficult to understand what was being said.Terrorism, jihad or freedom fighters are all made of the same cloth seeking an idealistic result, but sowing death wherever it occurs.",7,1,11,25 June 2019
La La Land," I really can't believe my eyes
","I must be from another planet! This film which did so well at the recent Oscars, made me painfully aware that my taste is much different from those who gave it such a good rating.I like musicals, but found this not to be one. What story was there to see? I watched the movie on disc and found the dancing in the traffic jam at the start, a load of rubbish and hurtful to watch. I battled on watching, but after almost half an hour, scanned through to the end. The flashing picture before my eyes, was no different when watching the movie! The same scenes over and over again.If the movie had anything in its favor, I missed this completely. Oh well, I saved about 2 hours of pain. Thanks goodness I am still sane after this experience. I give it a rating of 2, because of not having seen the movie at normal speed, otherwise it would probably be a 1.",2,19,33,14 April 2017
Downfall," Will we ever learn?
","Unfortunately there are still many people around the world in denial that these atrocities ever took place. Today's youth don't even know much about WWII (if at all) and when asked who Hitler was, quite a number think that he is a current president of some country, but most just don't know.This movie is probably the best and most accurate portrayal of the last days in the bunker based on the book written by Hitler's secretary. Most other war films are fictional and dramatized and eye account documentaries on this subject become scarcer as time goes by.Important lessons are learnt from history, but without this acquired knowledge wars reoccur and many are raging around the world as we speak.",8,1,1,11 August 2018
Black Panther," What's the fuzz?
","I saw this movie today and expected an all action movie, but that's not what I got. Yes, probably a great visual spectacle for anyone not living in Africa, but nothing spectacular otherwise. The real difference is an almost 100% black cast for a big budget movie, which is a first and perhaps made it popular for that very reason.I came away disappointed. The Black Panther didn't do it for me.",6,1,2,2 May 2018
Midway," Unrealistic glorified battle scenes
","A spectacular movie to watch, but not a realistic reflection how the actual events took place. A hyped up film based on records from leaders and sailors who fought in it, does not make this movie a good testimony of historic value.It is fair to say that this film is solely made for entertainment purposes.",7,3,4,6 February 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wick the Wig
","Short and sweet: one long video game not for the meek. I'm not a gamer and failed to enjoy this insaner. Shoot-ups galore and then some more and more and more.With nothing more positive to say, perhaps yesteryear's Wick will be back another day.I hang my head in shame. Please no more movies in this frame!",4,3,8,1 June 2017
Annihilation," Slowly going nowhere
","I was looking forward to this movie, but what a letdown! It is ever so slow to develop into something, yet actually never did. Watching it all the way through, my mood kept changing. At first I was keenly interested, 10 minutes later interest starting waning, followed by what's going on? Then a bore was born, which before the end of the movie was the big bore.The movie got such a high rating, which made me watch it in the first place. But this movie only had me hopping mad at the end of it for wasting my time. I give it a rating of 4 which is extremely generous. Any lower rating which a lot of viewers had given it, did not take any merit into consideration, which I did. Without that a rating of 1 is what it justifiably deserves.Netflix has received another demerit point from me.",4,1,4,16 March 2018
