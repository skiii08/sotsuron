Sucker Punch," Awwwful waste of time
","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY watching this awful movie. This has to be top 10 for worst movie experiences I've had. The story line, the characters, the acting... ALL SUB PAR. I've never actually reviewed movies on here; but this movie compelled me to express my disappointment.Within the very first 10 minutes, I felt absolutely no connection with the story line & lost interest in any of the characters. The scenes were random & made little connection to any any part of the so-called reality from imagination of the main character 'baby doll'. At the end of the movie- adding insult to injury- the whole moral of the movie was once again reiterated to the audience; as if it was so intricate of a plot and thus needing explanation. Don't waste your money like I did.",Null,6,12,30 March 2011
