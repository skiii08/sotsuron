National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Film That Repeats The Same Formula As The Original
","2004's National Treasure was a massive sleeper Hit bringing Nicholas Cage to both critical and commercial success with audiences who loved his historically correct intellectual adventurous persona. The film became one of the years highest grossing films and is just what Cage needed. For years after the eighties he'd been trying to shake off his celebrity teen star image with films like Valley Girl and When Peggy Sue Got Married which brought him fame in the eighties aside from being Francis Ford Coppola nephew. Leaving Las Vegas showed that he had the potential as an adult star but National Treasure made people forget about his years as a naive teen star and put him in all aspects as a sophisticated adult star. Because National Treasure was such a success it was no surprise that there was going to be a sequel nor was it a surprise that the sequel was going to pale in comparison to the original, because if you've been around the block more than once then you know that most sequels don't work out like the originals and Book of Secrets fails in just that same way.The film repeats the same formula as the original crew follows a branch of clues that that requires one to be a competent historian and includes puzzles which require some mathematical and scientific thought. The film is set up the same and you know like all adventures films there will be a conclusive climax that brings the story and clues together in one final scene that details the treasure rewards the protagonist as desired. Nicholas Cage's character Ben Gates has a specific desire to find the treasure that puts him at risk for many unfortunate consequences. The film itself revolves around the Lincoln assassination conspiracy and how it has recently surfaced that Gate's great great grandfather Thomas Gates could be the mastermind of the whole conspiracy kill Lincoln. To clear his families name and not fill the shoes of new Dr.Samuel Mudd (who helped John Wilkes Booth) Gates goes through all the trouble of going on another treasure hunt to clear his grandfather's name and that's what the whole film revolves around. In any case, many people wouldn't mind having a notorious figure in their family and wouldn't go through any where near as much trouble Gates gets into.Though Ben Gates being the historical nut that he is goes through a lot of trouble in order to clear Thomas Gates name, having a plot line focusing around this sole purpose is inane. The main plot points circle around a range of conspiracy theories which play a vital part in this and most other recent adventure films. This one includes a Book of Secrets which has been passed down from president to president revealing truths of presidential assassinations, Watergate. Area 51 and finally the one this film revolves around: the Indian built City of Gold. Finding the City of Gold is the only chance Gates has of clearing his great great grandfathers name. Recurring characters include Gates former girlfriend from the first film Abigail (Diane Kruger) who for reasons vaguely explained in this film have broken up. Also, Gates sometimes incompetent partner Riley Pool(Justin Bartha) who in the film has just wrote a book on conspiracies and urban legends which plays a vital part in solving some of the clues and puzzles however the book is ignored by most people. Other characters include Gate's divorced parents who are still heated at one another over their failed relationship. Gates Mother plays a vital part in reading PreColumbian Indian language which also plays a part in finding the location of the City Of Gold. The supposed antagonist Mitch Wilkinson who during the climax actually helps out the characters which is rarely seen in an antagonist it is a strange twist brought upon by the producers. All these clashing personalities tie into the film appropriately considering the subject matter because all of the crews characters provide much historical knowledge and create a sense of drama that movie goers will enjoy seeing. Two other vital players in the film include a rough caricature of some future president because the producers knew what kind of controversy they would cause if they parodied George.W.Bush. The second supporting player is the FBI leader Sadusky (Harvey Keitel). The film lacks much originality relying on what much of the first film had in store for audiences and continuing with the same idea. I found it repetitive and unoriginal as this film shows in a variety of ways how the same intense drama/action scenes play out like any other overaction movie would. In some ways, the way the scenes played out reminds me of a '24' action montage. However this film is like any other action/adventure/drama film a sense of purpose and clashing emotions create a plot line to follow and a not to surprising climax. Regardless of that the film is a must see for families or people who really liked the first film.",8,0,1,4 January 2008
Cloverfield," An Exceptionally Awful Piece Of Film
","First off I didn't like this film to begin with seeing how the monster movie genre has no cinematic value to me at all. However I could be biased on this review to because while in the theater I endured one of the worst movie experiences of my life. A group of loud rambunctious teens who sat next to us where giving away parts of the movie before they were shown swearing talking out loud and not amongst themselves. Though critics and film goers alike say that the way this film is done is said to be innovative but I cant see Hollywood basing many of their films on a Blair Witch theme were the whole film is seen from a camera.This film is basically a rip-off what you get when a bunch of producers decide to mix Godzilla and the Blair Witch. The plot line is all out of place just them running around the city away from the giant beasts which there's really no logical explanation as to how they arrived here. The main characters are naive ignorant obnoxious but what are you going to get from a group of characters fresh out of college how are trying to live decent lives but this is an exceptional group of people who are unsophisticated obnoxious and indiscreet. Their idiocy eventually leads to their inevitable deaths as if it wasn't obvious that the whole film would turn to chaos and everyone would die what kind of film that has no morals no values make a wholesome movie. It doesn't this film is hyped and overrated and in the past few months this has faded into obscurity like it should. This is basically a fan film I can see many references to the producers favorite films including Alien, Blair Witch, and any monster movie crap. A fan film thats poorly edited produced and all out of place there's not even an actual plot line just the characters running around. There's no reason why you or anyone else should see this just because you like seeing this type of crap.",1,19,28,8 June 2008
I Am Legend," Will Smith Takes On Armageddon
","Will Smith has proved to be one of Hollywood's most influential and intelligent celebrities and can easily be seen as a role model without much hesitation. Using his everyman persona by just being himself and using his ambitions and morals to work for him and asking others to heed his advice. Will Smith projects that persona on most of his screen characters to create influential, lovable protagonist characters and he has carried out the out the same attitude in real life. This film has Smith continuing in the Action Scifi genre, a genre wheres he has been most marketable and commercially successful for over decade while receiving critical praise. With films like Independence Day and Men In Black, Will Smith became the Nineties most marketable and commercially successful Summer Movie star. Its great to have Will Smith continue in this genre because his everyman persona provides great depth for a struggling protagonist in an Action Scifi setting.The film is based on the 1954 novel of the same name drawing influences from other post-apocalyptic films such as Vincent Prices 1964 film The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man. This is a modernized update of the classic Armageddon story plot as it is inevitable that most Hollywood films of any theme or genre are updated to have modernized contemporary film elements. Will Smith's modern day persona blends in with the idea of the film. The Film runs slow for the first hour and is inconsistent with few surprises. The first half of the film is Smith's character and his dog Samantha traveling through the desolate city then when the film is 7/10ths of the way done we meet up with the supporting actress Anna Braga. The Film starts in the near future Manhattan 2012 three years prior to that a doctor by name of Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson) is convinced that she has a cure for cancer by genetically bioengineering the measles virus. This cure mutates with absolutely disastrous consequences as the new virus spreads throughout the world killing 98 percent of humanity and causing some survivors to devolve into flesh eating monsters that come out only at night.Prior to this Armageddon he was a famous well renowned Military virologist who dedicated his life to reversing the infectious virus started by Dr. Krippin which he continues to do after it wiped out nearly all of humanity. By the end of 2009 the disease spreads so quickly that 90% of the world and presumably Dr. Krippin are dead. Dr.Neville is convinced that it is not the end of humanity and attempts to contact anyone in the world by broadcasting on all AM Radio frequencies asking anyone listening to meet him at the city pier during mid day afternoon. For the first half of the film he wanders around the desolate city and hunts down the humans who have been transformed from the disease and studies them to find a cure this includes animals that have been infected as well. He uses traps to capture the infected creatures then putting them through numerous tests to see if he can come to a conclusion and have a cure to reverse this whole disaster. One of his infected test subjects is 18 - 20 year old girl who he attempts to treat without success. While doing all this there are flashbacks. While he goes to sleep to periodically in three separate dreams infer what actually happened prior to this desolate future putting into detail what has happened during the apocalypse for humanity. Basically Neville's and his families escape from the city during the break out of the infection and how it was spreading and their struggles to leave and how Dr.Neville has started to begin finding a cure. The flashbacks are separated periodically as to when Will Smith is sleeping. The last dream basically shows the military solution by bombing Manhattan and how his family tries to escape in one of the helicopter's and how it collides with one of theirs. The only family he has left is his dog Samantha who is basically killed off as well because she didn't heed Neville's command of running away from the mutated canines and humans when they had the chance. Smith than takes his anger out on the infected humans by using his car to ram over them driving aimlessly onto the pier than crashing into a lamp post, where the mutated humans take this as an advantage. As it looks like the protagonists life draws near he is saved by a group of survivors Anna (Alice Braga) and a kid named Ethan who were waiting at the city pier in response to his radio AM message. Returning them to his house she explains that there is a human colony in Vermont which Neville doesn't believe it and goes into denial mainly because he was convinced that the infection had wiped out all of humanity and that him and Anna and Ethan where the earths sole survivors. After this the most of the cities infected humans come and attack the homestead realizing that Neville is a threat in response to this Neville and Anna retreat to the basement where Neville finds himself at a dead end letting Anna and Ethan escape through the coal chute. During all of this Neville discovers that his testing on that 18 - 20 year old patient produced a cure that he hands over to Anna and spread to any of the infected humans. During all of this Neville sacrifices himself by killing him and all the other infected humans off with a grenade.Will Smiths take on the character is original in the way of how he expresses himself take for example how he uses Bob Marley as a distressful way of thinking of positives and at how any dark moment can be changed into a positive. Will Smith continues to be a great role model through films.",7,1,3,22 December 2007
Iron Man," Above Average Comic Book Film
","Recently the Superhero movie franchise the comic book industry for that matter has come under critical scrutiny and bland and UN-innovative work, work so innovative hasn't been seen under comic book artists and industry since that of Frank Miller. Both the Comic Book and Film needed a reawakening a slap in the face. Because in recent years both have not come out with material that been appealing to the mainstream. Iron Man is the first in the long time of films that has the realism and mainstream appeal that other innovative films possess.The film comes into unfamiliar territory for a protagonist thats not so down to earth a trust fund baby by the name of Tony Stark who's father created an empire of War Weapon Industry in which he inherited from his deceased father. The Protagonists appeal is his sarcasm's and wit both helping him out and causing him trouble in numerous situations. The film deals with a distribution of weapons to terrorist for intentionally antagonistic purposes. The eventual antagonist is Obidiah Stane who Co-Founded the company in hopes of appealing the weapons to just about everyone. To avoid Tony's intentions of cutting off deals with extreme organizations he sends him over to the middle east where hes token hostage. He eventually develops the Iron Man suit out crude materials later to develop the suit later on. The Iron Man suit becomes a fascination to Stark who isn't much of a megalomaniac for powers as much as he wants to study how far he can push the suit. The films sub-plot is a consistent love story between Starks personal secretary Gweneth but it becomes relentless and tiring to see sub-plots like love stories appear in super-hero movies repetitively. The film is a breath of fresh air and differs from most superhero movies and offers realism and a chance to see believe-able character Robert Downey Jr.s character reminds me of Dennis Miller . Though this is an above-average comic book film in part to the inconsistency and longevity of other films.",9,1,3,7 June 2008
