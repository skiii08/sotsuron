The Blair Witch Project," THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
","This movie is totally convincing.  I'm sure that it is actual footage and that the three actors who are currently making the circuits are only look-a-likes who want to capitalize on the deaths of those three heroic film makers who gave their lives to reveal to the world the horrors of the Blair Witch.  No one could act that convincingly, especially not three unknowns. This is just another government cover-up to conceal the TRUTH WHICH IS OUT THERE.The footage is just too raw, too jittery, to be anything but real.  If they were actors, Heather Donahue would have at least cleaned her nose before her infamous close-up scene.  We all know how vain show business folks are.  No, it's real, all right, and we should be mourning the deaths of those three courageous witch hunters, not celebrating the success of their look-a-likes.Go see this movie, if you dare, but don't be duped into believing it's not real.  That's what THEY want you to believe.  Yes, Virginia, there IS a Blair Witch, and thank God she exists!",Null,0,2,18 August 1999
The Iron Giant," A CLASSIC!
","When this movie ended, I couldn't get out of my seat.  You see, tears were pouring down my cheeks and I didn't want anyone in the lobby to see me. They may have thought it odd to see a fifty year old man crying.They began as tears of sadness about three minutes before the movie ended. It was a bitter-sweet sadness and I could easily have brushed them away. But it was the final scene, the last few seconds of the film, that did me in.If you've seen 'Places in the Heart,' you know what I mean... a final, defining scene that is so uplifting, so utterly transcendent, that it becomes a transforming moment in your life.The feeling remained with me long after I had hurried out of the lobby and into my truck.  I believe it was about the time I was pulling into my driveway that I realized, 'Hey, this was only an animated feature, for pete's sake... an animated feature, and it has touched my life deeply.'I intend to tell all my friends about this movie.  I want them all to see it.  A movie this wonderful is just too good to pass by.",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
