Minority Report," The dogs bollocks
","It's one of the best science fiction films ever made. No, that's not an exaggeration. Star Wars, Close Encounters ra ra ra... this is right up there. Good acting, the product placement is not a problem (come on people, it's the way it's done nowadays), and it's got more twists than a can of spaghetti. The story is great and highly original and Spielberg shows why he's one of the best directors around. Forget about that James Cameron feller, he's a flash in the pan. No one could have made this film apart from Spielberg, and hey, even Tom Cruise was pretty good. But obviously it wasn't the acting that really made it, or even the amazing special effects. Solid story, and solid story telling from one of the masters, still at the top of his game.",10,0,0,24 July 2002
