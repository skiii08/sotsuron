Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Report
",This wasn't as good as I thought it would be. First of all it was too boring and it had hardly any action in it. The story was pritty stupid and dumb. I thought everyone overeacted for this Star Wars. Episode 2 is a hundread times better than this junk. This movie diserves a C,Null,1,2,20 May 2002
Minority Report," Pritty Good Cruise Film
","Minority Report carried a lot of action and suspense. It had good technology and a instreasting story. It didn't surprised me when Max Von Sydow was the bad guy, I already knew he did it. There were some parts of the movie that was quit slow and boring. There was also a lot of funny scenes like Cruise dropping the eyes on the floor. If Cruise and Speilberg make another film, I think I would go see it. They did a good job on this movie. I would give this movie a B+",Null,0,0,30 June 2002
Fight Club," One of the best movies ever Made!
","I would have to say that Fight Club is probably one of my most favorites movies because everything about was good. The actors, the story, and the action were all well done. This movie I would for sure recommened to all the true critics. I hope David Fincher make a sequel to fight club because it's worth it. He is probanly one of my favorites directors now. I give this movie a A+",10,0,1,14 July 2002
Scary Movie 2," Not Again
","Okay, what is with hollywood now a days. Why would they even think about making another Scary Movie. The first one was just a piece of crap. And now they made Scary Movie 2. This movie was even worse. It didn't have one singal laugh in it and once again it was stupid. I even heard that they are going to make SCARY MOVIE 3!!!!!! Has hollywood gone nuts or what!! This movie deserves a big fat F",Null,0,1,30 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Report On Star Wars
","Well, I didn't think this movie would be as good as I thought it would. I enjoyed this movie way way better than Phantom Menace. I thought Phantom Menace was a terrible film. But I guess George Lucas finally came back to his real Star Wars. I would give this Star Wars a decent B+",Null,0,1,18 May 2002
American Pie," A good funny teen movie
","American Pie was really funny in a teen way. You would only get the jokes in this film if you were a teen now a days. My favorite character in this film was Stifler (who is played by Sean W. Scott) I find him the most funniest guy because he has the best lines and does the stupidest things. After seeing this movie, I didn't I eat an Apple Pie for a while, until I finally got over it. I would say this is a good solid funny teen movie. I give this movie an A-",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A film that I think is overated!
",This film I thought was truley overated. I didn't know what the big deal was. The movie was just plain stupid and really really boring. I would probably never say this but Harry Potter was better than this trash. I'm not looking forward to see the next two installments because this one was really bad. I didn't like the action or the story. I would for sure not give this film any higher than a C-,Null,1,2,21 July 2002
Spider-Man," What I Thought
","Once again the movie preview was better than the movie. This movie wasn't spectacular, I mean it didn't blow me away. The only thing I liked about Spider-Man was the special effects and the green goblin (played by William Dafoe). The rest was just some sappy love scenes with Marry Jane. I give this movie a C+",Null,0,0,12 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," A cool film with big names
","To tell you the truth, this movie was better than i thought it would be. When I first saw the preview for Oceans 11, I said here comes another stupid film with some stars and a directer who I don't really care for. But when I actually went and saw it, I really had a good time threw the whole film. I enjoyed all the actors in it and the story to. Some scenes I thought was really clever and some scene I've seen done before. Overall the movie was fun to watch. (Not really a serious film) I give this movie a B+",Null,0,1,20 July 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," I've seen better Submarines movies
",I wouldn't say that this was the best movie of the summer because really it wasn't that.........good. It had some good action scenes and a couple of good stars but thats about it. I really didn't care for the story because it wasn't instreasting. Better submarines movies are U571 and Das Boot. I give this movie a C,Null,2,2,27 July 2002
Men in Black II," No, It's not better than the first
","I would have to disagree to some people. I don't think MIIB is better than the first. I thought the first was way way funnier. It had better jokes and had a better story to it. The second one I thought was kind of lame. The story was pritty stupid and I didn't like the villan. The only thing that made this movie not get a failing mark is Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and the Dog. The rest was pritty boring. Otherwise, I give this movie a C+",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
There's Something About Mary," Very Funny!!!!
","When I first saw this movie, I almost p***ed in my pants. This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I'm surprised they arn't going to make a sequel. I mean it made a lot of money and it was very good. Ben Stiller was just hilarious. My favorite scene is probably the zipper scene. The rest was also really funny like when the dog gets druged and can't wake up. I also liked Matt Dillon in it, he was also very funny. I give this movie an A",Null,1,2,7 July 2002
From Hell," Good grossing movie
","'From Hell' is probably one of the most grossing/gory movies I've ever seen. It was really graphic and was quit disturbing at some scenes of the film. Either than that, the movie was really well done, with a good story and good actors like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. This film was kind of like 'Sleepy Hollow', around the same period of time and had the same kind of clothing. But I would say that this was just a littler bit better than 'Sleepy Hollow' I give this movie a A-",Null,1,2,27 July 2002
A Hard Day's Night," Good Beatles Movie
","I'm a big fan of the beatles. I thought it was really good because it brought back a lot of good memories back in the 60's. I thought the best part of the movie is the last scene at the Ed Sullivan show. That was really amazing scene. I thought this movie was better that their others, like Yellow Submarine and Help, those wern't very good. It's too bad two of them are dead. If they wern't, I bet they would have came back together and make another movie or even bettera CD. Long Live the BEATLES!!! This movies deserves an A",Null,1,2,7 July 2002
Shrek," The best Animation film ever!
","I would have to say that 'Shrek' is the best animation film I've ever seen. I say that because the computer graphics were really well done and the story was very good. It had a lot of good jokes and funny humour. I especially like the voices who were in it like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphey, and Cameron Diaz. They were good as those voices in 'Shrek' I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this film, hopefully it will be just as good as the first one, or maybe even better. I give this film an A+",Null,0,1,27 July 2002
Signs," The Sixth Sense was better!
","To tell you the truth, I think shyamalan movie's are all down hill now. The Sixth Sense was good, Unbreakable was alright, and Signs is okay to. None of his movies so far is as good as Sixth Sense. The movie had some scary scenes and good effects, but the film wasn't all based on aliens. It's about Mel Gibson trying to get faith back from God. I give this film a C+",Null,0,0,15 August 2002
Casino," One of the best Scorsese film!
","A very clever and well done film. I really liked all the stars in the film like Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. I thought Joe Pesci role was very powerful and good, robert de niro played the same kind of a role. The story was instreasting and well done. It was a bit long, but that's just the way it is. I think this is much better than Goodfellas. I give this film an A",Null,1,2,7 September 2002
Windtalkers," Just Another War Movie
","I would say that this movie is somewhat like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and Thin Red Line. They were all mostly the same to me, War movies will be war movies. People will die in a brutal way, and you will go home with a headache. But I would say that this had good action for a John Woo film. Story was instreasting and enertaining, so I would give this movie a B+",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
