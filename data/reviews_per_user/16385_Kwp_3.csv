Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sound and fury, signifying nothing
","What a disappointment! Yes, the special effects were sensational and the production quality was awesome, resulting in a visual and auditory feast (which summarizes every compliment anyone here has given the movie), but so what? People seem to think that's all a STAR WARS movie should be, but it's not. If the first movie hadn't had memorable characters, mythic overtones, and a bunch of great lines, it would have been just another mediocre sci-fi special-effects movie, rather than the classic that it is.So what does this movie have? Memorable characters? There are only two non-cardboard characters in this entire movie: Anakin and his mother. Everyone else is just a chess-piece being moved around as needed. Mythic overtones? This movie felt like a video game with speaking parts. And forget about the memorable lines.Even the special effects seemed lacking at times (blasphemy!). Isn't it amazing that the ships can land in a forest without disturbing a single tree? Then you have all the CGI characters, who end up looking exactly the same--not exactly a way to achieve suspension of disbelief.I thought George Lucas was special because he had figured out that fights, battle scenes, and pretty scenery are meaningless if you don't care about the characters and what's happening to them. I'm sorry to find out that I was wrong.",4,0,1,20 June 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A marvelous movie
","Shakespeare in Love is a marvelous movie. This is what going to movies should be like all the time: lifting you out of your everyday life and worries into a magical world. Silly, funny, charming, harrowing, and truthful all at the same time, it works on many levels. It's an homage to Shakespeare; it's a love story so beautiful and true that it hurts; it's a satire on modern Hollywood. And somehow it manages to blend all these together with never a false note, always both true to its own spirit and to truth itself. The ending is bittersweet but honest, with no contrived happy ending. (And while it does take liberties with history, the liberties are self-consistent and never distracting.)As for the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow seems to glow throughout, even when disguised as a man, and the other players, many familiar from various British productions, are superb and frequently hilarious.The movie has the cleverness of Pulp Fiction without the ugly violence; the characterizations and perceptiveness of Sense and Sensibility while being much more fun; the magic and sense of fun of Star Wars with better acting and a better script. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10,0,0,28 February 1999
American Beauty," Dog poo, photographed beautifully
","The moral of the story: suburban life in America is horrible, but if you can get enough sex and drugs, you might just be able to get by.That seems to be the logical conclusion to this depiction of a bunch of total losers where the most positive (or I should say 'least negative') character is a drug dealer.Dad hates his job and ignores his family. Mom is obsessed by her job and ignores her family. Sis is a miserable teenager who thinks a boob job will solve all her problems. Next-door neighbor is an ex-Marine psycho with an autistic wife and a weird son (that's the drug dealer). And Sis's best friend is a nympho. Are we really supposed to be able to learn anything from these people other than 'Try your darndest not to be like them?' It seemed like a total waste of time and money to me. After it was over, I snuck down the hall to another theater to watch the latter part of GALAXY QUEST, just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.That being said, this is an extraordinarily well-done movie from a technical viewpoint: the directing and acting are superb. But as far as I'm concerned it's not enough to redeem this movie: no matter how well you photograph doggie poo or how beautifully it glistens in the sun, it's still doggie poo.",3,0,1,13 March 2000
