Blade Runner 2049," Inert
","Just too slow moving and devoid of action. The story only picks up for a moment when Harrison Ford returns, the most engaging sequence being the fist fight in the Vegas casino. It's exciting to finally be reunited with the first film despite the fact that Deckard no longer looks like a middle-aged Elvis Costello and now looks more like an elderly Simon Cowell.",6,1,5,15 April 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Blake Edwards rip-off
","About half-way though my third attempt to sit through this dross, I realised it was just a rip-off of Blake Edwards' '10'- a composer runs off on holiday after breaking up with his girlfriend. But this time they cast Russell Brand as Bo Derek!",3,1,2,12 June 2018
The Irishman," Irish wide shut
","This film feels like the late films of many a great director. Scorsese is using the genre he is best known for to tell a story that is close to his heart now. Don't compare it to his earlier work, just pay attention to what the master has to say to you now.",8,6,16,28 November 2019
The Terminator," Back to the Past
","Terminator is the action thriller version of that other time travel classic Back to the Future. Just like Marty Mcfly, John Conner is faced with a time travel conundrum which keeps his parents apart and threatens his very existence. So he manipulates his dad into a situation where his mom can fall in love with him. In both cases a muscle bound threat gets in the way (Terminator/Biff) which I guess means that Doc Brown is Skynet?",10,0,2,5 January 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," This film is an utter masterpiece.
",I think the fact that it is a comedy prevents people from admitting that this is the most incisive analysis of humanity and its foibles ever rendered on celluloid. This should be the number one film on the IMDB list but for the fact that people will always place sentimentality ahead of cold perception of reality.,10,1,1,5 June 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Six letters from Woody Harrelson
",A movie with a doomed concept - we know Frances' daughter isn't coming back - so what is it? A movie about the frustration of grief? What hope can we have for her character? Maybe dating Peter Dinklage? He's cool right? Sam Rockwell is an idiot who usually would get some redemption in a movie like this. Nope - he stays an idiot who thinks he's cracked the case cos he overheard some guy talking shit in a bar. Clarke Peters turns up and we think 'Is this gonna turn into In The Heat Of The Night?' Nope - he does nothing. This movie is a series of left turns until you end up back at the beginning. Frances wants some payback for the death of her daughter. Does she get it?....Roll credits,4,5,8,17 February 2018
Aliens," First Acid Blood
",James Cameron famously wrote the script for this film and Rambo at the same time. It doesn't sound so hard considering he basically wrote the same film twice. PTSD suffering hero is dropped back into the location that birthed all their trauma and manages to rescue a lone survivor - a failed rescue leaves them stranded and forced to fight their way out while various 80s yuppie scumbags get in their way. Both films are sequels to very different origin movies and both films up the guns and ammo quotient to great effect and much success. The main diffrerence being that Ripley is given something to live for while Rambo ends up isolated and alone.,10,0,2,15 April 2020
Flashdance," Freeze Frame
","You might think that this iconic movie is a spiritual successor to dance themed classics like Saturday Night Fever or Fame. In reality this shallow epic works best as pseudo-sequel to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner - another film featuring animated mannequins posing in clouds of smoke, sparks and steam. Producers Simpson and Bruckheimer perfected this kind of style as substance filmmaking in the early 80's where every shot is a magazine ad and every scene an MTV video. Don't be fooled by the perfunctory romance or vague tale of ambition, this film exists to sell the soundtrack and not the other way around. Also Kevin Smith clearly stole his Jay and Silent Bob characters from the creepy bouncers in this film.",6,0,1,10 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another fractured fairytale from Quentin Tarantino.
","At first viewing this film seemed like an enjoyable trip down memory lane that ended up skidding off the end of the road and into the weeds. Then I realised that this story actually felt like more of a companion piece to 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. Both films resurrect 60's icons in a nearly plotless 'hangout' movie where we get to spend a lot of time enjoying the company of a group of iconic TV characters (real and invented) and in both cases the low-key story ends up resolving itself in a reinvention of a famous real-life event (Manson murders/Voyager probe launches) In both films the real intention is to enjoy time with the characters while the climactic events serve to give the whole thing a semblance of meaning or depth. Interestingly both films feature a sexy female victim character (Sharon Tate/Ilia) who is the focus of the story and is magically saved by the end of the film. This take gains more creedence when you consider that Tarantino has expressed interest in making his own Star Trek film.
Addendum: Nov 2019 - to continue the comparison, Leo must be Kirk the old-timer threatened by new younger players. Brad is Spock and like Spock he goes on an extended exploration of enemy territory which would make Charles Manson the equivalent of V'ger?",8,7,19,15 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," STAR WARS S3E2
","So our resistant heroes continue their fight against the Second Empire. Not much really happens unless you consider killing off various characters significant. (Admiral Ackbar!!) No real answers or explanations to any of Abrams 'mystery box' storytelling. Who's Snoke? Dunno. Who's Rey? Nobody. Long winded and filled with awkward humour (Luke milking a thing) and pointless adventures. (Finn's trip to a space casino which ends up accomplishing exactly nothing) Filled with confusing story telling where characters turn bad (or good) and back again for no reason and people show up out of the blue with no explanation as to how they got there. (How did Rey meet up with Chewie again?) Like Han in the last film Luke is really only in it to pass the torch and is just treated in an embarrassing manner. Strangely Leia survives and I'm expecting her to be written out in the opening crawl for the next one. These new movies are written in a TV variety style where characters and things show up for a round of applause and then go away.( 'And now...heeeeeres YODA!) These new movies are more in the style of the Star Wars Holiday Special than the original movies. Frankly it's just weird. 
(P.S. the Harry Potter-esque final scene was the most Un-Star Wars scene ever)",5,191,312,14 December 2017
Caddyshack," Cinderella Story
",Basically a series of golf club related sketches with almost zero plot just a group of recurring characters. The cast is headed by SNL alumni Chase and Murray and backed up by a team of young actors who were never seen again. Its saving grace is that it is funny as hell. A young Rodney Dangerfield is a revelation. ;),8,1,1,1 December 2019
Titanic," Terminator 1912
",In Titanic (T3) James Cameron unwittingly remakes his first hit The Terminator. In both films a couple struggle to escape an unstoppable machine which is on a relentless course to destroy them. Only the girl survives but it is unknown whether Kate is pregnant with a child who will save all mankind. In this case I guess it means the iceberg is Skynet since it programs the Titanic on its mission to take them down.,8,5,7,5 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Starcrash
",Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.,5,18,22,22 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Graffiti -1138
","George Lucas is the James Dean of film directors. Three iconic films and then out. What many people fail to notice is that his third film is an amalgam of his first two. If you took the kids from American Graffiti and dropped them into the world of THX-1138, you'd get Star Wars. The scene where the Imperials fail to fire on the escape pod and the stormtroopers discuss the new BT-16 are straight out of THX. Meanwhile Harrison Ford reprises Bob Falfa in his '55 Chevy and Luke is clearly Terry the Toad eager to waste time with his friends at Mel's drive-in/Toshi Station. Cindy Williams was nearly the princess too!",10,2,3,2 November 2019
Alien: Covenant," FAILIEN
","This film epitomizes the conceptual gymnastics that go into keeping a money making film franchise active. Alien:Covenant is at once a sequel, a prequel, a remake, a reboot and a ripoff. It steals from the original Alien, its sequel Aliens while shoehorning in a follow-up to Prometheus at the same time. It is basically a plotless misadventure on an another planet with a 10 minute remake of Alien tacked on the end. Plus the final 'twist' is telegraphed for any person who ever saw a movie by the scene where Fassbender gives himself a haircut for no reason.",5,1,4,25 August 2019
