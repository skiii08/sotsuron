Iron Man 3," Biggest let down ever
","I love Ironman 1 and 2 and was waiting a year for this movie. Mainly because the Mandarin. I was nearly going to walk out of the cinema when i seen that he was just a drunk actor. How did Marvel let this happen? I don't know where to start to tell how disappointed i am. What is the story with the random kid that he found in a house? they just keep making one cheesy joke after another.Also Aldrich Killian was the worst bad guy, with no character. Another bit that annoyed me was Pepper Potts, is she like a new super hero now? And she suddenly knows how to use the suit. I mean come on.Biggest let down of a movie ever.",1,14,30,30 April 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Marvel has lost it, it is now just a Comedy
","Marvel has finally lost anything it had going for it. It is now completely aimed at kids. One joke after another! sure it's funny! but I was not expecting a comedy. I loved all the previous marvel until iron man 3, I then gave up on the iron mans and thought that Thor 2 looked a bit darker. boy was I wrong. Really disappointed. The whole thing is a joke. i know i sound like a bit of a moody Michael but i was really looking forward to this. I have now given up on marvel and will not be going to see any more of them. It's a good watch for kids or if you want a laugh. They should really get some tips from the batman movies.",7,25,45,9 November 2013
