Changeling," Does good film-making, make a good film?
","This is a difficult film, both in subject matter and in pace.In 1920s America, a woman returns from work as a telephone exchange supervisor to find her young son missing. Five months later, the police re-unite her with her son; only, it is not her son. From this premise, we dive into a dark world where bad things happen to good people on a whim, where the police are corrupt, and where, good exists only in the individual. This is an America trapped by 'the system', where conformity is the only route to freedom.Clint Eastwood is a masterful story teller, but this movie is overly dense. It is literally 'bursting' with heaviness. Every detail, every nuance is ruminated on, every close-up is a study in Actors working hard. It is as preponderant as the word suggests.Don't get me wrong; everything about the film is very accomplished. The high-contrast photography. The measured editing. The throaty, horn-dominated symphony, lurking dangerously below the surface.The thing is, it takes itself far too seriously. And there is a gaping plot-hole concerning the boy's involvement that you must suspend in order to access the story.The actors are brilliant as is to be expected, but by the middle of the film one can't escape the feeling that they have all been tragically mis-cast. Even for those of you for whom verbosity is not a problem, this film will leave you cold. Any number of other films have done this sort of thing before and made it work.Watch Doubt, or Capote before you dive into this one.",6,1,4,8 April 2010
Gone Baby Gone," What would you choose?
","Ben Affleck surprises with this tale about a Private Investigator, some Cops, and a missing girl.This is not a pretty film; there are no stunning frames and no obvious special effects. Think Seven...gloomy, atmospheric, peering into the shadows.And as in Seven, a wizened, life weary cop (played by Morgan Freeman) is played opposite a young investigator (played by Casey Affleck).But, unlike Seven, the chemistry doesn't quite get there.There are stunning performances by the girls grandmother and main investigating cop (Ed Harris, though you wouldn't know it right off), but Freeman is on-screen for a very small amount of time, and Casey is so dense he becomes impenetrable.Having said this, 'Gone Baby Gone', remains an intriguing, tempered film, deftly Scripted and Directed by an actor whose talent can no longer, be disputed.No wonder Ben Affleck's reputation in inner-circles Holloywood, is consistently more flattering than tabloid news reports.",8,0,0,2 April 2010
Clash of the Titans," will keep you smiling!
","This is one of those films you don't have to bring a mind too and yet you leave highly entertained anyway! Which is hard to do in the first place! There are issues with the gods. And everyone is represented.All religions, resplendant! If you have a girlfriend, take her to this movie! If you have a boyfriend, take him! Popcorn it!And better, without the 3d hype! From the first time Posidon unleashes, to the last time hades is vanquished, it's a hoot! This has nothing to do with Oscar.This is sheer entertainment! By the bucket-load! Nevermind '300'!This one rocks! Having done Avatar, the actor is really having a good time! And carrying you alongside! Fabulous!!!",8,1,4,11 April 2010
