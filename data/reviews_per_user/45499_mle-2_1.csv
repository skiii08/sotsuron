Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stay 'til the curtain closes!
","I have to admit to being a little disappointed - not because of the hype but because it was so clearly part 1 of 3 instead of being self-contained (as Star Wars IV was) and everything was so obvious.  The only real surprise for me was the origin of the Emperor.  However, I advise all fans to stay to the very end because, once the music fades out, there is a little treat for you all which makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.I also have a dislike of computer generated characters and would much prefer to see real people in costumes - if only so that the other characters can look them in the eye instead of over their left ear or somewhere in the region of their chin!  However, as droid control was so easy to destroy, perhaps this is the beginning of a humanoid army for the empire.Once again a serious lack of female role models (though Natalie Portman was very good) and some seriously racist issues such as the Japanese-style trade baddies and the good-for-a-laugh characters who were negro-like.  Surely we are past this sort of  stereo-typing?Thought Neeson and McGregor were dreadful (I am usually a fan) but have excepted the fact that Lucas cannot direct (perhaps that explains the animation?).  Also the fades/wipes from one brief scene to another really irritated.'Nuff whingeing.  All up I enjoyed it, gave it 7 out of 10 and will probably see it again.  Any Star Wars film on the big screen is an experience.",7,6,8,16 June 1999
