Ali," Excellent
","I loved it.  I thought it was a brilliant piece of film making and that it deserved every Oscar nomination that it got.  Especially Will Smith for best actor.  Very well deserved.  Not only was it a completely different role from his usual ones, he had to play Mohammed Ali....that's as different as it gets.  His expressions and his dialogue delivery were superb. The rest of the actors were well cast too.  The direction was great and the story never bored for a minute.  A great movie, well worth the time.",9,0,0,12 July 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Just kept my eyes glued to the screen.
","Excellent.  Extremely captivating.  Didn't wanna look away for a second. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been an incredible actor (I think so anyway) - I'm not a huge fan of his, but you gotta hand it to the guy - he's an amazing actor.  His expressions and dialogue delivery are very natural.  He pulled this role off perfectly.  Tom Hanks as expected, was great.  This man can do anything.  Anything.  Every role fits him perfectly.  I don't care what this guy plays, I'll go see him everytime.  And of course, Spielberg rules.If you haven't seen this movie, get off the computer, NOW and go and rent it.  No, don't rent it, BUY it.  It's worth every cent!*****/***** 10/10 100% A+",10,1,2,14 December 2003
Memento," Unforgettable.
","Wow...this just has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It was extremely captivating.  Once I understood what was going on, I was hooked. Throughout the whole movie, you're actually trying to get inside Leonard's head and try to feel what he must be going through.  The way that the movie was presented was excellent.  I really liked the idea of the reverse order of events.I was never a big fan of Guy Pearce before this movie, but after watching his splendid performance, I became really interested in his work.  His expressions were totally genuine and he had a really nice way of interacting with the other characters.All in all, a must-see film...highly recommended.",10,0,1,22 May 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp rules!
","Why on earth hasn't Johnny Depp got an Oscar yet????  Even if he doesn't do a movie in a whole year, they should just give him one for being a darn good actor.  Darn great actor, infact! This movie was an adventure.  One that you could go on again and again and again.  Every aspect of the movie was extremely entertaining. As soon as Johnny Depp enters, you know that there's gonna be a hell of a performance. And there was.  That guy can play anything and I really wouldn't mind if he played a pirate for the rest of his life!  His ability to put on almost any accent for any role is absolutely amazing.  He doesn't slip up even for a second. Orlando Bloom looked really good, Keira Knightley looked really pretty and this role suited her well. Geoffrey Rush was amazing, as always. The direction was excellent and the dialogues were hilarious. Very highly recommended! *****/*****",10,1,3,26 December 2003
The English Patient," Excellent = Ralph Fiennes
","Now, here you have one of the best movies ever starring some of the best actors ever....Ralph Fiennes (brilliant, brilliant, brilliant), Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche.  This movie was very touching and extremely well made.  It explores the characters to great depths and gradually unfolds each of their stories.  Every minute was worth watching and it definitely did not disappoint me in any aspect.  Also, it was one of the very few movies which had a very good ending.Ralph Fiennes (as Laszlo De Almasy) was just pure brilliance (and as good looking as one can possibly get).  His performance was just amazing, considering that he is unable to move during most of the movie, so his expressions were absolutely incredible. He has deserved every Oscar nomination that he has got.  Willem Dafoe (Caravaggio), as usual, gave a fine performance to an otherwise, dry character. The best thing about Dafoe is that he can make relatively dull characters actually have their presence felt in the movie. No doubt, one of Hollywood's greatest actors.  Juliette Binoche (Hana), not only looked beautiful, she also showed that she is a superb actress.  Just her expressions in the interaction with Fiennes in the movie did her character complete justice.I just love the way Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) plays her roles.  She just seems so natural to it all.  Her dialogue delivery and facial expressions were excellent.Highly recommended.  10/10.",9,4,7,9 August 2002
Finding Nemo," Best animated picture of all time.
","Amazing animation, amazing voice acting, amazing dialogues, amazing movie!!!!  Every single character in this movie is extraordinary!  I just have to say that Dory is the most hilarious movie character in the history of cinema.  This is one of the best animated feature films of all time and boy does it deserve the Oscar this year! A father goes in search of his son Nemo after he is taken away by a scuba diver and the fun starts from there!  Exciting, thrilling and an entire ocean of laughter from start to finish!  Absolutely brilliant!  The guys from PIXAR have really outdone themselves this time! 10/10   *****/*****  A+++++",10,0,2,23 February 2004
The Others," Very, very creepy.
","First thing's first... Nicole Kidman was absolutely brilliant. This movie raises creepiness to a whole new level.  The direction and suspense level are just excellent.  Very few horror movies are made this way.  The less you see and the more you feel and hear... the scarier it gets.  The main character, Grace, is determined to keep herself and her children protected from strange 'intruders' in the house which she has been living in for five years.  The sudden appearance of three mysterious servants hasn't made it all that easier for her either.  So, you can imagine the extremely tense feeling that Grace is overcome by throughout most of the movie.  And Nicole does the perfect job of keeping that tense expression on her face for the entire duration.  Both of the kids did a great job and though Christopher Eccleston's role was a bit short, he was great too.  Very interesting, full of suspense and some fantastic twists and turns.  Highly recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,19 April 2003
Dead Poets Society," Unforgettable
","I cannot believe this movie isn't on the IMDb Top 250 list. This film was brilliant in every way. Being a student of English Literature myself, I couldn't help but be inspired by Robin Williams', 'Mr. Keating.' The story is just beautiful and the acting is superb. It is one of the very few movies that have made me cry, especially the last 15 minutes. Individual hopes and dreams take a back seat to the pressures of society and family and that eventually becomes to much to bear for one particular student. Everything was played out brilliantly and makes the film simply unforgettable. Robin Williams was awesome, as usual. Robert Sean Leonard was fantastic and a very young Ethan Hawke was great as well. This is a film that will stay with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. :)",10,0,1,30 March 2005
Ed Wood," Extremely entertaining.
","I absolutely loved this movie.  It was extremely entertaining and captured my attention from beginning to end.  Hilarious, sweet and very well directed.  Johnny Depp is one of the most versatile actors I have ever seen, there is no doubt about it.  He has done every type of role and in lots of different looks and accents.  He was absolutely excellent in this movie.  I just loved the way he smiled and delivered his lines in just about every scene. Martin Landau was very interesting to look at as well.  Not only did he give an exceptional performance, he put on a great accent.  Wonderful body language and facial expressions too.  He deserved his Oscar. 
Tim Burton is a very talented director and the way he looks at things it just so interesting.  He has a very unique style about his movies.  I've really liked every movie he's made so far.  And the fact that it was made it black and white gave a perfect mood and setting for it.Everyone else gave really good performances and were well suited to their characters, especially Bill Murray.  Very nice movie, well worth your time.  Highly recommended.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Silent Hill," Best horror movie in years
","Oh man. Oh man oh man oh man. This movie was fantastic. The game scared the hell out of me, but that's not the only reason I wanted to see the movie. I'm a huge Sean Bean fan and I'd watch anything if it had him in it for even half a second. BUT, this movie has SO MANY MORE reasons for people to watch it.The production design is brilliant. The visuals are haunting and eerie and although it doesn't have many 'scary' moments, it has deeply haunting and disturbing visuals, which in the context of the entire story are great. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there. And NOTHING is left out. Nothing is implied. It's all there. The blood, the creatures, the creepy atmosphere.And then we have the siren. The movie gets into full horror mode whenever that siren sounds and 'The Darkness' descends. It quite possibly delivers the creepiest feeling you'll ever have. I completely agree with all those people who said that it's the best game-to-movie adaptation ever.The acting was really good from everyone. The only criticism I have there is that Radha Mitchell needs to work on her American accent a bit. It kind of restricts her expression in her dialogue delivery sometimes.Highly recommended movie, especially for horror fans and not necessarily for just lovers of the game.****/*****",10,0,1,20 September 2006
Cast Away," I really, really liked this movie.
","Wow.  Another well deserved Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks.  Most of this movie is with no dialogue, just Hanks' expressions.  And aren't they one of the best expressions the movie industry has ever seen? 
This movie is great.  It makes you think, makes you wonder.  What would you do if you (literally) lost EVERYTHING and EVERYONE whoever meant anything to you within just a few minutes?  This is what it's about.  One man's desire to live, his struggle to survive.  The hope,that one day he will make it through all this, strengthened by his love for a woman who's face in a photo is the only human face he'll see for years.  His loneliness only adds to his desperation, so much so that he befriends a volleyball, 'Wilson', which he paints a face on (with his blood) and talks to all day.  No replies in return, but just having it there is the only thing keeping him from going totally insane.  Great performance from Helen Hunt too, although her role was short.If you haven't seen this, go and rent it.  Excellent, excellent movie. *****/*****",9,0,0,29 November 2002
The Village," Huh???
","OK.... ummm.... Mr. Shyamalan.... WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU???!!!This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The acting was pretty good, but the movie was pathetic. The 'surprise ending' wasn't even a surprise... it wasn't even an ending... This film started from no where and ended up no where. Throughout the whole thing I kept thinking, 'maybe something will happen now, maybe something will happen now...' Nothing ever happened. Completely over-hyped. The trailer was so cool, but the movie was a disaster. I want my money back.*/*****",1,4,8,5 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Brilliant
","This film was excellent. Absolutely fantastic. The style made you realise immediately that the movie was in the hands of another director. (Nothing against Chris Columbus... I loved the first two movies as well). It was definitely darker and scarier than the previous ones and the acting and effects were superb. The kids have really grown into mature actors and now that they have a bit more practice and experience, they looked and performed great. I haven't read the books, but I loved the story. Emma Thompson did a good job but I feel she was wasted. The movie could have done without those scenes... A very enjoyable experience... awesome film. *****/*****",10,0,0,9 July 2004
American History X," No one beat Edward Norton that year.
","Edward Norton gave the most outstanding performance out of all Hollywood actors in the year this movie came out.  He was too good.  His character went through amazing transformations and his portrayal of Derek was nothing short of brilliant.  This movie was excellent.  Racism is a very sensitive subject to make such a powerful story on and the ending, which was not at all expected, was the main highlight (out of countless other highlights) of the movie. 
Edward Furlong was absolutely fantasic as well.  No doubt, his finest performance.Highly recommended movie. 9/10.",9,0,1,31 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Every single person involved in this movie should have had an Oscar nomination.
","This movie is a classic.  So vibrant, so spectacular, so captivating.  It had every single quality of a great musical.  Not a single song was out of place.  Just by looking at the elaborate sets and costumes, you could tell that a huge amount of effort and passion was put into this.  The story is very ordinary, but the way that Baz Luhrmann has presented it is simply delightful. And the singing... oh dear Lord, Ewan and Nicole's voices!  They were so good!  It didn't look as if they were doing this for the first time (although Ewan did sing in A Life Less Ordinary - but that was just one song), it looked like they had been singing for ages!  By the way, I loved how they turned 'Roxanne' into a tango.  Ok, now for the acting.  I was so surprised that Ewan McGregor didn't get any nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.  He was just great, superb, amazing, excellent.  Not just his singing (and his oh-so-attractive appearance) but his expressions.  You could almost feel every emotion Christian (his character) was feeling, it reflected so clearly on his face while he was singing AND acting.  This guy is a very, very good actor and now we all know he can sing as well!  Nicole Kidman was very impressive and she has also proven that she has a beautiful singing voice as well.  Her performance was brilliant as well and I was glad that she got a nomination.  She looked great too.  She portrayed every aspect of Satine (her character) very genuinely. 
Now anyone who's seen Richard Roxburgh before could almost laugh when they see him in the Duke's role.  He had to change his voice and normal facial appearance and the way that he carried himself was so much suited to the character, that sometimes you didn't even realise that this was Richard. Excellent performance, I loved it.Jim Broadbent is so good at every role that he does.  Even though he got an Oscar for Iris this year, his performance in this movie was great too.  It was a very difficult role, but he played it to perfection. 
I've always been a fan of John Leguizamo's work.  His character was a very difficult one too and he didn't disappoint me at all this time either.  The accent along with the humourous personality of Toulouse Lautrec was nicely done.  There was only one big disappointment and that was that Baz Luhrmann did not get nominated for an Academy Award.  Now that was simply not fair.  This certainly wasn't a movie to be overlooked.  Even if they intentionally did not nominate him, there was no reason for it.  That spectacular, visually stunning piece of work definitely could not have been achieved without him. He's got such an imaginative and artistic outlook on various aspects of life and he really makes very interesting and entertaining films to say the least.  One of the best musicals of all time, definitely.  *****/***** Watch it.",10,1,2,12 December 2002
8 Mile," Eminem!
","Ok... here's the deal.... if you're an Eminem fan and you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  If you're not an Eminem fan and you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  He was great, he was in every scene and he did total justice to his role.  The story's not all that bad either... a guy who just doesn't let go of any opportunity he might get to make a better life for himself and gain the respect of people around him, most of whom are of a different race.  Quite meaningful and well written.  9/10.",9,0,0,28 January 2003
The Insider," Highly recommended.
","If there was ever a film to keep you absorbed through over 150 minutes, it's this one.  Everything was just excellent.  It just keeps you in suspense the entire time and there wasn't a single boring moment.  Brilliant performances by Russell Crowe and Al Pacino.  I gotta say, they were robbed of their Oscars.  Nobody deserved it more than they did that year.  Michael Mann's direction was superb as usual.  Brilliant movie.",10,1,1,20 June 2002

It really changes your perspective on game shows... Watch it if you have the time...it's worth it.Cheers.",Null,0,0,16 June 2002
The Dark Knight," Ledger owns this movie.
","Well the movie was great, no doubt about that. Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and it's no surprise that he has made another amazing movie. This one was much darker than the first one and each and every character, no matter how long or short their appearance, was fascinating.Now let's talk performances:Christian Bale is always interesting to watch. The best Batman by far and the best Bruce Wayne too. He's an exceptional actor and just flows into any role he does. I really like the fact that he changes his voice when he's in the Batsuit. I don't think any of the other actors who've played Batman ever did this. It really adds to the character and makes for brilliant screen presence.Heath Ledger. One word: *WOW*. I've never been a big fan of his, but I've seen enough of his work to figure out that he was capable of some pretty decent acting. Boy is that an understatement. 'Decent' doesn't even begin describe the level of complete submission of his entire being to becoming Joker in this movie. If you had no idea who was playing the Joker in this movie, you would *never*, *EVER* have guessed it was Heath Ledger. It was as though he ceased to become Heath Ledger, the actor, and just morphed into The Joker from the Batman universe. It wasn't a 'performance', it was a total transformation. The best thing that I liked about it is, he took it to the extreme, but he never crossed the line into over-acting the part. You see him in his funniest, darkest and creepiest moments, but every time, it seems like he looks past the make-up and the costumes and the posture and just delivers sharp and philosophical dialogue in that creepy, creepy voice with such effortlessness. What brilliant preparation.Best movie villain performance I have ever seen. Everyone else was great. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine. Gary Oldman: always cool... solid performances all round. Great to see Eric Roberts! Nice little cameo from William Fichtner as well and Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and go see it as soon as you can.",10,3,7,19 July 2008
National Treasure," Decent Entertainment
","First thing's first... the main reason I went to see this movie was because of Sean Bean... he's one of my all time favourite actors. I just made it a point that whether or not this movie was actually good, I would force myself to like it because he was in it. I actually genuinely enjoyed the movie. :) I though it was great. I walked out of there quite entertained. I wasn't really concerned with it's similarities to The DaVinci Code or whether or not some of the historical information was accurate... I just had a good time watching the story unravel on screen. The performances were pretty decent. Nicolas Cage, as usual, does a pretty good job with the lead role, Diane Kruger looks great and Justin Bartha was very likable... the guy has perfect comic timing. Sean Bean, of course, in my humble opinion, was brilliant as the greedy, deceitful villain. A great thing about him is that he never overplays his characters. He sets exactly the right tone needed for a specific situation. This film was well worth 2 hours of my time. ****/*****",9,4,4,22 December 2004
The Godfather: Part III," I liked it.
","Well, this movie was good.  I think it was a good ending to a great saga, with one of the saddest endings I've seen.  Al Pacino was brilliant as always, Andy Garcia did a fine job,(and looked great, I might add), Diane Keaton was great too and everyone else was well cast.  EXCEPT Sofia Coppolla.  I don't even know how to describe how terrible her performance was.  It was a major let down of the movie.  Besides that, it was really well directed and didn't bore for a minute.",10,3,7,29 June 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Superb.
","Well, there was never any doubt that Ron Howard's directorial skills could go to great limits.  Once again, he and the rest of his crew have made another extraordinary film.  It was excellent.  One of the best pieces of film making of modern times.  A Beautiful Mind was definitely the best film of 2001. Russell Crowe was just brilliant. Even though I was rooting for Denzel Washington at the Oscars, I would not have been surprised at all if Russell Crowe ended up with the Best Actor.  His performance was exceptional.  Most of us would not have seen the real John Nash before this, but if Crowe's acting was anything to go by, I think that's exactly how he must have been. His dialogue delivery and expressions were wonderful.  I believe that the entire movie rested on his shoulders and he did a splendid job. As for Jennifer Connelly, I truly think that she deserved her Oscar as well. You could almost feel all those emotions in her eyes. This movie is definitely a masterpiece.  Superb in all departments.  You've missed out on a lot if you haven't seen this.",10,0,1,13 July 2002

Go watch it if you haven't seen it... as soon as you can. Highly recommended.",10,3,5,9 December 2002
The Departed," Brilliant, brilliant performances
","OK now... I've never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I have always believed that he is a brilliant actor. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', 'Gangs of New York', 'Catch Me If You Can', 'The Aviator' and now 'The Departed.' All fantastic performances. This might be a bit premature for me to say, but after four Golden Globe nominations with one win, plus two Oscar nominations... come on Academy people, hand over an Oscar to this guy, he deserves it. (Martin Scorcese's is a whole other request... I've given up on that one). He really held his own against an acting powerhouse like Jack Nicholson (who was, of course, great as well). In fact there were times when he actually stole the scene from him. If ever there was a character you sympathised with from the very beginning, it was this guy. And DiCaprio's performance really helped build that feeling.Matt Damon has been steadily pacing himself as an actor of immense worth as well. His career speaks for itself. Solid performances every time. It was nice to see him play a character like this though. I agree with people here who say he should do this type of role more often. He was believable, it worked.Martin Sheen was, well, Martin Sheen. Great screen presence.Alec Baldwin was hilarious. I love the way he just disappears into his characters. He just 'blends in' with the atmosphere created by the scene. Swift, sharp dialogue execution. I love it.But Mark Wahlberg stole the show for me. He didn't have as much screen time as the others, but man oh man, he just killed it. Brilliant performance. There are times when you wonder whether he's going to be in the next scene just so you can see him again. He stood out in every scene he was in: in the beginning with Sheen and DiCaprio and then later with Nicholson, Baldwin and Damon. I think he's always had this in him, but he really needed a quality film like this (Scorcese being the director has gotta help) to show what he can really do. I was blown away by his performance.In fact there wasn't a hair out of line in all the performances. We've all been hearing it for weeks and I'll just say it again... this is a superbly-cast movie.Now with the acting out of the way, let's get to the rest of the movie. It was thrilling, it was suspenseful and it took me a few minutes to get used to the ending, but the longer I thought about it, the more I liked it. I haven't seen 'Internal Affairs' so I have no idea how similar this is to that. But I don't like making too many comparisons anyway. This movie stands out quite prominently on its own. A bit of a slow start, but things really heat up after the first hour.Highly recommended. :-) ****/***** 9/10.",9,2,4,14 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I'm speechless. Overwhelmed.
","It was dark.It was depressing.It was AWESOME!!! Absolutely fantastic. The changeover from the Republic to the Empire was very subtle. Nicely done.Hayden Christensen was brilliant. His intensity, his expressions... it all added to the darkness of the movie. Ian McDiarmid rules. He just does. He *is* the Emperor. And Ewan McGregor is, of course, the man! He was amazing. Natalie was really good too. It just broke my heart to see her cry.Man, oh man, when Anakin stepped into the Younglings chamber and ignited his lightsaber, it just sent chills up and down my spine. That was one of the most bone-chilling scenes in cinema history. Poor kids. That reaffirmed my belief that Vader was not at all someone to be sympathised with. Even though he did all of that out of love, it was still brutal. No excuse for that. Hayden's transformation was awesome.The scene where he confronts Padme before he chokes her was great as well. The acting was just amazing.One thing that really impressed me was the intense, chilling, pauses in dialogue in the conversations between Palpatine and Anakin. It really added to the tension. Great for dramatic effect.And then of course there's the Vader suit. How fantastic was that??!!! Action sequences! I think the lightsaber got more screen time in this episode than in all other episodes combined. Absolutely amazing fight sequences.This movie answered a lot of questions and George Lucas did a perfect job in linking the two trilogies together. You just wanna run back home and watch ANH. Especially after the scene where Darth Vader and the Emperor are looking out towards the construction of the Death Star, standing side by side.As I walked out of the theatre, I couldn't help waving to the people waiting in line outside to go in and giving them a two thumbs up to tell let them know how awesome it was. Hehehe. I looked at the posters of all the other movies and thought, man, they have no idea what they're up against.Great stuff, Mr. Lucas. YOU ROCK!!!",10,5,10,19 May 2005
Casino Royale," The human James Bond
","For all those using the word 'pure' to describe Bond in this movie: I agree 110 per cent. Before I get to Daniel Craig (fantastic, *fantastic*), I'd just like to say that I'm among those people who say that this movie is the best Bond movie yet. It was more real, more believable, more from-planet-Earth. The plot was simple enough to understand (sorry, but it was), the characters were less outrageous and we finally learn that Bond is after all, one among us. Human. He thinks and he *feels* - instead of just looking fantastic (which Craig evidently had no problem with).Now I'll talk about him. Yes, absolutely, without a doubt - best Bond ever. We all know Sean Connery was brilliant, Pierce Brosnan was awesome etc etc etc, but Daniel Craig gave Bond that human touch that has always been lacking from the other movies. He didn't have many fancy gadgets to play with, so all he could do was show us what he could do with James Bond as a character and not as a complicated piece of machinery. He's always been a fine actor and I have to say, I was really looking forward to how he'd do in a Bond film. I loved what he did with Bond. He added a new dimension to the character and did not, for a second, look like he was uncomfortable in the least. Not even for a nano-second did I have to think, 'Man, they made the wrong choice here. So-and-so could have been so much better.' I can't wait to see him in the next one.Mads Mikkelsen as a villain was great too. Quiet, subtle, there to do the job. Nothing over-the-top. No over-acting. (Kind of like Sean Bean's Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye - good, solid acting). I really liked Eva Green in this movie as well. She was way more likable and less annoying than Bond girls of the past. She has a really natural, loose acting style. No artificiality.Boy oh boy, this movie was refreshing. It was like a breath of fresh air after being caught up in a huge cloud of dense smog. With the exception of GoldenEye, which was awesome, the double-o movies just seemed to be one brainless, action-packed drag after another. It was so good just to see a *real* story, with *real* characters and great acting - with the action thrown in for good measure (and that itself was a whole lot of fun too).Doesn't matter if you're a Bond fan or not, GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it. If it's not screening anymore where you are and you're waiting for the DVD release, grab it immediately.10/10, *****/***** A++++++",10,2,4,11 December 2006
300," Incredibly stunning, extremely beautiful and just plain *cool*!
","This is quite possibly the *coolest* movie I have ever seen. It went completely beyond my expectations. I read some great reviews about it, heard people say how fantastic it was, but it wasn't until I actually saw it myself that I realised its incredible *awesome-ness*. Scene after scene was just sheer brilliance. From the direction, to the acting, to the production design. Everything about it was amazing. What impressed me most were the stunning visuals. Everything you see, every millimetre of the screen is beautiful. Earthy colours. Nothing but brown, red and green. Brilliant, rich, blood red capes on the Spartan soldiers stand out against the rich brown and gold tones and shades of everything else. Unlike other adaptations, this one truly feels like a moving graphic novel. Frame after frame just flows flawlessly on the screen. Good, solid acting. Nothing underplayed. Nothing over-the-top. Gerry Butler is always interesting to watch - he makes an impressive King Leonidas, totally worthy of the part. Lena Headey makes a strong queen and great support play by David Wenham and Michael Fassbender. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Best movie I've seen so far this year and probably for the rest of the year. Like I said: it's just so *cool*. A+++++, *****/*****, 10/10.",10,0,3,12 April 2007
Gangs of New York," Long, but worth it.
","I am not American nor do I know the history of New York, but if this film is anything to go by, I think that the New York of that time period would not have been a very pleasant place to live. This film is very graphic and rather disturbing. But it is worth sitting through for the acting.A lot of people have said that Daniel Day-Lewis should have won the best actor Oscar... and I won't say anything different. He was just phenomenal. Pure genius. He totally transformed himself into Bill the Butcher and not for one second could you see any part of Daniel the Actor. The expressions, the body-language, the dialogue delivery... absolutely brilliant. It's a shame that he hasn't done a lot more films but maybe that's where the 'quality over quantity' factor comes in. He could easily be doing lots of movies, but I guess his greatness lies in the fact that he can come out every few years with a performance like his life depended on it and then disappear. One thing's for sure, he never loses his charm. One of the greatest of all time, definitely. I've never been a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I do believe that he is an exceptional actor. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?', 'Catch Me If You Can' and now this one... all solid, intense performances. He really got into character and did a great job despite the accent slip-ups.The less said about Cameron Diaz, the better. I will agree with everyone who has said that she was less annoying in this movie than usual. Decent performance, but nothing noteworthy.The rest of the supporting cast is great. Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reily... all fine actors. And then of course, Liam Neeson. His role was short, but whatever he does is always excellent.My rating: 8/10.",8,0,1,3 November 2004
