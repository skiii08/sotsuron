Skyfall," WAAAY over-hyped and OVERRATED !
","Sorry folks, don't believe the hype, this is nowhere near 'best,Bond,ever' nonsense reviews, actually both Casino Royale and the much maligned Quantum of Solace were better, The best scene in the movie is the opening scene before the credits and theme song, it's downhill from there, I thought Javier Bardem's performance was the best thing about the movie and found myself somewhat sympathetic to his character ,as he had clear and specific reasons for his actions, namely revenge for being betrayed by his country and specifically 'M'. Without giving away too much, you leave the movie realizing Bond was a complete failure at every assignment in the movie,and a Bond that fails is not a Bond I care to see, you also realize that if 'X' had simply happened before 'Y' , none of the other lives would have been lost. Another bone of contention is the dark filming and poorly choreographed fight scenes,almost two thirds of this movie is filmed in dark, drab,locations or in silhouette, not the bright exotic locales of a Bond film. I also have a disdain for the underlying theme of the film, which is the sacrifice of the self for the so-called 'greater good', this has been the 'con' of every communist, socialist, dictator, and religious extremist for hundreds of years now.",3,16,35,12 November 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Actually Pretty Damn Good, flawed but much better than the critics reviews
","This movie was much better than the poor reviews it got, and actually better than I hoped, and I'm no softy when it comes to reviewing movies but I think both this and Robin Hood got a bad rap by the critics, both movies while flawed were still quite enjoyable. I think this movie fell victim to a bad ad campaign that actually made the movie seem LESS interesting than it really is. Gemma Arterton shines in this, her most verbose role to date, and Gylenhaal is actually pretty damn good as well, though outdone by his co-star, and Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as 'comic relief' for the movie. I think the most ridiculous part of the whole movie is the damn British accents (WHY !???). To compare it to Bruckheimers' other famous franchise I would say it is faaar better than 'Pirates 3', slightly better than 'Pirates 2' and not as good as the original 'Pirates', that should give you a good idea of what to expect.",8,1,3,3 June 2010
Drive," Don't believe the Hype... ,Pointless, Boring exercise in Nihilism
","I want my two hours back. I am convinced critics will only give a positive review if a movie is depressing and nihilistic. Don't believe the hype that this is some cinematic artistic achievement, when over 30 minutes of a two hour run time is filled with dead silence or overly long awkward pauses in dialogue , it's not 'hip and artistic' it's just boring, nor is it 'stylish and clever' when our main protagonist , who clearly has the upper hand at the end, defies common sense by putting himself needlessly in danger and not taking necessary precautions. I also don't find the retro 80s styling and soundtrack of a movie set in modern times to be 'artistic brilliance' either, it's just distracting and awkward. Even our heroes' intentions seem to defy common sense,...risk your life for a girl you didn't even screw,a kid that's not yours, and her ex-con husband who doesn't even like you, that's not heroic, that's idiotic. If you want to be duped by critics who would have you believe this is 'stylish and clever neo noir' go ahead and waste your time and money, but trust me ,once you dissect this movie for what it really is, it becomes a pointless exercise in nihilism whose plot points defy logic, common sense, and motivation, all glossed over by an over-stylized retro-80s feel and boring silence and self contemplation. Were there some good action sequences?, yes, but if you add them all up they take up about ten minutes of the run time. This one is a DVD rental at best, and by the way, if you saw this directors other film, 'Valhalla Rising', even though the subject matter may seem completely different the theme and ending are basically exactly the same.",Null,160,300,19 September 2011
Godzilla," an HONEST review by a lifelong Godzilla fan
","As a child of the 70s and 80s I grew up with the TOHO Godzilla movies, as a pre-teen Godzilla movies ( and dinosaurs) were my favorite type of movies, those of you from the east coast may remember the annual tradition of the Thanksgiving (and Friday after) Godzilla marathons on channel 9 in the late 70s early 80s. fast forward to 1998 and Roland Emmerich rapes my childhood memories,...nuff said about that debacle. Now fast forward again to 2014 and the Americans once again take on the legendary Big 'G', can they finally get it right?.......well sort of. I'm not going to give you a play-by -play of the whole movie,too many other reviewers have already done that,..I'm going to tell you what you really need to know. Let's start with the good : Godzilla LOOKS pretty damn good (though the complaints of looking somewhat 'hefty' have merit), and equally important they seem to have gotten the NATURE of the beast mostly correct, Godzilla is the anti-hero of the monster world, he is not evil,he is heroic, yet also indifferent to humankind. WHEN (and that's the key issue)you see Godzilla it is truly exhilarating and you really want to just stare in awe of this creature as long as possible. The monster fights are pretty good WHEN they are actually showing them, and let's face it ,that is what most of us really want in a Godzilla movie. This is definitely a 'movie theatre' movie and should be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Bryan Cranston is great for as long as you get to see him. That's about it for the good, it may not sound like much but it makes up for a lot of the bad and still justifies a ticket purchase.Now to the bad: Way ,way ,waaaay too much buildup and not nearly enough payoff. Bryan Cranston's character and acting talents are completely squandered. At first you are sympathetic to the human element, but after almost 90 minutes and over 20 'cutaways' to the human scenes you start becoming downright bored and even resentful, to the point that you wish the MUTOS and Godzilla would wipe them all out already so we can focus on the monsters. Stupid Military dialogue. Only one species of MUTO. ......and now to biggest gripe of all........ Godzilla, the movies' namesake, the big 'G', Gojira, King of all Monsters gets a whopping 10 minutes of screen time of an entire 2 hour movie,..and if you think I am exaggerating don't take my word, I want you to bring an actual stopwatch with you, start it when 'G' is on screen and stop it at each cutaway when he is offscreen ,then check the total time when the movie ends. He gets about 1 minute midway through the movie at his introduction and about 9 minutes at the end (not counting the interspersed cutaways).Bottom Line: as the saying goes ,you only get one chance to make a first impression, and director Gareth Edwards has somewhat squandered his by taking what could have been a 'Great' movie and making it into a mere 'good' one by being waaay too reserved with showing the monsters. It's still worthy of a viewing on the bigscreen, it's miles above the 98 version, it's fertile ground to make a much better sequel, but I really wish they could have gotten it right the first time around by giving us exactly what we came for......GODZILLA !!!!",7,2,5,16 May 2014
