The Rock," Fast-paced and visually stunning action-adventure
","Again, an incredibly vivid and colourful film from director Michael Bay. The trademark screen shots (Nick Cage after his Ferrari F355 was crushed, Wil Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys after the chase scene) and the film's passionate score mark this as one of Bay's best.  Great actors playing great roles with possibly the best lines ever delivered: 'Your best?...' The shower scene between Michael Biehn and Ed Harris, absolutely fantastic.",9,1,1,20 December 1998
Blade II," Crunching Bones Hidden Biter
","Blade II is a disgusting and vile movie that will make you wish you never leave sunlight. For some people that's a good thing, and if you can look past the poor camera work, the thin plot, and the cheesy one-liners, you might find an earnest attempt at making your skin crawl.There where plenty of times mine did.Between seeing the explicit internals of a new super breed of addict-like vampire, and the final fight scene chock full of bone crunching, snapping, and breaking, I was left hoping for the movie to end.As the movie starts, the Blade character himself reduces him communication to grunts, snarls, and finger points. But as the film requires more dialogue, the audience is blessed with such quality one-liners as, 'Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer' and the final line, 'You didn't think I forgot you, did you?'And then there's the plot: Blade enlists the help of his former-mentor-turned-vampire Whistler, who was supposed to have died in the first movie. While the Vampire Council seeks the help of Blade and asks him to lead the 'Blood Pack', a tactical vampire team formed and trained to kill him. Can the Blood Pack resist with guns in their hands and Blade in their sights? Can Blade control his need to shoot every vampire he sees as he's lead into their hangout?Ooh, the suspense! Rent it, and find out!",4,1,5,23 March 2002
