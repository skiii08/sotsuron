Insidious: Chapter 2," My favourite horror movie of all time.
","Loved chapter 1 and in my opinion this is even better. It really is a scary movie. Got a movie night with some friends and want a good really scary movie? Just watch this movie (after you have watched the first one of course) and your good to go. All I can say is, don't listen to the bad reviews here, I'm not sure why people don't like it since I personally love the story and the scares of the movie. This makes it (The Conjuring 1&2 are very close as well) My favourite horror movie of all time!",10,0,1,18 July 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Way better than than I expected it to be!
","I must say after stranger tides I wasn't expecting much of this movie but since I liked the first 3 movies I thought it wasn't a bad idea to watch this one. And I must say I was quite surprised, the movie was actually pretty good it felt much like POTC 1 was which I loved. Especially the ending of this movie was really good to me. The only thing I didn't like was that Jack was mostly drunk during the film and therefore he didn't fully feel the same as the smart jack in the first 3 movies. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie and in the case of a POTC 6, I would definitely go back to the cinema to watch it.EDIT: I've given it a bit more thought and watched it for a second time and now feel a little bit different about the movie. I still love the ending, but I just really hate jack in this movie, he's just stupid, all his smart planning is gone. It's just luck that get's him true. The thing I hate the most are all the continuity errors, things don't make sense compared to the other movies.",3,1,3,25 June 2017
