First Man," A Beautiful Film
","What a great movie. For thousands of years humans held close to a variety of myths about the moon and space. Lunar is derived from the name Luna who was thought to be the moon goddess. Then just 66 years after we learned to fly, we sent people on a nearly week long trip through space and a person walked on the moon. We did it six times. It was so difficult and costly we havent that we havent returned in almost 50 years. We've been doing this sort of thing since we walked on two legs. There were seas and continents to cross, mountains to climb, skies to travel and people like me think there is a Mars to visit and beyond.Thats the spirit of this movie. It portrays the efforts of the wives, children, scientists, engineers and astronauts that stretched the boundaries of human achievement. If you long to comprehend life outside of your personal experience and see a world of possibilities like many did back then you will love 'The First Man'.The acting is superb. The story and directing is wonderful and Im listening to the score as I write this. Its powerful and emotional.Im stunned that I shared a 400 seat theater with only 4 other people while Halloween and others were sold out. If this is the case everywhere, take advantage of the elbow room and check this out while its in the theaters.",10,2,6,20 October 2018
