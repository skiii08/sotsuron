Alien 3," Good horror. *Spoilers*
","One of the most thrilling movies of the 80's gets a conclusion, and it's not pretty. In fact it is ugly.It turns out the alien queen left some eggs on board the spaceship and they wreck havoc with the ship's computer killing Hicks, Newt and sending android Bishop to the scrap heap.If matters can't get worse for Ripley she ends up on a prison planet which is filled with a right bunch of ugly bastards, she gets her head shaved,impregnated by Charles Dance, impregnated by the Alien and that pesky alien is back again.The Alien trilogy could have ended in so many different ways yet it goes for the super sad and tragic ending. It's still a good horror. As a the closer for such a pair of classic movies, it's way too depressing.",7,2,2,16 November 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bloody Good
","I just can't say enough good things about this movie. A real high octane thriller of a movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who after sleeping in a coma for 4 years after being left for dead, seeks revenge from her killers. Tarantino offers a visual feast leaving subtle clues in each scene to tell the story; Bills hanker chief with his name on it but you can't see him, Death list 5 already has a name scored off it. Nice wee touches like that. Its not as dialogue driven as his previous movies Its his bloodiest movie yet, more action orientated but its done so well and so blatantly over the top. There's also a Manga style cartoon to tell the origins of one of The Brides Nemesis' very over the top and violent and when it comes to the real life action, its just as over the top. The music is well picked and accompanies each scene perfectly. One of the tracks used was a piece of music Tarantino heard in a hotel lobby in Japan. Only Tarantino could choose so wisely. The movie is a homage to Japanese action movies; like Reservoir Dogs its not 100% original nonetheless it doesn't stop it being a relentless action packed treat.",9,1,3,31 January 2007
