The Rock," Good God, this movie is so not given its full right.
","This movie goes action-packed from its kick-off on through its ending, it's cool and all you have to do is sit back and grab your popcorn, and watch these artistic actors do the job. And with a fine pitching at the main idea, it is not about breaking out of prison, but breaking INTO it, where the benefits collide, and there then exists 'good evil' and 'bad angels'. Watch this movie, it is so great though being old.8/10",8,3,4,19 October 2017
Requiem for a Dream," Beautifully painful
","A simple movie, a simple plot, top notch acting and directing, top notch pacing, and that's it, it's the secret formula and key to creating this golden piece. It diagnoses a dilemma of drugs, poor living conditions, how things can turn out the way you don't want, despair, and much more. It is a blockbuster, but not in no way an immortal legacy.8/10",8,1,2,19 October 2017
Your Name.," A Wonderful Piece of Art
","I saw this movie top the list on MAL, and people were so fascinated by it, so I gave it my money and watched it. And guess what, it was so worth it.It is a simple piece of art nailed in every single aspect you can think of, animating, story, twists, entertaining, voice-acting, music, and the momentum it can cast, or rather the Aura it has. It is exceptional and sensational. And the open ending leaves a fantastically confusing impression on everyone who's done watching it.I recommend this to everyone, Kimi No Na Wa is a masterpiece ! 9/10",9,3,5,14 October 2017
Source Code," Unique
","So I watched this movie after having watched Tom Cruise's Edge of Tomorrow, which represent the same idea, but then, I realized Source Code is older, and makes more sense nevertheless (To me at least) and all you have to have as an film environment is a train where the problem as a whole lies. Jake Gyllenhaal perfected his role once again, the ending leaves you confused, it gives you mixed signals of whether it is a happy or sad ending.The movie isn't long, it's 1h30min only, somehow the movie loses a bit of steam midway but then regains it.Awesome. 8.5/10",9,1,2,19 October 2017
50 First Dates," Underrated, horribly Underrated.
","This is an excellent movie, I enjoyed every bit of it. It has a cleverish dialogue, a good ascending of events, and a good ending. Long story short, this is a movie that should NOT die. Sure, it has some downs, for example the underwhelming thought-woulda- been-funny scenes (like the penguin's). The hispanic dude was really good though, he had this fine impact on the movie.Anyways, you gotta give this movie a shot, it is hilarious, and fantastic.",8,18,19,10 May 2017
Se7en," Timeless Gem, Clever and Thrilling to the Climax
","I should've watched this a decade ago, it's a masterpiece, it kept me thinking all the time, the suspense and the atmosphere are both unheard- of. Vehement scenes, gory, and tragic aura casting off from beginning to end.This movie is the perfect example of Drama, Crime, and Serial-killer genre of movies. It had everything you need, and I liked how the main duo (Pitt and Freeman) fit in with each other.Se7en discusses the philosophy of the deadly sins subtly from the serial killer shoes, and yes, not every case comes to a satisfying end. Se7en is much more than you expect, whether it is 2017, 2025 or 2040, go to watch it now if you haven't yet.9/10",9,0,0,21 October 2017
Fight Club," Drama at its finest, no minute wasted.
","Fight Club is the movie that rules the Drama, it represents the perfection of a movie, for its story-line, storyboard, acting, concept, and most importantly intensity and entertainment. The movie seemed mediocre at first, but as the movie advances, you realize it is no ordinary movie, and there is something big, well, I strongly recommend this excellence of a movie.10/10 Would watch again",10,0,1,30 September 2017
Memento," I ran out of words
","Memento is a masterpiece that only fits the concept, no such portraying will ever exist again. It is depicted in a way that is mysterious, confusing, mind-blowing and ENTERTAINING ! You really sit through the movie questioning what the hell is happening and spend too much time thinking that you forget the flow of the movie and even miss some of the details which will lead to even bigger confusion.It is not a movie that you'll watch once, if you are a fan of mind-freak movies, this is yours.
9/10",9,1,2,29 December 2017
Memento," One hell of an Enigma to kick off the 21th century !
","Easy on my mind, fellow director, there is nobody on Earth that can grasp what's going on in this movie that easily, it's totally confusing, in a good way, and that's the point. It's going backwards obviously, but, there are many things questionable, it represents the riddle life the protagonist lives, the movie goes on from only one perspective, the And-ill protagonist's perspective, you see things according to his mind, to his eyes, and one of the cleverest things to do is to make things go backwards to really feel the puzzle dizzy you around. I wonder how long it took 'em to write, edit and even flawless-ize this movie ? This is my second time watching and I hardly catch a breath thinking.9/10. Masterpiece.",9,1,3,19 October 2017
World War Z," A Typical Zombie Movie
","Despite all the negative reviews out there, World War Z mostly delivered as a typical Zombie movie. It has gore, violence, intense scenes, a plot (albeit not too genuine), and most of all, good acting, as we see Brad Pitt shine again.It is a little bit long, that's true, but it was a right decision to make the ending short, it gave a tasty ending after the successful heroism.There are a few underwhelming scenes, but that's fine, it's just to slow down the pace so the scenes that are meant to make your adrenaline rush would work. At last, the huge budget and the cool effects whatsoever, be it makeup, or special effects, they all were on point. It all served the movie.7/10 just grab your popcorn and stop thinking too much",7,2,3,28 October 2017
Ted," I lol'ed
","Ted is a movie, well, rather a puppet that came to life because of a Xmas wish, and becomes best friends with its owner since childhood, and somehow, the duo makes a good time-killing movie, with fine humor including dirty jokes and whatnot, I found myself laughing spontaneously from time to time, the movie gets serious sometimes, but generally, this movie is nice.7/10",7,0,1,20 October 2017
Creed," A Classic, Rocky shines again
","I am a big fan of Sylvester Stallone, and having seen him get old made me upset and afraid of his not doing any more 'boxing' movies like the old classics. Guess I was wrong, I watched this movie back in the theater and this is the second time. It is what I needed, good cast, and with Sylvester Stallone, there is no way in hell I would dislike this movie. I loved it. Although when you come think of it, it isn't a real big deal for people who aren't big fans of Sylvester Stallone like I am. Suppose it's just me.8/10",8,2,2,20 October 2017
Spotlight," So what ?
","I don't get it, all these positive reviews, I read the short description of the movie, I really liked the idea, it's a very sensitive subject that had to be discussed sooner or later, but 60 minutes into the movie and I dropped it, like seriously ? It's so boring, all these names thrown here and there, it's dialogue-heavy for no obvious reason, there is no important dialogue going on, just a bunch of workers, handling a case, interviewing a bunch of victims, and voil√†, nothing more. I felt underwhelmed, bored to death. If it were not for the subject-matter, or the actors, this movie would get a zero. So for subject matter and actors' performances : 4/10",4,3,12,13 April 2018
Dear John," Leaves so much to be desired.
","Least to say about Dear John is that it's a typical Romance movie. With not-so- much to fill in the entire playtime, decent Soundtracks, acting, and directing. It didn't deliver much and came out short, although it could've done otherwise, potential wasted.I am not a big fan of Channing Tatum, but I like his movies, most of them, well as for this one, I wasn't very contented by his acting, and it felt a little bit made-up, if I am not wrong. On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried nailed her role very well. But that all doesn't matter, and is nothing when put face to face next to the plot line importance, because that's where all the criticism should go. Provided that the movie is based on a book, I felt like this has much to give as an adaption, but I was wrong, the adaption was made in a wrong way, it was wrongly paced, and the screenplay left so much to be desired.I can't say quite much without spoiling. 6.5/10",6,0,0,28 October 2017
Final Destination 2," Better than Part 1, a good sequel with a different cast
","So the cast is almost totally changed, except for the girl who belonged to 'Death Design list' in the first part, 'Clear'. The deaths in this part are a lot more convincing, however, I am not really totally contented about the plot, the first plot was better but still, 'takes from it some yet gives to it some other' they say, right ? So Final Destination 1 and 2 are equally good but are not identical except for the concept. It was a good movie to kill time. 6.5~7/10",7,0,0,20 October 2017
Horrible Bosses," Hilarious.
","I've had great long bursts of laughter during this movie, the trio is the best you can see in a comedic movie, and the dialogue is comedy-smart, plus the movie-environment works just very well.This movie in particular, considering that it's got a second part, works just like a build-up for that 2nd part, so I am regarding it like a build- up, this is a franchise, really. The concept was really good albeit simple.Horrible Bosses and Hilarious are those ones who work under them !8/10",8,0,0,21 October 2017
21 Jump Street," Laughed to Tears
","Man, I don't know where I start, this movie was the therapy of my day, week, year or whatever. If it were to cost more I would pay more, considering it would make me laugh this much. I've had a great time watching this solely at the first time then with my friends who hadn't seen it too at my second time. I love the acting, the jokes which aren't all dirty (That's what most modern movies rely on nowadays), and most importantly the great ending and the whole point from this movie is the plot. Bro, I loved this, if you haven't watched it, waste no time, go ahead and order this.9/10",9,0,1,20 October 2017
American Hustle," Unhateable, it is, beautiful.
","I feel like I don't need much reason to like this movie because the director is already aware of his masterpiece-ish work. He is so clever and what he had put in this movie proves many things, this movie is beautiful on so many aspects, acting, directing, and also, the not-so-much-to-tell- but-figure-it-for-yourself point. It is so indirect, non-straightforward, but at the same time contenting and entertaining to watch, due to the hilarious dialogue and progression of events, as well as the genius in all that.8/10 Would watch again",8,1,3,21 October 2017
Nightcrawler," A fine and realistic Blessing in Disguise,
","This movie is exactly the movie that needn't be so big, so great, but the simple idea and plot hooks you to it, it makes you love it, the fine acting, and the underlying messages, and beyond-and-between-the-lines thoughts that hit the nail on the head. I liked it, Jake Gyllenhaal's blessed his role, and gave it just as much Charisma as it required.Nightcrawler is a movie that you certainly won't hate. 8/10",8,0,0,19 October 2017
Split," Not bad, but definitely overrated
","The only period of the movie that felt so entertaining to see is the first quarter, anything else was please-just-pass. The concept granted the director the potential to come up with something great, especially with the perfect acting of James McAvoy. The final quarter of the movie just felt so ridiculous, and what is Bruce Willis doing there ? If this is having a sequel (which is likely) I would give it a try.So you either totally hate this movie or like it, I somehow fell in between. 6/10",6,2,5,20 October 2017
American Psycho," A Movie that only Bale can chew
","Christian Bale's performance in this movie really astonished me, and somehow it felt really in place, on point, as if the movie was destined to be his from the very beginning. His face and the sarcastic script, and the laughable pacing of events were all a mixture of art of the director. It is a classic; a gory, violent, funny, simple classic that is dedicated to entertaining us, without feeling it coming.8/10",8,0,0,21 October 2017
Knowing," Knowing
","The weird thing about this review is that I watched it 3 years ago and I partially forgot things that went on in this movie. But it's fine, cause needless to say, it's a good movie, and I really enjoyed it back then, and it had me in the edge of my seat a few times, and the ending is epic as well, it deals with the idea that the world be at stake, and how eventually to save it.I really liked it, and I might as well re-watch it, kudos to Nicolas Cage for his magnificent acting ! 7/10",7,4,5,19 October 2017
Face_Off," Good concept that deserved this movie.
","It is pretty interesting to think that two people who are no friends, but absolute foes to each others, would switch faces, it is a really promising concept. Now we see Cage and Travolta lead this movie, as the two foes, they delivered one hell of a suspenseful movie, with lots of twists and on-the-edge-of-the-seat moments. What a great classical that will never lose to time no matter how old.. 8.5/10",9,4,6,21 October 2017
Dunkirk," A decent budget wasted in a horrendous way
","I can't give this movie above 4. The 4 Stars would go to Good acting and good visuals, 2 stars for the heroes who died in war. Anything else ? This movie failed us.I won't complain about the soundtrack because it only becomes plain and obvious when the crowd's attention isn't fully sunken into the movie. There were no scenes at all to absorb that attention, so, our attention turned to the soundtrack, visuals, and whatnots.I couldn't find any depth in the characters, but it's fine, it was a war movie with not so much to do with the characters. But well ? Where is the Action ? Where is the suspense ? And there are a lot of ridiculous plotholes cited by other reviewers. This is not like Christopher Nolan, who absolutely disappointed me. When the movie ended, I didn't feel anything, or actually I did, I felt disappointment and non-contentment. Last thing I would say, This is VASTLY overrated. Save your money for something else. 4/10",4,1,1,25 December 2017
The Intouchables," Unbelievably wonderful. A perfect depiction of a real story
","I don't remember the last I have been THIS touched by a real story put into a film with such great actors, such details, such directing, such pacing, and such an ending, it is beautiful, how everything developed forwards, and how sad things can turn into the most joyful things ever, the best thing about this is that it factually OCCURRED. And I am happy I got the opportunity to hear the story, or rather 'watch' it as a movie. Thanks to the directors, thanks to the cast, and most importantly, SALUTE to Driss and Philippe and wish you both the best in your lives !9/10",9,1,3,20 October 2017
The Conjuring 2," A horror movie that made me laugh ? Woah.
","Guys, am I missing something ? I somehow laughed in each and every scene, is it meant to scare the little kids or my Adrenaline is not functioning ? I haven't watched the first part (I definitely won't) but this enough proves how bad it is. The ending was god-awful, it left me unsatisfied to the extremest extent. The effects are so bad as well. I would definitely recommend it to no one, despite of the amount of praise it is receiving; well, to me ? It doesn't deserve it.2/10",2,0,2,26 September 2017
The Butterfly Effect," Fantastic
","The Butterfly Effect is a movie that starts so strong, and goes on like that until it finishes, it is disturbing and intense, and so confusing, until the ending which clarifies everything.It is well written and deserves all the praise, it deals with alternate universes within the scope of realism as well as the butterfly effect which is the main concept of this movie. Everything was handled pretty well and I will definitely watch this again !9/10",9,0,0,20 October 2017
Wreck-It Ralph," Outstanding
","How good is it to see a movie about old video gaming, and an inside look at the fanciful characters' lives ? Well, if it is Wreck-it Ralph ? then hell boy is it good ! I loved this movie so much, I laughed to tears sometimes, I loved the ending, I loved the development, I adored everything. It is probably one of the best must-be-acknowledged animation movies.8.5/10",8,1,1,19 October 2017
The Pianist," A pianist going through survival !
","You can't believe how much I liked this movie, as a pianist myself, and without having read the about-summary, I expected it to be piano-exclusive kind of movie. I was wrong, but then, I was lucky. It turned out to be a real adaption for Wladyslaw Szpilman's miserable attempt to survive the dense era of the World War 2, and oh boy was it intense ! I felt like I am in Szpilman's shoes ! The movie is long, and detailed, it depicts everything, it makes you feel everything. And man, the ending, I had goosebumps, it was wonderful, I love how they cut the 'Chopin's Ballade No.1' piece, they removed the happy parts, and kept only the relieving-then-intense parts. It is just beautiful. (This is no spoiler by no means)May you rest in peace Wladyslaw Szpilman, You are a legend, and your life made a great legendary movie !9/10",9,0,0,19 October 2017
The Mist," Subtract the ending and you get a mediocre movie
","Note : There are no major spoilers in this review. If you're gonna review a movie, you shouldn't base it upon the 'general impression' after having watched it, you should base it upon all the thoughts and emotions during each and every minute throughout the movie, and also consider the 'cinematographic' aspects thereof.See, it is a typical-apocalyptic-movie. Had it not been for the ending, I would grump for the waste of time about the rest of the movie which is, Let's say 'Hide 'n Seek'. You have a bunch of people surrounded in the mall trying to survive, limiting the entire environment of the movie to a certain mall. Then you have under- powered human beings trying to fight a supernatural prowess. The idea of the movie was pretty simple and anybody can come up with that, also with such plot, but there are a few points here and there which were subtle but valid, and the major point was : Don't mess with Mother Nature, I guess ?At first, I thought it's a Christian-ish propaganda with that woman's shouting out biblical verses, but then, no, the plot changes. It also explained how primitively lunatic people can get when they are facing the apocalypse. I don't really know if this is exactly a horror movie, because I cannot count how many times I had jump-scares, I suppose only 1, more or less.The bad thing is, I am used to such horror, and I have seen many things coming a few minutes before, only then did I know it was none other than an average plot.The pros of this movie would be : The ending and the fine screenplay and scriptThe cons are too many to cite, I wish they had shortened the movie to 1h30mn instead of 2 hours, removing all the fruitless and underwhelming scenes. Also, the movie tried to build sympathy for people who die, but it didn't work out quite well.You see, even the ending is flawed, I can't buy why the dude killed 'them', including his kid... and then 'The Mist' seems to be resolved and there, you got yourself trolled. However, this is not the only time the Movie had been illogical, it ticked me off several times because of the lack of logic.There is nothing I would complain about music or acting, they were pretty average and I wouldn't really consider criticizing.Pretty much more to say, but too long a review I guess... 6/10.",6,2,2,30 September 2017
22 Jump Street," A Sequel that kept it up to the first part
","The only thing that I found weird is the whereabouts of Schmidt's girlfriend from the first part, they didn't really make any mentioning for her, which is obviously weird, but that aside, I loved this movie, it isn't any quality-lower than the first part, we're seeing different jokes, different plot line, same point, not straying too far from the franchise, and most importantly our favorite cast leads. Need you more ? NO.I would really like to see 23 jump street or whatever but the ending scenes clarified that it needs great originality to come up with another part, but let's just hope !9/10 Definitely would watch again",9,1,2,20 October 2017
Amadeus," Spectacular, Perfect.
","I'm a classical pianist, I like Mozart's works so much, and I finally had the opportunity to know what had occurred in his life, yes, this movie was long, wait, was it ? 3 hours? It didn't feel like it, I really loved it.I loved how everything was depicted from Antonio Salieri's perspective. How refreshing. It depicted everything from his childhood on through his manhood 'til he dies. Thanks to everyone who participated in the creation of this masterpiece, and it deserved all the wins ! 9/10",9,0,0,20 October 2017
Big Hero 6," Wow.
","All the effort put into the movie hasn't gone in vain, it's an incredible movie for all ages, I watched this with my siblings, we had one hell of a night, this animation movie is great and wonderful, and the animation is tremendous; let alone how entertaining the plot is. It is the kind of movie that won't leave you space or time to yawn, this movie fully contented me. It deserved the time, and it really isn't strange for an adult to like it, it's just the layout models which give this 'childish' look of it, while it is much more than that.8.5/10",8,1,3,19 October 2017
Prisoners," Sit down and feel every scene.
","Yes, go watch this movie, it is awesome. It is intensive, the realistic plot and the open ending, and good acting and great directing, the fine plot- twisting and crime layout and plotting, I nearly had enough of this movie let alone the open ending ! Man I want more ! Go watch this movie with your friends, it is worth your time and money !",9,2,3,19 October 2017
Men in Black," Totally deserved the Oscar.
","Men in Black is a franchise that turned a serious idea into a comedic, yet still-serious movie. Will Smith goes into action by joining this secret organization which seems to be the only status that knows about aliens, then yes, fight the villain who could cause Earth's destruction, or so it seems. It's not that simple. There are a few smart spots here and there I didn't notice only after willing to write this review.I laughed hard, and I definitely enjoyed it. 8/10",8,0,1,19 October 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Forgetting is a blessing'
","The idea of this movie as you might have read the plot summary, is two lovers adoring each but it eventually turns out to be a failure, they try to forget, it is a struggle, because feelings can never be dismissed, or forsaken. That is the simple message of the movie, and is quite the originality that uniquely classified this movie as one of the best concerning the 'mind-washing' genre. There is nothing to criticize in this movie, it is a fine piece of work, kudos to all the staff.8/10",8,1,3,19 October 2017
Pulp Fiction," When you don't really know why you loved a movie
","I will keep this short, Pulp Fiction is a great movie, it has a clever screen writing and astounding acting, directing, and other aspects. The Movie goes on, and you be like 'What, why' but you just forget it because it's hilarious, and genuine.By the movie's ending, I realized I liked the movie, and enjoyed every bit of it, and til now I don't really know the reason, I may well re-watch it, 'cuz it's worth another look-at.8/10",8,0,1,30 September 2017
Sausage Party," Not Bad
","I am not into Animated Movies. But this one ? It is inappropriate for kids, that's true, but why make it Animated ? That's because it's the only style as which it'd be portrayed.It made a fine hour, sometimes laughed, sometimes concentrated, but mostly didn't yawn or felt awkwardness during the film. It's not that bad, although full of dirty jokes, which is the last resort of comedy when you're out of humorous ideas.",6,1,1,29 December 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Phenomenal
","Tom Cruise, well done, you have rolled in yet another piece of great art. Edge of Tomorrow contains an idea that in some way creates a problem, which keeps the movie attenders hooked, and wondering, about how this problem is solved. Whenever time is manipulated, you know you should be as original as possible, well, they changed the scope as of how Time was manipulated. Thereby, I enjoyed this movie, I liked the idea, I liked the acting, I liked every minute, it's finely paced, kudos to everyone. Tom Cruise, you will never stop giving us great movies will you ?9/10",9,0,1,19 October 2017
Inception," Pre-eminent, stellar, excellent, it deserves all the praise.
","When you see your boy Leonardo DiCaprio role, and Christopher Nolan heads it all, you get pumped and your expectations fly to the climax.This movie is refreshing, and its pace is perfect, Leonardo DiCaprio and other were fitting for their roles, the dialogue is neat, effects, ending and beginning, you can find what you want, and the concept is really interesting, there are no mistakes I could figure out whatsoever.I loved this movie. 9/10",9,0,1,30 September 2017
Lord of War," Stuck in the hands of corruption.
","Lord of War is a simple of example of how corrupt the world is from the view of an arms dealer, and how money doesn't solve everything, rather, how money can drain the person's morality but then drains him himself completely.Nicolas Cage's flawless acting which suited the arms dealer persona very well is a principal in this movie, and without it, I wouldn't even have liked the protagonist, or rather, the antagonist, you can't distinguish who's good and who's bad anymore. Lord of War is a war of morals, philosophy, benefits, pride and most importantly money.Give it a try ! 7/10",7,1,2,19 October 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A Good Movie, but Definitely Not Number 1!!
","Cons : This movie is kinda very slow-paced, but it might fit its nature and its plot.However, this should not be the first movie of all time, because it , as a matter of fact, isn't. The Godfather, for instance, deserves the title.From an other perspective, it's kinda unfortunate to not see Red playing the Harmonica, that would have been a good part too...I can see the whole 'Brooks' arc a waste of time, that could've been shrunk within very few minutes.Halas ! Few more cons would be stated , but I'd go with the pros : A movie that beats all expectations, so is the plot, and so does it, because whenever you see a scene , you expect something, but it goes otherwise.The ending is really good, few movies manage to strike the bullseye when it comes to endings. The Shawshank redemption did the job fortunately, and it delivered.The plot's exciting-radiation was on its climax with the last quarter of the movie.Worth 8 and not 9.3.",6,0,0,5 August 2016
Blade Runner," Slightly Overrated, not boring, but not too masterful, it somehow falls in between
","Blade Runner 1982 is one of those movies which take place in the future, with a vast boost of scientific and digital evolution.
Surprisingly, the concept was pretty good, but the movie could've been shortened to 1h30m, it felt so slow and underwhelming in many parts.
One of the biggest weaknesses is, it felt so incoherent, between each part and another, and how 'this' led to 'that', a viewer would be all confused
Now, to logic, the plot wasn't so 'heroic', so that's a pro, but the con is, it didn't feel anything special type thing at all.
This movie plays the role of bedrock for Blade Runner 2049. So it's a must-see-first.
6.5/10",6,1,3,28 December 2017
Am√©lie," Merde du Merde, not Cr√™me de la CR√ãME !
","So I am not French, don't judge the summary above. But to make it short, this is the worst movie I have ever watched, no exaggeration, but sincere judgment. It's terribly awful, so much that I want my 2 hours back !Now let's make it clear, I have never rated a movie (1 star, or under 6 stars) like this one ever before, actually I am easy-pleased by things, movies, and stuff, but this one went too far beyond Sh*t. I watched this with my friend, neither me nor him had enjoyed it so far, it was so awkward and unfunny, the narrator was so annoying. Giving every character a special persona ? That didn't work out, it was so shitty, it made a lot of jokes about sex and stuff, and that didn't work out as well. The main character was lovely during the first 4 minutes but the plot ruined her for good.I wished the movie had ended so soon, I felt like I am torturing my friend along with his time. If this was horribly rated I'd not blame myself... But...18th... seriously ?!This howsoever has no point at all, you finish watching it then you be like :'What have I just watched? What's the point?' the only winner of the movie is Am√©lie who hung out with a porn-shop guy, seriously...Charlie Chaplin would have murdered himself if he had heard the lame jokes in this movie. They don't even fit a kid's sense of humour, let alone this movie is rated for Mature people.It doesn't deserve a 10, a 9, but a negative rating. Mince ! I know I am 15 years late, but a legendary movie never dies. This one lasted so long not enough, it shouldn't have.Let us all pray to God that we don't witness another Merde, Amen.",1,8,17,19 December 2016
Final Destination," Good
","6.5 out of 10 and here's why : The concept is good, an idea like this deserves quite a depiction, but there it is, Final Destination is a movie where people are facing a timed bomb-y Death, and they know it. It is a struggle against death. The only thing I hated is how deaths aren't completely incidental and they depicted it as some sort of 'transparent-yet-dark soul' which causes circumstances to change and voil√†, death ! If only it were fully incidental then the scope of reality would've been preserved, without having to lean on supernatural stuff. Acting was good, though, so is the plot.",7,0,0,20 October 2017
The Truman Show," So Original, Handled with Caress.
","This movie is about a person called 'Truman' whose life is monitored 24/7 and streamed as a live broadcast to the whole world since his birth, under a show's title that is 'The Truman Show'. The idea is original and I don't suppose it has ever been represented before.What's coming next is the plot summary in other words, no spoilers intended. This protagonist of ours, he lives his life spontaneously as if everyone does so as well, but they turn out to be just a controllable part of the show. But what if Truman finds it fishy and starts to wonder, is this really my life, or someone is controlling it ...?You see, the messages are deep, you can't manipulate someone's life, and a few more.The ending is open, it may the solution, but you never know.8.5/10",9,0,1,19 October 2017
The Matrix," The Matrix Trilogy is a legacy that will never die.
","Do I recommend this ? Hell yeah I do. This review is not limited to the first part (which is solely incomplete without the followups).My impression on the three movies is : Woah boy ! Totally worth the money. I love how everything seemed so perfect even though the movie is kind of old, but believe, it'll never get old. The story, the idea, the effects, the editing, the acting, the action-packing, and most importantly, A POINT out of all this.Clearly it mixed philosophy and action to create an intense tone, you can feel all the suspense during those intelligently-written dialogues.If you haven't watched the Matrix, I can say you're decades late, go do it, now. 9/10",9,0,1,30 September 2017
Deadpool," Greater than I expected
","Oh boy did I enjoy Deadpool, aside from being hilarious and the main character's lovable charisma and persona, it delivered an intense action- packed dramatically-storylined movie with no chance of yawning or leaving your place at any minute, it was fast-paced, and very clever of a dialogue that was !Although I am not so much into this superhero kinda thing, but guess what ? I've already lent the DVD to my friends because Deadpool is just that good. 9/10",9,1,3,21 October 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Enjoyed each and every minute !
","This movie is intense and funny, it's brilliant ! The fighting scenes are epic ! The plot isn't something 'very' genuine and the character development is predictable but why not ? I really liked this movie, it has many twists.Absolutely looking forwards to watching its second part ! 9/10",9,1,3,19 October 2017
Her," A pleasant experience for a promising concept
","'Her' presents a promising concept that is yet to be applied in real life which is to create a machine that simulates feelings. HER does just that, it represents an experience of love between a human and an AI with a humanish feelings. It felt really entertaining to watch, although I don't anticipate it delivered THAT much, it was also suspenseful a few times, gladdening a few other times.7~7.5/10",7,0,0,21 October 2017
The Nice Guys," Avoid this Rubbish. Don't say I didn't warn you.
","For starters, there are many things wrong about this movie, the pace, the atmosphere, the plot, and even the characters themselves. Ryan played his character well but his mate Ross totally screwed it up, it felt like he's doing the director a favor, it felt like he was not paid, he was truly underwhelming and anti-climatic, which makes us wonder, where has our Gladiator's star gone ?Well, that wouldn't be a big problem if the screenplay and the dialogue were good, unfortunately they left a lot to desire. The jokes were low-tier flat and weak, somehow the incoherent pace between scenes and the bad timing of most jokes made them feel shoved by force.Lots of users will disagree with this, I understand, you loved this movie because you got brainwashed that this movie is good, hence the good rating. But trust me, it left me with a bad mood, a really bad one. I regret spending money and time on this.I watched this a day after watching Game Night. Surprisingly this movie got an IMDb Score of 7.4, whereas Game Night got only a 7. This makes you think that this movie is much better, well, turned out I was pretty wrong.It is boring, nonsensical, anti-climatic and worthless at best. If you're some 15-yo teenager or some like-all-movies type, take it, but watch it with low expectations.Deserves a one. 1/10",1,3,14,19 March 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Beautiful Depiction of a Real Story
","Least I can say is that the real story contained in this movie has been perfectly depicted; from acting down to effects. I enjoyed this movie. As you can see, the first half (hour) consists of the journey to participating in the army, and a love story, the second half however represents the war events, it's a beautiful mixture of the two, and the ending was just so good, especially having showcased real interviews with the heroes.Recommended, 8/10",8,2,3,14 October 2017
Donnie Darko," You don't know what you're missing.
","An undying masterpiece to be forever glorified, a movie that will leave you entirely speechless, a movie that you will speak about to your friends, a movie that will cause your mind to mark an error, a movie that will leave you wonder, and question, and feel, just about everything. It is 'Donnie Darko', do not let the title fool you, it is the beginning of Jake Gyllenhaal's star career.A short review is a disgrace to this movie, but if I start writing what's in my mind right now, it will be worth a hundred lines.10/10 Unforgettably genius",10,1,2,19 October 2017
