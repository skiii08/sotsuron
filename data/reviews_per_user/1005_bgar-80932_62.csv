The Avengers," Very good
","This is the best MCU film I've watched yet. I liked the combo of everyone even though some of it is a little silly. Hawkeye and Black Widow are kinda silly characters that you wouldn't think would really be that effective fighting off the alien invasion but you can look past it because it's a superhero movie. Thought Sam Jackson was a really good character. Loki honestly wasn't the best villain and it felt like either Thor, Iron Man, or the Hulk could beat him alone. He'd beat Captain America and the rest of the crew but he wasn't the toughest villain although he did have that army with him which made him more dangerous and he could convert people to his side. Pretty good though.",8,0,1,13 March 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Pretty good, not quite great
","I was about to rate this a 7 until something came up that I didn't realize. Regardless it's a good movie. It has excellent visuals that I don't know if they're beat anywhere. The story is good for sci-fi these days. Most of the stuff I've watched lately is more looks that having an actual good story a la mute and altered carbon. This is better than those but it still has flaws. Let's face is Ryan Goslin is shit. If he was better this movie had potential to be a masterpiece. Once Harrison Ford came around the movie became so much better. That said this is probably one of Ryan Goslin's best roles ever, he's a robot in real life so this was him. Drive sucked is what I'm saying. Good movie though and a satisfying conclusion, could have been amazing though.",7,1,4,19 June 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the first
",The first Kill Bill was kinda non-sense KungFu crazy action. It had some cool ways to film it but I'm not a big Kung Fu fan so I didn't love it. This one focused a bit more on dialogue than the fighting and I enjoyed that more. The dialogue to me still wasn't near as good as the majority of Tarantino films so I still didn't love it but this was for sure better. This one had some cool interesting ways to film as well though and had some really cool scenes. It wrapped it up nicely and now I feel no need to ever watch these again.,6,1,4,21 December 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Better than Ironman
",This is basically the exact same movie as Ironman as in the end it's the Hulk fighting a different version of the Hulk just like in Ironman it's Ironman vs. a guy in a similar Ironman suit. That said Ironman had a ridiculous escape scene that was non-sense so I should have knocked it down another peg. I like the tie in at the end of the movie as well. Nothing outstanding though.,7,0,2,1 December 2018
Iron Man 3," Repetitive
",What I'm going to say right away will make it sound weird that I said it's repetitive because this movie actually does switch it up. It adds different cool abilities for the Iron Man suits and makes Tony Stark deal with a villain in part without his suit. That said just the whole way it feels like no consequence just like the other two Iron Man movies. I lost interest somewhere around the middle but finished it because I did like the Avengers and want to have it set up so I watched all of them leading up to the Avengers Age of Ultron. It just felt too easy for me I guess.,6,0,3,24 March 2019
It," Felt a bit jumbled
",I liked the movie and I liked some of the kids and think they did a good job acting (especially Bill who's like the leader of the group and has a lisp) but regardless it feels a little disjointed. Something doesn't click perfectly for whatever reason. It may be because I've read the book and the book flips from the kids to when they are older and doing this again basically. It looks good and everything and the clown is a little creepy but it just feels like it just barely missed on something. I'm actually really looking forward to part two which will be the adults one as it already has a lot of good actors. I think they can probably carry it a little better than the kids did.,7,0,0,6 July 2018
Hereditary," Legit creepy
","I'm not big into horror movies but I heart how well this did so I had to check it out. It was one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen honestly. One of the first tragedies actually jarred me and kept me with a pit in my stomach for a good 10 minutes. It's a testimony to the acting, the realistic portrayal of both dealing with loss and losing your mind, as well as the cinematic and musical elements. I think it lost steam near the end and I didn't necessarily like the way it wound up but it's still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Well done.",7,1,3,12 February 2019
Wind River," Good movie with great end
",The movie was good the whole way through but it was definitely building to the end. The end was great. Everything about the last like half hour or something was perfect.,8,0,0,17 October 2018
Se7en," Not re-watchable
",This is a good movie that turns into something better in the last half. The end really was great and memorable and I think that's the only reason why this movie is held in such high regard. It was fairly standard until then and frankly I don't even think Pitt was doing that well in the first half of the movie. Once you know what happens you don't really need to watch it again. All that said it's still a really good movie for one watch.,8,0,1,10 October 2018
Train to Busan," Legitimately great
","I kind of thought I was done with the Zombie flick but upon hearing the buzz for this one I decided to finally give it a go. It was a good decision. First thing I liked is how quick everything took off, the zombies turned quick and they were fast as hell. They also had a great cast. The big dude was my favorite and I got quite a bit of satisfaction when he ran over and elbowed a zombie to the ground in the train station to save the little girl. The main guy evolved as well and quit his selfish ways for his daughter. The end was a serious tear jerker for me which is something I hadn't expected in a zombie movie. Might be because I'm a dad now but it hit me.",8,1,2,27 February 2020
12 Angry Men," Great acting and great dialogue
","This is one of the rare black and white movie that stands the test of time for me. It's 12 jurors who are put in charge of the fate of a young man in a murder trial. It's not just guilty or not guilty because if they choose guilty the man gets the death penalty. This have more gravity to it and it's the main reason one juror opposes guilty at the beginning. Throughout the process they talk it out and see maybe he is guilty, maybe he isn't, but there is more reasonable doubt than there was at first glance with the trial. It's a movie all in one room and that is 62 years old so the odds were in the favor of me not enjoying it but I get why this is rated so highly and I enjoyed it. I probably won't watch it again but the acting was pretty good and it's very impressive to stand up this far down the road.",8,0,0,21 August 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Better than expected
","It's a fantasy film so of course you have to suspend your belief a bit, especially as it relates to the young children with no experience knowing how to fight so well. That said this was a fun kid movie. There was lots of mystery and the kids finding out what was going on was fun. The little girl Lucy was really entertaining and did a great job with her expressions. Made me feel like how a kid really would react to these bizarre circumstances. The battle itself was actually pretty good too beside the main boy I think Peter just swinging with everything he had on every swing and it being effective. Like I said you have to suspend belief a bit. My wife and I watched it all in one go and that's difficult for us sometimes as we have a newborn and are tired a lot.",7,0,0,13 November 2019
The Babadook," Okay
",A single mother has a tough time caring after a really troubled child who's like 6 or 7 by herself because the husband died the day he was born. That's surely enough to mess a little kid up and the kid was pretty screwed up in the first half. The mom some reason reads a really scary book to him which makes it harder and harder for both of them to sleep. Weird things happen and the pair think something is out to get them. I'm not sure if it is or if it's sleep deprivation and drugs along with that book that create a scary feeling for the pair. I'm not sure if I liked the ending which could have made it good for me but overall I just wasn't that entertained. The actors did a good job and I don't have complaints for them I was just a little bored and never scared.,5,0,1,24 July 2018
Us," Good follow up
",I think some of this film doesn't make the most sense. I also think that the dad was pretty goofy making jokes the whole time his family is at risk of getting murdered. That said I was still engaged and it was still pretty entertaining. The 'evil' version of the little girl especially excelled. She was creepy. The end was a little goofy but I think overall it just felt a little rushed. I think Jordan Peele was trying to capitalize on Get Out and that's why it feels a little unpolished. Still a very solid effort though in my opinion.,7,1,3,3 December 2019
The Irishman," Dissapointing
","I like Martin Scorsese but this felt like a boring history lesson and I love history. The acting was fine, these guys know how to act like mob guys but it was just a drag for the most part. It's a 3.5 hour movie that felt like five. Some of the de-aging thing killed it as well. Robert Deniro can't look young no matter what you do. There was one scene where he's supposed to be young and beating up someone but he was physically so stiff and could hardly move his arms. It's hard to take someone serious as a bruiser when they have crazy arthritis.",6,2,6,24 March 2020
Spider-Man 3," Fairly bad
",This isn't the worst movie of all time or anything but it's bad. Seeing Toby Macguire turn 'badass' and walk around shooting finger guns at everyone was legitimately hard to watch. He's tough to watch in general. Seeing this after seeing James Franco in much better things is weird too. Overall it's slow and like I said when spiderman tries to be hard because of that black stuff and dealing with MJ it's really really bad. The fighting was okay.,4,0,0,4 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Just fun
",A lot of Marvel movies try to be funny and serious and to me it takes away from the thing a bit. They're all at least a decent watch but if the end of the world is threatened you shouldn't be making stupid little one liners all the time. This movie took the fun role the whole way like Guardians of the Galaxy did in my opinion. Yes there's a big threat and everything but the whole way it's just fun. Thor fighting Hulk. A crazy escape from a colorful bizarre world. It just never took itself all that seriously and to me that's good. It needs to be all in or all out so I rank this as one of the best Marvel movies out there right up there with Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers. I'm only up to this one though so I still have like half of them left to watch. My main gripe on this was it was a little long for a fun flick like that. Should have been like an hour and a half although I don't know what needed to be cut.,8,1,8,31 May 2019
The Hateful Eight," Pretty good
","I'm a huge Tarantino fan and it's mainly because of the dialogue in his movies. They're known for the over the top violence as well but the dialogue is what really sells it. This movie has both of those and it doesn't seem near as long as it is. I still feel like it's missing something and isn't quite on the level of Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Bastards, and Reservoir Dogs but it probably fits right in the middle of his films.",7,0,2,5 December 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Didn't suck me in
",I could tell this was a good movie and wanted to love it because I like fantasy but it didn't suck me in. I think it's because it followed the fairy tale format they just made it darker. I like fantasy but if it's too much in line with a fairy tale it's not as interesting to me. The end was pretty satisfying to me though.,6,0,4,8 February 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Average
","I don't have many notes on this, marvel is pretty much all the same and I kind of lost interest when they brought back Sam Jackson. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised when he died. In this end everything was predictable and the fights were just average.",6,2,4,5 April 2019
Interstellar," Very close
",The film had amazing acting and incredible visuals and ideas. Christopher Nolan really went all in with this one and I thought it was so close to be a classic. Every actor and actress did a great job and they really made you feel for the family getting ripped apart to try to save the human race. I really liked how they showed people's survivor instincts as well as their selfishness. That felt real. Some of the end I didn't love but it was still a really cool movie. Some of the visuals and cinematography was great and I loved the silence during the explosions. I'd say it was a little too long and I didn't love the end otherwise I'd have given this a higher score.,7,1,3,23 February 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Great genre bender
","The main plot of the story is a mother trying to get justice for her daughter who was raped and killed 7 months ago while the cops have no leads. She tries to get this justice by putting up some billboards putting the cops, particularly the chief (Woody Harrelson) on blast. For a movie like this it has a ton of laughs on the way which is why I say genre bending. Her plan worked to and extent in that it brings the case to the forefront but it has a ton of unforeseen ramifications. The chief actually has cancer and winds up killing himself (although he wrote a note saying it wasn't because of her billboards). This inspired a horrible cop in the unit (I think Sam Rockwell) to throw a guy who put the billboards up out of a two story window which causes him to lose his job. You'd think he'd get an assault charge here as well but there's a lot of things like that you have to just overlook in this movie. For whatever reason the same cop that did that also got a note from the chief which inspired him to be a good cop and try to find the killer. He failed but settles on possibly going with that mom to try to kill a different rapist. Oh and the mom burned down the police station and badly burnt Rockwell's face at some point but he ain't mad at her. Sounds like non-sense but the movie's legitimately great.",8,0,0,17 July 2018
Ant-Man," Everyone loves Paul Rudd
",Movie was pretty decent but didn't blow me away. Paul Rudd is great in just about everything though so he makes it worth watching for sure. His powers are more effective than I would think too. I can see how he'd actually be a factor down the road in the Avengers.,7,0,1,30 April 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good origin story
","This is one of the better 'origin' stories from marvel that I've seen. Thor might have been better but this is better than the Hulk or Iron Man in my opinion. It may just be because the villains are Nazis and everyone loves Nazis dying, not sure. That said I thought it was pretty good and it didn't feel too long like some of these Marvel ones do for me. It doesn't do anything different but it's good and now I'm more interesting in the Avengers. I've seen it before in theaters but it's been a long time and I'm not huge into the superheros but I'm trying it out.",7,0,1,12 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," As advertised
",This movie has some pretty good acting and shows Queen starting up all until Freddie Mercury's death of aids. Rami Malek seems like a perfect Freddy Murphy although I've never watched Murphy's interviews or anything like that. Feels right though and it felt right seeing their creative process making some goofy songs. The music is great though and that's the main reason I watched the movie. The movie features most of my favorite Queen songs and it brings back some nostalgia. Really enjoyable movie although it's not something I'd probably re-watch.,8,2,2,22 January 2020
Bird Box," Pretty darn good
",Sandra Bullock is a great actor and she holds this together for sure. The kids do pretty well too and so do a few of the survivors. Overall it's an interesting story with great acting and a decent end. It's not perfect. It's not action packed. It did what a good story should do and made me care for the characters though.,8,0,1,29 December 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Good comedy/drama
","This movie has been on lists forever so I'm glad I finally watched it. In general I don't really think Robin Williams is as funny as everyone else does and talking fast/switching thoughts really fast doesn't really do it for me. That was the same here although there are some good lines for sure which is the same in all his for me, he's not bad just not my favorite comedian. I probably would have rated it worse but it turns into a good drama like halfway through the movie. I found that aspect far more compelling. Still, I liked it and was satisfied with the movie for sure. The guy was just there to make the war more bearable and that's what he did.",7,0,0,10 June 2018
Watchmen," Better the 2nd viewing
","I saw this movie when it came out so 9 years ago now and was sorta meh on it. I think I was hoping it was going to be like Sin City after seeing how stylized it was and it's not that movie not at all. That doesn't mean it was bad and I actually liked it a lot more this viewing. Most everything was good. The story was really cool and much better than all the marvel nonsense out these days. The action was fine but didn't stand out. The characters were deep. There's more thinking going on here than the typical super hero movie and that's a good thing. It's a world where caped heroes had retired basically but came out of hiding after one of their own got killed. A plot that affects the whole world though is revealed when investigating his death and it goes from there. Basically the pacing of the moving is the only thing I thought was a bit off but still MUCH MUCH better than I remembered.
And no it's not as good as Sin City, Sin City is a masterpiece.",7,0,0,6 August 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Good but not the masterpiece I was hoping
","This movie is quite good. Visually it looks great, there's good music that fits, and there's a good story with plenty of comedy mixed in. The cast is pretty good and like I said it was a pretty good story. Multiple spider-men all wind up in the same universe because some guy 'Kingpin' is trying to get his family back and they all have to team up in order to get back to their own universe before they basically disintegrate. I'm saying all good things so you may wonder why I only gave it a 7. I think maybe I just had heard too much hype before seeing this honestly. It just didn't blow my mind like I was hoping.",7,1,2,26 April 2019
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Underrated
",I don't ever hear anyone talk about this movie but it's actually a pretty great parody of 'Walk the Line'. John C. Reilly kills it as Dewey Cox a young kid who was cast away from his family and goes down as a music legend. The comedy beats you over the head with the lines and it's intentional and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. The music is actually really quality too and adds to making it a great comedy rather than a good one. It shows the whole life of Dewey Cox and I for sure recommend it. It even had a nice Jonah Hill cameo that I forgot about.,7,0,0,27 June 2018
Apocalypse Now," Not as good as advertised
",I watched this movie because I heard it was a classic and honestly it just didn't do it for me. The idea is interesting but I just don't get it I guess. The idea is Martin Sheen's character is in the US armed forces during Nam and he gets a mission to assassinate on of their our who has gone rogue and is in Cambodia. The guy he's supposed to kill had basically gone crazy and was somewhat of a cult leader to the Cambodians. Then Sheen goes semi-crazy as well. That's basically the whole movie now you don't have to go watch.,5,3,8,28 September 2017
Being John Malkovich," Bizarre but good
",This film really revels in the weird and somehow turns out a decent product. It's not my favorite film or anything but it's such a crazy concept that somehow is pretty good and hard to look away. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz really nailed it. I think my favorite part of the movies is Cusack's complete apathy towards his life like the fact that they live with all these random animals and Diaz will like ask him about one and he won't know their names. He lives with a chimp and has no idea it's name. That's crazy. There's random other little things like that that make it an enjoyable experience. This is now the second time I've watched it and both times many years down the road I came up with a similar conclusion about it. For a movie about a portal into someone else's body it is much better than expected.,7,0,1,18 September 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Decent
",The movie doesn't do anything great or blow my mind or anything but it had solid action and solid acting. The scene where's there's Captain America and 5 heroes fighting against Iron Man and the other 5 was pretty good action. Not sure why they always have to try and throw comedy into the fights but whatever that's the MCU formula. I like it when Paul Rudd does it but a lot of the others don't land.,7,0,2,11 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Decent end
",I'm glad to get to the finale of these movies and am probably done with marvel. They're good popcorn movies but there isn't any staying power in my mind. They're all too similar. This one ended alright though and had some good scenes. That said the captain marvel just running through a ship crap annoyed me. Also when she had the stones all the women showed up randomly to protect her as if this huge battle wasnt going on and they just happened to be in the same spot. There was a little less jokes here which I like. If it's a pretty much end of the world situation I dont want all the jokes. Pick a tone. Overall though I'm happy to have finished it.,7,2,8,24 December 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Typical blockbuster
",This trilogy is referred to as one of the best trilogies out there so I gave it a shot. It just felt like a regular blockbuster to me. Decent. I felt for Franco and Caesar but overall kind of meh. I'm not sure why it seemed like all of the apes got smart. Caesar made sense and the one who was in the circus who learned sign language made sense but the rest started following Caesar like they were as intelligent. I don't know much about groups of apes and maybe they do just follow the alpha but they were operating with intelligence when Caesar told half to go on the bridge lines and half to go under the bridge. Maybe it's reasonable but it didn't feel like it. Catching the humans by surprise seemed a bit reasonable though but I can't fathom why there would be 3 movies. In the 2nd one people would just exterminate them. I might give it a shot anyways though.,7,0,0,10 January 2020
City of God," Feels authentic
","I don't have time for much of a review but I will give a few thoughts while they are fresh. Whoever directed this did a great job of showing the time pass as well as giving a real feel of the life in the slums there. Only after the movie did I realize it was based on a true story which makes sense because it seemed so authentic. Life is just different there. Morality and mortality are thought of differently there than for those of us who have lived an easy life. It made me care for the good guys. I was pretty damn sad when Benny got put down even though I knew he would. I was pretty happy Rocket made it out when the cards were against him. That's a sign of a good movie to me, when it actually makes me care about the characters, most don't.",8,0,0,30 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Good end
",I've decided to go ahead and finish up with End Game and then probably call it quits with Marvel. Marvel's decent but nothing ever blows me away because it always has to be a mix with serious/funny. Problem is it's not actually funny and just ruins the moment 9 times out of 10. Yes I get that in real life people use humor to deal with tragic situations such as at a funeral but I don't need a 'witty quip' in the middle of a fight to the death. It takes you out of it and makes it seem like the moment isn't as significant. The last fight at Wakanda was dope though I have to give it credit there. It also had a pretty intriguing end that made me want to throw on the next one so it did something good there for sure. The enormity of the situation was actually felt there and I'm intrigued to see it end. I guess Spiderman is part of phase 3 but whatever I'm watching Ant-Man and the Wasp then Endgame then probably being done with Marvel forever and not spending my time on movies I only find average. That's a really dumb use of my time and I'm not blaming anyone for liking the movies as they are well done but don't resonate enough with me.,7,0,1,1 August 2019
Gone Girl," Interesting end
",This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,8,2,2,7 August 2018
Get Out," Great and different
",The movie was an excellent directing debut for Jordan Peele. It had a creepy vibe all throughout. A young black guy and his white girlfriend were taking a weekend trip to meet her parents. Everything seemed nice except little things that he was catching onto. The servants at the house were black and seemed a little blank I guess. They seemed off at least and it gave him pause. Also her brother was aggressive towards him and the mom practiced hypnotism. Eventually he figures it all out and it has a very satisfying end. His best friend is a TSA agent who was pretty good comic relief as well.,8,1,5,27 June 2018
The Lion King," Still good
",There's a lot of negative reviews here but it's still a good movie. It doesn't flow as well as the first one and some of the songs aren't as good in my opinion but it's still a quality flick for sure. Timon and Pumba were pretty funny still and overall it still felt like Lion King. The animated one is a classic and one of the best of all time though so this falls short of that but it's still worth watching.,8,0,3,29 January 2020
A Quiet Place," Cool idea and good acting
",The movie certainly has a cool idea and I like the acting it just didn't make me as tense as I feel it was supposed to. I may have suffered from seeing it way later than most people and kinda hearing about it which probably lessened the effect. Still it was a directorial debut and for that I gotta say it's a success and I'll be interested in what he comes up with next.,6,0,2,26 May 2019
Ex Machina," Good movie
",This movie was very well done even if it's not what I was expecting. A genius boss invites a coder to a somewhat hidden facility to test if his android has thinking of her own or is just giving responses that it's supposed to give. It's very thought provoking and it keeps you interested throughout not just on the guy and the android but also the guy and the boss. There's more than meets the eye there which causes additional intrigue. It was a tad slow and I probably wouldn't re-watch it so I docked it a point or two but it's good really and absolutely worth one watch.,7,0,0,5 September 2018
Back to the Future Part III," Meh
",I feel like these movies are all the same and this is the worst one. Happy ending and at times the western aspect was fun but overall I've seen this same movie 3 times.,6,1,3,19 March 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Human side of war
",The film is about WW2 and the effect it has on a Japanese family. A young boy and his little sister are separated from their mother during a bombing raid and lose their home in the process. Their father is off in the navy so he can't help them. Throughout the film they lose everything and it's up to the young boy to take care of his sister when their mother died and their aunt didn't want them to stay any longer. This isn't your typical happy ending type of movie. It shows the horrors of war and I think the anime makes it easier to take. I'm not big into anime but this one made me feel for the characters even if I think the movie may have had a bigger effect in live action.,7,2,3,14 November 2018
Clash of the Titans," So-so
",The movie did have some good looking battles but really not much to write home over and probably not enough for me to watch the sequel. If they would have focused a little more on storytelling and acting I think it could have been better. I think in general it's hard to take Greek Mythology and make it a good movie. It's much easier to take a good fantasy book and make it a movie instead so hopefully they kind of give up on these types.,6,0,3,26 September 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Much worse than The Avengers
",I found this film to be much worse than the original grouping of the Avengers although I did think it had some redeeming qualities near the end. The last battle was good and a few characters were introduced and one died trying to help out. That's basically it though. It was a paint by numbers superhero movie that more or less fell flat to me. It did make me look forward to Infinity Wars at the end though.,5,1,5,25 April 2019
The King," Underwhelming
","This is a decent film but after hearing the praise I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. The acting was decent but just the overall tone I struggled with. It's a sad film of a new king trying to do right but probably just doing the same thing that's been being done before. There's a lot of death and strife. That said I just wasn't drawn to any of the characters. I didn't really care for anybody on the English or French side. The action was pretty good and chaotic and I think they did a real good job with that part but when you have no emotional investment really it doesn't land. I did like the end where the King figured out the one who had been misleading him, although I assumed that from the get go. Worth watching but it certainly didn't blow my mind.",6,1,2,15 January 2020
Eyes Wide Shut," Not a classic but good
",This isn't really my type of movie as there wasn't really any action but it was more focused on a married couple and their relationship but it is well done. I like how the wife having fantasies completely crushes Tom Cruise and causes him to have his weird night out. The film was pretty slow at times but it kind of had to be. Can't lie the nudity didn't hurt in helping me get through it. It wasn't a very sexual movie at all though. It was more with dealing with a long relationship where things get stale I suppose. I liked the end where although he was out trying to get some action all night he clearly saw the faults in what he did and she took him back. She wouldn't say forever though and I liked that touch some reason. The piano was nice for me as well. I'd say 7/10 but one I'd probably never watch again. Too long and I didn't love it.,7,0,1,27 August 2018
Inception," Unique
",This really is a unique movie experience. There was clearly alot of thought put into it and it seemed to all add up to me. Well done.,9,0,1,19 April 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Average
",This movie does a few things really well. The solving of the crimes is clever. Some of the visuals are beautiful and some of the camera work is really interesting. That said the main character who's the detective is dull. He's supposed to be dull I guess and his attention to detail is why he solves crimes but he lacks charisma. I still feel like you need charisma to lead a movie and I just didn't feel it in this. I did like the end but have no need to watch the sequel they're making.,6,0,2,18 December 2018
Defiance," Great
","This is an excellent movie. You never hear about this one in relation to great WW2 movies but this is one for sure. It's a true story of Jewish people who fought back and refused to just be slaughtered. The acting was on point, the fighting, everything. Really well done.",8,0,0,29 March 2020
Platoon," Classic
",Probably the best Vietnam war movie I've ever seen. Most are too depressing to really enjoy and this one is depressing too but it works for me. It shows all the terrible side of this war even men turning on each other and probably the best character killed by someone in his own crew. It's raw and not uplifting but it's really well acted and I like it more than the others I've seen. Apocalypse Now is one of the other classics for this war and I really didn't like it at all. Willem Dafoe was great.,8,2,3,28 September 2017
Black Panther," Not Oscar worthy
",This is a pretty decent movie but it's not great. Some of the editing feels off. Some of the acting is pretty good though as I like the main guy and I like the villain. It basically went exactly as you'd expect though so it didn't do anything new and it didn't do anything unexpected. Basically all these origin stories are almost exactly the same. I did like that it was like a different society but some of that made no sense. They're a super advanced technology but use spears. Really? I mean I know they're different spears that can take down aircraft and such but when they're fighting each other they're just spears. It's ridiculous. Decent end though I suppose. I liked it more than this review indicates probably.,7,0,2,15 July 2019
Iron Man," Better than I remembered
",For whatever reason I remembered really disliking Iron Man but just re watched it because I'm trying to get caught up on the MCU. This was not a great movie to me and it's kinda surprising this basically launched the biggest franchise in the world. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad movie but nothing ground breaking to me. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) creates the best weapons in the world and doesn't care who it hurts. That is until he's kidnapped and made to create weapons for 'the bad guys' in Afghanistan. Then he basically reforms his ways and decides not to make weapons for evil anymore. He's betrayed by someone in his company twice and has to defeat him even though the guy used his own technology and made his own suit. He had help from his assistant Pepper and was able to get it done. Just kinda generic to me and I think a lot of why people liked it is Robert Downey Juniors charm but I think he's been better in other stuff.,7,0,0,13 June 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Average
","Movie was decent but it wasn't as good as the first Thor. There were aspects I liked but overall it was a very meh movie. I liked that Thor had to use Loki to help him and I like that Loki still betrayed him at the end even when it seemed like he didn't. I also liked the funky fight near with end with all messed up physics. Aside from that nothing stood out. It didn't feel epic even though the villains were trying to destroy their universe. Also those dark elves looked corny, it was kind of off putting honestly.",6,1,2,2 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Super average
","I tried this out to see if I'm still into Star Wars and it's possible I'm just not or not into sci-fi anymore. This didn't make me want to finish the trilogy that's for sure. That said I did really like Rogue One, they did a really good job with that one. This just seemed unoriginal and trying to play of the nostalgia factor having Han/Leia/etc come back. The end did surprise me though and for that reason alone I'll probably try 8. Oh and Rey was pretty hot so there's that.",6,1,3,30 January 2019
300," Better than remembered
",The story is great and the acting is better than I remember. It's a great story. The only thing that takes it down in my opinion is putting a kind of fantasy spin on it. I also don't love the slow downs and such in the battles and think they could have been done better. That said it was a really fun ride and a 2 hour movie that certainly didn't bore me.,8,2,3,25 October 2019
Annihilation," Decent
",I loved the premise I just felt like it fell flat a bit. A soldier who's the husband of Natalie Portman who's a former soldier and current biologist comes back from a zone of the earth that screwed him up. It's all hush-hush but it's messing up the world and causing most people who go into the zone to die. She joins an expedition and tries to figure out what's going on. It's a little slow for me but it's interesting to see the animals that got changed aka they got refracted by the lighthouse. They should have introduced concepts faster though but the idea of the movie is great.,6,0,3,12 January 2019
Incredibles 2," Good kid movie
",I thought it was a good sequel for sure. It's the same thing as an adult superhero movie where they gotta combine powers and beat evil. They stopped the evil villain and the whole way had some good points related to real life that kids would probably miss. It also had a lot of comedy thrown in. I really liked Jack Jack and think that he made the movie. Very similar to the first one and that's a good thing.,7,2,2,28 February 2019
Braveheart," Never loses anything
",I've seen this three hour movie maybe 20 times and it still doesn't lose a thing. It's really a classic revenge tale but it turns into so much more. Everything is amazing. Battle scenes still hold up today but for the time they were amazing. The acting is amazing by everyone involved. Mel Gibson's character (William Wallace) has a scene where he's betrayed and his expressions are for sure the example of the best non verbal acting I've ever seen. The guy who plays Robert The Bruce nails it in response as well. Powerful all the way around. The music adds something too from the get go. Even the child actors were pretty good. Basically this is as close to a perfect movie ever for me with the only real contender being Training Day.,10,3,7,6 November 2018
Back to the Future," Good fun
",I watched this movie this year for the first time so it held no nostalgia for me. All I can really say is it's good cheesy 80s fun.,7,0,0,3 March 2020
Cinderella Man," Amazing
","Everything about this movie is great. It's the story of a boxer down on his luck during the great depression. It's James J. Braddock (Russel Crowe), trying to put food on the table for his family. At first he's an up and coming prospect but hand injuries derail him into taking fights with no use of his good hand. Eventually the commission strips him and doesn't allow him to box anymore so he has to work on the docks using his bad hand more. When an opportunity came up to fight a #1 contender on 24 hours notice as nobody else would Braddock came back to boxing. He won and went on an incredible streak. The Cindarella Man. A lot of the movie is him trying to get by and him putting his pride aside and doing anything to keep his kids and wife together. The performances by pretty much everyone completely nailed it. The best boxing movie I've ever seen.",9,1,1,4 October 2018
