The Incredible Hulk," A nice movie
","Definitely not as good and intelligent as Iron Man. Still, I have put 10 * because I think that Marvel did a great job, creating high-rated movies about their most remarkable heroes. And... Stark's cameo and Lou's appearance were AWESOME! Thank you very much, guys!!!!! Tim Roth was perfect (as usually). I have recently seen him on Euronews channel, speaking about the movie, and I really think that he is one of the most gifted actors. Special thanks to Mr Norton!!!I have never read any of Marvel comics and it was somewhat hard to follow the storyline because there were made several allusions that I did not understand during the movie. However, I watched The incredible Hulk because it was interesting, and the characters were so appealing that there was no chance to distract my attention.",10,2,4,19 June 2008
Hancock," Almost bad.
","The beginning was quite OK, then it seemed as if the crew did not have enough imagination to create a fully developed image of the characters, time and place of the action. However, since this hero is unknown to the audience (no comic books, no prequel etc.), it is very hard for such movies to get immediately on the top and to gain the admiration. Yeah... I felt so odd... I did not know who Hancock was, and I had an odd impression maybe because I got used to the way how other such type of movies were created (Iron Man, Superman...). I do think that the crew HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, but I feel it could have been better if instead of Charlize Theron there would be another actress. IMHO, she has a talent, but in this role she has been too... impersonal...",6,2,5,3 July 2008
