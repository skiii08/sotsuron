Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Strangely not as good as the three others.
","It is true that the screenplay is not very original and that the characters have strangely no emotions at all. But the direction stand very and I mean very spectacular. But after all, we really need to see this one to prepare ourselves for the next one.I give it *** out of *****  !",8,0,0,27 March 2000
X-Men," Very very good !!!
",This is maybe the best cartoon-based movie ever. It is the best since Batman. The special effects are really good. The actors are amazing witch is very very rare for these kind of movies. We care for the characters and that's why it's so good but the amazing screenplay help a lot. It's like Batman with an heart !I give it ****1/2 out of *****,8,0,0,30 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great ending the the best trilogy of all time !!!
","It's maybe the worst of the trilogy but Return of the Jedi capture our imagination and our dreams. What I hate in this movie is the annoying Ewoks. But lets just all forget it, it's Star Wars after all ! The final battles between Luke and Vador and the final attack on the new Death Star are absolutely amazing.I give it ***1\2 / *****",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Congratulation Mrs Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale !!
","This is the final part in the Back to the Future trilogy. Marty must go back in the old west in order to save the life of Doc. The first one is just slightly better than this one but it is a terrific conclusion to the trilogy! Again, imaginative screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale and great special effects. This is one of the most entertaining trilogy of the history of cinema ! Wait to see the end of the film!!! Wow!! What an ending!!!There is really amazing movie magic happening here!I give it ****1/2 out of *****",Null,0,0,22 July 2000
Scream 2," Not as good as the first was but remember that this is a sequel !
","Great sequel to the movie Scream ! It's good to see the character from the first film comeback together. Like mostly every sequels, it's not as good as the first was. Writer Kevin Williamson's script is great. Theres more blood and gore and good scary moments. But in the end....it sucks ! I give it ***1/2 out of *****",7,0,0,4 February 2000
Scream," Will maybe become a classic !!!
",Scream is one of the best horror movie I've ever seen. I like the way that Wes Craven parody horror movies but without being a comedy. It got great scares and the actor are so good (especially David Arquette who is my favorite character). I've maybe seen this movie 20 times but I'm not even tired of it. A great start for this horror trilogy ! I give it ***** out of *****,Null,0,0,4 February 2000
Back to the Future Part II," Wow !!! What a movie !!!
","This is the long awaited sequel to Back to the Future. Now, Marty must go in 2015 in order to save is own life and the future of his future childrens. Like most of the sequels in a trilogy (except the amazing Empire Strikes Back) this one is not as good as the original but it delivers! It got amazing special effects and again highly imaginative script from Bob Gale and Robert Zemekis. This movie doesn't stop to captivate us and you'll want to see this one over and over !!!I give it ***1/2 out of *****",Null,0,1,22 July 2000
Final Destination," One of the most original movies in years and a little hope for 'teen slasher films'.
","Scream is the film that resurrected this genre. With the incredible Scream 3 I thought that slasher movies will die. But with Final Destination there is a little hope for these kind of films. This film is directed by one of the writer and producers of The X-Files; James Wong. This movie is full of originality and twists and turns. The screenplay is very very good. It got very good scares and no fake ones. A slasher movie without a slasher.I give it *****+*/*****, go see it you won't be disappointed!",10,1,2,18 March 2000
The Matrix," The very BEST movie I've seen in years !
","When I first saw the trailer of this film, the movie looked very good. I've seen it and what a movie. It has the most intelligent and good screenplay I've seen. Nothing in the dialogues were useless. The special effects were very amazing. For this time, Keanu Reeves did a very good job. The story of The Matrix is very complicated but that why it's so good. Before, my best movie was Dark City but The Matrix is now by far my best film. I gives it a big ***** out of ***** .",10,0,0,8 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic movie that will stay in our mind forever !
","Star Wars is maybe one of the best movie ever made. It as a great story, good actors and good special effects (for the time). George Lucas delivers us a thrill ride that will affect every generation. If I had a top ten for the best movie of all time, Star Wars should be around 6 or 7. If you didn't saw this movie, run to your video store and rent it (especially the Special Edition ) !!I give it *****/*****",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," MY ALL TIME FAVORITE !!!
","The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie I have seen of all my life ! It has an amazing story, great actors and jaw dropping special effect. Irvin Kirshner did an outstanding direction !! The scenery is an eye candy. This movie has one of the most reminded ending ever : 'Luke, I am your father'. It is full of fantasy and imagination. Who said that sequels sucks ???I give it ***** + * /*****",10,0,0,4 November 1999
Back to the Future," One of the most entertaining movie ever !!!
",This one is a classic ! It's the incredible story of a teenager who must go back in time to save is parents marriage. Highly imaginative screenplay by Bob Gale and Robert Zemmekis. Good special effects and the good classic character played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Loyd as the crazy scientist. You never get tired to watch this movie again and again. A terrific start to one of the best trilogy of all time !I give it ***** out of *****,Null,0,1,22 July 2000
