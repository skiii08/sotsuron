Men in Black 3," I Want To See It Again! They Got It Right!!
","This is by far the best Men in Black movie of the series. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. There was nothing a miss or off. I didn't expect anything that happened and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The action was just enough action, the story was brilliantly told. The writer (s) got it right. There is nothing to fix in this movie and it's worth seeing again and again.There was, as always, a disgusting factor, or creep factor with the aliens and it kept me excited and grossed out. I LOVE IT!! Josh Brolin, had Tommy Lee Jones down perfectly. It was exciting to watch him. The movie and the acting was very well down. A movie perfected!!",10,4,8,20 June 2012
